This study investigated how service diversification is included in hotels in Mures County (Romania) and analyzed factors typical of diversification through management decisions in the hotels comprised in the study. Therefore, this research focused on the following dimensions: determination of issues concerning hotel groups in Mures County related to service diversification; typological analysis of hotels in Mures County according to service diversification; analysis of correlations between factors that define service diversification in hotels and performance. The research features examination through total observation using a questionnaire and tests four hypothesis from international literature review. The results indicate that service diversification varies with the classification category of the hotels analyzed in the study. Factors related to diversification were grouped into three categories, which consisted of relaxation and leisure services, services related to business travel and subsidiary (auxiliary) services to accommodation services that complement existing business travel amenities. Also, the results show a positive correlation with performance indicators (respectively income and expenditure) with components of service diversification. The main findings offer valuable insights to both theoreticians and practitioners within the domestic and foreign hotel industry being the first study of this kind in Romania.","[Oltean, Flavia Dana] Petru Major Univ Tirgu Mures, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Management Econ Dept, Nicolae Iorga St 1, Targu Mures 540080, Mures County, Romania; [Gabor, Manuela Rozalia] Petru Major Univ Tirgu Mures, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Cybernet & Econ Stat Management Econ Dept, Nicolae Iorga St 1, Targu Mures 540080, Mures County, Romania",,"Oltean, FD (通讯作者)，Petru Major Univ Tirgu Mures, Fac Econ Law & Adm Sci, Management Econ Dept, Nicolae Iorga St 1, Targu Mures 540080, Mures County, Romania.",flaviaoltean@yahoo.com; rozalia_gabor@yahoo.com,"Gabor, Manuela Rozalia/AAK-9004-2020","Gabor, Manuela Rozalia/0000-0003-1025-869X",,,,,37,5,5,2,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

For the measuring there were used point method and five integrated indicators - living standards, health condition, social facilities, social pathology and unemployment. The measuring was done in four regions in the Czech Republic - the Hradec Kralove and the Plzen Region (representatives of prosperous regions), and the Usti and the Moravian-Silesian Region (representatives of structurally affected regions).

Furthermore, we evaluate the model's ability to capture the development of the observed variables in the examined period from 1999Q1 to 2015Q2. We compute conditional forecasts and stochastic simulations, which are then used for moment and correlation comparisons and calculation of the Beveridge curve.

The Committee of the Regions (CoR) is an EU advisory body composed of locally and regionally elected representatives coming from 28 Member States. Although its powers are relatively limited, the Committee of the Regions can provide input in the EU legislative process and has had an important role in the safeguarding of subsidiarity from the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. The European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the EU must consult the CoR when drawing up legislation on matters concerning local and regional government. If they fail to do so, the CoR can bring a case before the CJEU (an action for annulment). Once the CoR receives a legislative proposal, it adopts an opinion and then forwards it to relevant EU institutions. Bearing in mind the fact that from the entering into force of the Lisbon Treaty the CoR as an advisory body has had a legal mechanism (an action for annulment) to control the EU decision-makers, this paper will analyze the existing practice of the CoR in this field. This paper will assessif the EU institutions are respecting the obligation to consult the CoR when drawing up legislation on matters concerning regions. Is the CoR using its right for the action for annulment? What is the impact of the CoR opinions both on the matters of legislative proposal and on its own initiative? Based on the results of the analysis, this paper will suggest further legal solutions from which regions can benefit and subsidiarity can be safeguarded. Respectively, conclusions will contribute to further regional development, decentralization and subsidiarity in the EU regional framework.","[Petrasevic, Tunjica; Duic, Dunja] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair European Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Petrasevic, T (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law Osijek, Chair European Law, Stjepana Radica 13, Osijek, Croatia.",tpetrase@pravos.hr; dduic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,961,971,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600096,0

Key concepts mentioned in the theory of the business cycle are quantified and then put into context with the development of the economy or selected region. Schumpeter mentioned five elements of innovation, which are quantified, performed primarily on the basis of submitted and accepted applications for new patents and utility design.

We examine in how much detail one needs to model the factor and commodity flows between states, and how much, if anything, is lost in the aggregation of neighboring states into larger regions. We develop nine dynamic multi-region general equilibrium models of the United States, with different aggregations of states (a two-region model, a 7-region model, and a full 51-region model) and different assumptions regarding intermediate inputs. We examine the same policy change with these nine models and find that all nine models suggest very similar economic effects of the policy change in the first year. Our overall conclusion is that small and highly aggregate models are not necessarily any less accurate than larger models. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling. Published by Elsevier Inc.

By shifting the concentration of tax authorities to its regions, the countries with a large number of constituent entities can form the competitiveness concept of their taxation systems, thereby creating a race for taxpayers as a source of tax revenues. Within the current realities, the world practice allows to distinguish four basic models of taxation systems: the Anglo-Saxon system, the Euro-continental system, the Latin-American system, and the mixed system. Having some knowledge about the principles of each model, the authors decided to form an identification matrix for a taxation system model, highlighting the general parameters for each model, dividing them into two categories: quantitative and qualitative. Specific values and characteristics were determined (obtained) by analyzing taxation systems of different countries. To prove the validity of the proposed matrix, it was decided to test it when identifying the taxation system model of the Russian Federation on the basis of statistical data on the amount of income taxes and fees in the consolidated budget of the Russian Federation. Taking into account the specific characteristics of the Russian Federation, it was decided to use the identification matrix for the taxation system of the Krasnoyarsk Region- one of the largest regions of the Russian Federation. Interpretation of the analyzed data in terms of meeting the criteria of the identification matrix presented in the article confirms that the taxation system of the Krasnoyarsk Region corresponds to the Euro-continental model. Understanding the concept of the taxation system model may be of great interest when establishing the financial policy of any country on the basis of its strategic and tactical goals and objectives. With regard to economic entities, such knowledge will be important when choosing the region for business activities from the perspective of its economic stability and security.","[Satsuk, Tatiana P.] Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Dept Transport Econ, Moskovsky Pr 9, St Petersburg 190031, Russia; [Koneva, Olga V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Business Management & Econ, Svobodny Pr 79, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University; Siberian Federal University,"Satsuk, TP (通讯作者)，Emperor Alexander I St Petersburg State Transport, Dept Transport Econ, Moskovsky Pr 9, St Petersburg 190031, Russia.",stp13@mail.ru; smorodina77@list.ru,"Satsuk, Tatyana Pavlovna/AAH-5123-2021","Satsuk, Tatyana Pavlovna/0000-0001-5010-202X",,,,,15,3,3,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1956,1963,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800243,0

Firstly, it seeks to date regional downturns as opposed to assuming that all regional economies are affected by economic shocks at the same point in time; secondly, it measures the amplitude and duration of economic downturns and subsequent recoveries; and thirdly, as well as measuring recovery, it measures the resistance of regional economies to economic shocks. The paper applies this methodology to selected European countries to provide an analysis of differential regional responses to several economic shocks since the early 1990s.

Special attention is given to the assumptions made about mortality rates for disabled people and disability incidence rates, which largely determine the contribution rate assigned to disability. The model could be of interest to policymakers because, after some adaptations, it could be implemented without too much difficulty and would uncover the real cost of disability and minimize the risk of disability insurance being used as a vote-buying mechanism.","[Ventura-Marco, Manuel; Vidal-Melia, Carlos] Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Vidal-Meliá, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Financial Econ & Actuarial Sci, Valencia, Spain.",carlos.vidal@uv.es,"VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/AAH-9010-2020; Ventura-Marco, Manuel/K-8505-2019","VIDAL-MELIA, CARLOS/0000-0002-7227-5076; Ventura-Marco, Manuel/0000-0002-4510-7499",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) [ECO2012-36685],Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad),We are grateful for the financial assistance received from the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad) project [ECO2012-36685].,,55,6,6,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The article draws attention to the correlation between innovation capacity and the industrial structure of economies. Its aim is to investigate whether selected groups of European countries show similar trends in industrial structure development reflected in its innovative capacity. For the analysis and evaluation of development in the period 2006-2013, we selected three groups of countries: Benelux, the Visegrad Group and the Baltic Assembly. The innovative capability evaluation, which is represented by the Global Innovation Index, is based partly on an ordinal analysis of its basic indices, but also on the evaluation of gamma-convergence. To assess the evolution of industrial structure, which is divided into five industry groups, the SHA-DE method based on gross added value is applied. The results show the signs of greater dynamics in strengthening innovation when grouping innovation-weaker countries; in terms of the development of disparities in innovative capability, the measured values suggest a divergence of innovatively developed Benelux countries, while in the less developed countries of the Visegrad Group and Baltic Assembly the ranges of disparities are rather stable and tend to weak convergence. In terms of industrial structure, the main differences can be seen among the surveyed groups both in the secondary sector, but particularly in the tertiary innovative sector. And it is the results obtained in relation to the share and development of the  innovative tertiary sector that confirms the assumption that the innovativeness of a country is largely derived not from the entire economy, but mainly from the specific status of a narrow group of industries that can be largely considered the determinants of innovation.","[Zdrazil, Pavel; Kraftova, Ivana; Mateja, Zdenek] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Zdrazil, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",Pavel.Zdrazil@upce.cz; Ivana.Kraftova@upce.cz; Zdenek.Mateja@upce.cz,"Kraftova, Ivana/G-8935-2017; Zdražil, Pavel/AAM-2505-2020","Kraftova, Ivana/0000-0003-0740-2670","University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration [SGSFES_2015001]","University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration","The University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration, Project SGSFES_2015001, financially supported this work.",,67,15,15,0,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To this purpose, we construct an original dataset by collecting information on the participation of national and international organizations in the European Commission consultations on trade issues and by merging it with newly released data on non-tariff measures aggregated at the tariff-line level between 1999 and 2007. Our results suggest that European lobbies exert a major influence on policy-makers. Drawing upon the panel structure of the dataset, we find that participation in consultation meetings increases the probability of a protectionist policy, even after controlling for product fixed effects and a number of control variables. Moreover, actual attendance turns out to be more effective than simple registration and organizations representing more than one industrial category are more likely to obtain protection than single-sector organizations. These findings are interpreted in light of a political economy model of lobbying with (possibly endogenous) costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our contribution is both methodological and empirical. First, we propose a way to rotate the innovations resulting from the Bayoumi-Eichengreen (1992) decomposition of the VAR residuals to ensure that their properties remain identical to the properties of the well-known Blanchard-Quah (1989) factorization. In addition, we derive the slope coefficients of the AS-AD curves from the impulse responses to demand shocks and thereby reveal structural heterogeneities across countries. Second, we study fifteen euro and non-euro countries using quarterly data over 1960-2012. Bootstrap simulations reveal that: 1) the Bayoumi-Eichengreen decomposition yields the same conclusions as the Blanchard-Quah one in terms of shock sizes and asymmetry; 2) the long-run neutrality of demand shocks on output is often not decisive in assessing shock asymmetry; and 3) the estimated structural and stochastic asymmetries are imprecise, which has been often disregarded in the literature. Thus, one should be cautious about the empirical relevance of macroeconomic idiosyncrasies with regard to the suitability of a currency area. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, while developed countries struggled to deal the financial crisis, several emerging countries resorted to them as part of the macro-prudential policy toolkit The apparent success of such non-conventional instruments in mitigating business cycle fluctuations raises the question whether they deserve full credit for that or some merit should be given to conventional instruments, like short-term interest rates. To answer this question, we use a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with risk-averse financial intermediaries, heterogeneous agents facing uninsurable idiosyncratic risk and a central bank that implements countercyclical policy using two instruments: short-term rates and reserve requirements. In this environment, in which agents' wealth matters for their consumption and savings decisions, we find that using reserve requirements as a countercyclical tool marginally helps to reduce the consumption volatility and that its effect becomes quantitatively relevant only if banks are sufficiently risk averse. Two factors drive our results: the presence of interest rate risk and the imperfect substitution between bank liabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this light, many European countries are currently considering reforms to increase efficiency in the provision of nursing home services. One popular restructuring policy is the transformation of public organizations into private nonprofit organizations. The underlying assumption is that private nonprofit nursing homes are more efficient than public nursing homes. However, there is limited empirical evidence to support this view. This analysis aims to contribute to the evidence base on this issue by investigating the impact of the organizational form on the costs of nursing homes. We use a sample of 45 nursing homes from one Swiss canton over a 5-year period (2001-2005). The applied estimation strategy provides more accurate estimates as compared to previous studies. In particular, we distinguish between cost differences that are under the control of the managers from those that are not (structural). Our findings suggest that public nursing homes are more costly than private nursing homes, although the difference is small. This cost difference is mainly driven by structural rather than managerial costs. Therefore, cost-reducing policies that promote private nonprofit nursing homes are expected to reduce costs only slightly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study finds that, first, investors from economies sharing the same legal origin with China tend to select ownership modes with a relatively high level of foreign control. That is, such foreign direct investment (FDI) firms are more likely to be wholly owned enterprises or joint ventures with relatively large foreign shares. Second, similarities in legal enforcement between China and the home economies correlate positively with high foreign control. Third, the effects of legal traditions on ownership modes are relatively weak for new entrants compared to their forerunners, probably owing to the continuous improvement in China's business and law institutions.","[Gu, Quanlin] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shaoan] Shandong Univ, Ctr Econ Res, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Shaoan] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Jinan 250100, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yupeng] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Peking University; Shandong University; Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Shi, YP (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",shiyupeng@pku.edu.cn,,,Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation [14ZDB120]; Major Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education [14JZD019]; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,Major Project of the National Social Science Foundation; Major Project of the Chinese Ministry of Education; Program for Innovation Research in Central University of Finance and Economics,"Gu: Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, 5 Yiheyuan Road Haidian District, Beijing 100871, China.

That putting teams into competition with each other can mitigate this problem is an important recent insight. However, we know little about how inequality in endowment between teams might influence this beneficial effect from competition. We address this question with an experiment where teams contribute to a public good that then determines their chances of winning a Tullock contest with another team. The boost to efforts from competition disappears when inequality is high. This is mainly because the 'rich' disengage': they make no more contribution to a public good than they would when there is no competition. There is evidence that the 'poor' respond to moderate inequality 'doggedly', by expending more effort compared to competition with equality, but this 'doggedness' disappears too when inequality is high.

After the incumbent has acquired a patent, it can be infringed by the challenger, and the conflict between them can be resolved via litigation or settlement with endogenously determined triggers and royalties. The model explains why litigation is so unusual in the real world and why most of the lawsuits over patent rights cease before the court's judgment is made. It also clarifies why roughly a half of litigated patents are found to be invalid in court and in what circumstances the introduction of new technology or the infringement of patent is delayed. From the perspective of implications on patent system, the model shows that neither tightening the patent examination nor widening the patent scope guarantees the acceleration of R&D investment, and rather delays it in some cases.

The article focuses on private entrepreneurs (privatnici). In specific, it questions how are the aesthetics of the informal house negotiated and the role of urban planning is delineated through the relationship of the state, instrumentalised by already established socialist elites and privatnici, the newcomers.

Underemployment is associated with job insecurity, increased casualisation and lower savings, and from a macroeconomic standpoint, underemployment is a signal of inefficiency in the utilisation of skilled labour. This article explores the patterns of underemployment for mature-age workers in Australia, a group for whom the prevalence of long spells of underemployment is especially marked. The research uses a 12-year panel dataset to analyse factors that contribute to a heightened risk of underemployment. Significant path dependency is revealed, whereby previous periods of underemployment increase the propensity towards further underemployment in the current period. Interestingly, most demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, except for the presence of older dependent children and a non-English-speaking foreign-born background for women, tend not to have any direct impact on the propensity for underemployment. These findings suggest the need for targeted interventions to triage these barriers aimed at highlighting the role of improved labour market attachment in promoting the well-being and economic contribution of mature-age workers.","[Li, Jinjing; Miranti, Riyana] Univ Canberra, NATSEM, Inst Governance & Policy Anal, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Duncan, Alan] Curtin Univ, Bankwest Curtin Econ Ctr, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",University of Canberra; Curtin University,"Li, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Canberra, NATSEM, Inst Governance & Policy Anal, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",jinjing.li@canberra.edu.au,"Duncan, Alan S/U-5851-2018","Duncan, Alan S/0000-0001-5145-6516; Miranti, Riyana/0000-0002-0900-3924; Li, Jinjing/0000-0001-5640-2058",Australian Department of Social Services (DSS); ARC [LP120100624]; Australian Research Council [LP120100624] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Department of Social Services (DSS)(Australian Government); ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This article uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

Estimates suggest a 10% increase in price decreases daily smoking by 0.91 percentage points (2.11%), occasional smoking by 1.24 percentage points (8.27%) and average smoking intensity by 0.15 cigarettes per day (2.9%).

In section 2, I critically examine Williamson's work and his analysis of the enabling conditions of policy changes based on the Washington Consensus. I also consider Klein's work, and use, as a case study, the economic reforms in Chile in the 1970s. Whilst Williamson and Klein provide insights into the introduction of policy change, they do not offer plausible accounts of its persistence after a crisis has passed. Drawing on insights from behavioral economics, an explanation of persistence is offered (section 3). In section 4, the notion of politics contained in the work of proponents of market-oriented policy reform is scrutinized.

In the case of my book Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2014), a common simplification of the main theme is that because the rate of return on capital r exceeds the growth rate of the economy g, the inequality of wealth is destined to increase indefinitely over time. In my view, the magnitude of the gap between r and g is indeed one of the important forces that can explain historical magnitudes and variations in wealth inequality. However, I do not view r > g as the only or even the primary tool for considering changes in income and wealth in the 20th century, or for forecasting the path of income and wealth inequality in the 21st century. In this essay, I will take up several themes from my book that have perhaps become attenuated or garbled in the ongoing discussions of the book, and will seek to re-explain and re-frame these themes. First, I stress the key role played in my book by the interaction between beliefs systems, institutions, and the dynamics of inequality. Second, I briefly describe my multidimensional approach to the history of capital and inequality. Third, I review the relationship and differing causes between wealth inequality and income inequality. Fourth, I turn to the specific role of r > g in the dynamics of wealth inequality: specifically, a larger r - g gap will amplify the steady-state inequality of a wealth distribution that arises out of a given mixture of shocks. Fifth, I consider some of the scenarios that affect how r - g might evolve in the 21st century, including rising international tax competition, a growth slowdown, and differential access by the wealthy to higher returns on capital. Finally, I seek to clarify what is distinctive in my historical and political economy approach to institutions and inequality dynamics, and the complementarity with other approaches.","Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Piketty, T (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",piketty@psemail.eu,"MOTREB, ayoub EL/AAB-1710-2019",,,,,,17,95,104,1,105,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Popularity of this uniquely American activity, measured by attendance, television ratings, or team revenues, has never been higher. At the same time, however, several high-profile scandals exposing unseemly behavior on the part of players, coaches, and even respected higher education institutions-as well as questions about the distribution of the enormous revenues pouring into university athletic departments-have marred the image of these college football and men's basketball programs. Currently there are several legal challenges to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and its member institutions that may change dramatically and permanently the arrangements between the NCAA cartel, its member colleges and universities, and the student-athletes who play on the teams. These challenges all focus on the NCAA's collective fixing of players' wages. We describe this peculiar industry, detailing the numerous market imperfections in both output and labor markets, the demand for and supply of college athlete labor, and possible alternative arrangements in the college athlete labor market, including the ramifications of compensating players beyond the tuition, room, board, books, and fees that some current players already receive as grants-in-aid.","[Sanderson, Allen R.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Siegfried, John J.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Econ, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Siegfried, John J.] Amer Econ Assoc, Nashville, TN USA; [Siegfried, John J.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA",University of Chicago; University of Adelaide; Vanderbilt University,"Sanderson, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",arsx@uchicago.edu; john.siegfried@vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,29,17,51,1,103,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

In particular, the hypothesis is tested that output-based regulatory frameworks, which implicitly take into account quality-of-supply-criteria, improve the level of reliability vis A vis purely incentive-based schemes. To do so, novel empirical evidence is analyzed based on a cross-country panel data set covering 27 countries for the period from 1999 to 2013. Regional heterogeneity and potential endogeneity are controlled for. We find that the introduction of output-based regulation, ceteris paribus, leads to reductions of the annual outage duration by 16.05 % on average when compared to incentive-based systems. Given the substantial economic costs of power outages, marginal reliability improvements have considerable economic effects, which can now be quantfied. In the, admittedly hypothetical, case that EU member states, who have not yet done so, were to implement quality-controlling regulation, macroeconomic benefits amount to 930 m. a,not sign p.a.

The gender gaps in promotions from associate professor to full professor are more complex. Childless women are promoted faster than childless men. However, since the effects of marriage and children are negative for women, this 'reverse gender gap' disappears for childless married academics, and women's time to promotion becomes substantially longer than men's if they have children.

We conclude that there do not appear to be serious harmful health effects of moderate cannabis use.

Stylized facts are that larger, more R&D intensive and high tech firms are more likely to use knowledge external sources and that use of knowledge external sources is associated to firms higher technical results. Less attention has been paid to the third question and evidence is not conclusive. Several recommendations for future research emerge. First, to take in greater consideration methodological issues so that potential biases in the results caused by sample selection and endogeneity are handled properly.

Ambiguity is modeled by a second-order probability distribution that captures the firm's uncertainty about which of the subjective beliefs govern the price risk. Ambiguity preferences are modeled by the (second-order) expectation of a concave transformation of the (first-order) expected utility of profit conditional on each plausible subjective distribution of the price risk. Within this framework, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which the ambiguity-averse firm optimally produces less in response either to the introduction of ambiguity or to greater ambiguity aversion when ambiguity prevails. In the case that the price risk is binary, we show that ambiguity and greater ambiguity aversion always adversely affect the firm's production decision.","[Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Hong Kong,"Wong, KP (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Sch Econ & Finance, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",kpwong@econ.hku.hk,,,,,,,35,6,6,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Instead, a different principle, in which the decisions of an agent are based directly on the decisions and strategies of other agents, is offered as a relevant core model. Preferences are not stable, but evolve. It is not a special case in such circumstances, but the general one. The author provides empirical evidence to suggest that as a description of behaviour in the modern world, economic rationality is applicable in a declining number of situations. He discusses models drawn from the modern literature on cultural evolution in which imitation of others is the basic strategy, and suggests a heuristic way of classifying situations in which the different models are relevant. The key point is that in situations where radical uncertainty is present, we require theoretical 'null' models of agent behaviour which are different from those of economic rationality. Under uncertainty, fundamentally different behavioural rules are 'rational'. The author gives an example of a very simple pure sentiment model of the business cycle, in which agents use very simple heuristic decision rules. It is nevertheless capable of approximating a number of deep features of output growth over the cycle.","[Ormerod, Paul] UCL, Ctr Decis Making Uncertainty, London, England; [Ormerod, Paul] Volterra Consulting, London, England",University of London; University College London,"Ormerod, P (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Decis Making Uncertainty, London, England.",pormerod@volterra.co.uk,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,11,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 20,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201541.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-41,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY6ZO,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366557500001,0

Divided into three time frames - 2000 to 2006, 2007 to 2012 and 2000 to 2012, data on 189 countries was used to compare the impact of different intensities of the Internet access on trade in education. This research uses the following methods to analyse data: pooled ordinary least squares regression, fixed-effects model and random effects model. Results suggest that the Internet facilitates trade in education, the impact of which is between 16.4% and 21% for every 0.01% increase in Internet access. Larger countries and countries that share a common language show a highly significant impact of the Internet on trade in education for all three time frames at 0.01%. However, economic health of a country does not necessarily imply greater trade. This study finds mixed results for fixed (wired) broadband over the three time frames. The results explain between 63.2% and 74.9% of the impact of the Internet on trade in education.

As a result, extraneous risk affects aggregate equilibrium quantities. We derive equilibrium quantities and investigate how an extraneous risk priced via investors' different beliefs can affect the equilibrium at the aggregate level.

As in Grossman and Helpman (Innovation and growth in the global economy. MIT Press, Cambridge, 1992) a wide-gap and a narrow gap steady state equilibrium is characterized. It is shown that there can be multiplicity of equilibrium in the wide gap case. Interestingly, free labour mobility causes the growth rate to be identical for both the wide gap and the narrow gap case. A strengthening of intellectual property rights reduces the global growth rate of the economy both in the wide gap and narrow gap equilibrium. In case of the unique narrow gap equilibrium, stronger property rights reduces the rate of imitation unambiguously, but the effect of stronger property rights remains ambiguous in case of wide gap equilibrium. Also subsidy by North to innovation, in a Narrow gap equilibrium, has no effect on the rate of imitation or on the global growth rate.","Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, Kolkata 700108, W Bengal, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata,"Biswas, R (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ Res Unit, 203 BT Rd, Kolkata 700108, W Bengal, India.",advaita.mannanam@gmail.com,,,,,,,19,4,7,0,25,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

However, the introduction of nonlinearity, by using a polynomial in the error correction term, does not lead to any further improvement in forecasting accuracy and may even lead to deterioration. The results provide evidence against the proposition that the Meese-Rogoff puzzle can be explained in terms of failure to account for nonlinearity. It is also shown that the introduction of dynamics boosts the forecasting accuracy (in terms of the magnitude of the forecasting error) of the model relative to the static specification because dynamic specifications involve a random walk component.

We find that the typical price distribution is symmetric and leptokurtic, with a standard deviation between 19% and 36%. Only 10% of the variance of prices is due to variation in the expensiveness of the stores at which a good is sold, whereas the remaining 90% is due, in approximately equal parts, to differences in the average price of a good across equally expensive stores and to differences in the price of a good across transactions at the same store. We show that the distribution of prices that households pay for the same bundle of goods is approximately Normal, with a standard deviation between 9% and 14%. Half of this dispersion is due to differences in the expensiveness of the stores where households shop, whereas the other half is mostly due to differences in households' choices of which goods to purchase at which stores. We find that households with fewer employed members pay lower prices and do so by visiting a larger number of stores instead of by shopping more frequently.","Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania,"Kaplan, G (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Fisher Hall, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",gkaplan@princeton.edu,,,Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies,Griswold Center for Economic Policy Studies,"This work uses data supplied by the Kilts-Nielsen Data Center at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

Starting from the well-known financial model of (Brock and Hommes, 1998), we show how an appropriate calibration enables the model to describe price time series. We formulate the calibration problem as a nonlinear constrained optimization that can be solved numerically via a gradient-based method. The calibration results show that the simplest version of the Brock and Hommes model, with two trader types, fundamentalists and trend-followers, replicates nicely the price series of four different markets indices: the S&P 500, the Euro Stoxx 50, the Nikkei 225 and the CSI 300. We show how the parameter values of the calibrated model are important in interpreting the trader behavior in the different markets investigated. These parameters are then used for price forecasting. To further improve the forecasting, we modify our calibration approach by increasing the trader information set. Finally, we show how this new approach improves the model's ability to predict market prices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use a stochastic frontier production function to derive a time-varying, industry-specific measure of technical efficiency. Employing a multi-level mixed effects model and accounting for the variance structure of the data (i.e., destination markets, industries, and time), we examine the average effect of an increase in industry-specific technical efficiency on the number of firms involved in exporting and the corresponding industry-specific deviations. Our results show that higher levels of industry-specific technical efficiency correspond with larger numbers of firms involved in exporting implying the importance of giving due consideration to approaches that focus on improving technical efficiency. Additionally, a much larger increase is observed among small-sized firms than for medium- or large-sized firms. We discuss the implications of the observed deviations, particularly for policy makers interested in increasing the extensive margins of their nations' trade.","[Tadesse, Bedassa] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [White, Roger] Whittier Coll, Dept Econ, Whittier, CA 90608 USA; [Shukralla, Elias] Qatar Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Doha, Qatar",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth; Qatar University,"White, R (通讯作者)，Whittier Coll, Dept Econ, 13406 E Philadelphia St, Whittier, CA 90608 USA.",btadesse@d.umn.edu; rwhite1@whittier.edu; cshukralla@qu.cdu.qa,,"Tadesse, Bedassa/0000-0001-9108-9589; Shukralla, Elias/0000-0002-7929-953X",,,,,38,5,5,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Although such criticism implies that the gender imbalance should improve significantly once the one-child policy is removed, experiences of other countries with similar gender imbalance and no mandated fertility limit suggest that this conclusion should not be accepted without closer examination. Consequently, this paper examines the effects of allowing parents to have two children on the gender ratio. Specifically, we build a model of parental decision-making, in which parents choose between letting nature decide the gender of their child and manipulating the birth process to increase the likelihood of obtaining a son, and identify the optimal behaviors in this framework, We investigate the equilibrium level of gender imbalance under both the one-child and the two-child policy settings and show through a series of examples that the gender imbalance need not improve under the two-child policy.

There is no one, generally accepted procedure for how to do this. Several estimators are commonly used, though little is known about their relative performance. A complication arises when the sample of published studies is subject to sample selection due to publication bias. This study uses Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the performance of five different MA estimators in the presence of publication bias. The author considers two kinds of publication bias: publication bias directed against statistically insignificant estimates, and publication bias directed against wrong-signed estimates. The experiments simulate two data environments. In the Random Effects environment, each study produces only one estimate and the true effect differs across studies. In the Panel Random Effects environment, each study produces multiple estimates, and the true effect differs both within and across studies. The simulations produce a number of findings that challenge results from previous research.","Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 1, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Reed, WR (通讯作者)，Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch 1, New Zealand.",bob.reed@canterbury.ac.nz,"Reed, W.

To answer this question we set up a two-country model with search in labor-markets and featuring legal and illegal immigrants among the low skilled. We calibrate it to the US and Mexican economies during the 2000-2010 period. As immigrants - especially illegal ones - have a worse outside option than natives, their wages are lower. Hence, their presence reduces the labor cost of employers who, as a consequence, create more jobs per unemployed when there are more immigrants. Because of such effects our model shows increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Prior research has emphasized a negative relation between productivity and equity risk that results from operating leverage when capital adjustment is costly. In general, however, expansion and contraction options affect risk in the opposite direction: they lower equity risk as profitability declines. The general prediction is a non-monotonic overlay of opposing real option and operating leverage effects. For parameters chosen to match empirical firm characteristics, the predicted non-monotonicities are quantitatively important, and are detectable in the data. The calibrated model implies that real option effects dominate operating leverage effects, and the average firm is best described by an increasing risk profile, a conclusion supported by conditional beta estimates. The baseline calibration helps explain the profitability premium in the cross-section, but makes the value puzzle worse. Panels with heterogeneous firms can deliver simultaneous profitability and value effects that match empirical levels.","[Hackbarth, Dirk] Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Johnson, Timothy] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",Boston University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"Hackbarth, D (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Sch Management, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Hackbarth, Dirk/GNM-9256-2022","Hackbarth, Dirk/0000-0003-4259-5690",,,,,39,31,38,1,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We find that, consistent with the theory, impatient individuals procrastinate more, but only in tasks where there are costs to delay (the online game and university application). Since we pay participants by check, we are also able to determine whether the participants' cashing behavior is consistent with the timing of their payment choice. We find substantial evidence of time inconsistency.

Recent meta-analyses on this topic suggest that publication bias is not a problem for this field. Using a much larger sample of studies this article, however, finds substantial evidence of publication bias. Evidence suggests a preferential tendency to publish the article if studies reject the null hypothesis, that is, when the investigations produce positive and statistically significant findings. We collected 1450 spillover estimates conducted by 93 researchers from 69 primary empirical studies dealing with 31 developing countries for the period 1986-2013. We found that the FDI spillover effects are suffering from significant and meaningful publication bias.

By this approach, we provide a tool for making good decisions in certain problems in which the goals may be modelled by linear fractional functions under linear constraints; and when only vague data are available. In order to evaluate the membership function of the fractional objective, we use the -cut interval of a special class of fuzzy numbers, namely the fuzzy numbers obtained as sums of products of triangular fuzzy numbers with positive support. We derive the -cut interval of the ratio of such fuzzy numbers, compute the exact membership function of the ratio, and introduce a way to evaluate the error that arises when the result is approximated by a triangular fuzzy number. We analyse the effect of this approximation on solving a full fuzzy linear fractional programming problem. We illustrate our approach by solving a special example - a decision-making problem in production planning.","[Stanojevic, Bogdana] Serbian Acad Arts & Sci, Math Inst, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Dzitac, Ioan] Aurel Vlaicu Univ Arad, Dept Math & Comp Sci, Arad, Romania; [Dzitac, Ioan] Agora Univ Oradea, Sci, Oradea, Romania; [Dzitac, Simona] Univ Oradea, Dept Energy Engn, Oradea, Romania",Serbian Academy of Sciences & Arts; Aurel Vlaicu University of Arad; University of Oradea,"Stanojevic, B (通讯作者)，Serbian Acad Arts & Sci, Math Inst, Kneza Mihaila 36, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",bgdnpop@mi.sanu.ac.rs,"Dzitac, Ioan/A-6169-2010; Dzitac, Ioan/N-8695-2019; Dzitac, Ioan/T-2471-2019; Stanojevic, Bogdana/A-9195-2010; Dzitac, Simona/AAM-3377-2020; Dzitac, Ioan/A-8653-2010; Rossi, Jose Osvaldo/F-7391-2012","Dzitac, Ioan/0000-0002-5415-9936; Dzitac, Ioan/0000-0002-5415-9936; Stanojevic, Bogdana/0000-0003-4524-5354; Gull, Amir/0000-0001-6396-3208; Dzitac, Simona/0000-0001-5325-2584; da Luz, Lara Emanuele/0000-0001-5284-238X; Rossi, Jose Osvaldo/0000-0002-1421-163X","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia [TR36006]","Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia","This research was partially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science, Republic of Serbia, project number TR36006.

This explains why some developing countries are stuck with high levels of corruption and low levels of growth, while others are not. Moreover, in the face of either stricter anti-corruption enforcement or deregulation by promoting market competition, corruption may exhibit an intensive margin response in the sense that the number of bribe-paying firms decreases, but each individual firm bribes more for a production license.","[Chang, Juin-Jen] Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan; [Lu, Huei-chung; Tsai, Hsueh-fang] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, Taipei, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Chang, JJ (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",jjchang@econ.sinica.edu.tw,"Chang, Juin-Jen/ABD-9235-2022",,,,,,30,3,3,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-7355,1742-7363,,INT J ECON THEORY,Int.

The demand for foreign reserves stems from the interaction between productivity growth and underdevelopment of the domestic financial market. As domestic firms are credit-constrained, domestic saving instruments are necessary to increase their retained earnings in order to invest in capital. The central bank plays the role of a financial intermediary and provides liquid public bonds while investing the bond proceeds abroad in the form of foreign reserves. Foreign reserve accumulation is thus part of a catching-up strategy in an economy facing financial frictions. During economic transition, foreign reserve accumulation is proved to be welfare-improving as long as private capital flows are controlled. This joint strategy enables the central bank to channel sufficient external funding to the domestic economy while keeping domestic interest rates under control to cope with positive productivity shocks.","[Cheng, Gong] Sci Po, F-75007 Paris, France; [Cheng, Gong] European Stabil Mech, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po),"Cheng, G (通讯作者)，Sci Po, Dept Econ, 28 Rue St Peres, F-75007 Paris, France.",gong.cheng@sciencespo.fr,,,,,,,39,7,7,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Abstracting from risk aversion or hedging motives, we find that insurance may have a catalytic role on external finance. Such effect is particularly strong in those low- to middle-income countries that face financial constraints when hit by a shock or in its anticipation. Insurance makes defaults less likely, thereby relaxing the country's borrowing constraint, and enhancing its access to capital markets. The presence of multilateral lenders that explicitly or implicitly provide inexpensive reconstruction funds in the aftermath of a natural disaster weakens but does not eliminate the demand for catalytic insurance.","[Cordella, Tito] World Bank, London, England; [Yeyati, Eduardo Levy] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yeyati, Eduardo Levy] Univ Torcuato Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",The World Bank; Harvard University; Universidad Torcuato Di Tella,"Cordella, T (通讯作者)，World Bank, London, England.",tcordella@worldbank.org; ely@utdt.edu,"Cordella, Tito/AAN-1891-2020","Cordella, Tito/0000-0001-5520-165X",,,,,16,3,4,3,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We characterize the impact of competition on the optimal monetary rules within the linear-quadratic approach of Rotemberg-Woodford. The optimal monetary rule requires a less aggressive reaction to inflationary shocks compared to monopolistic competition, but an increase in competition, due to either an increase in substitutability between the goods or in the number of firms, makes it optimal to adopt a more aggressive reaction in front of inflationary shocks.

We measure the 'mechanical' contributions of these dynamics to per capita income as revealed by growth decompositions, before assessing the determinants of per capita income and productivity growth in a series of regressions that include the growth of the working-age to total population (WAP) ratio and a measure of sectoral employment change. Our results indicate that sectoral change has made a significant positive contribution to both per capita income growth and aggregate productivity growth, stemming from its positive impact on agricultural productivity growth as predicted by the Lewisian dual economy model. However, the negative impact of sectoral change on productivity growth in the industrial and service sectors, combined with the negative impact of growth of the WAP ratio on both per capita income and aggregate productivity growth, suggests that the benefits of China's population dynamics during the last three decades have been overstated.

The Boone indicator and the efficiency-adjusted Lerner index are used as proxies for competition, while the non-performing loans (NPL) ratio and Z-scores are used as proxies for bank stability. The main results indicate that competition is negatively related to the NPL ratio but positively related to the Z-score. The results further indicate that greater concentration has a positive impact on the NPL and a negative impact on the Z-score. We also use a quadratic term of the competition measures to capture a possible non-linear relationship between competition and stability. The results show that the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative for the NPL model and positive for the Z-score model. Overall, our findings provide support for the competition-fragility view.

In the pre-Volcker period, we estimate that money did play an important role and determinacy required a passive interest rate policy.

In the presence of fixed-mobile substitution, above-cost mobile termination charge creates a trade-off on the mobile network's profit: i.e., (i) reducing retail profit by strengthening competition for subscribers (price competition effect), and (ii) raising termination profit by increasing market shares (market share effect). Our analysis shows that the competitive effect of asymmetric regulation on mobile and fixed termination charges is decided by the interaction between these two effects, which in turn depends on the distribution of customer types. That is, above-cost termination charges are likely to be beneficial to consumers for a sufficiently large fixed-mobile type (i.e., customers choosing between mobile and fixed networks) compared to a mobile type (i.e., customers choosing between mobile networks), while they are likely to be harmful to consumers for a small fixed-mobile type. It would be an important implication for regulatory authorities that there exist various factors to consider in regulating termination charges, including the industry development and market structure.

Accordingly, the responses of bilateral US dollar exchange rates to interest rate shocks should differ substantially with respect to the (US or foreign) origin of the shock We demonstrate this empirically and apply a model of liquidity premia on US treasuries originating from monetary policy implementation. The liquidity premium leads to a modification of uncovered interest rate parity (UIP), which enables the model to explain an appreciation of the dollar subsequent to an increase in US interest rates if foreign interest rates follow the US monetary policy rate.

It first presents a straightforward framework for understanding how key macroeconomic variables determine this alternative competitiveness measure with reference to output and expenditure behaviour in a two sector open economy. It then econometrically examines its most significant determinants with reference to private and public sector consumption and investment in Australia. Results based on quarterly data from 1998 to 2013 suggest that government expenditure on non-tradable goods and services was the most significant factor to worsen Australia's competitiveness. This provides an alternative perspective on the efficacy of fiscal policy to those previously advanced in standard international macroeconomic models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, we find that the optimal nuclear tax is different depending on the time horizon: the optimal short-run tax has the same order of magnitude as the nuclear taxes imposed in Belgium and Germany, while in the long run the optimal tax may be negative, i.e. a subsidy. Second, government credibility is important: when a government cannot credibly commit, the mere possibility of a short-run tax could severely harm incentives for future investments in lifetime-extending refurbishment or new plants. Third, when there is natural scarcity in nuclear potential, other policies like inviting multiple competitive bidders for lifetime extension franchises or for investments in new plants, may be more efficient ways to increase government revenue.

Oddly enough, such a concept has been neglected by most of Marx's scholars and exegetes, as is demonstrated by the small number of scientific works dealing with it. Yet the rate of turnover is a key category in Marxian analysis, because it enables Marx to address the impact of the improvement in finance and other unproductive industries on the capitalist process of creation (and realisation) of surplus value. The evidence from the new philological edition of Marx and Engel's writings (MEGA(2)) further strengthens this insight. The main goal of the article is threefold: first, to bridge the gap in the literature dealing with volume Two of Capital; second, to provide a re-definition of several Marxian concepts in the light of the role played by the rate of turnover of capital; third, to analyse the effect of the developments in the banking and finance industry on the turnover rate and thereby on the general rate of profit.","[Passarella, Marco Veronese] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; Univ Insubria, Como, Italy; Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",University of Leeds; University of Insubria; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Passarella, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",M.Passarella@leeds.ac.uk,,"Veronese Passarella, Marco/0000-0001-7652-5952",,,,,36,8,8,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

On the negative side, public debt is still high, primary surpluses improved only modestly, and public spending barely fell as the problem of ever-rising pension payments remained unsolved. On the positive side, unemployment fell sharply, exports and the current account balance rose, capital and labor reallocated to more productive and tradable sectors, and the economy is growing faster than the European Union average for the first time in 15 years.","[Reis, Ricardo] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Reis, R (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, London, England.",,,,ESRC [ES/L500343/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,21,10,15,1,28,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Such studies do not typically attend to potential biases that may arise due to survey attrition. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics - the data source most commonly used in prior studies - we demonstrate that attrition is particularly high for low-income adult children with low-income parents and particularly low for high-income adult children with high-income parents. Because of this pattern of attrition, intergenerational upward mobility has been overstated for low-income families and downward mobility has been understated for high-income families. The bias among low-income families is greater than the bias among high-income families implying that intergenerational elasticity in family income is higher than previous estimates with the Panel Study of Income Dynamics would suggest.","[Schoeni, Robert F.] Univ Michigan, Inst Social Res, Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Schoeni, Robert F.] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA; [Wiemers, Emily E.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02125 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,"Wiemers, EE (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, 100 Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125 USA.",bschoeni@umich.edu; emily.wiemers@umb.edu,,,"National Institute on Aging [AG000221-17, P01-AG029409]; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [R01-HD069609]",National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"We thank Charlie Brown, Vicki Freedman, Fabian Pfeffer, Frank Stafford, Narayan Sastry, and seminar participants at the University of Michigan for important comments on earlier drafts of this manuscript.

Before the beginning of the second period, a product reputation established in the past period enables consumers to recognize the real type of the monopolist. I show that there occurs a signalling equilibrium where the high-quality type monopolist uses a high price strategy.

Measurements show that in both developing and developed countries, the utilisation efficiency of external debt funds shows a downward trend; this downward trend is more obvious in developed countries. Empirical analysis found that the trade deficit rate, the trade openness, the ratio of fiscal revenue to gross domestic product (GDP), and the inflation rate have a significant negative effect on the utilisation efficiency of external debt funds. The ratio of money and quasi money (M2) to GDP, the ratio of the population aged 15-65 to total population, the ratio of industry value-added to GDP, and the investment growth rate have a significant positive effect on the utilisation efficiency of external debt funds. Furthermore, under the condition of high ratio of the population aged 15-65 to total population, an increase in the ratio of the population aged 15-65 to total population will have a larger effect on improving the utilisation efficiency of external debt funds. Under the condition of high trade deficit rate, an increase in trade deficit rate will have a bigger effect on decreasing the utilisation efficiency of external debt funds.","[Yang, Yun; Chen, Leyi; Huang, Qingqing] Hunan Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China",Hunan University,"Yang, Y (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, North Campus, Changsha 410006, Hunan, Peoples R China.",yangyunpaper@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Conversely, I find no positive effects of localization economies (as measured by the number of other workers working for neighboring firms in the same industry and in the same city).

The literature on social capital suggests that the levels of trust and participation in societies may affect cooperation and innovation. While there is evidence of the role of trade and inconclusive evidence on the role of social capital, previous studies have generally omitted two factors, out of the three mentioned, used small sample sizes and emphasized economic growth rather than technological progress. Our study addresses these shortcomings. We find robust evidence of the role of trade in fostering technological progress which is invariant to TFP proxies and independent of the debate on measuring TFP. Moreover, there is no clear role for scale, and a country rate of TFP growth seems to increase the most the more the country trades with dynamic economies that are different from. We uncover a positive effect of social capital, which is more significant in richer countries, suggesting that other characteristics, such as institutional quality, may be complementary to social capital. The paper's results are robust to different specification and estimation methods.","[Jalles, Joao Tovar] OECD, Dept Econ, F-75116 Paris, France; [Tavares, Jose] Univ Nova Lisboa, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Universidade Nova de Lisboa,"Jalles, JT (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75116 Paris, France.",joao.jalles@oecd.org,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076; Tavares, Jose/0000-0002-8159-9646",,,,,72,4,4,1,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

In a panel data set of manufacturing firms in 25 Eastern European and Central Asian countries between 2001 and 2007, we employ international trade cost shocks to identify the causal impacts of trade credit on firms' exportation. We find that when trade costs decline, firms with less trade credit increase their exports disproportionately more because of the alleviation of their financing burdens. Results are robust after controlling for bank and other financing channels, country financial development, and the endogeneity of trade credit. Our findings contribute to the empirical identification of financial frictions on firms' exports and to the role of trade credit on firms' performance.","Univ N Dakota, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA",University of North Dakota Grand Forks,"Wang, X (通讯作者)，Univ N Dakota, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Grand Forks, ND 58202 USA.",xiao.wang@business.und.edu,"Wang, Xiao/D-9306-2019","Wang, Xiao/0000-0003-3884-0702",,,,,11,1,1,1,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The Chinese export-led growth path has been challenged by its own success, and the global financial crisis forced China toward rebalancing, which is a work in progress.

The impact of different incentives depends on the form they take tiorl on the way they are received. This paper compares the impact of different incentives designed to increase pro-environmental behaviour (by increasing individuals' willingness to recycle household waste). Some individuals are more responsive to a nudge (that increases individuals' perceptions of the intrinsic value of action) than to a threat (that they will be punished if they refuse to comply). The relative efficacy of these incentives depends on the extent to which individuals are motivated by 'environmental morale'.

We find that generosity among anonymous villagers is very low compared with the findings in the dictator game literature. On average, the dictators in our sample allocate only 6% of their endowments to anonymous persons in the village, and 73% of the dictators keep all of their endowments to themselves when paired with anonymous persons. However, we found very high levels of sharing between husband and wife. In terms of gender differences, we find that women are not more generous towards anonymous persons, nor are they more likely to share within theft families. In fact, there is some evidence, albeit weak, showing that women allocate less to anonymous persons than do men. Additionally, there is strong evidence that women are less likely to share theft resources with theft spouse than are men. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using data for Spain, we estimate zero-inflated ordered probit models to control for an excess of zeros in our ordinal dependent variable. We find that the probability of game playing increases with the consumption of other cultural goods (e.g., listening to music or watching television) or active involvement in artistic activities (e.g., writing or visual arts production). Game playing is in general an urban phenomenon; it is positively associated with the ownership of home equipment and access to new technologies, but decreases with greater time restrictions of a person. The main differences to the traditional art formats is that game playing appeals particularly to younger, usually less educated cohorts.","[Borowiecki, Karol J.] Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark; [Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Oviedo, Spain",University of Southern Denmark; University of Oviedo,"Borowiecki, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Dept Econ & Business, Odense, Denmark.",kjb@sam.sdu.dk,"Borowiecki, Karol J./ABE-1387-2021; Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/C-7766-2013","Borowiecki, Karol J./0000-0003-4959-181X; Prieto-Rodriguez, Juan/0000-0001-9163-3011","European Union; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-27896, ECO2013-46516-C4-4-R]",European Union(European Union (EU)); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"The authors wish to thank Martin Falk, John O'Hagan, Beatriz Plaza, the Editor Kathryn Graddy and participants at the European Workshop on Applied Cultural Economics in Ljubljana, workshop on Culture, data and digitization'' in Bilbao and an invited seminar at the University of Catania for helpful suggestions and insightful comments.

We carry out the analysis on both sectors and individual industries within sectors. As a first step, we use the Stock and Watson (J Am Stat Assoc 93(441):349-358, 1998) procedure to filter the data in order to extract the long-run component of the series; then, following Phillips and Sul (Econometrica 75(6):1771-1855, 2007), we estimate the relative transition parameters. In the case of sectoral indices we find convergence in the middle of the sample period, followed by divergence, and detect four (two large and two small) clusters. The analysis at a disaggregate, industry level again points to convergence in the middle of the sample, and subsequent divergence, but a much larger number of clusters is now found. Splitting the cross-section into two subgroups including euro area countries, the UK and the US respectively, provides evidence of a global convergence/divergence process not obviously influenced by EU policies.","[Caporale, Guglielmo Maria] Brunel Univ, London, England; [Erdogan, Burcu] Univ Trier, Trier, Germany; [Kuzin, Vladimir] ECB, Frankfurt, Germany",Brunel University; Universitat Trier; European Central Bank,"Caporale, GM (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, London, England.",Guglielmo-Maria.Caporale@brunel.ac.uk,,,,,,,29,9,9,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42.0,3,,,,,481,498,,10.1007/s10663-014-9259-x,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800001,0

The disciplinary sanctions resulted from external investigations, which revealed misapplications of auditing standards. In particular, we evaluate (a) the efficacy of the external supervisory board in identifying low-quality auditors and (b) the effectiveness of the disciplinary system in improving the quality of subsequent statutory audits performed by the sanctioned auditors. We employ two earnings management indicators as proxies for audit quality: loss avoidance through extraordinary items and abnormal accruals. And we compare these measures in the financial statements of client companies (auditees) audited by sanctioned and non-sanctioned auditors between 1995 and 2007. Our evidence is mixed. The results show that companies audited by Non-Big 4 sanctioned auditors in the pre-inspection period are less likely to avoid bottom-line losses. Additionally, we conclude that use of this earnings management tool decreases in the post-investigation period for all sanctioned auditors, whether Big 4 or Non-Big 4 firms. Contrary to our expectations, the enhancement performance on this measure of audit quality is observed only for smaller fines. The discretionary accrual approach to earnings management does not offer significant results, however. Therefore, the conclusions are not robust, and further investigation is needed. A feasible explanation for the elusive conclusion may be based on the strong incentives for private firms to avoid bottom-line losses for financing purposes and to manipulate earnings to minimize tax payments.","[De Fuentes, Cristina] Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Valencia 46021, Spain; [Illueca, Manuel; Consuelo Pucheta-Martinez, Maria] Univ Jaume 1, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Econ, Castellon De La Plana 12071, Spain",University of Valencia; Universitat Jaume I,"De Fuentes, C (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Fac Econ, Avda Tarongers S-N, Valencia 46021, Spain.",cristina.de-fuentes@uv.es; Illueca@cofin.uji.es; pucheta@cofin.uji.es,"Illueca, Manuel/KAM-0946-2024","De Fuentes, Cristina/0000-0001-6771-3679","Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes [ECO2011-29144-C03-02]; Junta de Andalucia [SEJ-8236]","Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura y Deportes; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia)","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 3rd Workshop on Audit Quality, 5th EARNET Symposium, the 33rd EAA Annual Conference, and the 7th Workshop on Empirical Research in Financial Accounting.

We find that interruption costs vary significantly over time, between sectors and regions. Peaking at midday on a Monday in December at 750 Mio Euro per hour, the average total national outage costs amount to approximately 430 Mio Euro per hour.

Simultaneous elections are thus preferred if the front-runner advantage is small, but sequential elections are preferred if the advantage is large.

The equilibrium relationships between monetary aggregates, credit interest rates and real income are derived from banks' optimizing behavior. This model is used to theoretically establish the effects of a crisis on the bank lending channel and, more specifically, on the equilibrium relationships between the main economic and monetary variables. The model is also used to explore the potential effects of unconventional monetary policies focused on reducing risk aversion during crisis episodes. These effects are empirically assessed applying cointegration techniques to macroeconomic data of the euro area and the United States before and after the collapse of the Lehman Brothers. The results support the efficacy of unconventional measures in restoring the conventional transmission channels between monetary aggregates but shed some doubts on the ability of these measures to boost economic activity.

We find that when competitive behavior has no impact on coworkers (i.e., the baseline), the size of the competitive reference group does not influence the level of competitive behavior. If we allow the competitive choice to reduce the earnings of coworkers: (1) the level of competitive behavior falls relative to the baseline; and (2) increases in the size of the competitive reference group increase the level of competitive behavior. The level of competitive behavior falls further when respondents also anticipate future interactions with the reference group. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It supports the Frey and Gallus view that, as a consequence of individuals employing external inputs rather than relying upon their own judgemental capacities, the quality of decision-making may differ at the market and macro levels from what has been observed in laboratory experiments. It seeks to forestall potential moves by rational choice theorists to argue that such processes, imposed by competitive pressures, will swiftly eliminate anomalous behaviour. But it questions Frey and Gallus's use of conventional rational choice theory as the reference point for judging the quality of real-world decisions. It argues that choice is an activity based on evolving sets of habits and rules, rather than based on given preference systems, and that Frey and Gallus's failure to consider alternative reference points is itself a manifestation of anchoring.","Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Earl, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",p.earl@uq.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP1093840]; Australian Research Council [DP1093840] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"Many of the arguments and examples in this paper owe their origins to my involvement in a long-term research project funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant (DP1093840), in which Lana Friesen and I have been studying how, and how well, Australian consumers choose their mobile phone service contracts.

We try to determine what drove the expansion and what might be the implications of the retrenchment. We look at the commercial motivations that are the staples of the general OFDI literature but also, given the peculiar if not unique features of Russian business and state, we consider political explanations - whether business invests abroad in order to escape a predatory state or alternatively to serve the foreign policy objectives of the state. We also consider psychological' explanations, specifically the possible irrational' if not irresponsible exuberance' of hard-driving Russian oligarchs. It is expected that the discussion will allow some significant, albeit tentative, conclusions on Russian big business and its place in the global economy.The article is structured as follows: an outline of the key characteristics of the Russian steel industry; a presentation of the possible explanations for Russian steel OFDI; a summary of the OFDI activities of the six biggest Russian steel companies, with particular emphasis on three; an examination of the possible explanations in the light of their activities; and conclusions.","[Fortescue, Stephen] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Hanson, Philip] Royal Inst Int Affairs, Chatham House, London, England",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Hanson, P (通讯作者)，Royal Inst Int Affairs, Chatham House, London, England.",phil_hanson@btinternet.com,,,,,,,47,5,8,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUL 3,2015,27.0,3,,,,,283,305,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1055962,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CP1BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359609600001,0

I claim that Hausman's evidential account does not justify the use of any one measure more than it justifies the use of any other measure.

In standing committees, however, existing agreements can be amended. This article studies an extension of the Baron-Ferejohn framework to a model with an evolving default that reflects this important feature of policymaking in standing committees: In each of an infinite number of periods, the ongoing default can be amended to a new policy (which is, in turn, the default for the next period). The model provides a number of quite different predictions. (i) From a positive perspective, the key distinction turns on whether the quota is less than unanimity. In that case, patient enough players waste substantial shares of the pie each period and the size principle fails in some pure strategy Markov perfect equilibria. In contrast, the unique Markov perfect equilibrium payoffs in a unanimity committee coincide with those in the corresponding Baron-Ferejohn framework.

A double threshold GARCH(1,1) methodology is utilized where the VIX index is used as the threshold regime change indicator. Daily data from January 4, 1999, to December 31, 2013, are used. A sub-period analysis covering only the financial crisis period of January 2, 2007, to December 31, 2009, is also performed. This study provides evidence that the level of equity market volatility (i.e., VIX) that triggers a regime shift is commodity specific. The results also indicate that the threshold VIX values are time varying. Furthermore, natural gas prices appear to withstand considerably more volatility in the equity market than do the prices of other energy commodities. This relationship is even more pronounced during the financial crisis period. Approximately 70% and 50% of the estimated coefficients display asymmetric sensitivities due to regime changes during the entire period and the crisis period, respectively. The findings have practical implications as the underlying volatility of an asset plays a significant role in determining its associated activity in the futures markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that sentiment is a key variable in the prices of stocks traded on these markets, and has a stronger impact here than in more developed European markets. This effect is linked to stock characteristics, particularly those considered to make stocks more prone to the influence of investor sentiment. The evidence shows that the effect is not uniform across countries, since higher levels are found for Poland and the Czech Republic, thus confirming the role of country-specific factors in the impact of investor sentiment on stock prices. The results also confirm that sentiment is a twofold (global and local) phenomenon, in which the global dimension has much greater impact than the local dimension, at least in the markets considered. Finally, the article shows that sentiment does not spread, at least to any significant degree, through the movement of capital between markets. This strengthens the argument that sentiment is transmitted through a behavioral mechanism. If this argument proves correct, there is little likelihood of local regulatory action being very effective in limiting the perverse impact of asset bubbles.","[Corredor, P.; Ferrer, E.; Santamaria, R.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Navarra 31006, Spain",Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Santamaria, R (通讯作者)，Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Gest Empresas, Campus Arrosadia S-N, Navarra 31006, Spain.",rafael@unavarra.es,"Corredor, Pilar/G-7800-2015; Santamaria, Rafael/G-5755-2015; Ferrer, Elena/H-1239-2015","Corredor, Pilar/0000-0003-1739-0095; Santamaria, Rafael/0000-0001-7656-6412; Ferrer, Elena/0000-0002-1761-9120",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35946-C02-01],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),This article has received financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ECO2012-35946-C02-01).,,29,29,33,4,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

We argue that this is one of the factors behind the success of the Nordic model, where a comprehensive welfare state is associated with high employment. In a general equilibrium setting, the underlining mechanism works through wage moderation and job creation. The benefits make it more important to hold a job, thus lower wages will be accepted, and more jobs created. Moreover, we show that the incentive to acquire higher education improves, further boosting employment in the long run. These positive effects help in counteracting the negative impact of taxation. Through numerical simulations, we show how this mechanism can contribute to explain the better labor market performance and more equitable income distribution of Nordic countries compared to Continental European ones.

In a first step, we show how gender-based taxes can act as Pigou taxes and correct the externality induced by a non-cooperative household equilibrium. We find that the first-best Pigou tax rules are solely determined by spouses' relative marginal rates of substitution between the public household good and private consumption. Breaking down this general rule into the primitives of the model, the spouse with a comparative advantage in home production should be taxed at a higher rate. In a second step, we embed our non-cooperative framework in a standard second-best planning problem in which taxes serve a revenue-raising purpose. In this case, the optimal structure of differential taxation by gender is partly determined by a Ramsey-type inverse elasticity rule and partly by a Pigouvian tax element. We show that these two forces work in opposite directions in determining whether men or women should be taxed at a higher rate, and that either one could be dominant, depending on the revenue-raising position of the government. This result is robust to the introduction of two groups of households that differ in their mode of decision-making, which can be either cooperative or non-cooperative. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While it is generally portrayed as a barter framework, the proof actually assumes an accepted system of credits and debits; a system of privately issued IOU's, or what is the same thing commitments by private agents to deliver a certain quantity of a given commodity at a given equilibrium price. In other words, the proof presupposes the existence of 'inside money'. Yet a system of generalized exchange with pure inside money is not compatible with the main principles of Neo-Classical monetary theory including that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, the exogeneity of money and also the neutrality of money. This explains the importance and necessity of introducing 'outside money' in general equilibrium. Focussing mainly on Patinkin's 'invalid dichotomy' and the real balance effect, and to a lesser extent, on overlapping generation models, I try to show that these attempts have been unsuccessful. In both cases the integration of monetary and value theory amount to collapsing all individuals into a single one. This negates the very economic problem (i.e., multiple exchanges) that gave rise to general equilibrium theory and to the impending requirement to prove the existence of market clearing equilibrium.","[Perez Caldentey, Esteban] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile",,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",Esteban.PEREZ@eclac.org,,,,,,,57,0,0,0,4,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

One of the main criteria for assessing green performance is eco-efficiency. To identify all aspects of the eco-efficiency, inputs should be divided into energy and non-energy and outputs should be divided into good and bad outputs. To deal with this issue, a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model is developed to divide inputs into both energy and non-energy and outputs into both desirable (good) and undesirable (bad) outputs. Likewise, variables are separated into both discretionary and non-discretionary factors. Accordingly, a bounded adjusted measure (BAM) based on green indicators is developed to calculate the eco-efficiency of derision making units (DMUs). Besides, energy saving potentials and undesirable output abatement potentials are calculated to show correlation coefficient between energy consumption and undesirable output. Finally, proposed model is validated by assessing the eco-efficiency of some selected members of organization for economic cooperation and development (OECD). Australia, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and Switzerland are recognized as eco-efficient countries and the rest of countries are inefficient in terms of the eco-efficiency. High and positive Spearman correlation coefficient between energy consumption and undesirable outputs addresses that the more use of energy inputs, the more undesirable outputs.

Yet in making these projections, researchers often ignore the aspect of household formation-despite sustained trends in many industrialized countries towards smaller household units with fewer members. Over the long term, this trend is likely to reduce the benefits of sharing goods/services within households (household economies of scale) at the micro-level, thereby increasing household-sector demand at the macro level. We propose a framework to (a) quantify the level of household economies of scale for different household types and (b) assess how the decline in average household size impacts aggregate household-sector demand. We apply the framework to energy consumption in Japan. The application indicates that household economies of scale in energy use are substantial and that the 5% decline in average household size in Japan between 2005 and 2010 led to an economy-wide loss in household economies of scale amounting to almost 4%.","[Schroeder, Carsten] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Socio Econ Panel Study SOEP, Berlin, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Free Univ Berlin, Berlin, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin; Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Rehdanz, Katrin] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Narita, Daiju] JICA Res Inst, Phnom Penh, Cambodia; [Okubo, Toshihiro] Keio Univ, Tokyo 108, Japan",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Free University of Berlin; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Kiel; Keio University,"Schröder, C (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Socio Econ Panel Study SOEP, Mohrenstr 58, Berlin, Germany.",cschroeder@diw.de,"Narita, Daiju/G-7125-2016; Narita, Daiju/AAH-2870-2020","Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Rehdanz, Katrin/0000-0002-5336-0582","[JSPS 25780169]; [JSPS 26220503]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503, 15H03348] Funding Source: KAKEN","; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (JSPS 25780169 and JSPS 26220503 to T.O.).,,39,16,17,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

The results demonstrate that for Jerusalem residents, mobility restrictions reduce out-migration but they are much more pronounced in impeding out-migration to Israel proper than to Israeli settlements. Additionally, an increase in the number of border closures per quarter has a positive and significant impact on the odds of facing unemployment for all groups, but is especially high for migrant workers residing outside of Jerusalem. A lower bound estimate of the economic cost of a 50 day increase in the number of border closures (1.78 standard deviations) per quarter is about USD 1.7 million per day in the subsequent quarter. The paper also concludes that the determinants of out-migration differ from those of return-migration. For example, while border closures and unemployment status during previous visits are strong determinants of out-migration, the decision to return is driven by relatively low wages and lacking the necessary legal documentation to enter Israel. The findings in this paper are consistent with international studies that ascribe inefficiency in labor markets to restrictions on labor mobility across regions. (C) 2015 The Author.

In this paper, the limiting distribution of the Suits index estimator is derived and simple plug-in formulae for the index estimator and its sampling variance are provided. By means of a simulation analysis, we show that inferences based on first-order asymptotics perform well for moderately large samples. Bootstrap-t - which uses the plug-in variance estimator - appears to perform well.

We show conditions under which the profitability of legal firms may or may not be negatively affected by the presence of a P2P network. In addition, we demonstrate the resilience of P2P host sites to distribute digital goods.

If the income data are not missing completely at random, the calculated income inequalities are more likely to be biased, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions and policy recommendations. To handle the missing data on income, a multiple imputation approach is utilized. In particular, we propose an extended approach to correct the possible sample selection bias in the imputation process. A case study using China's household survey suggests that extended imputation corrects for biases effectively in the calculation of Gini coefficients and results in gains in efficiency as well.","[Chen, Yongwei] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Sch Math & Stat, Wuhan 430073, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Fu, Dahai] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Fu, DH (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Trade & Econ, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yongwei@znufe.edu.cn; fudahai@cufe.edu.cn,,"Fu, Dahai/0000-0001-8840-5966","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71001107, 71161010]; Foundations for Young Scholars in the Central Universities [2722013JC086]; National Social Science Fund of China [13CJL037]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Foundations for Young Scholars in the Central Universities; National Social Science Fund of China,We would like to thank Associate Editor Buhong Zheng and two anonymous referees for their useful comments and suggestions which improved the quality of the paper substantially.

While micro-finance institutions (MFIs) act under the flag of serving the common good, there are still the interests of institutional investors behind them, who are looking to profit through international financial circuits. On one hand, microfinance is part of financial innovation in the global financial circuits. On the other hand, women's bancarization inserts them into the labor market, hence into the financial circuits. MFIs become part of the shadow financial system. When debating microcredit's profitability from a gender perspective, I note both the financial effectiveness of microcredits and the role of women as highly profitable economic agents. Is there a relation between financialization and microcredit? Is microcredit an achievement that will improve the economic, political, and social environment for women? Why is it that women's bancarization has been a priority of international financial organizations? Microcredit with a woman's face confirms the suggested hypotheses. Their empowerment through microcredit is a new way for financial investors to obtain higher profits through MFIs. The highest interest rates that MFIs charges are an expression of financialization by institutional investors.","Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Econ Res Inst, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Girón, A (通讯作者)，Natl Autonomous Univ Mexico UNAM, Econ Res Inst, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",,"Girón, Alicia/JNT-1631-2023",,CONACYT's scholarship,CONACYT's scholarship,"Alicia Giron is the 2015 James Street Scholar.

In this model the effect of a shock may be permanent or transitory in different time periods. By applying the IRS model to the 1870-2008 annual U.S. real GDP data, we find that the output shocks in the periods of the 1893 depression, the 1907 financial panic, the two World Wars and the Great Depression are likely to have had a large but transitory effect, whereas the output shocks in the remaining periods are likely to have had a permanent effect.

The first model incorporates capital adjustment costs, while the second one assumes that risk-averse managers maximize their own objective function rather than shareholder wealth. We show that, while both models generate pro-cyclical aggregate dividends, a feature consistent with the observed business-cycle pattern of payouts from well-diversified portfolios, the second model provides a more likely explanation for this effect.

The latter provides a unified research paradigm for analysing tax compliance behaviour integrating economic and psychological factors. Tax honesty is distinguished into two types, voluntary and enforced compliance and these in turn vary depending on the trust individuals have on government and on the power of tax authorities. Results verify that trust increases voluntary compliance, and power increases enforced compliance. A very interesting finding is that power has no influence on voluntary compliance in the high trust conditions, but high power leads to even lower voluntary compliance in low trust conditions. This suggests that in high trust conditions, power of tax authorities is perceived as legitimate, while in low trust conditions, the same power is perceived as coercive and yields negative attitudes. In the post-crisis years, Greece has experienced a deep erosion of trust to the authorities. With the trust paradigm deactivated, efforts to improve the effectiveness of tax authorities can at best improve enforced compliance.

In contrast to much earlier work on income diversification I use crop-level data to explicitly evaluate marginal returns within agriculture. The integrated household survey used allows me to then link these returns to household characteristics and broader labour supply decisions and consumption behaviour. In line with expectations agricultural wage work seems to be a last resort option, as agricultural wage labourers have lower marginal returns than others due to a higher labour allocation to own agricultural production. Furthermore, wage rates are much higher than the agricultural shadow wages, implying that there are gains to be made from expanding the non-farm side of the rural economy. However, there is no evidence that households are stuck in agriculture due to being constrained from entering the existing labour market, and neither do I find preferences for own crops being important for labour allocation. Work preferences seem to play a role though, and the findings are consistent with both credit and social networks being important determinants of a household's marginal productivity in agriculture.","Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Nerman, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.",mansnerman@gmail.se,,,Swedish International Development Agency (Sida),Swedish International Development Agency (Sida),"I am grateful for comments by Niklas Bengtsson, Arne Bigsten, Andy McKay, Gerald Shively, Mans Soderbom and seminar participants at the University of Gothenburg, as well as to the NBS in Dar es Salaam for data access and to the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) for project funds.",,23,4,4,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

In this auction, each supplier's offer consists of both price and quality, and a supplier whose offer achieves the highest score wins. The environment we consider has the feature that quality is multidimensional, and the cost complementarity or cost substitutability among quality attributes significantly affects the form of a scoring rule which implements the buyer's optimal mechanism. Our results show that the optimal scoring rule can be additively separable in the quality attributes if the degree of cost substitutability between the attributes is nonpositive, and it cannot be additively separable if the degree is sufficiently high. An example shows how to compute the buyer's loss from using an additively separable scoring rule. We also investigate how the optimal scoring rule depends on the buyer's weight parameter on suppliers' profits and the number of suppliers.","Komazawa Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan",,"Nishimura, T (通讯作者)，Komazawa Univ, Dept Econ, Tokyo, Japan.",tnishi@komazawa-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [11J56302]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03346, 11J56302, 26885081] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to an editor and two referees for their invaluable suggestions and comments.

A pre-analysis plan pre-specifies in a precise way the analysis to be run before examining the data. A researcher can specify variables, data cleaning procedures, regression specifications, and so on. If the regressions are pre-specified in advance and researchers are required to report all the results they pre-specify, data-mining problems are greatly reduced. I begin by laying out the basics of what a statistical analysis plan actually contains so those researchers unfamiliar with it can better understand how it is done. In so doing, I have drawn both on standards used in clinical trials, which are clearly specified by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as my own practical experience from writing these plans in economics contexts. I then lay out some of the advantages of pre-specified analysis plans, both for the scientific community as a whole and also for the researcher. I also explore some of the limitations and costs of such plans. I then review a few pieces of evidence that suggest that, in many contexts, the benefits of using pre-specified analysis plans may not be as high as one might have expected initially. For the most part, I will focus on the relatively narrow issue of pre-analysis for randomized controlled trials.","MIT, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Olken, BA (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",bolken@mit.edu,,/0000-0003-1918-4631,,,,,34,109,125,1,42,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

This study explores a cost-effective solution to combining elicitation formats from a single study to obtain more preference information from a given sample while limiting respondents' cognitive burden. Methods: A stated-preference survey combined both discrete-choice experiment (DCE) and best-worst scaling (BWS) elicitation formats to Alzheimer's disease caregivers. DCE questions elicited attribute-level preferences for one subset of attributes, and object-case BWS elicited overall relative attribute importance for another subset of attributes, with two overlapping attributes in both designs. Two alternative joint models combined preferences from the BWS and DCE data. One model controlled for confounding between response-error variance and preference parameters in the DCE model, and the other did not. Results: About 400 caregivers completed the survey. We estimated attribute-level preference parameters for 17 attributes, 9 of which were directly estimated using the DCE data, and 8 of which were extrapolated based on the overall relative importance estimated using the object-case BWS data. Results from both joint models and individual models indicate that relative preferences from the two question formats were the same up to a scale factor. Conclusion: Our results suggest that combining DCE and object-case BWS is a cost-effective solution to the need for more information when study resources are limited. Moreover, for these data at least, researchers' concerns about serious confounding between DCE model estimates and response-error variance appear unwarranted.

Our analysis is motivated by the observation of a negative relationship between disagreement and economic growth among poorer countries.","Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; Univ Lucerne, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",Tilburg University; University of Lucerne,"Oechslin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Dept Econ, POB 4466, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",manuel.oechslin@unilu.ch,,,,,,,39,9,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

EVIDENCE FROM RAMADAN,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CROSS-COUNTRY; HEALTH; TRUST; SACRIFICE; CULTURE; WEIGHT,"We study the economic effects of religious practices in the context of the observance of Ramadan fasting, one of the central tenets of Islam. To establish causality, we exploit variation in the length of daily fasting due to the interaction between the rotating Islamic calendar and a country's latitude. We report two key, quantitatively meaningful results: (i) longer Ramadan fasting has a negative effect on output growth in Muslim countries, and (ii) it increases subjective well-being among Muslims. We find evidence that these patterns are consistent with a standard club good explanation for the emergence of costly religious practices: increased strictness of fasting screens out the less committed members, while the more committed respond with an increase in their relative levels of participation. Together, our results underscore that religious practices can affect individual behavior and beliefs in ways that have negative implications for economic performance, but that nevertheless increase subjective well-being among followers.","[Campante, Filipe] Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Campante, F (通讯作者)，Harvard Kennedy Sch, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,68,143,159,3,87,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Yet we know little about its implications for how nations should conduct their trade policy. For example, should import sectors with weaker comparative advantage be protected more? Conversely, should export sectors with stronger comparative advantage be subsidized less? In this article we take a first stab at exploring these issues. Our main results imply that in the context of a canonical Ricardian model, optimal import tariffs should be uniform, whereas optimal export subsidies should be weakly decreasing with respect to comparative advantage, reflecting the fact that countries have more room to manipulate prices in their comparative-advantage sectors.

We analyse the effects of introducing a two tier structure of capital taxation, where the asymmetric member states of a union choose a common, federal tax rate in the first stage, and then non-cooperatively set local tax rates in the second stage. We show that this mechanism effectively reduces competition for mobile capital between the members of the union. Moreover, it distributes the gains across the heterogeneous states in a way that yields a strict Pareto improvement over a one tier system of purely local tax choices.

I examine the French experience of working time reduction (the 35 hours week). I show that real wage growth has been frozen since the mid-1980s, working time reduction has been insufficient to create the amount of jobs necessary for maintaining full employment and most of the productivity gains were devoted to the recovery in the profit share. Under these conditions, we establish two important results. The first is that the rise in unemployment rate is offset by the increase in financialisation, measured as the difference between the profit share and the investment rate. The increase in dividends is therefore the counterpart of a lack in job creation due to an insufficient reduction of working time. The analysis has two main implications: growth is not a solution in itself, and the question of distribution is central, but it implies that capitalism should operate with a lower rate of profit, which it is not willing to accept.","Inst Rech Econ & Sociales, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France",,"Husson, M (通讯作者)，Inst Rech Econ & Sociales, Michel Husson 277,Ave Div Leclerc, F-92290 Chatenay Malabry, France.",Michel.Husson@gmail.com,,,,,,,8,8,10,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

However, turmoil in energy markets during the early 2000s has raised new questions about the stability of this elasticity. Using panel data on U.S. states, we revisit the simultaneous-equations methodology of Small and Van Dender (2007) and Hymel et al. (2010) to see whether structural parameters have changed. Using data through 2009, we confirm the earlier finding of a rebound effect that declines in magnitude with income, but we also find an upward shift in its magnitude of about 0.025 during the years 2003-2009. In addition, we find that the rebound effect is much greater in magnitude in years when gasoline prices are rising than when they are falling. It is also greater during times of media attention and price volatility, which explains about half the upward shift just mentioned. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a society where individuals voluntarily form risk-sharing groups in the absence of financial markets. We obtain a partition of society into distinct coalitions leading to partial risk sharing. When individuals differ only with respect to risk, the partition is homophily-based: the less risky agents congregate together and reject more risky ones into other coalitions. The distribution of risk affects the number and size of these coalitions. It turns out that individuals may pay a lower risk premium in more risky societies. We show that a higher heterogeneity in risk leads to a lower degree of partial risk sharing. The case of heterogenous risk aversion generates similar results. The empirical evidence on partial risk sharing can be understood when the endogenous partition of society into risk-sharing coalitions is taken into account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate the total factor productivity (TFP) of establishments as a function of foreign presence within and across industries. Both the fixed assets and wages share of foreign establishments in a five-digit ISIC (International Standard Industrial Classification) industry are used as measures of foreign presence. The estimations provide evidence of significantly negative (or insignificant) FDI vertical spillover effects and insignificant horizontal spillover effects on the TFP of domestic establishments. The positive (negative) coefficient of the interaction term between the forward (horizontal) spillover variable and the technology gap supports the catching-up' (technology accumulation) hypothesis. The negative impact, even absence, of FDI spillover effects on TFP and the mixed evidence on the effects of interactions between FDI spillovers and the technology gap suggest that fine-tuning of fiscal incentive schemes for FDI to arrive at positive net benefits may prove to be a daunting task in the Malaysian E&E industries.","[Khalifah, Noor Aini] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Bangi 43600, Malaysia; [Salleh, Salmah Mohd] Minist Educ, Educ Planning & Res Div, Unit, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Adam, Radziah] Univ Sains Malaysia, Sch Distance Educ, Gelugor, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Khalifah, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Bangi 43600, Malaysia.",khalifah@ukm.edu.my; salmah.salleh@moe.gov.my; radziah_adam@usm.my,"Adam, Radziah/C-1467-2009","ADAM, RADZIAH/0000-0003-1200-0289","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [UKM-GUP-JKKBG-08-03-015]; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme [FRGS/1/2011/SS/UKM/02/2]","Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia; Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia via the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme","We would like to thank the participants of the 2013 Enterprise Performance in Asia Conference, organised by the Asian Institute of Management Policy Center in Cebu City, Philippines, 7-9 November, and Mansor Jusoh and Abdul Hamid Jaafar for helpful comments and suggestions.

Using matched county-firm data for 1998-2005, we estimate the impact of county government size on the relationship between a firm's reported profit and imputed profit based on the national income accounts. A larger government is found to be correlated with more severe tax evasion, especially for state-owned and collectively-owned firms. Such an effect is stronger when local governance become worse. This paper shows that a large government does not bring about a strong state capacity to enforce tax rules at the local level in China.","[Li, Lixing] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Ma, Guangrong] Renmin Univ China, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Peking University; Renmin University of China,"Ma, GR (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",grongma@163.com,,"Li, Lixing/0000-0002-1178-5830","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71203004, 71403278]; key project of the National Social Science Fund of China [14AZD127]; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project [YETP0042]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); key project of the National Social Science Fund of China; Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project,"Address for Correspondence: China Financial Policy Research Center, School of Finance, Renmin University of China, Beijing 100872, China.

Based on the analytical framework of Zhou et at (Energy Economics, 32, 194-201, 2010), we develop a parametric Malmquist index approach that takes into account statistical noises. Moreover, the fixed-effect panel stochastic frontier model is employed to deal with regional heterogeneity. The proposed approach is applied to analyze the dynamics of carbon emission performance in 30 Chinese provinces during the period of 2000-2010. The main findings are as follows. First, the carbon emission performances of 30 provinces as a whole improved by 4.1% annually during the sample period, which was mainly driven by efficiency change component. Second, the east area shows the best performance with an average Malmquist CO2 emissions performance index (MCPI) of 1.108, followed by the central area (1.039). Unlike the east and central areas, the west area experienced deterioration in carbon emission performance. More effective environmental policies should be implemented to change the situation. Third, compared with the proposed approach, the nonparametric approach tends to underestimate China's MCPI and gives rise to volatile results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Nonetheless, the experience of liberalized electricity markets indicates that market establishment would be insufficient to produce competitive results. To determine whether the restructured market is moving toward competition, this paper assesses production efficiency in Iran's electricity market during high demand periods in 2006 as the first year of the restructured market's performance, and in 2012 as the last year with available data. We compared counterfactual benchmark outcomes to the actual dispatches to determine the production efficiency. Moreover, Iran's power market is a discriminatory, day-ahead auction; therefore, we considered the market design in the competitive benchmark. We found that the production was inefficient in both 2006 and 2012. More importantly, the production in the market is becoming increasingly inefficient over time due to exercising market power and distortion of the market's production by strategic firms. Not only were strategic firms distorting the market's production, but they were also learning to exercise more non-competitive behavior because these firms distorted the production in 2012 eight times more than they did in 2006.

In particular, we show that their model implicitly imposes a zero rebound effect, which contradicts most of the available empirical evidence on this issue. We relax this restrictive assumption through the modelling of a rebound-effect function that mitigates or intensifies the effect of an efficiency improvement on energy consumption. We illustrate our model with an empirical application that aims to estimate a US frontier residential aggregate energy demand function using panel data for 48 states over the period 1995 to 2011. Average values of the rebound effect in the range of 56-80% are found. Therefore, policymakers should be aware that most of the expected energy reduction from efficiency improvements may not be achieved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While formally showing that below-cost pricing on one market side can allow an incumbent firm to exclude a potential rival which does not have a customer base yet, the proposed model does not necessarily imply that below-cost pricing in such markets should be taken as anti-competitive conduct. Instead, I find that in sufficiently asymmetric two-sided markets, exclusion is always beneficial and if anything, there is too little of it in the sense that there are cases in which there is inefficient entry. Further, prohibiting below marginal cost pricing may destroy some socially efficient exclusion and worsen the problem of excessive (or inefficient) entry. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By looking at the composition of adjustment, the analysis confirms the pre-crisis consensus - from the perspective of economic growth and competitiveness, expenditure-based consolidations are superior to consolidations which are based on raising revenue. The mechanisms behind this outcome are examined by comparing the fiscal consolidations in Latvia and Hungary, which represent two different approaches to fiscal consolidation. While Latvia followed the textbook approach, Hungary aimed to save households from the burden of adjustment and stimulate the economy.

The results show evidence of cointegration relationship between the variables of interest, and reveal that economic growth responds positively to trade openness over both the short run and long run. The evidence is robust to using various trade openness measures and to alternative model specifications, suggesting thus the non-fragility of the linkage between economic growth and openness to international trade for the GCC region.

However, in reality, Ul has to be funded through taxation that might be distortionary. In this paper, I analyze the welfare implications of raising funds towards UI benefits through different taxation systems within a directed search model. Since firms direct workers to apply to them by posting wages, raising Ul funds in a lump-sum manner always distorts the efficient allocation, as it gives firms an incentive to be excessively aggressive in their attempt to maximize the probability of filing up their vacancies. I discuss two ways through which this externality can be internalized and efficiency can be restored. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The results indicate a strong but fast-dying habit in leisure, and a somewhat weaker but more persistent habit in consumption. Intratemporal nonseparabilities in consumption and leisure play an important role in driving the response of real variables to a productivity shock. Adding capital adjustment costs to the model with nonseparabilities in consumption and leisure and external habits both in consumption and leisure changes the responses of real variables to a productivity shock, however, in a way similar to that documented for the models with capital adjustment costs and habit formation in consumption. The estimated persistence of the productivity shock is quite modest, which may be the factor that drives a procyclical response of hours worked to the positive productivity shock even when habit in consumption is strong.

Yet, modeling the interplay between communication, expectations and aggregate outcomes remains a challenging task, mainly because this requires deviation from the paradigm of rational expectations and perfect information. While agent-based macro models allow for such a deviation, their representation of expectations dynamics often remains simplistic. This paper introduces an expectation formation model which allows us to integrate a wide range of information disclosed by central banks. This expectation model is then integrated to the macroeconomic ABM developed in Salle et al. 2013 - [Economic Modelling, 2013, 34, 114-1281, and yields aggregate results strongly in line with empirical evidence. In particular, we find that i) opacity is always sub-optimal, giving rise to the so-called opacity bias, ii) communication loosens the trade-off between the two objectives of monetary policy, and iii) forward guidance acts as a partial substitute for policy actions, and softens the optimal policy responses. This expectation model appears therefore promising to develop macroeconomic agent-based models. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There exist three regions in which firms, markets and sequences of bilateral contracts are weakly more efficient than all other mechanisms in a big class.","MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Wernerfelt, B (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,38,12,12,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,APR,2015,82.0,326,,,,,350,367,,10.1111/ecca.12109,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CD0HD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000350750500007,0

A key feature of the model is that competition not only lowers the cost cut-off between the firms that produce and those that exit, but it also raises the scope for quality differentiation. With both these channels present, the most productive firms respond to competition by raising quality, prices, and markups, while the least productive either exit or respond in the exact opposite manner. The model generates a unified theory and a supply-side explanation for an extremely rich set of stylized facts relating to (i) productivity heterogeneity, (ii) product quality heterogeneity, (iii) markups heterogeneity, (iv) heterogeneity in the response of firms to competition, and (v) heterogeneity in the sign and magnitude of the correlations between output prices, firm productivity, size, and product quality. In addition, the model predicts that average price and markups exhibit a U-shape response to competition and that imports from developed countries have higher quality, markups and prices when compared to imports from developing countries.

The unprecedented quantitative easing policies of advanced countries after the global financial crisis have presented serious financial stability concerns for most emerging countries including Turkey. To cope with these challenges, Turkey has devised new policy tools such as asymmetric interest rate corridor and reserve option mechanism. From the perspective of capital flows, the interest rate corridor works mainly through stabilizing supply of foreign funds, and the reserve option mechanism through decreasing the sensitivity of equilibrium exchange rate to shifts in the demand for foreign funds. Using a large panel of 46 countries and employing [Bruno and Shin (2013a). Capital flows, cross-border banking and Global liquidity. Working paper, Princeton university; Bruno and Shin (2013b). Assessing macroprudential policies: Case of Korea. Working paper, Princeton university] methodology, we investigate whether the new policy framework in Turkey has been successful in cushioning the economy from volatile cross-border capital flows from a comparative perspective. The results show that, after controlling for a set of domestic and external variables and relative to a group of advanced and emerging countries, cross-border capital flows to Turkey have been less sensitive to global factors after the implementation of macroprudential policies.","[Aysan, Ahmet Faruk; Fendoglu, Salih; Kilinc, Mustafa] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Aysan, AF (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey.",ahmet.aysan@tcmb.gov.tr; salih.fendoglu@tcmb.gov.tr; mustafa.kilinc@tcmb.gov.tr,"Kilinc, Mustafa/IQV-6679-2023; Aysan, Ahmet/ABD-9167-2021","Aysan, Ahmet/0000-0001-7363-0116; Kilinc, Mustafa/0009-0008-4830-3832",,,,,36,15,15,4,40,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We study mechanisms for selling identical items when the total supply is unknown but is drawn from a known distribution.

We devise a simple incentive-compatible mechanism that guarantees some constant fraction of the first-best solution. A surprising feature of our mechanism is that it artificially limits supply, and we show that limiting the supply is essential for obtaining high social welfare. Although common when maximizing revenue, commitment to limit the supply is less intuitive when maximizing social welfare.

We show that firms' ability to sell consumer information can lead to lower prices, higher screening intensities, and increased social welfare. By exploiting variations in the adoption of local financial-privacy ordinances in five California Bay Area counties, we are able to provide simple estimates of the effects of stricter financial-privacy laws on mortgage denial rates during 2001-2006. Consistent with the model's predictions, denial rates for home-purchase loans and refinancing loans decreased in counties where opt-in privacy ordinances were adopted.

Items are identical, but have different expiration times, and each item must be allocated before it expires. Buyers are of dynamic nature, and arrive and depart over time. Our goal is to design mechanisms that maximize the social welfare. We begin by showing that dominant-strategy incentive-compatibility cannot be used in this case, since any such auction cannot obtain any constant fraction of the optimal social welfare. We then design two auctions that perform well under a wide class of semi-myopic strategies. For every combination of such strategies, the auction is associated with a different algorithm (or allocation rule), and so we have a family of semi-myopic algorithms. We show that any algorithm in this family obtains at least 1/3 of the optimal social welfare. We also provide some game-theoretic justification for acting in a semi-myopic way.

This study evaluates the impacts of a BDS program serving female microentrepreneurs in Lima using an experimental design, that included two treatment groups: One received only general training (GT), albeit more time-intense than previous studies, and delivered by experts, while the other received in addition technical assistance (TA). Results show the existence of room for efficiency gains and growth, as all treated showed increased sales revenues and self-reported adoption of recommended business practices. Those that received only GT showed positive but not significant effects early on, but the two treatment groups showed indistinguishable growth, above 15%, two years after the end of the treatment. Low take up of the training may suggest some space to improve recruitment and delivery of treatments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Agents differ across two dimensions: age and productivity in learning. Our results show that individuals invest more in human capital during economic downturns. However, human capital accumulation is more counter-cyclical for young and low-productivity individuals because they face a lower opportunity cost of education and a higher marginal product of human capital. These results are confirmed empirically using US data from the Current Population Survey and the American Time Use Survey. In addition, the paper contributes to the RBC literature by showing that the model's business cycle properties, in particular hours worked volatility, are sensitive to assumptions of heterogeneity. Introducing heterogeneity in productivity increases the volatility of aggregate hours worked and changes the life-cycle profile for hours volatility to better match the data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Our experiment is to restrict preference parameters in order to as well as possible match some asset-price facts the average returns on equity and a short-term risk-free bond and then compute the welfare benefits of removing all consumption fluctuations given those parameters.

We show that high current ship earnings are associated with high used ship prices and heightened industry investment in new ships, but forecast low future returns. We propose and estimate a behavioral model of industry cycles that can account for the evidence. In our model, firms overextrapolate exogenous demand shocks and partially neglect the endogenous investment response of their competitors. As a result, firms overpay for ships and overinvest in booms and are disappointed by the subsequent low returns.

We strip the concept of leadership down to its most basic elements. Questions of style and evaluations of a leader based on style of leadership adopted are made irrelevant. Our leader is an average player who is distinguished merely by occupying the leadership position. Legitimacy is conferred on the leader by the special information possessed. Followers voluntarily choose whether or not to follow the better-informed leader. The effectiveness of the leader is reduced to two simple factors: is the leader willing or not to voluntarily place him/herself in a vulnerable position to achieve an outcome beneficial to both the leader and his/her followers? Do followers trust their leaders to make the right choice? We provide experimental evidence that female leaders and followers are more cooperative than the males in most circumstances. Female leaders show a hesitation to lead in mixed-gender environments with gender signalling in circumstances where followers' refusal to follow can significantly hurt them.

We then apply this framework to analyze firms' production and export performances along the value chain and document the following patterns: (I). Both start-up capital stock and the annual investment expenses are higher for upstream firms, which makes the upstream firms more capital intensive. (2). Both productivity and profitability are higher for these upstream firms. (3). Counter-intuitively, the underdeveloped provinces, which are often thought to be more labor-abundant, are concentrated in the capital-intensive upstream industries.

In this regard, the focus is on the development of financial intermediation by banks, considering the fact that the banking sector plays an important role in Serbian financial system. The empirical research is based on quarterly data for the period Q1 2004-Q4 2011 by using Toda-Yamamoto causality test. Our empirical findings suggest that process of economic growth contributes to process of financial deepening. On the other hand, the results indicate that there is a significant unidirectional causality that runs from both private enterprise credit to GDP and household credit to GDP to economic growth. Bidirectional causal relation is confirmed only between the share of bank credit to nonfinancial private sector in total domestic credit and economic growth rate.","[Obradovic, Sasa; Grbic, Milka] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Macroecon, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Obradovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Macroecon, Djure Pucara 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",sobradovic@kg.ac.rs; mgrbic@kg.ac.rs,"Obradovic, Sasa/A-6998-2010","Obradovic, Sasa/0000-0001-9918-7271; Grbic, Milka/0000-0001-9839-1166","Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [179015, 41010]","Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This paper is a part of Research Projects No. 179015 and No. 41010 financed by the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia.,,37,7,7,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The main empirical result of the paper is that the Great Moderation has diversely affected macroeconomic volatility at different horizons (short-run, business-cycle, and medium-run). I refer to this phenomenon as the heterogeneous Great Moderation across frequencies. I formally test these findings by defining a frequency domain structural break test that detects the presence of a break in the variance of real macroeconomic variables at different frequencies. I derive its asymptotic and small sample properties, and I apply it to U.S. macroeconomic variables to provide statistical evidence that the Great Moderation is mainly confined to short-run fluctuations. I finally use a DSGE model to investigate which elements of the model can generate the heterogeneous Great Moderation. I find that, whereas just a decline of the magnitude of the shocks and a change in the monetary policy cannot replicate the stylized facts, accounting for the increased persistence of the exogenous disturbances is the key feature for generating the heterogeneous Great Moderation.

At the country specific level, the findings of this study provide robust empirical evidence indicating that higher revealed trade openness is not the main engine explaining the Asian economic-growth miracle. In particular, the authors find that physical capital accumulation is at the core of the observed long-run output per worker growth. At the regional level, the authors observe a marked difference between the pre and post 1997-1998 financial crisis, whereas, in the post period, trade openness has a positive and significant effect on output growth. In general, the results from the dynamic estimations prove that the conventional OLS static estimates underestimate the effect of investment on output growth. In addition, the dynamic model allows for a separation of gains from trade between short term and long term. The paper results also provide evidence in support of the idea that, countries with a growing degree of trade openness may experience faster per-capita output growth through gains in productivity associated to capital accumulation, rather than the assumed technological spillover effects from the trading sector. Again, at the regional level in the post financial crisis period both short term and long term gains from trade are relevant to growth. Why more trade does not necessarily imply faster growth at all levels of revealed trade openness growth, remains a conundrum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Based on more than 12,000 observations over 20 years (1992-2012), our results reveal a nonmonotonic association. In particular, relatively less powerful CEOs exhibit risk aversion, resulting in less risky strategies. However, when the CEO has his power consolidated beyond a certain point, he is less likely to compromise with other executives, leading to less moderate decisions and more risky strategies. We estimate that the CEO has to wield considerable power, that is, around the 75th percentile of CPS, before significantly more risk-taking is observed. Finally, we show that our results are unlikely vulnerable to endogeneity.","[Chintrakarn, Pandej] Mahidol Univ Int Coll, Nakhon Prathom, Thailand; [Jiraporn, Pornsit] Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA; [Tong, Shenghui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Mahidol University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Jiraporn, P (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Great Valley Sch Grad Profess Studies, Malvern, PA 19355 USA.",pxj11@psu.edu,,,,,,,13,17,18,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Further, considering the interactive effects between globalization and economic growth, we show that in the period of higher global integration, the higher democracy (lower autocracy) may harm economic growth in the case of China.

Latvia has taken strong competitive positions in the industry of raw materials; Estonia also has medium comparative advantage in the industry of raw materials, while Lithuania has the comparative advantage in the industries of mineral fuels, lubricants and related materials. Export competitiveness index (XCI) results showed that all three Baltic States had growing competitive advantage in the industries of food, drinks and tobacco during both the period of economic recession and the period of economic revival. In the period of economic revival Estonia showed the growth potential in the industries of chemicals and related products, while Lithuania - in the industry of raw materials and related products. The identification of competitive industries during the periods of economic recession and revival can provide the governments of the Baltic States with the target data not only for supporting export companies, but also for taking the best decisions to improve the business environment in the industries that have the competitive advantage.","[Remeikiene, Rita; Startiene, Grazina; Dumciuviene, Daiva] Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Remeikiene, R (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Laisves Al 55, Kaunas, Lithuania.",rita.remeikiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,36,5,5,0,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Motivated by the heated debate on the financialization of commodities, we examine the existence of herding behaviour in metal commodities futures. In order to identify any time-dependent properties reflected in time-varying parameters, we employ the overlapping rolling window regression technique. The empirical evidence confirms a time-varying anti-herding behaviour before the global financial crisis and the absence of herding or anti-herding behaviour during the crisis. Next we attempt to formally establish the link between the documented anti-herding behaviour and portfolio management with the use of dynamic conditional correlations via the DCC-GARCH family multivariate modelling. After specifying the correlations, an in-sample recursive dynamic Markowitz portfolio is constructed and monitored. By doing so, we attribute the anti-herding behaviour to different portfolio positioning and rebalancing.

The results show that the selected macroeconomic indicators (wages, interest rate, stock exchange index-CROBEX, availability of loans and unemployment rate) do not influence the housing savings market dynamics. Moreover, the housing savings system proves to be resilient to economic downturn. On the other hand, the findings are that the system primarily depends on government incentives (GI) (premiums), as confirmed by the intervention analysis. Each of the three interventions in the structure of incentives (reductions in 2005 and 2013 and the decision to freeze the payment of premiums for 2014) resulted in a significant decline in the number of new housing savings contracts. Since the findings differ from empirical research on determinants of private savings, this article emphasises that housing savings are a specific financial product, very sensitive to institutional changes. Therefore, frequent regulatory modifications, especially regarding government incentives, can easily destabilise the whole system.","[Badun, Marijana; Franic, Josip] Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Badun, M (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Zagreb, Croatia.",marijana.badjun@ijf.hr,"Franic, Josip/R-5390-2016; Badjun, Marijana/R-5837-2016","Franic, Josip/0000-0002-5383-1735; Badjun, Marijana/0000-0001-9645-1540",HPB stambena stedionica; PBZ stambena stedionica; Prva stambena stedionica; Raiffeisen stambena stedionica; Wustenrot stambena stedionica,HPB stambena stedionica; PBZ stambena stedionica; Prva stambena stedionica; Raiffeisen stambena stedionica; Wustenrot stambena stedionica,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments and suggestions.

The methodology is applied to quarterly aggregate time series data for Tunisia (1980-2007), applying the same increasing, multi-step pricing scheme in the whole country. First, a seasonal cointegration analysis demonstrates the relevance of a pricing policy that increases the size of the lower consumption block in summer. Second, the nonseasonal cointegration analysis reveals a relatively high price elasticity for the highest consumption block. Therefore, we also propose to increase the tariff progressivity to promote water savings. This modified pricing scheme will help to achieve goals of environmental protection and social equity.","[Ben Zaied, Younes; Binet, Marie Estelle] Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, CNRS, CREM,UMR6211, F-35065 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Binet, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes 1, Fac Econ, CNRS, CREM,UMR6211, 7 Pl Hoche, F-35065 Rennes, France.",marie-estelle.binet@univ-rennes1.fr,,"BEN ZAIED, Younes/0000-0003-4366-3990",,,,,29,10,12,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Households whose joint labor income risk is reduced more by marriage have a higher increase in their exposure to risky assets in marriage.

The MS-DR allows multiple structural breaks in the estimation, and we can check regression coefficients separately in the recession and expansion periods. We selected two major developing countries (Mexico and South Africa) in order to reduce location bias. We use real stock returns, expected inflation, unexpected inflation, and real GDP growth in the estimations, and the ARFIMA model is used for unexpected inflation. The empirical results show that the relationship between real stock returns and inflation is negative only in the recession period. This regime-dependency is also tested with Eugene F. Fama's (1981) proxy effect hypothesis, and it is found that the stock returns respond differently to inflation in a regime according to the regime-dependent proxy effect hypothesis.

Based on the outcomes of a questionnaire completed by a sample of 411 household primary shoppers from a transitional country in the Southeast Europe region, we developed three models that depict the predictive power of attitudes, perceived behavioural control and subjective norms, and confirmed a significant positive relationship between green food purchasing intention and all three antecedents. Furthermore, regression analysis revealed two important theoretical insights: (1) descriptive norms represent statistically significant predictors of green food purchase behaviour; and (2) incorporating both social and descriptive norms increases the variance explained in intention. The latter also empirically proves that the meaning behind the two variables (social and descriptive norms) is different. These results contribute to the strengthening of the theory of planned behaviour in the part which has so far been referred to as the weakest link.","[Ham, Marija; Jeger, Marina; Ivkovic, Anita Frajman] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ, Fac Econ, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ham, M (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ, Fac Econ, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",mham@efos.hr,"Stanić, Marina/ABG-1001-2021; Ham, Marija/AAC-3577-2022","Stanić, Marina/0000-0002-3835-6358; Ham, Marija/0000-0003-4390-2218",,,,,36,178,203,5,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The key feature is the endogenous evolution of the risk as a consequence of policy changes. We calibrate the model to empirical evidence from Italy and then compare the effect of different policies on the equilibrium quantity of prostitution and on the harm associated with it. A prohibition regime that makes it illegal to buy sex but not to sell it is more effective than the opposite regime in reducing quantity. Taxes are one inducement to go illegal and prevent some of the less risky individuals from joining the market, leaving it smaller but riskier. A licensing system that prevents some infected individuals from joining the legal market reduces the risk and is therefore associated with an increase in quantity. Prohibition is preferable to minimize quantity only if a high expected fine is feasible. Regulation is best to minimize harm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Russo, F.

Unlike previous studies, we applied different parametric and nonparametric tests to investigate efficiency in the short and long horizons. Using recent data over the period May 2002-June 2012, we developed a time-series analysis of Islamic stock price dynamics in the context of the recent global financial crisis (2008-2009). Our analysis offers two interesting results. First, emerging Islamic stock markets seem to be less efficient than developed Islamic markets, suggesting interesting investment opportunities and diversification benefits from this region in both the short run and the long run. Second, nonrejection of the cointegration hypothesis for developed Islamic markets and the global conventional stock market point to efficiency for the former in the long term, even if it is inefficient in the short term. This finding has at least two economic and political implications: (i) investors who seek moderate risk would do well to opt for Islamic funds in developed countries, particularly as they share the same tendency and provide similar expected returns in the long term as conventional funds, (ii) Islamic financial systems can offer a useful model that can help to reform and remodel conventional financial institutions.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry, Evry, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] IPAG LAB, IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry, Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,31,32,37,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The experience gained from more than 1.000 implementations of ICS in European companies has been utilized to derive a standard set of 15 IC factors according to the common categorization into Human Capital, Structural Capital and Relational Capital, which is stable and mainly applicable on the company-level. Since the concept of IC on the company level has been established, first investigations have started to come up with different concepts of IC and ICS on the regional level. These concepts show that both, the definition of IC and the procedure for implementing ICS on the regional level, are not adequately investigated yet though. Therefore, the requirement is to develop and test a stable regional IC concept, meaning a suitable definition of IC and an adjusted procedure for implementing ICS on the regional level. Against this background, the paper at hand seeks to illustrate a conceptual framework for determining and measuring IC on different actor levels (micro, meso and macro level). The illustration of the conceptual framework is based on a literature review of four different regional IC concepts from Germany and of further existing Intellectual Capital concepts on regional and national level. The findings indicate that the definition of IC and the procedure of implementing ICS on the regional level are not adequately investigated yet and an adapted procedure with a balanced combination of quantitative measurement and qualitative assessment of IC is required. The paper introduces a preliminary set of harmonized IC success factors for regions based on a recent survey and workshop with more than 65 representatives from the local and regional level in Germany carried out in September 2014. Furthermore, the paper discusses possible approaches of procedures for implementing Intellectual Capital Statements on the regional level, which is and will be investigated further on in current and planned research projects.","[Kohl, Holger; Wuscher, Sven; Orth, Ronald; Steinhoefel, Erik] Fraunhofer IPK, Div Corp Management, Berlin, Germany",,"Kohl, H (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer IPK, Div Corp Management, Berlin, Germany.",holger.kohl@ipk.fraunhofer.de; sven.wuscher@ipk.fraunhofer.de; ronald.orth@ipk.fraunhofer.de; erik.steinhoefel@ipk.fraunhofer.de,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,189,198,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600023,0

The company/corporation is constituted in a manner that is a hybrid of other forms of positioning.

The underlying psychological bias thought to drive this fallacy is Representativeness Bias: the idea that even a small sample of outcomes should closely reflect the theoretical probability distribution (Tversky and Kahneman, 1971). Yet representativeness also has less commonly explored consequences in the cross-sectional dimension. We find strong evidence for this in lottery play where probabilities are well-defined and transparent, using a dataset of over 1.6 million lottery tickets purchased by over 28,000 players. Specifically, individuals prefer number combinations that are cross-sectionally representative of the uniform distribution from which they are drawn. We test two possible approaches to implementing representativeness; a heuristic 3-bin approach which is promoted in some gambling advice literature, and a direct optimization approach in which gamblers try to spread the numbers in the chosen set as evenly as possible across the lottery number range. By both measures, gamblers over-gravitated to highly representative lottery number sets and over-avoided less representative sets, compared to the proportions that the true lottery odds would suggest. In this pari-mutuel lottery setting, a cost is incurred by gamblers with this type of bias, by reducing their expected winnings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we trace whether overestimating one's own technical and financial abilities can hinder the willingness to seek advice, particularly when it would be in the investors' best interest to do so. We identify a subset of investors who are not knowledgeable and yet do not seek advice. These investors exhibit overconfidence in their ability to manage a fund, despite holding under-diversified and less sophisticated portfolios relative to their peers. Given the global rise in investors choosing to manage their own retirement funds and the importance of seeking advice in this context, there are direct policy implications from these results. They suggest a need to identify and target investors who display overconfidence since they are most likely to be managing underperforming retirement investments in the longer term.","[Mihaylov, George; Yawson, Alfred; Zurbruegg, Ralf] Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Mihaylov, G (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Business, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",george.mihaylov@adelaide.edu.au,,"Mihaylov, George/0000-0001-8146-7881",Australian Research Council [LP100100212]; SPAA; Australian Research Council [LP100100212] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); SPAA; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The authors wish to thank the Australian Research Council [grant number LP100100212] and SPAA for financial support enabling this research.,,28,3,5,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

An explanatory model of the phenomenon under study is proposed considering various institutional factors (market barriers, duration of procedure, government programs, access to credit, freedom of corruption, domestic demand), which is estimated by Feasible Generalized Least Squares.

More concretely, the concept of intellectual capital is composed of several types of capital, such as human, structural, and relational capital, which are related to the principal core competencies of an organization. In this research, we focus on human capital, which is directly linked to intellectual capital assets and performance in organizations (Marimuthu et al, 2009). Thus, the development of human capital is positively influenced by the educational level of employees, their skills, knowledge, their know-how and their overall satisfaction (Marimuthu et al, 2009), aspects that are collected by the two types of human capital: valuable human capital and firm-specific human capital. On the one hand, valuable human capital embraces abilities, knowledge and skills of employees that fit with the organization, as well as every training activity with the aim of improving competitiveness and productivity in employees. On the other hand, firm-specific human capital emphasizes the unique routines and procedures that have limited value outside the firm in which the capital base has been developed, as a consequence of deep training and experience. We contextualize this research in the EFQM Model of Excellence, emphasizing the task of human capital in it. The role of the personnel function, measured by the People criterion of the model, on the consecution of improvements on organizational performance is tested in this paper. Moreover, it is examined and concluded that intellectual human capital allows organizations to obtain competitive advantages through the application of human capital practices. For this purpose, the paper bases its empirical evidence on a cross-sectional design of a sample of 200 medium-sized Spanish organizations. The results show how the People criterion of the EFQM model can help in order to improve organizational results through intellectual capital.","[Para-Gonzalez, Lorena] Spanish Air Force Acad, Univ Ctr Def, Business Management Area, Murcia, Spain; [Jimenez-Jimenez, Daniel] Univ Murcia, Fac Business, Dept Management & Finances, Murcia, Spain; [Rafael Martinez-Lorente, Angel] Tech Univ Cartagena, Fac Business, Business Econ Dept, Cartagena, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena,"Para-González, L (通讯作者)，Spanish Air Force Acad, Univ Ctr Def, Business Management Area, Murcia, Spain.",lorena.para@cud.upct.es; danieljj@um.es; angel.martinez@upct.es,"PARA-GONZÁLEZ, LORENA/AFL-8304-2022; Martinez-Lorente, Angel R./ABF-4375-2020","PARA-GONZÁLEZ, LORENA/0000-0003-1873-4937;",,,,,26,3,3,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,253,261,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600030,0

However, the reverse effect has been neglected. This paper tests whether more financial services and opportunities in the home country attract remittances to developing countries. It addresses this hypothesis using a dataset of 72 developing countries over the period 1997-2011. The paper finds evidence that remittance inflows are driven by increased availability of domestic financial services. In particular, the presence of microfinance institutions is found to be a key driver in stimulating migrant remittances. These findings, perhaps, suggest that remittance-sending migrants may not be altruistic and send remittances to maximize their own future income. Alternatively, the results suggest that microfinance organizations have been successful in attracting remittances by lowering transaction costs and proving linked services.","RMIT Univ, Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Posso, A (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Econ, 445 Swanston St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",alberto.posso@rmit.edu.au,,"Posso, Alberto/0000-0003-4226-7072",,,,,23,4,4,1,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Biodiesel has been mostly produced in European countries, but the agronomic potential of the Latin-American countries has led the effort toward the biodiesel production, via regulations. This is the case of Colombia, where the oil palm has been exploited as the major biodiesel feedstock. The acts, laws and regulations indicate the mandatory expansion of biodiesel usage. Nonetheless, the laws do not explain the way in that those expansion targets will be done. In this work, the optimal conditions of the supply chain biodiesel were studied via the techno-economic and environmental analysis. Using logistic restrictions, environmental assessment and cost minimization (all of them were estimated in this work), the optimal expansion conditions were decided, taking into account the minimal emissions and the effect of the Land Use Change (LUC) for the oil palm crop expansion.

After the international financial crisis, the positive view of the role of credit risk transfer has changed and credit derivatives have been blamed as one of the responsible of the subprime credit crisis. Our purpose is to analyze whether the risk taken by European banks is affected by the use of credit derivatives. There are very few empirical works regarding this subjec and, in particular, in the European banking sector. We use as measures of risk the Z-score and other proxies of credit risk like the risk-weighted assets and non-performing loans (NPL) ratio. In summary, our results show that European banks that use credit derivatives for hedging experience an improvement in their level of financial stability, while those who opt for a speculative position test negative. Accordingly and based on these data, the cause of the current crisis in Europe could not be directly attributed to the use of credit derivatives.","[Rodriguez Gil, Luis Ignacio; Otero Gonzalez, Luis; Cantorna Agra, Sara; Duran Santomil, Pablo] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"Gil, LIR (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Santiago De Compostela, Spain.",luisignacio.rodriguez@usc.es; luis.otero@usc.es; sara.cantorna@usc.es; pablo.duran@usc.es,"DURAN SANTOMIL, PABLO/U-8352-2018; /F-2087-2015","DURAN SANTOMIL, PABLO/0000-0002-8231-6425; Rodriguez Gil, Luis Ignacio/0000-0002-0852-2212; /0000-0002-8214-6227",,,,,41,3,3,0,19,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

However, fiscal developments in many advanced economies were already on an unsustainable path even before the financial crisis. The lesson to be learnt from the crisis is how quickly the government debt can change from sustainable to unsustainable, thereby causing sovereign risk to materialise. The variation of debt in a given year depends on the amount of debt from the previous year, the implicit interest rate at which the country pays the debt and the primary government balance. Presently, sustainable fiscal policies should be targeting a surplus of the primary balance which would cover the cost of service of the existing stock of public debt. At first sight, the Czech fiscal situation for both balance and debt is currently considered as sustainable. However, there are many challenges for the long-term sustainability of Czech public finance. A higher than present level of indebtedness could easily become risky as any unanticipated adverse events could lead to its further sharp increase, quickly turning apparently sustainable fiscal position into unsustainable one. Seen from the prospective of confidence of the financial market into the stability of public finance, the sooner structural reforms, especially those aimed at addressing the ageing population issue are launched the better.","[Stepanek, Pavel; Zamrazilova, Eva] Czech Banking Assoc, Vodickova 30, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic",,"Stepánek, P (通讯作者)，Czech Banking Assoc, Vodickova 30, Prague 11000 1, Czech Republic.",zamrazilova@czech-ba.cz,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,1,NEWTON COLL AS,PRAHA 1,"POLITICKYCH VEZNU 10, PRAHA 1, 110 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87325-05-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,127,137,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3UF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380582800011,0

The main result of the article is a characterization of the allocations that can be implemented as equilibria in our contracting game. We then restrict attention to exclusive-contracting environments, in which the agent may select the contract of at most one principal. In this setting, our characterization result implies that principals can collude to implement the monopolist outcome. Finally, in general, equilibrium contracts turn out to be incomplete.

The paper aims at contributing to the literature by utilizing a recently constructed political regime data set and controlling for income inequality, a key variable that has not received substantial attention in the context of political regimes, economic growth and military expenditures. Covering a large set of countries and an extended time period, the paper reveals further evidence on the linkage between democracy and military expenditures. Our results yield two crucial facts. First, social democratic political regimes have a tendency to spend less on armaments as a share of the national income; compared to social democracy, all other political regimes are likely to have higher military burdens, confirming previous findings of the negative relationship between level of democracy and military burden. Second, the analysis shows that a higher income inequality is associated with a higher military burden. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use the vector Markov-switching model of Hamilton and Lin (1996) to analyse the technology stockholdings of 115 large institutional investors from 1980 to 2012. By imposing different restrictions on the elements of the transition probability matrix, we are able to test for various lead/lag scenarios that might have existed between the technology stockholding of each investor and that of the residual market. We find that only 17.4% of the investors in our sample herded during the dot-com bubble. Thus, during the dot-com bubble, herding among large institutional investors was not an especially widespread phenomenon. Among those investors that herded, 80% herded during the run-up, 10% during the collapse and 10% during both phases of the dot-com bubble. About 23% of all investors in our sample exited from the technology sector before the bubble collapsed.

Congestion management in the transmission network is of crucial importance for the efficiency of these inter-linkages. Different regulatory designs have been suggested, analyzed and followed, such as uniform zonal pricing with redispatch or nodal pricing. However, the literature has either focused on the short-term efficiency of congestion management or specific issues of timing investments. In contrast, this paper presents a generalized and flexible economic modeling framework based on a decomposed inter-temporal equilibrium model including generation, transmission, as well as their inter-linkages. The model covers short-run operation and long-run investments and hence, allows to analyze short and long-term efficiency of different congestion management designs that vary with respect to the definition of market areas, the regulation and organization of TSOs, the way of managing congestion besides grid expansion, and the type of cross-border capacity allocation. We are able to identify and isolate implicit frictions and sources of inefficiencies in the different regulatory designs, and to provide a comparative analysis including a benchmark against a first-best welfare-optimal result. To demonstrate the applicability of our framework, we calibrate and numerically solve our model for a detailed representation of the Central Western European (CWE) region, consisting of 70 nodes and 174 power lines. Analyzing six different congestion management designs until 2030, we show that compared to the first-best benchmark, i.e., nodal pricing, inefficiencies of up to 4.6% arise. Inefficiencies are mainly driven by the approach of determining cross-border capacities as well as the coordination of transmission system operators' activities.","[Hagspiel, Simeon] Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany; [Bertsch, Joachim; Just, Lisa] Ewi Energy Res & Scenarios gGmbH, Vogelsanger Str 321a, D-50827 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hagspiel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Dept Econ, Univ Str 22a, D-50937 Cologne, Germany.",simeon.hagspiel@uni-koeln.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy based on ruling of the Deutsche Bundestag; German research society DFG [HO 5108/2-1]; [03ESP239],German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy based on ruling of the Deutsche Bundestag; German research society DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG));,"We thank Felix Hoffler for helpful comments, as well as Tom Brown and Energy-nautics for their cooperation to realize the large-scale application.

We exploit the panel dimension of our data and distinguish between individual-specific and time-specific factors. On the basis of 21 technology, infrastructure, and institutional indicators from 82 countries over a 19-year period (1990 to 2008), we construct summary indicators of each of these three components in the cross-sectional dimension and an overall indicator of all 21 indicators in the time-series dimension and estimate their effects on growth and international differences in GDP per capita. For most countries, more than 50% of GDP per capita is explained by the four common factors we have introduced. Infrastructure is the greatest contributor to total factor productivity, followed by technology and institutions.","[Bresson, Georges] Univ Paris 02, Paris, France; [Bresson, Georges] Sorbonne Univ, Paris, France; [Etienne, Jean-Michel] Univ Paris Sud 11, Paris, France; [Mohnen, Pierre] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Universite Paris-Pantheon-Assas; Sorbonne Universite; Universite Paris Saclay; Maastricht University,"Mohnen, P (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",mohnen@merit.unu.edu,"Mohnen, Pierre/ACL-4047-2022","Mohnen, Pierre/0000-0002-2289-7379",,,,,37,3,3,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

We work with observable pricing factors and utilize the computationally convenient normalization of Joslin et al. (2013b). This allows us to estimate the model without needing to restrict the parameters driving the market prices of risk. Using data for the U.S. from 1962:Q1 to 2014:Q2, we find that inflation and the output gap account for around 80% of the unconditional forecast error variance of bond yields at the short and medium end of the term structure, while monetary policy shocks account for around 20%. Bond yields respond to macroeconomic shocks only gradually, peaking after about 4 quarters. This is due to sizable monetary policy inertia estimates in our model. At the peak of the response, inflation shocks increase bond yields by more than one-to-one, and output shocks by less than one-to-one, which is consistent with a Taylor type monetary policy rule. Our term premium estimate is strongly counter-cyclical and can capture salient features of the term structure that constitute a puzzle in the expectations hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Motivated by the fact that the labor force participation has changed substantially across OECD countries, this paper revisits the long-run relation by taking account of endogenous labor-force participation. We find that, via the effects on employment, changes in labor market institutions may increase or decrease long-run economic growth. Moreover, depending upon the effects on the labor force and employment, these labor market institutions may increase or decrease unemployment rates in the long run. Thus, changes in labor market institutions lead to a non-monotone relation between long-run economic growth and unemployment that is consistent with the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Due to the fact that high leverage augments systematic risk and accentuates the firm's vulnerability to shocks, debt screening is used to examine the sampled portfolios. As it imposes limits on debt, we examined the impact of such an ethical screening and a risk moderating principle on stock volatility, susceptibility to contagion and the implications for portfolio diversification. Using a vector autoregressive dynamic panel of multi-country framework, systematic risk is analysed by taking into account firm characteristics, country effects, and the heterogeneity across firms, thereby ensuring the robustness of results. Our findings suggest that the systematic risk changes with changes in the capital structure; the Shari'ah-compliant stocks are shown in most cases to carry less risk than conventional stock, while they do not necessarily out-perform in terms of return; during the global financial crisis. We conclude that during the global financial crisis, Islamic compliant stocks demonstrated lower values of systematic risk in the case of `Low Debt' portfolios when comparison to `High Debt' portfolios.

We use the reform as an exogenous policy variation to obtain causal evidence on breastfeeding behavior, applying a difference-in-differences approach. Mothers in particular benefit from the reform especially if they were employed prior to childbirth or if they have a household income above the income threshold of the previous parental leave scheme (treatment group). The reform did not bring significant changes within the first year of a child's life for all other mothers (control group). We draw on representative survey data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study. Three breastfeeding measures are used for the 2004 to 2009 cohorts: (1) breastfeeding at birth; (2) breastfeeding for at least 4 months; and (3) breastfeeding for at least 6 months. We find no effect of the Elterngeld reform on breastfeeding initiation but do observe an effect on breastfeeding duration. Our results are robust over various sensitivity tests, including placebo regressions, the application of matching approaches, and controlling for regional indicators, among others. Thus, our empirical results provide evidence that the reform's goal of allowing parents to spend more time with their children during the first year of life also impacted breastfeeding behavior.","[Kottwitz, Anita; Spiess, C.

Using multiple general measures related to political, economic, and legal environments to assess the soundness of institutional environments, we find that the relation between life insurance and economic growth is negative in the regime with relatively unhealthier institutional environments. However, this significantly negative effect becomes insignificant after a certain level or threshold of institutional quality has been achieved. A generally unhealthy institutional circumstance could deter the growth effect of life insurance sectors. This result might be explained by the problem of moral hazard and adverse selection, the behavior of risk-taking, as well as macroeconomic volatility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These are often used interchangeably since they imply an isomorphic linearized Phillips curve and, if the steady-state is efficient, the same policy conclusions. In this paper we compute time-consistent optimal monetary policy in the benchmark New Keynesian model containing each form of price stickiness using global solution techniques. We find that, due to an offsetting endogenous impact on average markups, the inflation bias problem under Calvo contracts is often significantly greater than under Rotemberg pricing, despite the fact that the former typically exhibits far greater welfare costs of inflation. The nonlinearities inherent in the New Keynesian model are significant and the form of nominal inertia adopted is not innocuous. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Over the past decade, the Chinese government has attempted to use the allocation of construction land and fiscal transfer payments to encourage the industrial development of its underdeveloped areas. This paper shows that this attempt was accompanied by an overall economic slowdown and a decline in resource allocation efficiency, which not only undermines the international competitiveness of China's economy, but also creates an elevated risk of debt. The paper points out that the realization of China's dual goals of efficiency and regional balance will require increased labor mobility rather than a simple increase in the scale of policy driven resource relocation.","[Lu, Ming; Xiang, Kuanhu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, 1954 Huashan Rd,Room 217 Zhongyuan Bldg, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Lu, Ming] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Fudan Univ, Room 1110,1954 Huashan Rd, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Fudan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Xiang, KH (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, 1954 Huashan Rd,Room 217 Zhongyuan Bldg, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",luming1973@sjtu.edu.cn; khxiang@sjtu.edu.cn,,,"National Social Science Funds [13ZD015, 12AZD045]; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [10YJA790126]; National Science Funds [71133004, 71273289]; Fudan Lab for China Development Studies","National Social Science Funds; Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Science Funds; Fudan Lab for China Development Studies","Xiang is the corresponding author.

A better integration in the EU is possible, at least in theory. Also, the negative consequences implicit in the existence of the common currency could be neutralised. However, the basic paradigms of the economic policies to be followed in the EU would have to be radically changed. First, the unconditional fiscal consolidation provisions still in force would have to be repelled.

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to consider the efficiency-default risk paradigm in a comparative setup which includes IBs. Efficiency and default risk are measured using the Stochastic Frontier Approach and distance to default( Merton's model) respectively. The existence of causality/reverse causality between the two is addressed via a panel Vector Auto Regression (VAR) framework. Our analysis shows that the relationship between profit efficiency and default risk banks across the sample, for CBs and for the GCC is such that a decrease in default risk is associated with lower efficiency levels. With the single exception of IBs, the causality from profit efficiency to default risk is inversely related for all categories. For CBs, the trade-off between efficiency and risk is evident. The absence of a trade-off for IBs suggests that efficiency and default risk are plausible early warning indicators of IB instability. These findings could be of relevance to regulators in countries where both banking system co-exist. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, a proper test of Metcalfe's law-or of any of the competing laws-requires correct identification of the type(s) of network effects involved and the relevant market(s). Second, a multi-market setting typically calls for scaled network sizes. Third, controlling for intertemporal changes in network quality may be imperative. Finally, indicators at the individual and aggregate levels should not be mixed. Armed with these insights, I re-examined Madureira et al. (2013)'s results.

The two models are based on two existing initial models (the Black-Scholes (BS) model and the Kou's jump diffusion model) respectively by introducing a skewed generalized t distribution (SGT). Moreover, we use the bipower variation test and the maximum likelihood estimation method to prove the existence of jumps and estimate, parameters, respectively. Further, several GARCH family models with some compouncLreturn distributions are presented to compare with the above novel jump diffusion models on the volatility forecast performance. Two main conclusions are as follows. First, for the asset return distribution describing performance, the results of empirical analysis show that the novel jump diffusion model is more tractable to handle and capture the characteristics of the asymmetric distribution with skewness, excess kurtosis, and heavy tails than the corresponding initial model in financial market.

Using panel data for 29 Chinese provinces over the period 1990-2012, the paper shows that the effects of revenue and expenditure decentralization on economic growth vary across the three main sectors, with the largest impact on the secondary sector. The results also suggest there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the degree of revenue (expenditure) decentralization and the growth of the secondary sector. In addition, slow-growing and fast-growing provinces respond differently to changes in both revenue and expenditure decentralization with greater responses from fast-growing provinces. The responses from fast-growing provinces appear to be nonlinear, indicating that fast-growing provinces benefit from appropriate revenue (expenditure) decentralization, but the effect turns negative as the degree of decentralization becomes excessively high. The study provides a way to reconcile the contradicting evidence found in the literature. In addition, the finding on heterogeneous responses to fiscal decentralization has important policy implications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the same time, energy consumption and the level of pollution in Vietnam has also increased. This article aims to focus on the link between openness to trade and pollution in Vietnam. Due to lack of data, very few existing studies have focused on Vietnam. Using annual data from1980 to 2011 and employing the bounds testing approach to cointegration, based on an autoregressive distributed lagged (ARDL) model, we find that there is a statistically significant long-run relationship amongst pollution, openness to trade, energy consumption and real national income in Vietnam. This conclusion continues to hold when the possibility of a structural break in the relationship is allowed for using the Gregory-Hansen approach to cointegration. Analysis of the cointegration relationship suggests that, in response to any exogenous shock to the system, adjustment back to the long-run equilibrium is very fast.","[Anwar, Sajid; Alexander, W.

In fact, solvency 2 framework has suggested some formulas to evaluate losses and solvency capital using an internal approach. However, these formulas where derived under the assumption of independent losses. Thus, the amount of capital may be inaccurate when losses are dependent, which is the case in practice. The aim of this paper is to investigate temporal dependence structure among claim amounts (losses). For that, a novel model named autoregressive conditional amount (ACA) model handling the dynamic behavior of claim amounts in insurance companies is proposed. Results show that ACA, models allow to predict accurately the future claims. Moreover, a measure of risk namely value at risk (VaR) ACA that could hedge daily dependent losses is provided. By backtesting techniques, empirical results show that the new VaR ACA can efficiently evaluate the coverage amount of risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Various statistical tests have been used on time series, cross section and panel data related to single and groups of countries to validate this hypothesis. In the literature, the validation has always been conducted by using a single equation. However, since both the environment and income variables are endogenous, the estimation of a single equation model when simultaneity exists produces inconsistent and biased estimates. Therefore, we formulate simultaneous two-equation models to investigate the EKC hypothesis for fifty-six countries, using annual panel data from 1990 to 2012, with the end year is determined by data availability for the panel. To make the panel data analysis more homogeneous, we investigate this issue for a three income-based panels (namely, high-, middle-, and low-income panels) given several explanatory variables. Our results indicate that there exists a bidirectional causality between economic growth and pollution emissions in the overall panels. We also find that the relationship is nonlinear and has an inverted U-shape for all the considered panels. Policy implications are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This classification covers approaches ranging from classical economics and political-economic explanations to more innovative explanations linked to behavioral economics. The subsequent part analyzes qualitatively and quantitatively to which extent the Southern European regime may imply a particular relevance of some of the potential reform obstacles classified before. We derive reform ability profiles which quantify several of the reform obstacles (or reform drivers) to compare EU countries in their likely reform predisposition. These profiles confirm particular Southern European weaknesses which tend to reduce the political-economic feasibility of long-term reforms: a low effectiveness in poverty protection, high intertemporal discounting and uncertainty avoidance, a poor information level of the population and deeply shattered trust in national institutions. In a microeconometric analysis based on Eurobarometer survey data, the analysis leaves the highly aggregated level and looks into the individual heterogeneity in reform acceptance. It is shown that several of the reform obstacles identified in theory are also empirically correlated with the individual inclination to accept reforms.","[Heinemann, Friedrich] Heidelberg Univ, ZEW Mannheim, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Grigoriadis, Theocharis] Free Univ Berlin, Garystr 55, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Free University of Berlin,"Heinemann, F (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, ZEW Mannheim, L 7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",heinemann@zew.de,,,FP7-WWW for Europe project,FP7-WWW for Europe project,Financial Support from the FP7-WWW for Europe project is gratefully acknowledged.,,67,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2016,43.0,4,,,SI,,661,691,,10.1007/s10663-016-9342-6,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,EA1SI,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386371800002,0

Then, using a GMM panel data model, regressions are run for each submarket, correlating industry's markups with the aggregate level of activity. The main finding is that low and middle income submarkets present higher average markups and a pro-cyclical behaviour.

Moreover, the relations display differences amongst various firm categories which arise from firm heterogeneity.","[Wang, Xunxiao] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Diao, Xundi] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Elect Informat & Elect Engn, Shanghai 200240, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yixiang] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu 610031, Peoples R China",Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Southwest Jiaotong University,"Wang, XX (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Stat & Management, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",wxxflystar@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Diao, Xundi/0000-0002-7691-7208",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71320107002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),The authors would like to thank the financial support provided by the research project 71320107002 of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.,,13,0,0,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We show that a standard rationale for torture generates two commitment problems. First, the principal would benefit from a commitment to torture a suspect he knows to be innocent. Secondly, the principal would benefit from a commitment to limit the amount of torture faced by the guilty. We analyse a dynamic model of torture in which the credibility of these threats and promises is endogenous. We show that these commitment problems dramatically reduce the value of torture and can even render it completely ineffective. We use our model to address questions such as the effect of enhanced interrogation techniques, rights against indefinite detention, and delegation of torture to specialists.","[Baliga, Sandeep] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Ely, Jeffrey C.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Baliga, S (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Baliga, Sandeep/KCY-3667-2024","Baliga, Sandeep/0009-0000-5709-4253",,,,,30,10,12,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

A calibration exercise suggests that the model is able to account for up to from 50 to about 100 percent of the increase in the share of the high-tech sector observed in the data from 1995 to 2007.

In this model, each financial agent is characterized by its resilience to the interest rate. Above a certain rate the interest due on the firm's financial costs exceeds its earnings and the firm becomes susceptible to failure (ponzi). For the interest rate levels under a certain threshold level, the firm loans are smaller then its earnings and the firm becomes 'hedge.' In this paper, we fit the historical data (2002-2009) on interest rate data into our model, in order to predict the number of the ponzi firms. We compare the prediction with the data taken from a large panel of Italian firms over a period of 9 years. We then use trade credit linkages to discuss the connection between the ponzi density and the network percolation. We find that the 'top-down'-'bottom-up' positive feedback loop accounts for most of the Minsky crisis accelerator dynamics. The peer-to-peer ponzi companies contagion becomes significant only in the last stage of the crisis when the ponzi density is above a critical value. Moreover the ponzi contagion is limited only to the companies that were not dynamic enough to substitute their distressed clients with new ones. In this respect the data support a view in which the success of the economy depends on substituting the static 'supply-network' picture with an interacting dynamic agents one.","[Golo, Natasa; Kelman, Guy; Solomon, Sorin] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, Jerusalem, Israel; [Bree, David S.] Univ Manchester, Sch Comp Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Ussher, Leanne] CUNY Queens Coll, Dept Econ, Flushing, NY 11367 USA; [Lamieri, Marco] Intesa Sanpaolo Spa, Econ Res Dept, Milan, Italy",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Manchester; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY); Intesa Sanpaolo Bank,"Golo, N (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Racah Inst Phys, Jerusalem, Israel.",natasa.golo@gmail.com,,"Ussher, Leanne/0000-0002-2115-3212; Kelman, Guy/0000-0001-8604-3279",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) [INO1100017],Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),"We thank the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), as this work has been performed with their support under Grant ID INO1100017.

New entrants in a smart, connected world face significant new obstacles, starting with the high fixed costs of a more complex product design, embedded technology and multiple layers of new IT infrastructure. As smart, connected products expand an industry's scope and the boundaries of competition, many companies will need to rethink their corporate purpose. As products continue to communicate and collaborate in networks, which are continuously expanding both in number and diversity, many companies will have to re-examine their core mission and value proposition. The authors present an analysis of changes that were initiated by applying new of smart and connected product technologies during creative discussions about disruptive innovation development.

Moreover, experiencing poverty reduces the chances of reemployment. As wage inequality has expanded in recent decades, low-paid employment and in-work poverty have both risen. This study analyzes whether low-pay employment helps people escape the no-pay - low-income trap. Survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel for the period 1995-2012 are used to estimate correlated random-effects probit models on the labor-market and income dynamics. The findings suggest that low-paid employment is especially helpful to exit the no-pay - low-income trap for persons who are long-term unemployed, as well as for those over 40 who have been unemployed for a short period of time. No indications of a low-pay - low-income trap are found.","[Plum, Alexander] Otto von Guericke Univ, Chair Publ Econ, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Plum, A (通讯作者)，Otto von Guericke Univ, Chair Publ Econ, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.",alexander.plum@ovgu.de,"Plum, Alexander/J-7276-2019","Plum, Alexander/0000-0001-7770-7344",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [KN 984/1-1],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, (Grant / Award Number: 'KN 984/1-1').",,61,1,1,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The effects of monetary policy are less powerful in recessions, especially for durables expenditure and business investment. The asymmetry relates to how fast the economy is growing, rather than to the level of resource utilization. There is some evidence that fiscal policy has counteracted monetary policy in recessions but reinforced it in booms. We also find evidence that contractionary policy shocks are more powerful than expansionary shocks, but contractionary shocks have not been more common in booms.

He argued that regulation is best viewed as a branch of public finance in which the power of the state is leveraged to achieve non-competitive outcomes. We develop an indirect test of Posner's theory by specifying the regulator's welfare function as a convex combination of consumer surplus, profits shared with the regulator and profits retained by the regulated firm. The welfare weights cannot be observed directly, but can be inferred from the regulator's behavior in equilibrium. To wit, when the regulator permits the regulated firm to earn positive profits and authorizes higher prices in response to a greater degree of profit sharing this establishes both an upper bound on the consumer surplus weight and a higher weight on shared profits than on profits retained by the regulated firm. Applying this test to the implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act lends support to Posner's theory.","[Weisman, Dennis L.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Kansas State University,"Weisman, DL (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Dept Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",weisman@ksu.edu,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

It argues that whilst FRB advocates recognize the essential endogeneity of the money creation process, they have failed to understand the Post Keynesian and monetary circuitist analyses of endogenous money, which leads them to analytical errors, including: lending activity creates seigniorage privilege for commercial banks; inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon; the inability of distinguishing the actual from the planned supply of bank loans, and money to be spent from money hoarded; and the debt-free money proposition. The paper also argues that an FRB system is likely to exacerbate financial instability for several reasons, including: the obsessive focus on commercial banks, while ignoring non-bank financial intermediaries and shadow banking; a blind fascination for the safety and security of the payment system, with little consideration for the financing needs of capitalist economies; and an inherent deflationary bias. Furthermore, FRB arrangements would soon be undermined by the development of alternative near-moneys. Finally, FRB will nullify the automatic stabilisers of fiscal policy and lead to ade acto dominance of monetary policy and unelected central bankers over fiscal policy and democratic decision making.","[Fontana, Giuseppe; Sawyer, Malcolm] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Benevento, Italy",University of Leeds; University of Sannio,"Sawyer, M (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Econ Div, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",m.c.sawyer@lubs.leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,67,29,30,2,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

If greed is calculated we would expect that cognitive load, which is assumed to reduce the influence of cognitive processes, should affect greed. In this paper we study both charitable giving and the behavior of dictators under high and low cognitive load to test if greed is affected by the load. This is tested in three different dictator game experiments. In the dictator games we use both a give frame, where the dictators are given an amount that they may share with a partner, and a take frame, where dictators may take from an amount initially allocated to the partner. The results from all three experiments show that the behavioral effect in terms of allocated money of the induced load is small if at all existent. At the same time, follow-up questions indicate that the subjects' decisions are more impulsive and less driven by their thoughts under cognitive load.","[Hauge, Karen Evelyn] Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway; [Brekke, Kjell Arne] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, Postboks 1095 Blindern, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Johansson, Lars-Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Psychol, Box 500, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Johansson-Stenman, Olof] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, Box 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Svedsater, Henrik] GlaxoSmithKline, Stockley Pk West,Blg 10 1-3 Iron Bridge Rd, Uxbridge UB11 1BT, Middx, England",University of Oslo; University of Gothenburg; University of Gothenburg; GlaxoSmithKline,"Hauge, KE (通讯作者)，Ragnar Frisch Ctr Econ Res, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",k.e.hauge@frisch.uio.no,,"Johansson-Stenman, Olof/0000-0003-4460-4765","Norwegian Research Council [164393]; Swedish Research Council [421-2010-1420]; Ethics programme at the University of Oslo; Research Council of Norway; Centre for Equality, Social Organization and Performance (ESOP)","Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Ethics programme at the University of Oslo; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Centre for Equality, Social Organization and Performance (ESOP)","Financial support is gratefully acknowledged from the Norwegian Research Council (grant no. 164393), the Swedish Research Council (ref 421-2010-1420) and the Ethics programme at the University of Oslo.

However, the post-crisis adjustment in the EA and the US shows striking differences in particular, the EA slump has been markedly more protracted. We estimate a three-region (EA, US and Rest of World) New Keynesian DSGE model (using quarterly data for 1999-2014) to quantify the drivers of the divergent EA and US adjustment paths. Our results suggest that financial shocks were key drivers of the 2008-09 Great Recession, for both the EA and the US. The post-2009 slump in the EA mainly reflects a combination of adverse aggregate demand and supply shocks, in particular lower productivity growth, and persistent adverse shocks to capital investment, linked to the continuing poor health of the EA financial system. Adverse financial shocks were less persistent for the US. The financial shocks identified by the model are consistent with observed performance indicators of the EA and US banking systems.

Common models to investigate the market outcomes and underlying market structures are games representing competitive markets, strategic Cournot competition and Stackelberg structures that take into account a dominant player acting first followed by one or more players. We add to the literature by expanding the application of mathematical models and applying an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), which is used to model multi-leader-follower games, to a spatial market Using our model, we investigate the prevalent market setting in the international market for metallurgical coal between 2008 and 2010, whose market characteristics provide arguments for a wide variety of market structures. Using different statistical measures to compare model results with actual market outcomes, we find that two previously neglected settings perform best: First, a setting in which the four largest metallurgical coal exporting firms compete against each other as Stackelberg leaders, while the remainders act as Cournot followers.

Moreover, I employ the assumption of monetary search costs and show that it can explain the empirically documented unemployed worker search behavior.

This article identifies and compares the main determinants of the widening and persistent external current account deficits of fifteen European transition countries vis-a-vis the EU-15 countries. It assesses the validity of the intertemporal approach of current account determination through bias-corrected least-squares dummy variable models (using three dynamic panel techniques) and data for thirty European countries during the 1994-2013 period. It concludes that the external accounts of European transition countries have been counter-cyclical and largely driven by faster growth of government consumption and investment as compared to their trading partners. After the outbreak of the global economic crisis, their external accounts improved due to lower private consumption and a significant rise in precautionary savings.","[Stojkov, Aleksandar] Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Iustinianus Primus Fac Law, Blvd Goce Delcev 9B, Skopje 1000, Macedonia; [Warin, Thierry] HEC Montreal, Dept Int Business, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Warin, Thierry] Harvard Univ, Weatherhead Ctr Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; Harvard University,"Stojkov, A (通讯作者)，Ss Cyril & Methodius Univ, Iustinianus Primus Fac Law, Blvd Goce Delcev 9B, Skopje 1000, Macedonia.",a.stojkov@pf.ukim.edu.mk,"Warin, Thierry/G-9409-2016","Warin, Thierry/0000-0002-5921-3428; Stojkov, Aleksandar/0000-0003-3993-6108",,,,,58,1,1,1,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Finally, I establish that the equilibrium effort level expended for each prize and the equilibrium total effort level are determined only by the widest positive valuation spread and the widest negative valuation spread.","[Baik, Kyung Hwan] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Baik, KH (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",khbaik@skku.edu,"Baik, Kyung Hwan/ABE-6007-2021; Baik, Kyung Hwan/IAQ-5601-2023","Baik, Kyung Hwan/0000-0003-3032-9686","Sungkyun Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","Sungkyun Research Fund, Sungkyunkwan University","I am grateful to Chris Baik, Amy Lee, Cheng-Chen Yang, and two anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

We use a mixture of normal approach to decompose the returns into abnormal and control samples. Price suppression is a form of market manipulation of the runs type, where longer negative runs with lower returns than expected would be observed. To explore whether this form of manipulation can be empirically detected the length of runs and the total return observed during a run were computed for modelled abnormal and control clusters in gold and silver. In both metals the proportion of negative runs in the abnormal cluster is greater than the proportion of negative runs in the control cluster. In both cases the average return for negative runs is significantly lower in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster. When average returns over positive runs are compared the abnormal group has significantly higher expected returns than the control group. Given the short maximum run lengths in the abnormal cluster and the fact that positive runs have significantly higher average returns in the abnormal cluster than in the control cluster, it is likely that that the high volatility associated with the abnormal cluster is the driver of the results presented in this study, as opposed to manipulation.

A possible explanation for the observed abrupt changes is offered by the stochastic catastrophe model. This paper addresses the question whether the catastrophe model can describe and predict the dynamics of housing markets. We fit a stochastic cusp catastrophe model to empirical housing market data for six OECD countries, US, JP, UK, NL, SE and BE. Two different estimation approaches are considered - Cobb's method and Euler discretization. The analysis shows that while Cobb's approach describes the long-run stationary density better, Euler discretization is more tailored for time series, as it provides better one-step-ahead predictions. Proceeding using the Euler discretization method we discuss the dynamics, of housing markets in terms of the multiple equilibria cusp catastrophe model. By considering the long-term interest rate as an exogenous variable we obtain new insights into the policy implications of interest rate levels, in particular concerning the stability of housing markets.

Investors' demand is modelled in a well-known asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs. In particular, I generalise the heterogeneous agents model of Brock and Hommes (1998) and Anufriev and Tuinstra (2013) to allow for leverage constraints as well as a short-selling tax. I consider two examples of adaptive belief systems describing the coevolution of prices and investors' beliefs. First, if the market is inhabited by fundamentalist and chartist traders, demand constraints have potential adverse effects and may restrict the stabilising fundamentalist strategy such that mispricing and price volatility increase. Second, if the market is inhabited by fundamentalists, optimists and pessimists with fixed beliefs, demand constraints drive down price volatility, but mispricing remains. The results suggest the stabilising effects of demand constraints in financial markets are limited. Only if asset prices are too high compared to fundamentals, policy makers should consider constraining leverage ratios in order to deflate financial bubbles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The exception is an ideology measure based on the Comparative Manifesto Project (left-right scale): using this measure, the results show that the growth in military expenditure increased by about 2.4 percentage points, when the ideology variable (right-wing) increased by one standard deviation. This effect, however, is based on observations until the early 1960s and cannot be generalized. The major political parties agreed on how to evaluate international risks and threats. Government ideology retired to the background.

However, little is known about the nature of school facility investments, whether it actually changes the physical condition of public schools, and the subsequent causal impacts on student achievement. We study the achievement effects of nearly 1400 capital campaigns initiated and financed by local school districts, comparing districts where school capital bonds were either narrowly approved or defeated by district voters. Overall, we find little evidence that these school capital campaigns improve student achievement. Event-study analysis focused on the students actually affected by large campus renovations also generates very precise zero estimates of achievement effects. Thus, U.S. school capital campaigns financed by local districts - the predominant method through which facility investments are made - may be a limited tool for realizing substantial gains in student achievement or closing achievement gaps.

For the combined panel of 168 major US and Chinese mining firms, we find that, on average, a firm engaging in R&D activities earns 4% to 11% higher sales and generates 4% to 13% more profits than firms that do not engage in R&D activities. We also show that, in the mining industry, firm age moderates the relationship between R&D activities and financial performance. A comparatively mature R&D active firm earns 4.4% more profit and generates 7.2% more sales than a younger non-innovative firm. The turning point at which R&D activities switch from making a negative, to positive, contribution to profit and sales is 37 years and 22 years, respectively. Our results are consistent with the liability of newness, meaning that firm investment in R&D takes time to have a real impact on bottom line measures of financial performance. We conclude with a discussion of the practical implications of our results for Chinese and US mining firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

U-shaped capital taxes always emerge when individuals' political behavior is purely determined by economic motives.","[Scheuer, Florian] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wolitzky, Alexander] MIT, Dept Econ, 50 Mem Dr, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Scheuer, F (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",scheuer@stanford.edu; wolitzky@mit.edu,,,"Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1555071] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,57,17,17,0,44,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

The underlying mechanisms of peer effects are generally under-discussed in existing studies. By investigating diffusion processes in the real world and reviewing previous studies, we find that information transmission, experience sharing and externalities are the basic mechanisms through which peer effects occur. They are termed as information effect, experience effect and externality effect, respectively. The three effects could occur through different types of relationships in a social network. Each of them plays a different role at different stages of a diffusion process. A simulation model incorporating multiple effects in a multiplex network is developed to provide a theoretical study. We simulate the experience effect and the externality effect in a context of rural diffusion. It generates the widely acknowledged patterns of diffusion in various scenarios. The experiments conducted using the model show that peer effects as a whole can be substantially misestimated if the underlying mechanisms are ignored. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

I show that, under informational frictions, a society that targets productive efficiency should subsidize poor agents with ideas, and choose the amount and timing of subsidies carefully in order to ensure that other agents do not mimic poor agents with ideas and receive subsidies.

We compare three approaches for tackling this question: directly asking borrowers how they spend proceeds from a loan (direct elicitation); asking borrowers using a list randomization technique (indirect elicitation) that allows them to answer discretely in cases where loan uses are at odds with lender policies or social norms; and, a counterfactual analysis in which we compare household and enterprise cash outflows for those in a treatment group, randomly assigned to receive credit, to a control group. The counterfactual analysis yields an estimate that about 100% of loan-financed spending is on business inventory. For the direct and indirect elicitations, we find evidence of both strategic misreporting and following the cash: borrowers likely report what they physically did with cash proceeds, rather than counterfactual spending.

Allegedly, the reason is that when business sees that the government balance sheet is improving-and public debt declining-there will be greater confidence in the country's economic prospects, and this increased confidence will lead to higher investment. This in turn will lead to growth and the road to economic recovery. This study examines the impact of government stance on public debt for 11 OECD countries for which data on the relevant factors are available from 1881 to 2011. Contrary to traditional predictions, it turns out that over this long historical span, fiscal contractions deteriorated rather than improved public debt as a percentage of GDP. This implies that fiscal austerity exacerbates the lack of demand and deteriorates rather than enhances the prospects of economic recovery.","[McCausland, W.

The first part is mainly descriptive and focuses on the basic features of the global warming game' characterizing the differences of the cooperative and non-cooperative approaches to deal with this theme. It then presents the most adopted cooperative solution concepts critically analysing their ratio. Furthermore, two alternative solutions, the Rawlsian Nucleolus and a revisited' Nash Bargaining solution are proposed, both based on the concept of Minimum Feasible Core. The second part is dedicated to a numerical exercise based on a standard emissions game in order to compare the mentioned concepts with particular focus on their redistributive properties and on their capability to minimize the potential losses caused by free riding. The Rawlsian Nucleolus is, among the considered solutions, the one with the highest redistributive properties, outperforming, on this regard, the Chander and Tulkens solution that still tends to prioritize polluted countries. The ability of avoiding losses from free riding is shown to be strongly correlated with the redistributive properties of solution concepts till the point that their ranking perfectly coincides.","[Rogna, Marco] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",University of Trento,"Rogna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Trento, Italy.",marco.rogna@unitn.it,,,,,,,48,2,2,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We propose that evolution has produced a 'drive for sense-making' which motivates people to gather, attend to, and process information in a fashion that augments, and complements, autonomous sense-making. A large fraction of autonomous cognitive processes are devoted to making sense of the information we acquire: and they do this by seeking simple descriptions of the world. In some situations, however, autonomous information processing alone is inadequate to transform disparate information into simple representations, in which case, we argue, the drive for sense-making directs our attention and can lead us to seek out additional information. We propose a theoretical model of sense-making and of how it is traded off against other goals. We show that the drive for sense-making can help to make sense of a wide range of disparate phenomena, including curiosity, boredom, 'flow', confirmation bias and information avoidance, esthetics (both in art and in science), why we care about others' beliefs, the importance of narrative and the role of 'the good life' in human decision making.

During the same period, the country also continued the shift to a service economy. By 2005, these two transitions led to a large increase in primary energy use (PEU), followed by a significant decline until 2010. The goal of this paper is to identify the main driving factors of changes in the Portuguese PEU through structural decomposition analysis. To do so we build a novel hybrid model with a detailed description of the energy sector in physical units, and a coarser description of the rest of the economy in monetary units. The results show that the main drivers were final demand (increasing PEU) and the direct energy intensity (decreasing PEU); while the energy and economic transitions also contributed to decrease PEU, although to a lesser extent.","[Guevara, Zeus] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Guevara, Zeus] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Sustainable Energy Syst, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal; [Rodrigues, Joao F.

However, the relationship between decentralization and local-level development dynamics remains unclear. Does decentralization lead to a 'reform dividend' of more rapid development in better-governed regions, with attendant national benefits? What is the impact on spatial inequality? In particular, do poorer regions lag further behind as equalizing fiscal policies at the national level weaken? We address these issues with reference to Indonesia, the world's largest archipelagic nation, which implemented a 'big bang' decentralization program in 2001.

The voluntary participation game consists of two stages: a non-cooperative participation decision followed by Coasian bargaining on public goods provision only among those who choose to participate. Our experimental findings show that, consistent with the theoretical findings of Dixit and Olson, the outcome of this game falls short of full efficiency. However, we find that voluntary participation undermines the Coase Theorem to a lesser extent than predicted by Dixit and Olson, particularly with larger numbers of players.

Inflation volatility is estimated by deploying the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (GARCH) technique. A Granger causality test is then conducted to examine the causality between inflation and inflation volatility. The empirical results obtained are consistent with a number of theoretical propositions. First, the results are consistent with the Friedman-Ball proposition, which states that a rise in inflation raises inflation volatility. Second, there is evidence supporting the Holland proposition that inflation volatility lowers the rate of inflation. This is consistent with the view that central banks attempt to stabilize inflation with the rise in inflation volatility. Third, empirical results obtained by asymmetric GARCH models suggest that inflation shocks have an asymmetric impact on inflation volatility (i.e. a positive inflation shock has a larger impact on inflation volatility - as measured by the logarithm of the conditional variance of inflation - than a negative inflation shock). Fourth, inflation volatility has an adverse impact on economic growth. Finally, given the fixed/pegged or managed float exchange rate system, US inflation has been found to have a positive impact on inflation and its volatility in Thailand. This article discusses the implications of empirical findings on the design and enactment of monetary policy for price stability in Thailand.","[Hossain, Akhand Akhtar; Arwatchanakarn, Popkarn] Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Hossain, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia.",akhtar.hossain@newcastle.edu.au,"Arwatchanakarn, Popkarn/AAH-3632-2021","Arwatchanakarn, Popkarn/0000-0002-9569-9461; hossain, Akhtar/0000-0002-5224-7545",,,,,41,2,2,2,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Furthermore, loan flows exhibit cyclical patterns over the business cycle, which is consistent with prior work in the U.S. and South Korea.

In particular, we compare a dynamic asking price, where the seller adjusts her asking price over time as she fails to sell her property, with a static asking price, where the seller sets an asking price and sticks to it until the property is sold. While we show this comparison to be ambiguous from a theoretical perspective, our empirical study, using a comprehensive dataset of the properties sold in the greater Sydney region in 2011, indicates that properties with a dynamic asking price sold, on average, for approximately 1.9 per cent less than properties with a static asking price.

This difference in the relationship between locus of control and search behavior across treatments cannot be explained by unmeasured skill or effort costs as the search technology and offer distribution do not vary across treatments.

It also follows from Hammond and Sun (Econ Theory 36:303-325, 2008) that the conditional independence assumption is generally satisfied. As an illustrative application, it is shown that any ex ante efficient allocation in an asymmetric information economy with general aggregate uncertainty has a (utility) equivalent allocation that is incentive compatible, which generalizes the corresponding results in Sun and Yannelis (Games Econ Behav 61:131-155, 2007) to the case with infinitely many states.","[Qiao, Lei] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Math, 10 Lower Kent Ridge Rd, Singapore 119076, Singapore; [Sun, Yeneng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore; [Zhang, Zhixiang] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Sun, YN (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Econ, 1 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",a0086330@nus.edu.sg; ynsun@nus.edu.sg; zhangzhixiang@cufe.edu.cn,"liu, shanshan/JPA-0852-2023; SUN, Ye/KBC-8159-2024; Sun, Yeneng/E-4271-2012",,,,,,22,5,7,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The method suggests that for the historical output, inflation and interest rate volatility in the United States over the 1984-2005 period to be generated by any optimal monetary policy with a high probability, the observed interest rate time series should have a 25% larger variance than in the data.","[Ravenna, Federico] HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Ravenna, F (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Appl Econ, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",federico.ravenna@hec.ca,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

We show that the savings subsidy and social security programs can be properly designed to mitigate the adverse effect of succumbing to temptation and release severity of self-control. Moreover, we disentangle the mechanics behind the two fiscal programs and find that the driving forces are quite different. Welfare gains associated with a social security program result mainly from releasing self-control costs. Conversely, welfare gains associated with a savings subsidy program are mainly driven by mitigating inter-temporal allocation distortions. Interestingly, the direction and size of welfare effects vary substantially when general equilibrium channels are in play. Our results have implications for designing an effective temptation control device using fiscal policy. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It examines how entrepreneurs allocate efforts when facing dual-dealing relationships with politicians in a rent-seeking society: entrepreneurs not only pursue additional benefits through rent seeking, but also try to avoid extortions by politicians. Using unique city-level and firm-level data across China, we demonstrate that Chinese entrepreneurs survive in a twisted world: ordinary entrepreneurs would desire better institutional environment, but if institutional improvement is not available, they would prefer political connections which are often preoccupied by special interest groups and/or large-sized firms.

We study a simple two player dynamic game of complete information which incorporates this type of commitment. For a given initial game, the players engage in an endogenously determined number of commitment periods before choosing from the remaining actions. We show the existence of equilibria with pure strategies in the commitment periods. Partial characterization results for general games capture the tradeoff between commitment and deterrence. The equilibrium outcome is unique and efficient for two classes of games, including pure coordination and stag-hunt games. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This is likely among the first of the energy-growth nexus literature to include human capital in the multivariate framework. Using recently developed panel unit root test and cointegration test that allow for cross-sectional dependence, this paper finds a long-run cointegrating relationship between these variables. Continuously-updated fully modified (Cup-FM) estimates are subsequently compared with panel heterogeneous fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) results to confirm the importance of accounting for interdependence across countries. The bootstrap panel Granger causality test results find economic growth Granger cause energy use in the region but the relationship varies for individual countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Individuals have identical preferences but are uncertain about which alternative can better achieve their common interest. Before voting, each individual can obtain information by buying a valuable but imperfect signal about the better alternative. Voting is either voluntary or compulsory. In the compulsory mode, each individual must vote between the two alternatives, while in the voluntary mode they can also abstain. An uninformed, random vote generates a negative externality since it may override an informative group decision in pivotal events. In our experiments, participants in randomly re-matched groups obtain information more often with compulsory than voluntary voting, and the average number of signals is greater in larger than smaller groups. Surprisingly, uninformed voting is common even in the voluntary model Finally, group performance is poor in all treatments, indicating the need to reconsider current practice of jury and committee voting.

In this paper we explore the limitations of this result. We prove that if memory size is costly and players can use mixed automata, then a folk theorem obtains and the set of equilibrium payoffs is once again the set of feasible and individually rational payoffs. Our result emphasizes the role of memory cost and of mixing when players have bounded computational power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

After accepting their respective wholesale contracts, two downstream firms have to pay a fixed cost in order to become active in the downstream market. If the downstream firm with lower marginal cost has significantly higher fixed cost, uniform pricing leads to lower marginal wholesale prices for all downstream firms and thus higher quantities of the final pro duct being produced. This in turn implies that banning price discrimination improves welfare and consumer surplus. If the downstream firm with lower marginal cost has only weakly higher (or even lower) fixed cost, banning price discrimination deteriorates welfare and consumer surplus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Feedback changes in the expected direction. Negative feedback is returned in the event of low offers while higher offers receive positive feedback. Additionally, the possibility of unrestricted feedback significantly increases amounts sent by proposers, but only in the lab. This effect is statistically significant and large in magnitude but is not present in the online experiments. These results illustrate that increases in social distance and/or physical proximity can weaken the effectiveness of non-monetary punishments.","[Johnson, David Blake] Univ Cent Missouri, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Suite 307 F, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA",University Central Missouri,"Johnson, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Missouri, Dept Econ Finance & Mkt, Suite 307 F, Warrensburg, MO 64093 USA.",djohnson@ucmo.edu,,,,,,,52,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2016,69.0,2,,,,,336,368,,10.1111/kykl.12113,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK1VI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374702600006,0

New institutional economics has been examining incentives that drive individuals to bring about market-supporting institutional arrangements. There is, however, an aspect of entrepreneurship conducive to institutional changes that has been neglected by contemporary institutionalist theories and that remains underdeveloped in entrepreneurship research. When and how does entrepreneurship bring about institutional change? I suggest that entrepreneurs are agents of institutional change when cultural categorization is ambiguous with regard to the proper and permissible applications of novel artifacts. Motherhood, for example, used to be a simple category, but surrogacy changed that radically. Examining newspaper evidence, social surveys, statutory law, and judicial cases, I show how entrepreneurs, by provoking a change in interpretation and judgment, challenged the existing institutional legal ordering of procreation turning a technically feasible method of surrogacy into current practice.","[Kuchar, Pavel] Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, DCEA Sede Marfil, Fracc 1, Guanajuato 36250, Gto, Mexico",Universidad de Guanajuato,"Kuchar, P (通讯作者)，Univ Guanajuato, Dept Econ & Finance, DCEA Sede Marfil, Fracc 1, Guanajuato 36250, Gto, Mexico.",pavel.kuchar@ugto.mx,"Kuchar, Pavel/I-5271-2015","Kuchar, Pavel/0000-0003-2794-3175",,,,,91,19,20,3,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We provide a simple framework with a monopoly ISP to evaluate the short-run effects of different net neutrality rules. Content differs in its sensitivity to delay. Content providers can use congestion control techniques to reduce delay for their content, but do not take into account the effect of their decisions on the aggregate volume of traffic. As a result, strict net neutrality often leads to socially inefficient allocation of traffic and traffic inflation. We show that piece-meal departures from net neutrality, such as transmission fees or prioritization based on sensitivity to delay, do not necessarily improve efficiency. However, the ISP implements the efficient allocation when allowed to introduce bandwidth tiering and charge for prioritized delivery. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that housing wealth has a negative impact on consumption, but the link is minor, so fluctuation in the housing market should not create sharp movements in consumption. House price control policies implemented in China may encourage limited spending on other goods. Moreover, we find an asymmetric response of consumption to stock market changes. There is a positive response to upward stock wealth change, but no response to downward stock wealth change. Because the results indicate that stock wealth, housing wealth, and consumption Granger cause one another, the Chinese government could influence the stock market and consumption through control of housing prices; the government could also foster the development of the stock market so as to attract investment out of housing, which would help control housing prices.

However, it is time inconsistent and has no optimal solution in the Ramsey model. By investigating stationary Markov equilibria in the game that generations with Chichilnisky preferences play, this paper shows how, nevertheless, this criterion can be practically implemented in the Ramsey model, leading to attractive consequences. The time-discounted utilitarian optimum is the unique equilibrium path with a high-productive initial stock, implying that the weight on the infinite future in the Chichilnisky criterion plays no role. However, this part of the Chichilnisky criterion may lead to more stock conservation than the time-discounted utilitarian optimum with a low-productive initial stock. Based on the notion of von Neumann-Morgenstern abstract stability, we obtain uniqueness by assuming that each generation coordinates on an almost best equilibrium and takes into account that future generations will do as well.","[Asheim, Geir B.] Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Ekeland, Ivar] Univ Paris 09, CEREMADE, F-75775 Paris, France; [Ekeland, Ivar] Univ Paris 09, Inst Finance, Paris, France",University of Oslo; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Asheim, GB (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",g.b.asheim@econ.uio.no; ekeland@math.ubc.ca,,"Asheim, Geir B./0000-0003-0669-4632",Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme [179552]; Chaire de Developpement Durable; Laboratoire de Finance des Marches de l'Energie at the Universite de Paris-Dauphine,Research Council of Norway through its Centres of Excellence funding scheme(Research Council of Norway); Chaire de Developpement Durable; Laboratoire de Finance des Marches de l'Energie at the Universite de Paris-Dauphine,"The paper builds on Ekeland et al.

Yet, banks in some countries are actively financing SMEs. This paper examines whether this is true in the case of Turkey, a G20 economy that has a significant SME sector. We study the determinants of banks' willingness to finance SMEs and banks' processing ability of SME financing portfolio in Turkey based on a unique quarterly small business panel data set of 40 commercial banks from 2006 to 2014. Employing pooled OLS and fixed-effects estimators, we find that Islamic banks (known as Participation banks in Turkey) are more inclined toward financing SMEs than conventional banks. We also find that the quality of Islamic banks' SME loan portfolio is comparable to that of conventional banks. The results are fairly robust to different bank ownership forms (state owned, private, and Islamic banks) and alternative model specifications. Our findings provide further support to the notion of small is the new big in that banking for SMEs can be a viable venture. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using the 2002-2008 waves of a rich survey of wealth and consumption and the substantial variation in dismissal costs across contracts in the Spanish labor market, we estimate the link between the probability that several household members lose their job and the wealth of that household. We instrument the type of contract using regional variation in the amount, timing and target groups of subsidies given to firms to hire workers using high severance payment contracts. Our findings suggest that older workers covered by fixed-term contracts accumulate more financial wealth. For that group, a drop in severance payments increases average financial wealth by about 40% of annual labor earnings. We examine the responses of credit rejections and consumption growth to changes in job security to disentangle between credit constraints or precautionary saving motives, and the results favor the latter hypothesis.

Our results indicate that a reform in phases should produce two effects: substitution effect that drives companies to bring forward investment and this should increase the GDP and inflation. The reaction of the central bank should be to raise the rate of interest. The other effect is negative and is a wealth effect that reduces the price of the shares and increases the exchange rate. Taking the example of Chile, which conducted a tax reform recently (2014). A 1% increase in taxes should produce, due to the intertemporal distortion, an increase of 0.17% in GDP in the first year of the announcement. However, there may be other elements of diverse nature that may negatively influence the implementation of reform and thus completely cancel the effect of intertemporal substitution. Among these negatives example are the lack the of clarity in the reform by the government, the pessimism in the discussions from opposing views in Congress and its influence on the expectations of employers, lack of credibility, the uncertainty of new tax hikes, etc.","[Chavez, Ricardo] Banco Cent Ecuador, Ibarra, Ecuador; [Garcia, Carlos J.] UAH, Inst Latinoamer Doctrina & Estudios Sociales ILAD, Santiago, Chile",,"Chávez, R (通讯作者)，Banco Cent Ecuador, Ibarra, Ecuador.;García, CJ (通讯作者)，UAH, Inst Latinoamer Doctrina & Estudios Sociales ILAD, Santiago, Chile.",rechavez@bce.ec; cgarcia@uahurtado.cl,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,9,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

A life-cycle model is constructed to understand a rich set of facts about decisions of households with different levels of educational attainment regarding stock market participation, the stock share in wealth, the stock adjustment rate and the wealth income ratio. Model parameters, including preferences, the costs of stock market participation and portfolio adjustment, are estimated to match financial decisions by different education groups. Based on the estimated model, education affects household finance mainly through increased average income. The estimation also finds evidence that higher educational attainment is associated with a lower stock market entry cost and a larger discount factor. Education specific differences in income risks, medical expenses, mortality risks and the life-cycle pattern of income explain relatively little of the observed differences in household financial choices.

Combining analytical and numerical methods, the interaction between these elements is studied in the phase plane of the price and a majority index. In addition, the model is estimated by the method of simulated moments, where the choice of the moments reflects the basic stylized facts of the daily returns of a stock market index. A (parametric) bootstrap procedure serves to set up an econometric test to evaluate the model's goodness-of-fit, which proves to be highly satisfactory. The bootstrap also makes sure that the estimated structural parameters are well identified.","[Franke, Reiner] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany; [Westerhoff, Frank] Univ Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany",University of Kiel; Otto Friedrich University Bamberg,"Franke, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany.",franke@uni-bremen.de,"Westerhoff, Frank/F-2933-2015; Westerhoff, Frank/ABG-4984-2021; Westerhoff, Frank/GSN-6357-2022","Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103; Westerhoff, Frank/0000-0003-1666-4103",,,,,43,39,40,0,20,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

The empirical modeling strategy accounts for the presence of potential endogeneity between these two variables. The results show that there is a positive relationship between health and labor force participation in both directions, indicating that better health is likely to lead to a higher probability of participation in the labor market, but also that individuals who participate in the labor market are more likely to report better health. Interesting differences are uncovered when comparing the results by gender and/or age groups. For instance, for younger females, health status and higher education positively affect the probability of labor participation, whereas having children under the age of 5 and being married reduce their probability of participation. Our findings also highlight the importance of public policy to guarantee good health conditions of the population which could also have a positive impact on labor productivity and consequently on long-run economic growth.","[Maria Iregui-Bohorquez, Ana; Alba Melo-Becerra, Ligia; Teresa Ramirez-Giraldo, Maria] Banco Republ, Carrera 7 14-78,Piso 11, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Iregui-Bohórquez, AM (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Carrera 7 14-78,Piso 11, Bogota, Colombia.",airegubo@banrep.gov.co,"Iregui-Bohorquez, Ana Maria/C-5766-2017; Melo-Becerra, Ligia Alba/C-7080-2017; Ramirez-Giraldo, Maria Teresa/C-3907-2017","Iregui-Bohorquez, Ana Maria/0000-0001-7527-8953; Melo-Becerra, Ligia Alba/0000-0003-0895-9753; Ramirez-Giraldo, Maria Teresa/0000-0002-6097-1605",,,,,26,1,1,0,15,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

However, we know very little about the content of these communications and the processes by which they produce changes in tax compliance. To address this knowledge gap, we employed an in-depth analysis of naturally-occurring online discussions about income tax among software developers. Using a discourse analytic framework, we report an empirical analysis of 120 online interactions between taxpayers, providing a categorization of these interactions. Interactions ranged from asking for information about tax regulations and receiving such information, to a variety of interactions aimed at persuading defiant individuals to comply with tax laws. These persuasion techniques varied from stating the benefits of compliance, to threats of severe economic and reputational consequences. Overall, this study is the first in-depth empirical investigation of social influence processes in taxpayer communication. We discuss how the results inform research into social norms and tax compliance, tax communication in social networks, and persuasive messaging in tax compliance campaigns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a critical roadmap of the social capital theories and applications for a general audience, nonusers included, with particular attention to the works of political and social economists.

Yet despite its importance, it remains in many countries the weakest building block of the health system and a major constraint to achieving universal health coverage goals. Most countries face either absolute shortages (not enough health workers) or relative shortages (skills imbalances)-sometimes both. Countries also face maldistribution, inadequate training capacity and a weak knowledge base, negative work environments, weak human resources management systems, poor working conditions, and inadequate financial and non-financial incentives. There is growing consensus among researchers, practitioners, and the research community that many of these problems have labour market roots. This paper reviews the main economic issues around key health workforce challenges and discusses the contributions that economic analysis can make to health workforce policy-making. It adopts a labour market framework to address the service delivery challenges countries face due to health workforce bottlenecks, and discusses the importance and contribution of the health workforce to general employment and economic growth. The use of an explicit economic framework helps to define policy responses that go beyond scaling up health workers' training, highlighting the importance also of the roles of incentives, preferences, and market failures.","[Araujo, Edson C.; Evans, Timothy Grant; Maeda, Akiko] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Araujo, EC; Evans, TG; Maeda, A (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",earaujo@worldbank.org; tgevans@worldbank.org; amaeda@worldbank.org,,,,,,,89,13,13,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

A good is free if the pecuniary cost of consumption is zero. Examples include the number of cookies consumed at a picnic, free in-store samples in supermarkets, free coffee and soft drinks in the office and paid sick days and vacations up to the contractual allowance. Standard economic theory suggests that consumers consume the good until their marginal utility equals zero or until the quantity restriction (if one exists) is reached, however, it has been demonstrated that when the price of the good is zero, other, non-economic, social considerations come into play and affect consumption decisions. In this paper we construct a simple demand model for zero-priced goods, with specific consideration given to the exogenous non-market variables discussed by Levitt and List (2007). We focus on the normative and social costs of consumption highlighting the effects on consumer choice of quantity restrictions, of scrutiny and of the size of the externality imposed on others, and we test the model in a field experiment. The results show that allowing unlimited consumption leads to less consumption, however, such behavior all but disappears when the subjects' choices are unobserved, including by the experimenter. The results suggest that the recent trend by some large firms to adopt unlimited vacation and sick-day policies may be beneficial for workers and employers as one. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After presenting empirical evidence for the US economy that the propensity to save increases significantly from the bottom to the top quintile of wage earners, we demonstrate that more equal distributions always lead to higher output in the traditional neo-Kaleckian macroeconomic model. We also present conditions under which a reduction of income inequality among workers results in demand becoming more wage led. This view is supported by the results of an econometric study for the USA (1967-2010), which show that the rise after 1980 in income inequality has made the US economy more profit led.","[Carvalho, Laura] Univ Sao Paulo, BR-05508 Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Rezai, Armon] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Rezai, Armon] IIASA, Vienna, Austria",Universidade de Sao Paulo; Vienna University of Economics & Business; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA),"Rezai, A (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Socioecon, Augasse 2-6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",arezai@wu.ac.at,,"Carvalho, Laura/0000-0001-5265-5867; Rezai, Armon/0000-0002-6598-7307",,,,,43,81,90,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

After reviewing the existing literature on the role played by demographic change as a determinant of economic growth and income convergence, with a focus on the European experience, we analyze the quantitative impact of the projected changes in the age and education composition of the labor force. Using newly available demographic projections, we show that the current demographic trends are expected to cause a slowdown in the speed of income convergence across European countries. Our projection exercise suggests that policies aimed exclusively at improving labor force participation do not appear to be sufficient to counteract the negative effects of aging on income convergence. Instead, we show that reducing the educational attainment gap between Central and Eastern European member states and the rest of the European Union in addition to increasing labor force participation leads to an accelerated pace of income convergence.

All agents produce and consume every period, and hold money to self-insure against idiosyncratic risk. The model is calibrated so the equilibrium monetary distribution shares features with US data. The long-run welfare costs of inflation are shown to be large because inflation reduces the ability of money to mitigate risk. However, the beneficial redistributive effect of inflation is magnified along the short-run transition and reduces the overall costs. These short-run benefits result in a majority-rule inflation rate above the Friedman Rule. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As a result of decades of overgrazing and lack of fire, encroachment by invasive, noxious woody shrubs and trees has markedly reduced the grass production upon which grazing cattle rely. More frequent and severe droughts and reduced grazing productivity, coupled with an increasing human population, have resulted in food aid becoming pervasive in the system. This suggests that the pastoral population has become less resilient over time. We examine the effects of altering the mix of the larger livestock species (introducing more browsing camels relative to grazing cattle), clearing stands of woody plants to promote grass production and expanding the use of traditional deferred grazing practices (kalo) to allow more grass forage to be available in the long dry season, which constitutes another resource bottleneck in the system. Results suggest that clearing the woody plants on a large scale (33% of the Harweyu landscape) would have the most positive impact on the ability of people to promote cattle production and could reduce dependence on food aid by almost one-third.","[Forrest, Brigham W.; Bailey, DeeVon; Ward, Ruby A.] Utah State Univ, Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Coppock, D.

We consider three alternative ways of incorporating the volatility index (VIX) and trading volume as exogenous variables within a selection of GARCH models. We are particularly interested in whether these variables have additional incremental forecast power over and above the baseline GARCH specification. Our results suggest that both the VIX and volume do provide some additional forecast power, and this is generally improved when considering both of these series jointly in the model. However, while the results may be statistically significant the gain is marginal and the coefficient values small. Moreover, in a horse race exercise VIX does not outperform the GARCH approach. In answering the question of whether VIX produces better forecasts than the GARCH model, then the answer is no, but the informational content of VIX cannot be ignored and should be incorporated into forecast regressions.","[Kambouroudis, Dimos S.; McMillan, David G.] Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Kambouroudis, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",d.s.kambouroudis@stir.ac.uk,"McMillan, David/H-5211-2019","McMillan, David/0000-0002-5891-4193; Kambouroudis, Dimos/0000-0002-8230-0028",,,,,84,26,29,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The cointegration test proposed by Bayer-Hanck (2013) is applied to estimate the long-run and short-run relationships among the variables. After confirming the existence of cointegration, the overall results from the estimation of an ARDL energy demand function reveal that in the long run, the acceleration of globalization (measured in three dimensions economic, social and overall globalization) leads to a decline in energy demand in India. Furthermore, while financial development is negatively related to energy consumption, economic growth and urbanization are the key factors leading to increased energy demand in the long run. These results have policy implications for the sustainable development of India. In particular, globalization and financial development provide a win-win situation for India to increase its economic growth in the long run and become more environmentally sustainable.

However, the economic repercussions and policy responses to extreme events for an island nation like Singapore are not as widely known or studied. This paper illustrates that impacts of a health disaster [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)] and an economic crisis [Global Financial Crisis (GFC)] on the Singapore economy based on selected indicators of the financial market, macroeconomy and property sector. Crises of different nature entail different policy responses of different scales and this is highlighted in the policy responses to both SARS and GFC toward economic recovery. In the case of SARS, there were preventive measures toward diseases but no reactive measures as the SARS virus was a new strain. For GFC, the policy measures were simply reactive as preventive measures failed to regulate the financial markets effectively. Our paper makes the case that the impacts of such extreme events are systemic as they affect all aspects of Singaporean society and that, moreover, the island nation is more vulnerable to these shocks than is currently acknowledged.","[Tan, Seck] Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Asia & Globalizat, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore; [Yu-Hung, Allen Lai] ESSEC Business Sch, Inst Hlth Econ & Management Asia Pacific, One North Gateway, Singapore 138502, Singapore",National University of Singapore; ESSEC Business School,"Tan, S (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew Sch Publ Policy, Ctr Asia & Globalizat, 469C Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",seck.tan@nus.edu.sg; allen.lai@essec.edu,,,,,,,34,6,6,0,17,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Volatilities and their short and long run linkages are analyzed using an asymmetric dynamic conditional correlation GARCH model as well as a multivariate multiplicative volatility model. Our approach provides a flexible and accurate fitting procedure for volatility and correlation risk.

In our model, agents differ in productivity and they can obtain a health service either from a congested public hospital or from a noncongested private one at a higher price. With pure in-kind redistribution, agents fail to internalize their impact on congestion, and the demand for the public hospital is higher than optimal. When productivities are not observable but the social planner can assign agents across hospitals, the optimal congestion is higher than in the full information case in order to relax incentive constraints and foster income redistribution. Finally, if agents can freely choose across hospitals, the optimal subsidy on the private hospital price may be negative or positive depending on the relative importance of redistribution and efficiency concerns. In this case, redistribution is limited if the quality of the public facility depends on the number of users.","[Canta, Chiara] Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] ESG UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] CESifo Germany, Munich, Germany; [Leroux, Marie-Louise] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; Ifo Institut; Universite Catholique Louvain,"Canta, C (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.;Leroux, ML (通讯作者)，ESG UQAM, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3P8, Canada.",chiara.canta@nhh.no; leroux.marie-louise@uqam.ca,,,,,,,26,0,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Using a recent firm-level survey for 19 Sub-Saharan African countries, the paper shows that there is a positive and significant relationship between importing and productivity for both manufacturing and services firms. Using a series of robustness tests, the paper finds that the importer-productivity relationship is robust in the case of manufacturing firms, but the results for services appear sensitive to the presence of extreme values. Finally, the paper shows that manufacturing firms with the highest levels of human capital show the strongest relationship between importing and productivity, a result consistent with a role for absorptive capacity in maximising the benefits of importing.","[Foster-McGregor, Neil] UNU MERIT, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Isaksson, Anders] United Nations Ind Dev Org, A-1400 Vienna, Austria; [Kaulich, Florian] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",Maastricht University; Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Kaulich, F (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Welthandelspl 1, A-1020 Vienna, Austria.",foster@merit.unu.edu; a.isaksson@unido.org; florian.kaulich@wu.ac.at,"Kaulich, Florian/F-7787-2016","Kaulich, Florian/0000-0001-6737-5921",European Commission [EERAF08043],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The dataset used in this paper is an output of the project EERAF08043 Survey of Enterprises in Selected ACP Countries, funded by the European Commission.

This paper addresses these concerns in the context of policies to increase energy efficiency, rather than direct action to reduce energy use. Using a global CGE simulation model, we extend the analyses of 'economy-wide' rebound from the national focus of previous studies to incorporate international spill-over effects from trade in goods and services. Our focus is to investigate whether these effects have the potential to increase or reduce the overall (global) rebound of local energy efficiency improvements. In the case we consider, increased energy efficiency in German production generates changes in comparative advantage that produce negative leakage effects, thereby actually rendering global rebound less than national rebound.

It also analyzes shifts in the occupational and sectoral structure of employment driven by technological changes and restructuring of the Ukrainian economy. A job polarization in Ukraine seems to stem from deindustrialization, expansion of subsistence farming, rapid growth of retail trade and other less-knowledge intensive services, rather than from routine-based technological changes observed in developed countries. Our results, obtained from the Hausman-Taylor panel data model, suggest that fairly high and persistent education-job mismatch results from both the supply (too many people with tertiary university education) and demand (too many jobs for low-skilled workers) factors. Taking into account that older workers are often more prone to overeducation in Ukraine than their younger peers, the major concern is that overeducation is likely to be a dead-end for many workers.

Since then, the trade integration of the Indian economy in general and the manufacturing sector in particular has increased phenomenally. Against this backdrop, this paper analyses the direct as well as indirect impact of trade on jobs in the Indian manufacturing sector. Using the growth accounting approach, we find that the direct impact of trade on manufacturing jobs has been positive. However, trade induced decrease in labour demand has neutralized direct job gains to a great extent. Therefore, unlike other Asian economies, the overall employment gain from trade has been minimal. The paper argues that supply side constraints should be addressed urgently to enhance job gains from international trade.

Transition to inflation targeting and currency market liberalization resulted in multiple ruble depreciation in 2014-2016, which became one of the reasons of inflation processes intensification in spite of the restrictive monetary policy. Attempts to suppress the non-monetary inflation (primarily induced by the growth of the natural monopolies' rates) by monetary methods are inappropriate and lead to the consequences negative for the economy and the society. Inflation targeting policy requiring introduction of the floating exchange rate, is disastrous for the Russian economy. In the condition of highly volatile prices for primary commodities, floating rate intensified effect of financial sanction on the Russian economy. Monetary policy shall contribute to economic growth but not serve as a weapon against the inflation. In contrast to developed countries, Russian economy has a huge growth potential connected with domestic development sources.

It is in use by both neoclassical economics-after Samuelson (1965, p. 43), who used the term in his paper on what later became a foundation of the efficient market hypothesis-and post Keynesian economics-after Davidson, who picked up the term in order to highlight methodological differences. Considering the origin of the concept in statistical physics and its use in the topology of dynamical systems, which most economists are not conversant with, the importance ascribed to ergodicity in economic debate seems mystifying. We deconstruct the meaning of the term in the major contributions of Samuelson and Davidson. We suggest an alternative to (non)ergodicity to discuss the nature of randomness in the real world. While neoclassical theory assumes stochastic randomness, post Keynesians assume nonstochastic randomness, a term developed by the mathematician Kolmogorov (1986, p. 467). We argue that even in an ergodic world there is a problem with the idea that stochastic randomness can be dealt with by the financial system.","[Alvarez, Miguel Carrion; Ehnts, Dirk] Bard Coll Berlin, Econ, Berlin, Germany",,"Alvarez, MC (通讯作者)，Bard Coll Berlin, Econ, Berlin, Germany.",,"Ehnts, Dirk Helmer/JXW-6368-2024","Ehnts, Dirk Helmer/0000-0001-8628-9797; Carrion Alvarez, Miguel/0000-0003-4660-6369",,,,,41,4,4,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In the contribution the importance of the long-run qualitative competitive advantage is stressed. The competitiveness of a country is defined as its ability to create innovations and to draw on the existing technologies, which is called as quality competitiveness. The goal of the contribution is to verify, whether the competitiveness of the EU member states increase and the heterogeneity in the European Union decrease simultaneously. After the composite indicator construction its development is analyzed and the convergence or divergence tendency of the quality competitiveness in the EU is verified. It was proved, that competitiveness in all EU economies increased in the time period 2000-2012.

Also, in periods of high uncertainty firms tend to postpone the implementation of their projects, which has a negative impact on the economic growth. In this paper, we study different policies that can be set by governments in order to stimulate private investment. We develop an extended real options model that takes into account some relevant macroeconomic factors (namely, different types of taxes, asymmetric investment multipliers, and public inefficiencies) that do not appear in the related literature. The optimal incentives for the different types of stimuli are derived and discussed. We show that the optimal subsidy that prompts the private investment must be subject to a maximum that accounts for the government's incremental tax-related benefits. Additionally, the required optimal subsidy can be reduced if the government acts as a competitor fighting for the project. This would diminish the public spending while achieving the same objectives. We also show that a subsidy policy is always better than tax reductions. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of the model with an example that applies to the Portuguese economy.

Less well known fact is that since the 70s international valuation standards, which can be considered a general basis for valuation activities worldwide has been also working out. Valuation of property is becoming increasingly important practical and in this context also theoretical discipline. It is based on the assumption that each property brings a certain income which derives from economic activity and which is based on the expectations of benefit. This means that investment in real estate should be part of each investment strategy. Therefore, the economic and business approach to capital is represented by following assumption: given capital saved with particular interest rate would in the future allow the investor to receive such amounts which would have been equal to the income from immovable property. Capitalization rate would again be primarily an expression of the profitability of the sector or industry in the area of national economy. The paper deals with methodology draft of capitalization rate for the market valuation of commercial real estate used in businesses. These results will be achieved on the basis of comparative method, namely the leases of commercial buildings located Ostrava.

We find evidence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between each pair of international and Da Qing oil prices, favouring the market integration hypothesis. We also estimate asymmetric adjustments under the momentum threshold autoregressive (M-TAR) specification in a TVECM, and the results show that adjustments to eliminate disequilibrium happen faster when oil price spread increases than when it decreases. The long-run and short-run Granger causality tests support the notion that China has influence on the international oil markets. The results imply that China should open up its domestic and imported oil markets, and also establish a well-functioning crude oil futures market, as they are essential for arbitrage and hedging strategies.","[Chan, Hing Lin] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Woo, Kai-Yin] Hong Kong Shue Yan Univ, Dep Econ & Finance, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong Baptist University; Hong Kong Shue Yan University,"Chan, HL (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",hlchan@hkbu.edu.hk,,,,,,,39,15,16,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The disruption in the Brazilian labor market was the result of the offensive of capital over labor, in a context of economic growth with unemployment and high turnover rates. Therefore, this article aims to analyze the turnover of the industrial labor market in the Northeast. This scenario is strongly characterized by the national restructuring process, especially as a receiver of economic activity/work intensive. Methodologically, it resorts to a literature review and empirical methods are added to the construction of indicators of turnover. The time frame covers the years 2001 and 2010, with the data source to the Annual Social Information and the General Register of Employed and Unemployed of the Ministry of Labor and Employment. The main results show that there are high rates of unfair dismissal, and a high proportion of workers who leave their jobs in less than a year. In addition, turnover is more pronounced in construction and agriculture. However, when the selection is made for the sectors of manufacturing industry, mechanical industry, footwear and food industries have high rates of turnover, compared with the other. Regarding the turnover rate according to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, it is more pronounced for the male labor force, the very young and the young, less educated and in jobs with earnings of up to one minimum wage.","[da Silva Filho, Luis Abel] Univ Reg Cariri URCA, Dept Econ, Crato, Brazil",Universidade Regional do Cariri,"da Silva, LA (通讯作者)，Univ Reg Cariri URCA, Dept Econ, Crato, Brazil.",abeleconomia@hotmail.com,"da Silva Filho, Luís Abel/AGT-6360-2022","da Silva Filho, Luís Abel/0000-0002-7453-1678",,,,,45,1,2,0,6,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

Wavelet decompositions, in both its discrete and continuous forms, are employed to unveil the multi-horizon nature of co-movements, volatility and lead-lag relationships. This is to unveil the path of linkages and the behavior underlying the transmission mechanism of financial shocks across major Eurozone stock markets. Evidence also supports the presence of common shocks whereby equity markets in Eurozone are significantly affected by episodic crisis events globally. Prior to the recent subprime crisis, contagion effects have generated short-term shocks that may potentially involve, among other factors, excessive channels. In stark contrast, the most recent US subprime crisis and EMU sovereign debt crisis reveal the evidence of fundamental-based contagion. We also find the increasing short-run and long-run stock market integration, driven by several stages of the establishment of EMU.

To evaluate the products' quality it is good to use different methods and tools of quality management. The quality management tools allow to collect and process data about events, situation and processes in the organization and its environment, connected to various aspects of quality management. The quality management tools are divided into two groups: Seven Basic Tools of Quality and Seven Management and Planning Tools. Basic Tools are based on a simple mathematical apparatus and mathematical statistics, are helpful in troubleshooting issues related to quality. They are called basic because they are suitable for people with little formal training in statistics. In contrast, Management and Planning Tools were created with the development of quality management. They have to support the basic tools and improve the information flows in the enterprise. The advantage of the use of quality management tools is that they are unified, known and used all over the world. So they have very versatile use and can be used by organizations of various types, including manufacturing enterprises. This means that globalization can also relate to the sphere of business management, especially production and quality management.

The research methodologies used include following methods: normative method, secondary researches, comparative method, historical and statistical methods. The research results show that there is legal basis for regional development of Eastern Croatia. The economic, social and territorial cohesion, aimed towards balanced regional development, the Lisbon Treaty lists as: a) as fundamental objective of the Union, b) as shared competence between the Union and the Member States and as the fundamental European policy, institutionalized in Articles 174-178 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty stipulates that in order to promote the overall harmonious development, the Union develops and implements its actions leading to strengthening of economic, social and territorial cohesion. The Croatian Constitution provides: the State's responsibility for the economic development of all its regions, the State's responsibility for the areas of interest to the Republic of Croatia and the areas of special state concern, the responsibility of the State to assist financially the weaker units of local government, as well as the responsibility of the Republic of Croatia for the implementation of the objectives and the Union law. The Act on Regional Development in 2014 defined the goal of Regional development policy of the Republic of Croatia: contribute to the socio-economic development of the Republic of Croatia, in accordance with the principles of sustainable development, creating conditions that will allow all parts of the country to strengthen the competitiveness and the implementation of their development potential. However, the accent is placed on actual ineffectiveness of legal norms. The key problem is that the region of Eastern Croatia states decreased economic and social development. One of the major reasons of the development fall is that the region of Eastern Croatia is not complete European region with self-governing status. This area consists of five counties: Osijek-Baranja, Vukovar-Brod-Posavina, Virovitica-Podravina and Pozega-Slavonia County. Therefore, with necessary implementation of the regionalization of the Croatian territory, as well as possible solutions to development problems, the authors in particular propose efficient use of the EU funds and greater responsibility and effectiveness of the government institutions.","[Gazilj, Nikolina] Off Entrepreneurial Dev, Dragutina Lermana 10, Pozega 34000, Croatia; [Marinac, Antun; Emanovic, Tena] Polytecn Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia",,"Gazilj, N (通讯作者)，Off Entrepreneurial Dev, Dragutina Lermana 10, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",nikolina.gazilj1@gmail.com; amarinac@vup.hr; tena.emanovic1@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,1,1,2,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,901,910,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600090,0

When information collection is endogenized, multiple equilibria may arise.","[Ghosh, Parikshit] Delhi Sch Econ, New Delhi, India; [Ray, Debraj] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Ray, Debraj] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Delhi School of Economics; New York University; University of Warwick,"Ghosh, P (通讯作者)，Delhi Sch Econ, New Delhi, India.",,,,"National Science Foundation [SES-1261560]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1261560] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",Ray's research was supported by National Science Foundation Grant SES-1261560.,,58,21,25,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JAN,2016,83.0,329,,,,,59,90,,10.1111/ecca.12169,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DA9LV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368131200003,0

Despite the fact that this transitivity has been decreased in recent years, exchange rate is still one of the main determinants of inflation in fragile economies with high current account values. Exchange rate increases detached from economic fundamentals are reflected to the prices in high percentages. Therefore, overvaluations or disvaluations require a monetary policy reaction. Changes in exchange rates should be considered when creating inflation expectations due to the impact of exchange rates on inflation. Depreciation in exchange rates began with the announcement by Fed that it will gradually exit from quantity easing. Inflation targeting has gained new flexibility to deal effectively with real economic instabilities according to recent empirical literature thanks to its ability to anchor inflation expectations. The objectives of the study were to make judgments about whether inflation targeting is a flexible monetary system or not by determining the strength of its anchoring effect on inflation expectations and to suggest some political recommendations according to the obtained results. In order to accomplish this objective, the relationship between exchange rates and inflation expectation will be analyzed via the dynamic panel method. It can be stated according to the acquired results that exchange rate continues to be an important indicator of inflation expectations for the sample group during the examined periods.","[Guler, Asli] Ordu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ordu, Turkey",Ordu University,"Guler, A (通讯作者)，Ordu Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Ordu, Turkey.",asliguler24@hotmail.com,"GüLER, ASLI/K-5500-2012",,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,355,363,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100038,0

Although the stronger proves incompatible with efficiency, the combination of efficiency and our second version leads to an important class of rules which improve upon a status quo order. These rules are also strategy-proof, which reveals a further connection between solidarity and incentive properties.

A generalized dynamic factor model is capable of accounting for these characteristics and can be applied to panel data of monthly returns of a vast variety of commodities. The empirical results indicate that four common dynamic factors exist that account for much of the variation in the commodity returns. The identification of the common dynamic factors is conducted by interchangeably creeping an economic indicator into the commodity return panel data and examining the ratio of variance explained by the common factors. The four common factors correspond to the U.S. inflation rate, the world industrial production, the world stock index, and the price of crude oil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in economic terms these effects are very weak and do not support the proposition that forfeiture provides vital funds and incentives for crime policing.

However, we find causality evidence only in one-fifth of the low and one-fourth of the middle-income countries. In general, the results are more country specific.

Given its many positive effects on the business performance, such as creativity, innovativeness and flexibility needed in modern business environment, it was of the utmost importance to investigate different factors that either contribute or constrain learning in alliances. After the theoretical background on the aforementioned topic was given, an empirical research and its main conclusions were described in the paper. A study of the alliances in Croatian context revealed that organizational characteristics exhibit the most pronounced influence on the knowledge transfer success which was especially highlighted in domestic alliances. The level of integration, the primary area of cooperation and the previous experience in forming alliances between partners did not change the extent to which different factors influenced knowledge transfer.","[Klindzic, Maja; Jelavic, Sanda Rasic; Braje, Ivana Nacinovic] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Klindzic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",mklindzic@net.efzg.hr; srasic@efzg.hr; ivana.nacinovic@efzg.hr,"Braje, Ivana Nacinovic/C-2332-2013; Klindzic, Maja/C-9268-2018; Klindžić, Maja/U-4270-2019","Braje, Ivana Nacinovic/0000-0003-4062-5251; Klindžić, Maja/0000-0001-7199-9542",,,,,42,0,0,0,12,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,594,604,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100063,0

The less educated are more likely to claim to have voted without having done so, which may explain why previous studies of voting in developing countries fail to find an effect of education. We demonstrate the importance of this finding by using our survey data to generate predicted voting probabilities for the respondents to the 2012 Afrobarometer survey in Tanzania and show that while mean self-reported voting does not differ much at different levels of education, the differences become significant when taking into account voting misrepresentation.","[Kolstad, Ivar; Wiig, Arne] Chr Michelsen Inst, Bergen, Norway",,"Kolstad, I (通讯作者)，Chr Michelsen Inst, Bergen, Norway.",ivar.kolstad@cmi.no,"Kolstad, Ivar/AAQ-3081-2020; Wiig, Arne/A-4430-2009","wiig, arne/0000-0002-6347-7370",Research Council of Norway,Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),Financial support from the Research Council of Norway is gratefully acknowledged.,,4,4,4,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

This article develops a mixed-integer programming model, and it is the first of its kind that jointly optimizes strategic fleet planning and the selections of long-term and spot contracts in tramp shipping. The model can be used to determine the best mix of long-term and spot contracts for a given fleet and/or to find the optimal fleet size and mix for a set of contracts. It can be used as a basis for a fleet renewal programme, informing decisions on when to sell, whether to buy old or new ships, and when to charter in or out vessels.

The purpose of our research is twofold: first, we aim to classify and define the effects of globalization, and second we explore these effects and test the relationship between the globalization effects and the performance of exporting companies. In this context the research attempts to answer two questions: 1) in which way the globalization affects company performance, and 2) what is the difference in the relationship between global market opportunities and performance and between global market threats and performance. Structured questionnaire was used to collect the data from marketing and sales managers of companies from six economic sectors in Slovakia. Bivariate regression analysis was applied to study the size and direction of the global market opportunities and global market threats on overall business performance. We found that globalization can affect business performance both positively and negatively: while company performance is enhanced by increased market opportunities caused by globalization, it is braked by growing competitive threats. Therefore, managers must consider such double effects, and try to expand the opportunities, while turning threats into opportunities. Appropriate strategies such as CRM strategies, developing networks with other companies or plural management strategies must be carefully developed and implemented in order to minimize the threats from increased competition.","[Lesakova, Dagmar] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesakova, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",lesakova@euba.sk,,,science project Consumer behaviour and individual consumption in the periods of unemployment and relative deprivation of unemployed population: implications for decision taking bodies and business [VEGA 1/0224/15],science project Consumer behaviour and individual consumption in the periods of unemployment and relative deprivation of unemployed population: implications for decision taking bodies and business,This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0224/15 Consumer behaviour and individual consumption in the periods of unemployment and relative deprivation of unemployed population: implications for decision taking bodies and business.,,16,2,2,2,17,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1171,1178,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800145,0

The company's awareness of the exposure to currency risk is of immense importance, as its negative effects could be treated by applying appropriate business policies and instruments. International business relations of Croatian real sector companies are becoming more and more important, especially after the Croatian accession to the European Union. As this trend is also present in eastern Croatia, there is a growing need to understand the possible consequences of currency risk exposure. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore the availability of various financial instruments for managing currency risk in Croatia, as well as to determine the level of their application in the eastern Croatian companies. Large companies from five Slavonian counties which operate also on the international market have been observed. The paper will analyze companies' approach to the currency risk problem, their awareness of the existing management instruments and the degree of their implementation. The paper will present in detail the forms of currency risk, such as transaction, translation and economic exposure, as well as the appropriate methods for its managing. The two major groups of these methods - internal and external, differ substantially in their availability - internal methods are available to each company naturally, while external ones depend on the development of the financial system. Analysis of exposure types and available instruments will be carried out by using comparative and descriptive methods while the situation in the companies will be examined by conducting a survey. Due to undeveloped Croatian financial system and lack of information on different instruments for currency risk management, it is necessary to raise companies' awareness of the currency risk exposure to properly manage it.","[Liovic, Dina; Novakovic, Drazen] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Liovic, D (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Trg Ljudevita Gaja 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",dinali@efos.hr; dnovakov@efos.hr,"Bičvić, Dina/AAT-6475-2021; Bičvić, Dina/AAL-1438-2021; Novaković, Dražen/AAN-7378-2021","Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788; Bičvić, Dina/0000-0002-5296-7788; Novaković, Dražen/0000-0002-8365-7248",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,1042,1050,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600103,0

By clustering twenty-eight EU countries and five former Soviet republics that are not integrated into the European framework using institutional environment quality indices (the corruption perceptions index, the index of economic freedom, the worldwide governance indicator), we are able to see a sustainable persisting difference between two groups of post-socialist states. We used Ward's method for clustering; calculations were done through the SPSS package. This method intends to create small clusters from the closest observations, which fits well the objectives of our study. Eastern European and Baltic countries come close to other EU states in terms of their institutional quality. These countries don't form their own cluster. Their institutional environment is consecutively improving, although these improvements have different speed. Former Soviet republics except for Kazakhstan form a single cluster notable for a similar state of the institutional environment, which is sustainable over the course of time. Unstable quality of institutional environment is common for south Europe countries. However, link between institutional quality and economic growth rates has not been revealed. Economic growth rates were significantly different in countries belonged to one cluster.","[Lyakin, Alexander N.; Benson, Isabel N.] St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Benson, IN (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Econ Policy, Tchaikovskogo Str 62,A 310, St Petersburg 191194, Russia.",a.lyakin@spbu.ru; benson.isabel@gmail.com,"Alexander, Lyakin/A-3672-2015","Alexander, Lyakin/0000-0002-0722-2517",,,,,19,6,6,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1220,1227,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800151,0

Laser cutting experiment was conducted based on Taguchi's L-9 experimental design by varying the laser power, cutting speed, assist gas pressure and focus position at three levels. Based on obtained experimental results, a MCDM model consisting of nine alternatives and six criteria was defined. In order to determine the relative significance of considered criteria a pair-wise comparison matrix of the AHP method was used. Stability of the obtained ranking of alternatives was checked by varying values of coefficient of linear combination and by the application of operational competitiveness ratings analysis (OCRA) method.","[Madic, Milos; Radovanovic, Miroslav; Petkovic, Dusan] Univ Nis, A Medvedeva 14, Nish 18000, Serbia; [Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Av 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",University of Nis; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Madic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, A Medvedeva 14, Nish 18000, Serbia.",madic@masfak.ni.ac.rs; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt; mirado@masfak.ni.ac.rs; dulep@masfak.ni.ac.rs,"Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Radovanovic, Miroslav R/ABA-6544-2021","Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Radovanovic, Miroslav R/0000-0002-5815-530X; Madic, Milos/0000-0002-2310-2590",Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [TR 35034],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",This work was carried out within the project TR 35034 financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia.,,31,19,19,2,24,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

A negative relation between a high personal discount rate and retirement wealth may be reduced when individuals engage in some form of retirement planning. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we provide evidence that respondents with a high personal discount rate accumulated 37% less retirement wealth, on average, between 2004 and 2008, when compared with respondents with a low personal discount rate. However, when retirement planning strategies were included in the model, there was no statistical difference in retirement wealth between people with high and low personal discount rates. The retirement planning strategies included calculating a retirement income need, hiring a financial planner for retirement or engaging in both of these activities.","[Martin, Terrance K., Jr.] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA; [Guillemette, Michael A.] Univ Missouri, Personal Financial Planning Dept, Columbia, MO USA; [Browning, Christopher M.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Martin, TK (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",terrance.martin@utrgv.edu,,,,,,,12,4,6,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Authors consider the conceptual approach to the identification of tax violations. This is based on the author's interpretation of the concepts of strategy and algebraic approach to the construction of the model. It is shown that efforts aimed to identify possible violations of tax laws can be attributed to research activities and satisfy the postulates of the routine research activities outlined in the work. Therefore, the strategy of tax violations search can be presented as a combination of six basic research strategies. This fact allows to apply the algebraic approach to the strategy construction. The authors consider that the algebraic approach comprises three components: 1) the system of basic strategies; 2) the system of standard transfolinations and standard combinations of strategies; 3) the approximating mechanism. The authors briefly describe examples of utilising basic research strategies for searching tax violations. The proposed algebraic approach provides a framework for solving the optimization problem of tax administration and allows to build the technological process of creating new economic and management models.","[Melnikov, Yury Borisovich] A Valek Str 12-32, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia; [Onokhina, Elena Alexandrovna] Traktoristov Str 17-27, Ekaterinburg 620130, Russia; [Shitikov, Sergey Alexandrovich] Radischev Str 31-201, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia",,"Melnikov, YB (通讯作者)，A Valek Str 12-32, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia.;Onokhina, EA (通讯作者)，Traktoristov Str 17-27, Ekaterinburg 620130, Russia.;Shitikov, SA (通讯作者)，Radischev Str 31-201, Ekaterinburg 620014, Russia.",UriiMelnikov58@gmail.com; Onohina@yandex.ru; Shitikov-s-a@yandex.ru,,,RFBR [16-06-00240],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),The reported study was funded by RFBR according to the research project No 16-06-00240.,,15,4,4,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1355,1362,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800167,0

In this paper, we take a different angle and investigate the relationship between financial market regulation and current account balances, an area for which limited empirical evidence exists. We use a panel of countries over the period 1980-2010 and employ a novel empirical approach which allows us to simultaneously account for model uncertainty, current account persistence and unobserved heterogeneity. We find robust evidence that financial market regulations affect current account balances and that different aspects of these regulations can have opposing effects on the current account. In particular we find that easing bank entry barriers is negatively associated with the current account balance. In contrast, bank privatization and securities market deregulation tend to raise current account balances. Our results also highlight the importance to control for persistence and unobserved heterogeneity. Once we control for these factors, we find robust evidence for a wide range of current account theories in contrast to previous studies accounting for model uncertainty. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluates whether, in the case of a small, open and peripheral country in which exports are the engine of economic growth despite a noticeable laggardness in terms of R&D, the firms' R&D impacts on and/or is influenced by their exports, as well as whether the interrelation between R&D and exports impacts on the performance of firms. Using an unique dataset comprising all (more than 340 thousands) non-financial companies based in Portugal, over the period 2006-2012, estimations based on bivariate probit models, which provide the simultaneous estimation of the two decisions (R&D and exports), taking into account the correlation between the estimation errors of the equations for R&D and exports, confirm there is complementarity between R&D and exports, which means that engaging in R&D activities will increase the firm's probability of engaging in export activities. Additionally, engaging in export activities will also increase the probability of engaging in R&D. The results also provide support for the hypothesis that more productive firms self-select into exporting activities and also provide support for the learning-by-exporting hypothesis. Finally, based on a panel model we further found that R&D and exports have a positive effect on sales growth, which is enhanced when both activities occur simultaneously.","[Neves, Alexandre] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Teixeira, Aurora A.

In general, the economic recession can be understood as one of the phases of the global business cycle because all countries had suffered somehow from this enormous collapse. However, the depth and length of this phase was different across the countries due to different approaches to the monetary and fiscal policy that was applied to stop it and to start economic recovery. That is why some substantial changes could arise leading to the economic divergence of the economies that might affect not only the stability of particular economies but also periods of their recovery, which in consequence, might spoil the business cycle synchronization that had been observed before the recession. This is particularly important for the future of such economic bodies like the European Union and the Eurozone that experienced both the advantages and the disadvantages of common policy and currency. It is commonly assumed that the GDP series in constant prices measure both business activity and business cycle. In the presented research, seasonally adjusted quarterly GDP series from 1995-2012 were analyzed. To determine how much the recession affected business cycle synchronization, a cross-spectral analysis for the whole analyzed period and for moving windows was implemented. We proposed to apply the tools of cross-spectral analysis such as coherence, phase and amplitude of the specified frequencies taking into account the time window of 48 quarters. Such a procedure allows indicating a rapid change in business cycle synchronization conditionally on the period of the analysis which includes the period 2007-2009. The empirical findings show that the assumption of business cycle synchronization within the EU was confirmed for the strongest economies of the European Union like Germany, Great Britain and France. Moreover, Poland and Spain can also be included in the club of synchronized economies. Other EU economies like the Hungarian, Italian and Portugese, were less synchronized with the EU business cycle, although in the period of crisis they were closer to the whole economic area. For the non-EU countries, a significantly weaker synchronization with the EU was observed. The hypothesis that the financial crisis caused similarities in the business cycle paths of the EU countries and the USA was confirmed, while for Japan and Switzerland it could not be confirmed in the light of the obtained results.","[Osinska, Magdalena; Kufel, Tadeusz] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland; [Blazejowski, Marcin; Kufel, Pawel] Torun Sch Banking, Fac Finance & Management, Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Osinska, M (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Torun, Poland.",,"Osinska, Magdalena B./F-5376-2014; Błażejowski, Marcin/L-5790-2019; Kufel, Paweł/Y-9058-2019","Osinska, Magdalena B./0000-0002-9796-2892; Błażejowski, Marcin/0000-0003-0204-2231; Kufel, Paweł/0000-0003-4769-8066; Kufel, Tadeusz/0000-0002-3200-9355",National Centre of Science in Poland [2012/07/B/HS4/02927],National Centre of Science in Poland,"Financial support from the National Centre of Science in Poland, grant number 2012/07/B/HS4/02927 is gratefully acknowledged",,24,4,4,0,9,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

Insurance contributes significantly to economic growth by improving the investment climate and promoting efficient mix of activities of economy than would be undertaken in the absence of risk management instruments. From other side economic growth and wealth are the most important determinants for insurance market growth and penetration. In this paper, the authors investigate the insurance density and penetration in dependence of economic growth and globalization in three Baltic countries: Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Slovenia. The findings of the paper show that level of economic growth and demand of insurance services in all states varies: the insurance density in Lithuania last year was at 1,6 %, while the average cost of insurance per capita was 204 euros.

The inequality as measured by the distribution of income between rich and poor countries, has globally narrowed. But within each country, the story is less pleasing. We may use three different arguments to support this conclusion: 1) differentiation among workers. A-skilled workers in rich countries; B-low skilled workers in rich countries; C-high-skilled workers in poor countries; D-low skilled workers in poor countries. The new slogan originating in the Silicon Valley works with the gig economy and appearance of the new workers category- contract workers. 2) growth of crony capitalism (measured by crony capitalism index).

I show the existence of a recursive equilibrium with a minimal state space through the Kakutani-Fan-Glicksberg fixed point theorem. Moreover, any such recursive equilibrium implements a sequential equilibrium and its uniqueness implies its continuity. Particularly, I prove that an agent making persistent errors in the price expectation function is driven out of the market in any sequential equilibrium implemented by a continuous recursive equilibrium.

This situation is part of the age of sustainable development or it is just the result of consumerism? As reported Hes (2014) consumerism is a form of human behaviour-consumers. The unjustified consumption is characteristic of this behaviour. People do not buy only what they need but also what they like and they think that it brings good luck. A company, which allows this behaviour, is called consumer society. It is the result of economic growth and global trends. It leads to the overproduction, the cost reduction and to the higher profits. Although overproduction has a certain advantage, but it also has negative effects, such as growth of debt people, overconsumption, hidden deterioration of health, the destruction of nature. The question now is to search for answers: what to do next? That is the subject of theoretical research, which is linked to the practical situations in the present article. Jeffrey D. Sachs in his book The Age of Sustainable Development, 2008 presents a convincing and practical framework for how people can use global journey. The issue of sustainability and sustainable development is appointed by the author, as a way of looking at the world with a focus on the context of the economic, social and environmental changes.

The analysis focuses on 30 different industries in Canada. The evidence provides weak support for optimal collusion in one industry, which is consistent with the idea that such kind of collusive arrangements is unusual, or, if collusion is all too common, that price wars as deviations from collusion are rare.","[Resende, Marcelo] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Zeidan, Rodrigo] Fundacao Dom Cabral, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Zeidan, Rodrigo] NYU Shanghai, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Resende, M (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",mresende@ie.ufrj.br,"Resende, Marcelo/AAF-6570-2020","Zeidan, Rodrigo/0000-0003-2980-3360",CNPq [303637/2010-2],CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),This work was supported by the CNPq [grant number 303637/2010-2].,,34,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The opportunities to participate in the evaluation of socially responsible practices have all companies that are under the criteria of the Zlatna Kuna rated as the most successful in Croatia. Croatian Chamber of Commerce each year invites 2,000 small, medium and large companies that were under the criteria of the Zlatna Kuna in the previous financial period operating positively and are ranked according to business success. It is enough to fill out the questionnaire to participate in the CSR Index. Each year a questionnaire could be fulfilled by the mid-September and in period of at least 45 days, and every invited company will receive their link under which will fulfill the questionnaire. The methodology defines a set of evaluation criteria in six basic areas: economic sustainability, inclusion of CSR in business strategy, working environment, environmental protection, market relations and relations with the community. Merchants of finished products, as intermediaries between consumers and producers, are faced with growing demands regarding corporate social responsibility. They claim that corporate social responsibility is part of the strategic orientation of the company and that has to be integrated into their business. This paper will process example of the business ethics and social responsibility in the business group Auto Hrvatska d.d., Tesco PLC, Metro AG and others. Basing its business on corporate social responsibility, Auto Hrvatska d.d. actively cooperates with sports, cultural and humanitarian subjects in Zagreb and other Croatian cities and cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia, and not only as a reliable business partner, but also as partner of public and civil sector. Tesco PLC emphasizes its role in society as an extension of the main purposes of business, and Metro AG points out that corporate social responsibility is guideline towards sustainable management. The aim of this paper is to determine the relationship between the implementation of CSR in the company's business with pleasure of the final consumer.

Due to this shift, the SMEs' barriers for technology adoption, including lack of financial resources, knowledge and skills, are diminishing. The latter, supported also by the research findings, increases the impact of SMEs bringing them closer to the large corporations in the global marketplace. The study is significant because it extends previous knowledge on technology adoption, with findings about the adoption of digital channels by SMEs, but more importantly, it opens up a novel insight into strategic literature for SMEs.","[Stankovska, Ivana; Josimovski, Saso] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ, E Business Dept, Skopje, Macedonia; [Stankovska, Ivana] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England; [Edwards, Christopher] Univ Lancaster, Sch Comp & Commun, Lancaster, England",Saints Cyril & Methodius University of Skopje; Lancaster University; Lancaster University,"Stankovska, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Econ, E Business Dept, Skopje, Macedonia.;Stankovska, I (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster, England.",nanevamail@gmail.com,,"Edwards, Chris/0000-0002-0685-4248",,,,,79,25,30,1,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In the evaluation there were involved physical persons and also legal entities. It is expected that individuals use less the tools of managerial accounting. It is also expected that SMEs use less the tools of managerial accounting than large companies. The last hypothesis is dedicated to the efficiency of the company. It can be expected that firms that prepare and monitor calculations, plans and budgets are aware of the importance of financial analysis and evaluate it.

Applying a broad range of methods allows deriving complex empirical findings about the process of convergence, in the context of the high economic heterogeneity that persists over time in the Ecuadorian economy. Encouraging the enlargement of private sector, entering and staying more years in education, increasing the effectiveness of public investment and discouraging the inefficient credit activity are found to be important drivers of economic growth and regional convergence. Additionally, the non-parametric analysis reveals that the progress on the path of regional convergence is mainly due to the 2007-2010 upward transition of the group of poorest provinces. Still, the regional GVA distribution remains polarized and it seems that the group of rich provinces advances faster than the majorities' one, making the achievement of regional convergence even more difficult in the years to come.","[Szeles, Monica Raileanu] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania; [Szeles, Monica Raileanu] Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania; [Szeles, Monica Raileanu] Cuenca Univ, Prometeo, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Mendieta Munoz, Rodrigo] Univ Cuenca, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Cuenca, Ecuador; [Mendieta Munoz, Rodrigo] Univ Cuenca, Grp Invest Econ Reg, Cuenca, Ecuador",Transylvania University of Brasov; Universidad de Cuenca; Universidad de Cuenca; Universidad de Cuenca,"Szeles, MR (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.;Szeles, MR (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Forecasting, Bucharest, Romania.;Szeles, MR (通讯作者)，Cuenca Univ, Prometeo, Cuenca, Ecuador.",monica.szeles@unitbv.ro; rodrigo.mendieta@ucuenca.edu.ec,,"Mendieta, Rodrigo/0000-0001-8040-9305",,,,,48,9,10,0,7,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Despite well-targeted policies, structural reforms and promising outcomes of the recovery program, political parties forming the coalition government lost their seats in the 2002 parliamentary elections and the Justice and Development Party (AKP) came to power with a large majority. The successful program stimulated an impressive growth performance in the following years and most AKP proponents credit a large proportion of this success to AKP's single party government, giving rise to the debate as to whether single party governments are more inclined to generate growth in Turkey. The AKP wing has frequently claimed that single party governance for 14 years has led to significant economic gains in Turkey since 2002, including GDP per capita growth. In this study we attempt to unearth to what extend this argument is in line with the formal results, employing a recently introduced methodology, based on stationarity test. Additionally, the study reveals whether Turkey's economic performance in this period is sufficient to move the country out of the middle income trap. For the analysis we construct a series showing the relative position of the Turkish GDP per capita compared to a wealthy reference economy, namely the US. To this end, we evaluate the relative position of the Turkish GDP per capita for the periods before and after commencement of AKP governance and for the sub-periods of the AKP era between 2002 and 2015. Our findings show that the Turkish economy improved significantly under the single party government in the first two terms of the Justice and Development Party between 2002 and 2011. However, this inclination in performance appears to have lost momentum in recent years.","[Tras, Mehmet Fatih; Lopcu, Kenan; Ozbey, Fela] Cukurova Univ, Adana, Turkey",Cukurova University,"Tras, MF (通讯作者)，Cukurova Univ, Adana, Turkey.",mftras@cu.edu.tr; klopcu@cu.edu.tr; fozbey@cu.edu.tr,"LOPCU, Kenan/H-5220-2018; ÖZBEY, Fela/E-8190-2018","LOPCU, Kenan/0000-0003-1526-5581; ÖZBEY, Fela/0000-0003-1468-6106",,,,,5,0,0,0,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,162,171,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100019,0

I test for differential effects across ages, state-sex education requirements, and viewership levels in a quasi-difference-in-difference framework that controls for confounding effects of coincident contraception policy changes, the economy, and downward trends in teen fertility.

Strikingly, the electrification rate is not only low, but is falling in many countries as population growth outpaces efforts to give more people access to electricity. Seizing the opportunities presented by rapid changes in technology and the availability of renewable energy at continually falling costs, social enterprises have begun to light the darkness and fill in the gap between the public and private provision of electricity. We review the extent of energy poverty and explain why neither the public, nor the private sector has successfully addressed this problem. We also discuss institutional factors that have created an environment conducive to the spread of solar power. To illustrate the social enterprise response, we explain the sector's three most common approaches to solar electrification. Since the potential benefits of any social innovation revolve around its scalability, we discuss various paths to scale before outlining A.T. Kearney's Social Enterprise Accelerator model as a template for scaling up individual social businesses. To enable greater consistency with an institutional economic framework, we suggest an adaptation of the model.

In order to facilitate business in foreign countries, there are various agreements and institutions which eliminate effects of trading barriers. World trade is progressing well thanks to the technology that enables simpler communication too. Before entering into foreign market the companies are supposed to determine marketing strategy based on international marketing research, which is essential for finding out further information about internal and external environmental factors. Despite the continuing process of globalization, it is not possible to remove certain specifics that individual cultures still preserved. According to this fact, management has to make a decision about strategy of unification or differentiation. To create successful marketing strategy for foreign market, managers must dispose actual information about global environment and competition. At the beginning the paper focuses on globalization and its influence on trade.

Its impact on the national economy is primarily reflected in the large number of people it employs, and the export shares. Thefashion industry involves systematic creativity and innovation, and integratesdifferent types of knowledgethat can contribute to creating high added value of the final product. For a full understanding of the economic benefits that are realized in the fashion industry it is necessary to analyze its supply chain. The supply chain has, for the purpose of this paper, been broken down intoits key linksproviding the necessary level of insight into the overall functioning of the system. Supply Chain Management can be defined as a contemporary concept of managing strategic alliances that captures the nature of interactions between businesses (chain links), as well as the advantages which businesses that enter into a strategic alliancecan achieve. In this paper we propose the concept of active cooperation between companies from developed and developing countries to enable the companies of the developing countries, including Croatian companies, to become an integral part of the global supply chains. For companies from a less developed country, not being a part of the global supply chains means the inability to acquire tacit knowledge through spillover that is necessary to create a market-friendly product and to developmanagement systemstandards. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine the different modalities for the integration of Croatian companies intothe global supply chains of the fashion & textiles industry. Considering its geographical situation, culture, and the level of information technologydevelopment, joining to a business or industry clusteris proposed as one of the most promising models.","[Zekic, Zdravko; Samarzija, Luka; Sunjic, Iva] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zekic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",zzekic@efri.hr; luka.samarzija@efri.hr; iva.sunjic1992@gmail.com,"Zekić, Zdravko/R-1848-2018; Samaržija, Luka/R-1808-2018",,,,,,13,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,357,366,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600035,0

Among the more popular types of power plants using renewable energy sources, which have a great potential in the Slavonia region of Croatia, are the biomass-fired power plants. Instead of the traditional financial valuation methods such as net present value or internal rate of return we use the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) method to calculate the profitability of biomass-fired power plants. It allows us to calculate the level of electricity prices at which a certain type of power plant is profitable. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the price level of electricity produced in biomass-fired power plants and to compare it with the wholesale prices and feed-in tariffs of electricity produced from biomass in Croatia. The LCOE offers an insight into the production cost of electricity by taking into account the investment costs, cost of capital, fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs and the cost of fuel. We perform the sensitivity analysis by varying the inputs in the LCOE formula. The main objective of this paper is to see whether it is viable to further subsidize power plants using biomass in Croatia, as a type of power plant using renewable energy sources. Based on the obtained LCOE figures, we can conclude that this type of renewable source fired power plant is the most expensive type and that its level of electricity prices is significantly above the market wholesale price. If Croatia wants to increase the production of electricity generated in biomassfired power plants, it should be aware that these cannot function in the open market without continuous and significant feed-in tariffs.","[Zikovic, Sasa; Grzeta, Ivan; Kastelan, Kristina] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Zikovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka, Croatia.",szikovic@efri.hr; igrzeta@efri.hr; kkastela@efri.hr,"Gržeta, Ivan/P-9460-2018; Žiković, Saša/P-9458-2018","Gržeta, Ivan/0000-0003-4900-0688;",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,722,730,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600073,0

We study seven potential drivers: (1) population increases; (2) a relaxation of credit standards, for example, due to the shadow banking system; (3) increasing preferences towards housing, for example, due to a housing bubble, or to housing being a status asset in the marriage Market; (4) an increase in the savings rate; (5) expected productivity progress; (6) changes in land supply; and (7) tax policy, a proxy for policy stimulus. Our results show that, even if all shocks play relevant roles, productivity, savings glut, and policy stimulus have been the dominant drivers. When the sample is closer to 2014, housing preferences and credit shocks increase their importance to explain house prices and volume, while population shocks explain a larger share of the dynamics of residential investment. The results show some differences if we use house price indices constructed by the government or by private sources. The official indices show smaller increases in house prices and assign a smaller role to credit and preference shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using US data, we estimate by Bayesian-Maximum-Likelihood methods a standard medium-sized DSGE model with a CES rather than Cobb-Douglas (CD) technology. We estimate a elasticity of substitution between capital and labour well below unity at 015-0.18. In a marginal likelihood race CES decisively beats the CD production and this is matched by its ability to fit the data better in terms of second moments. We show that this result is mainly driven by the implied fluctuations of factor shares under the CES specification. The CES model performance is further improved when the estimation is carried out under an imperfect information assumption. Hence the main message for DSGE models is that we should dismiss once and for all the use of CD for business cycle analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the relationship between trade concentration and transmission of the subprime crisis is empirically weak. Thailand is one of the countries with declining reliance on the advanced economies, yet it was greatly affected by the recent crisis. This might result because the formation of global supply chains creates both direct and indirect trade linkages. In this paper, the authors include the effects of both linkages to examine their connection to the transmission of external shocks, as experienced by the Thai economy. If total trade linkages are calculated, Thailand is still found to be highly exposed to advanced markets.

A vertical differentiation model is presented herein to analyze system firms' compatibility choices. This paper differs from the existing literature in two aspects: (1) The purebred and hybrid systems are vertically differentiated; (2) Since one-way compatibility is a phenomenon often observed in real life, this paper considers compatibility as being unilateral rather than bilateral and the possibility of one-way compatibility. We find that, depending on the quality of the hybrid system, any state of compatibility could be an equilibrium outcome. When the quality of a hybrid system is very small, both firms adopt compatibility. Second, despite the fact that firms always earn higher profit under full compatibility than they do under incompatibility, the equilibrium outcome is incompatibility when the quality of a hybrid system is very high, which means firms face a prisoners' dilemma under this situation. Finally, since a firm favors incompatibility more when its rivals adopt compatibility than when its rival adopts incompatibility, the equilibrium outcome is one-way compatibility when the quality of a hybrid system is intermediate. From this point of view, this paper provides a theoretical interpretation of one-way compatibility between Windows OS versus Mac OS. We also show that the market outcome is socially inefficient when the hybrid system's quality is relatively high.","I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Chou, CH (通讯作者)，I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 84001, Taiwan.",chchou@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,12,0,0,1,21,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

J,"Cole, DH",,,,"Cole, Daniel H.",,,'Economic property rights' as 'nonsense upon stilts': a comment on Hodgson,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,LAW,"Hodgson's (2015) critique of extra-legal 'property rights' - in this case, so-called 'economic property rights' - is right on target. This Comment contributes two further points to his critique. First, the notion of 'economic property rights' is based on what Gilbert Ryle (1949) referred to as a 'category mistake', conflating physical possession, which is a brute fact about the world, with the right or entitlement to possession, which is a social or institutional fact that cannot exist in the absence of some social contract, convention, covenant, or agreement. The very notion of a non-institutional 'right' is oxymoronic. Second, the fact that property is an institutional fact does not mean it must exist with the structure of a 'state' (as Bentham suggested). Rather, institutions like 'property rights' only require some community, however large or small, operating with what Searle (1995; 2005) calls collective intentionality and collective acceptance, according to shared 'rules of recognition' (Hart, 1997).","[Cole, Daniel H.] Indiana Univ, Maurer Sch Law, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Vincent & Elinor Ostrom Workshop Polit Theory & P, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Cole, DH (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Maurer Sch Law, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Vincent & Elinor Ostrom Workshop Polit Theory & P, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dancole@indiana.edu,"Cole, Daniel/AAZ-6091-2020","Cole, Daniel/0000-0002-6356-5178",,,,,20,17,19,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Here, following a recounting of this concept and demonstrating its significance not only for classical theory but also for larger social concerns, I argue that the base wage (as it is sometimes termed) as articulated within a Job Guarantee program, is (or should be) comparable to the subsistence wage but requires modification to make it (roughly) equivalent. It will be demonstrated that adherents of the classical approach did not rest their wage theory on a quasi-neoclassical supply demand approach (with some primitive marginal productivity notion lying behind a supposed demand for labor schedule), but understood wages as socially determined where institutional and historic forces established a normative standard around which market wages gravitated. Such an approach was shared by, among others, Thorstein Veblen and John Maynard Keynes.",,,"Henry, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri Kansas City, Dept Econ, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA.",,,,Association for Evolutionary Economics,Association for Evolutionary Economics,"John F.

In recent years, with unprecedented urbanization of China, many children in rural areas have been left behind while their parents migrate to urban areas to seek employment opportunities. Thus, it is considerably important for us to understand the effects of lack of parental care on the health status of left-behind children. Using data from China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), we find that the left-behind children in rural areas are significantly 20.0% more likely to get sick or develop chronic conditions than those living with their parents.

Greene introduced the so-called 'True fixed effects' (TFE) model, which is intended to discriminate between heterogeneity and efficiency in stochastic frontier analysis. We would say that the TFE model has had a huge impact on applied stochastic frontier analysis. One problem with the original TFE estimator, is its inconsistency in cases with finite time observations, at least for the variance components. For the normal-half-normal model, this problem was solved by Chen et al. (2014) based on maximum likelihood estimation of the within-transformed model. In this study, we illustrate the possibilities offered by method of moments estimation. This approach is more flexible than the MLE proposed by Chen et al. (2014), since the method of moments estimators are not so closely dependent on the distributional assumptions and do not hinge on an explicit distribution of the random error. We only assume symmetry, as well as a fixed fourth-order cumulant for more complicated models. Greene's methodology can, and has been, generalized to other models than the normal-half-normal model. However, the method of moments estimators proposed here are consistent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that these fiscal adjustments occur mainly via changes in government investment, accounting for 63-95% of adjustments in permanent unit innovations in grants and own-revenue. In contrast to the role of expenditure, the municipalities' own-source revenue plays a limited role in balancing the local budget. The results also reveal that 40% of the increase in own-source revenue is offset by a reduction in grants. This suggests that the current grants system discourages municipalities from increasing their own-source revenue. Furthermore, municipalities can induce grants by expanding government current expenditure. Here, a 1 yen increase in current expenditure is followed by an increase in grants of 0.65 yen in subsequent years. Finally, we conduct an additional analysis based on population size to study how the adjustment process varies among municipalities of different sizes.

Evidence from Tunisia,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Export promotion; Export margins; Tunisia; Impact evaluation; Propensity-score matching; Matching grant,PROPENSITY SCORE; FIRMS; TRADE,"This paper evaluates the effects of the FAMEX export promotion program in Tunisia on the performance of beneficiary firms. While most studies assess only the short-term impact of such programs, we consider also the longer-term impact. Our estimates suggest that the average beneficiary initially saw both higher overall export levels and greater diversification across destinations and products. However, three years after the intervention, beneficiaries' export levels and diversification were no longer significantly different from those of a control group. Furthermore, the effects were heterogeneous across firms: small and large firms saw no positive impact on export levels, and even the positive impact on medium sized firms was temporary. The temporariness of the impact was not due to spillovers to non-beneficiary firms which helped them to catch up, or to greater exposure of beneficiaries to crisis-affected economies. Rather, the impact may be transient because the program did not lead to the enhancements in product quality or sophistication which could have strengthened competitiveness durably. Notwithstanding its transient effect, the relatively low-cost FAMEX still generated two Tunisian Dinars of private profits per Dinar of program expenditure, and the additional corporate tax revenue just covered the public cost of the program.

In this market, agents buy or sell productive time. This implicit market gives rise to the formation of teams, organized in hierarchies with one leader (buyer) at the top and helpers (sellers) below. Relative to autarky, hierarchical organization leads to higher within and between team payoffs/productivity inequality.

When PTOs (Patent and Trademark Offices) award bad patents, not only do false innovators have the incentive to file applications but also, and more interestingly, true innovators are forced to patent more intensively in an attempt to signal their type. However, if they are liquidity constrained, true innovators may fail to separate and this fact reduces the incentives to exert effort in R&D. In addition, drawing on the signaling role of patents highlighted by the model, we investigate some of the proposals that have been put forward in order to mitigate the bad patent problem. We provide an intuitive condition under which a tightening of the patentability standards (raising the bar) reduces the distortions caused by bad patents. Moreover, we show that introducing a two-tiered patent system is unlikely to improve market outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The three main results to be stressed are as follows. First, we show that if the home and foreign countries have identical ratios with respect to intermediate goods firms that set their export prices in the local currency, the optimal monetary stance in a non-cooperative equilibrium is eased in response to an increase in the ratios. Second, under such an optimal monetary stance, we show that welfare is maximized in both the home and foreign countries if all home and foreign intermediate goods firms set their export prices in the local currency. Third, in a scenario where not all home and foreign intermediate goods firms adopt this pricing strategy, we show that there is always a welfare gain from cooperation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Starting around 15,000 years ago, communities of sedentary foragers began to emerge. This transition has been detected archeologically in numerous regions of the world, including southwest Asia and Japan. In these cases and others, the transition to sedentary foraging occurred several millennia before the transition to agriculture. We develop an economic model of this process that combines climate change, population growth, and technical progress. Better climate led to a larger population for Malthusian reasons, and in some cases this led to technological innovation. A novel insight from our theory is that technological change caused a ratchet effect that made sedentism persist even in cases where climate subsequently deteriorated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of these expenditures are: first, to develop recreational sport facilities to improve public health and to use sport as an instrument of social engineering; and second, to provide elite-level facilities to build a powerful sports nation. The objective of this study is to examine the relationship between government expenditures on sport facilities (GXSF) and sporting success in the oil-rich economy, Iran. Applying regression analyses to the 31 provinces, our results indicated that a higher level of GXFS was not a significant determinant of sporting success. This result may have been due to the fact that national sport resources are directed toward the inefficient provinces because of a high level of patronage behaviors among political elites and the mismanagement of sport funds. Moreover, our results suggested that provinces with larger populations, hosting more sport events and having more investment in sports by the private sector have higher levels of sporting success.

As a corollary, these models offer a partial view of the growth process circumscribed to a limit case, namely the most favorable case in which all possible frictions on the allocation of investment resources are absent This paper adds to the conventional growth setup an optimal mechanism of assignment of investment resources that contemplates the possibility of inefficient allocation. In the assumed economy there is a single representative investor and a large number of firms that compete for the available resources. The new setup highlights how agency costs may deviate the economy from the benchmark growth outcome, potentially generating less desirable long-run results.

Using detailed data around the local institutional context in the Philippines, the paper shows how the correlation can be interpreted as arising in equilibrium under conditions of clientelism, when political strategies emphasize the provision of targeted benefits in exchange for political support. In places where households report more vote buying, government records show that municipalities invest less in basic health services for mothers and children; and, a higher percentage of children are recorded as severely under-weight Corroborating evidence is provided using Afrobarometer surveys across 33 countries. Taken together, the evidence shows that where politicians purchase political support through targeted transfers, they are likely to trade it off against the provision of broader public services on which poor people rely.

We find that the substitution possibilities between the two sectors have an ambivalent effect: although a high substitution elasticity requires less aggressive mitigation policies than a low one, it creates a greater welfare loss through the lock-in in the absence of regulation, The socially optimal policy response consists of a permanent carbon tax as well as a learning subsidy for clean technologies.

The present paper provides a detailed treatment of how Latin American structuralist methodology was formed between the 1950s and 1970s, with emphasis on Celso Furtado's views. Furtado was influenced by both C. Levi-Strauss's and F. Braudel's apparently incompatible approaches to structure and history. Furtado's suggested combination of structure and history was based on the use of economic models to interpret successive historical structures, plus the development of the notion of creativity as a link between structures and processes. It differed in some important aspects from the historical-structural method' usually associated with other Latin American authors such as Sunkel, and Cardoso and Faletto, built on existentialism and dialectics.","[Boianovsky, Mauro] Univ Brasilia, Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Boianovsky, M (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Econ, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",boianovs@unb.br,,,,,,,127,11,15,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Apart from the obvious physical challenges facing disabled people, there may also be psychological barriers that make it difficult for them to integrate in society and prosper. These challenges may be particularly difficult in developing countries, where disabled individuals are often marginalized. The present paper presents experimental evidence on the effect of social identity on disabled secondary school students in urban and rural Uganda. In the rural setting, we find a negative effect of social identity on confidence, but, somewhat surprisingly, in the urban setting we find a positive effect on confidence. This evidence suggests that social identities are shaped by the local environment and are not necessarily in line with commonly held stereotypes, a finding that could have important implications for the design of policies aimed at improving the lives of the disabled. We find only limited evidence of social identity affecting performance or preferences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Rather, our results suggest that in homogenous groups, observable racial identity may convey information about heterogeneity in other dimensions, especially where race is highly correlated with diversity in other dimensions, such as linguistic diversity, low intra-group trust and socio-economic need. Thus, racial identity loses its salience in the absence of any visibly identifiable out-group members, but other dimensions of identity increase their salience.

Perhaps more surprisingly, however, six such articles were submitted independently over several months to Labour Economics and subsequently made it through the normal review process. These articles are collected in the Special Section that follows. This article provides additional background to facilitate the understanding of the policies that are evaluated in the Special Section articles and, more importantly, a discussion of what can be learned from the articles as a collection. Taken together, the articles are quite informative in demonstrating how the effectiveness of policies can vary across different national contexts and how this variation itself can be usefully examined with the standard theoretical framework.

Strategic over and undersupply positions are the result of existing stochastic arbitrage opportunities between the spot market and the balancing mechanism. Clear indications for strategic behavior can be observed in aggregate market data. These structural imbalances increase the need for reserve capacity, raise system security concerns, and therefore place significant costs on consumers. The underlying problem is the disconnect between spot market, reserve capacity market and balancing mechanism.

In this paper, we show that, in a federal framework, tax auditing policies can serve as additional tools for regional interaction. We examine the presence of this interaction by adopting a spatial econometric approach. We employ a spatial panel autoregressive model and obtain results that are congruent with standard theory, corroborating the presence of horizontal competition between regions in their tax auditing policies. We also find that once regional governments acquire legal power, the opaque competition in enforcement policies appears to switch in part to a more transparent competition in statutory tax parameters.","[Maria Duran-Cabre, Jose; Esteller-More, Alejandro; Salvadori, Luca] Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Salvadori, Luca] Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Econ Publ Econ Polit & Econ Espanyola, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Salvadori, L (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Econ Publ Econ Polit & Econ Espanyola, Avda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",jmduran@ub.edu; aesteller@ub.edu; luca.salvadori@ub.edu,"Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014; Salvadori, Luca/G-9921-2015","Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093; Duran-Cabre, Jose M/0000-0002-6265-4347; Salvadori, Luca/0000-0001-7610-439X","Generalitat de Catalunya [2009SGR102]; Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2009-12928, ECO2012-37873]",Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya); Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government),"We would like to thank participants at several conferences and seminars for their helpful comments: specifically, the IEB seminar (University of Barcelona), the XIX Encuentro de Economia Publica (University of Santiago de Compostela), the 13th Mediterranean Research Meeting (EUI, Florence), the DSEMS seminar (University of Salento, Lecce), the Workshop on Macroeconomic and Policy Implications of Underground Economy and Tax Evasion (Bocconi University, Milan), the IIPF 2012 Congress (TU, Dresden), the ERSA 2012 Congress (University of Bratislava), the 2012 Spanish Stata Users Group meeting (University of Barcelona) and the VII Tax Day (Max Planck Institute for Tax Law and Public Finance, Munich).

We find that negative idiosyncratic income shocks increase migration and elicit household out rental of land. The effect of covariate income shocks is generally dependent on both the timing and the nature of the shock. Our results suggest that rainfall deficiencies during paddy maturing or harvesting seasons reduce the number of migrants by raising the marginal value product of farm labour, thereby increasing the opportunity costs associated with migration.","[Ward, Patrick S.] Int Food Policy Res Inst, New Delhi 110012, India; [Shively, Gerald E.] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Ward, PS (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Natl Agr Sci Ctr, C Block,Dev Prakesh Shastri Marg, New Delhi 110012, India.",p.ward@cgiar.org,"Ward, Patrick S/JDW-3649-2023","Ward, Patrick S/0000-0001-8793-1200","Purdue Research Foundation; Purdue Climate Change Research Center; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development (USAID); National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH [R01-HD30880, DK056350, R01-HD38700]; Fogarty International Center, NIH","Purdue Research Foundation; Purdue Climate Change Research Center; Bureau of Economic Growth, Agriculture and Trade, US Agency for International Development (USAID)(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)); National Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety; China Center for Disease Control and Prevention; Carolina Population Center; University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); Fogarty International Center, NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC))","This research was primarily conducted while one of the authors was a graduate student in the Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University.

A friendly remark on the article by Hindriks and Guala,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"This short commentary basically supports the unified approach to institutions of Hindriks and Guala (2014). First, using a flow diagram over the two-by-two boxes in the space spanned by the collective-individual dimension and the behavior (play)-cognitive (belief) dimension, it argues that the classical game theory and the so-called institution-as-rule theory are both incomplete and that they should be regarded as complementary for an integrated theory of institution as a process. However, the substantive forms of institutions ought to be linguistic representations (i.e. rules and ideas) that summarize equilibrium states of play of the societal game so as to mediate them to be incorporated into minds of players as collective intentionality (i.e. shared beliefs). From this perspective this note also supports the authors' argument to unpack the Y' term in Searle's notion of constitutive rule (that is, the regulative rule) and submit it to be based on a neo-Hegelian notion of mutual recognition (i.e. equilibrium).","Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Aoki, M (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",aoki@stanford.edu,,,,,,,14,10,10,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In the first case, the bank lending channel exists. In contrast, when policy interest rates are estimated at lower quantiles as the rates approach the Zero Lower Bound, the monetary policy's capacity to influence banking loans seems to lose its momentum and is found to be completely ineffective below a critical policy interest rate. The results remain robust for different bank characteristics such as capitalisation, asset size, and liquidity, as well as for alternative scenarios concerning the definition of monetary decisions and the construction of lending activities. The empirical findings also survived other robustness checks, such as a different methodological approach, the role of securitisation and the role of non-conventional monetary policy measures. The empirical findings are expected to be significant in the context of the recent global financial crisis where central banks had to push down their policy interest rates close to zero. In such a distressed financial environment, changes in bank lending terms should form an explicit component of macroeconomic models that describe monetary policy rules used for policy advice.

Our results suggest that tax evasion attempts - independently of whether they are successful or not - lead to efficiency losses in the form of too low quality and less frequent trade. Thus, shadow economies may reduce welfare not only by inducing agents to incur costs to hide or to uncover taxable transactions, by imposing risk on uncertainty-averse tax evaders and by distorting competition, but also by creating an additional efficiency loss in the underlying market by forfeiting possible gains from trade and by inducing insufficient quality provision.

The family of expected poverty indices used in this context contains versions under vulnerability of many well-known poverty indices.

This paper addresses several issues surrounding such episodes. We investigate how frequent are capital surges and have they been increasing over time. This requires dealing with the issue of how capital flow surges are measured. In our review of recent studies we found that a wide variety of measures have been used and that most studies have paid little attention to the measures used in other studies. To examine how much the identification of surge episodes varied according to the different measures, we selected seven measures from the recent literature and applied them on a common dataset of 46 countries for the period 1980 to 2010. The differences in the numbers of episodes identified by the various methods were far from trivial. In fact they varied by a factor of almost three. However, across most measures, we found that there was a substantial increase in surges from the 1980s period to 1990s. Whether there was a further increase during the 2000s varied by the measure used. These findings highlight a need to devote more attention to how surges may best be measured.","[Crystallin, Masyita] World Bank, Jakarta, Indonesia; [Efremidze, Levan] Pepperdine Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Efremidze, Levan; Kim, Sungsoo; Nugroho, Wahyu; Sula, Ozan; Willett, Thomas] Claremont Inst Econ Policy Studies, Claremont, CA USA; [Nugroho, Wahyu] Bank Indonesia, Claremont, CA USA; [Sula, Ozan] Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA; [Willett, Thomas] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",The World Bank; Pepperdine University; Western Washington University; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Sula, O (通讯作者)，Western Washington Univ, Dept Econ, 516 High St, Bellingham, WA 98225 USA.",ozan.sula@wwu.edu,,,,,,,28,18,19,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Drawing on a unique large-scale consumer credit database, we find that Equifax Risk Scores and the use of certain forms of credit, especially mortgages, are low on reservations. However, usage of other forms of credit on reservations is not always low. Moreover, the gaps in credit usage on versus off reservations differ significantly across states and can change notably over time. Among predictors of consumer credit outcomes, the percentage of American Indian residents is robustly negatively associated with favorable credit outcomes. Furthermore, once controlling for racial composition, the effect of an area's location vis-a-vis a reservation often becomes statistically insignificant. Other socio-economic variables are generally poor predictors of credit outcomes on reservations. State jurisdiction over legal matters is, at least on average, associated with favorable credit outcomes on reservations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of biofuel markets over the next 10-20 years and the implications for energy, agriculture, and the environment are uncertain. Building on an integrated agriculture-energy modeling framework, this study analyzes a baseline and three alternative scenarios: two scenarios based on energy prices (crude oil and natural gas) and one based on assumptions regarding cellulosic biomass availability. By examining the impact of scenarios driven by (a) changes in the energy sector and (b) changes in the agricultural sector, we can compare the differential effects on biofuels markets, commodity prices and quantities in each sector, and CO2 emissions. Scenario comparisons show biofuel markets affected more by crude oil prices than natural gas prices. However, higher natural gas prices shift the biofuel production mix away from corn-grain based to more cellulosic ethanol via multiple mechanisms. Alternatively, the scenario with no cellulosic feedstock lowers total ethanol production and raises ethanol and corn prices. In terms of environmental impacts, higher ethanol levels driven by higher oil prices lead to lower CO2 emissions. In comparison, the no cellulosic scenario results in the highest CO2 trajectory relative to the baseline. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Dodder, Rebecca S.; Kaplan, P.

I assess the capability of the different arrangements to stabilize regional consumption, output, and employment over the business cycle. I also study the implications for interregional income, consumption risk sharing and welfare. From this analysis, the following results emerge. First, a central fiscal authority stabilizes consumption fluctuations and increases the scope of interregional income and consumption risk sharing. Second, fiscal equalization destabilizes consumption fluctuations and also reduces the scope of interregional income and consumption risk smoothing. Third, a central fiscal authority leads to welfare gains, whereas fiscal equalization leads to welfare losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, when the manager's risk aversion and ability persistence are small, distortions decrease, on average, over time. For sufficiently high degrees of risk aversion and ability persistence, instead, distortions increase, on average, with tenure.

This article argues that only a concept of human need can do the work required. It compares need theory with three alternative approaches. Preference satisfaction theory is criticised on the grounds of subjectivity, epistemic irrationality, endogenous and adaptive preferences, the limitlessness of wants, the absence of moral evaluation and the non-specificity of future preferences. The happiness approach is found equally wanting. The main section shows how these deficiencies can be addressed by a coherent theory of need. Human needs are necessary pre-conditions to avoid serious harm and are universalisable, objective, empirically grounded, non-substitutable and satiable. They are broader than 'material' needs since a need for personal autonomy figures in all theoretical accounts. Whilst needs are universal, need satisfiers are most often contextual and relative to institutions and cultures. The satiability and non-substitutability of needs is critical for understanding sustainability. Finally, it is argued that human needs provide an indispensable foundation for many current ethical arguments for global and inter-generational justice in the face of threats from climate change. An appendix compares this theory with the capability approaches of Sen and Nussbaum and argues it to be more fundamental.","[Gough, Ian] LSE, Ctr Anal Social Exclus, London, England; [Gough, Ian] LSE, Grantham Res Inst Climate Change & Environm, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gough, I (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, STICERD, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",i.gough@lse.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006576/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,93,112,116,4,53,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Explanations about what is happening in the retail sector have been dominated by two powerful and not fully consistent narratives: a prediction that retail sales will migrate online and physical retail will be virtually extinguished, and a prediction that future shoppers will almost all be heading to giant physical stores like warehouse clubs and supercenters. Although online retail will surely continue to be a force shaping the sector going forward and may yet emerge as the dominant mode of commerce in the retail sector in the United States, its time for supremacy has not yet arrived. We discuss evidence indicating that the warehouse clubs/supercenter format has had a greater effect on the shape of retail over the past 15-20 years. We begin with an overview of the retail sector as a whole, which over the long term has been shrinking as a share of total US economic activity and in terms of relative employment share. The retail sector has experienced stronger-than average productivity growth, but this has not been accompanied by commensurate wage growth. After discussing the important e-commerce and warehouse clubs/supercenters segments, we look more broadly at changes across the structure of the retail sector, including scale, concentration, dynamism, and degree of urbanization.

The asymptotic properties of the two-stage least square (2SLS) estimator suggested by Kelejian and Prucha (1998) are derived under such a circumstance. Although the coefficients of the spatial effect cannot be consistently estimated, the coefficients of regressors may still be consistently estimated with a regular root n speed of convergence, for example, when all instruments are irrelevant. Furthermore, when the coefficient of the spatial effect is close to 1, it could be also consistently estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The present study measures network effects on auto parts exports from 6 major auto producing countries using a panel data set covering 49 destinations and 31 products from 2002 to 2008. In contrast to prior research, the present study finds that in the case of Japanese automakers, overseas production by subsidiary plants is less important in determining auto parts exports from Japan than it is for the other major auto producing countries. Such uniqueness could be led by the higher reliance on domestic procurements of overseas subsidiaries of Japanese automakers as a result of the transfer of the vertical networks between automakers and parts suppliers formed in Japan.","Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Nishitateno, S (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.",,,"Nishitateno, Shuhei/0000-0001-8687-841X",Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University,Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University,"I am grateful for research funding from the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University.

We give particular attention to issues of statistical inference, and the choice of the poverty line and the poverty measure. Our robust conclusion is that absolute poverty declined rapidly between 2003 and 2008 but fell only slightly between 2008 and 2012. Changes in relative poverty were negligible throughout. Using decomposition methods, we argue that the declines in the absolute poverty rate are largely accounted for by changes in the rate of economic growth rather than by distributional changes or changes in population composition.","[Seker, Sirma Demir] Minist Dev, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey; [Jenkins, Stephen P.] London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Jenkins, Stephen P.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Jenkins, Stephen P.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Kalkinma Bakanligi; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Essex; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Jenkins, SP (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Social Policy, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",sdemir@dpt.gov.tr; s.jenkins@lse.ac.uk,,"Jenkins, Stephen/0000-0002-8305-9774","Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the Institute for Social and Economic Research by University of Essex; UK Economic and Social Research Council [RES-518-28-001, ES/L009153/1]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Research Centre on Micro-Social Change at the Institute for Social and Economic Research by University of Essex; UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research for this paper was begun when Demir Seker was a Visiting Fellow at the LSE on leave from the Turkish Ministry of Development.

This contribution distinguishes between economic, socio-cultural and political welfare to evaluate whether NCAs examine a merger's impact against the width of consumer interest. A claim analysis is conducted of the NCAs' formal decisions on eight selected cases of proposed media mergers. The analysis shows that, in recent years, these NCAs pay attention to non-economic interests of consumers, but remain vague as to, first, what interests in particular are at stake; second, who the stakeholders are; and, third, how these interests are weighed. The results suggest potential to increase consumer welfare by safeguarding the media's political and socio-cultural role in particular. To this end, first, the perspective of individuals as citizens must prevail; second, specific tests must review the impact of media mergers on political and socio-cultural welfare; and, third, NCAs and Media Regulatory Authorities (MRAs) must bundle strengths.

We found that the oil price was characterized by volatility clustering and jump behavior. At the same time, oil price shocks had different effects on agricultural commodities. In addition, the shocks on most agricultural commodities were asymmetric.

The 2006 edition of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) (OECD, 2006a) points to three key aspects of the institutions that regulate secondary education that play a part in reproducing inequalities of origin, hindering the equalizing role that guides the education system. First, the teacher assignment mechanism has the dual effect of sending a revolving door of young and inexperienced teachers to schools in unfavourable sociocultural contexts as well as concentrating teachers with more experience in schools in favourable contexts. Second, the geography-based system for assigning students to schools reproduces the residential segregation process. Lastly, the centralized system for supplying educational and technological materials is inadequate to the needs of the schools.","[Bogliaccini, Juan A.] Univ Catolica Uruguay, Social & Polit Sci Dept, Montevideo, Uruguay; [Rodriguez, Federico] Natl Inst Educ Assessment, Studies Res & Indicators Unit, Montevideo, Uruguay",Universidad Catolica del Uruguay,"Bogliaccini, JA (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Uruguay, Social & Polit Sci Dept, Montevideo, Uruguay.",juan.bogliaccini@ucu.edu.uy; federico.rodriguez@correo.ucu.edu.uy,"Rodríguez, Federico/V-7086-2018",,,,,,54,5,5,0,7,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2015,,116,,,,,85,99,,,,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366152800005,0

We test this prediction in two, two-stage experiments. We find that asymmetric history in a first stage leads to increased impasses in a second stage, but that this effect holds only when the second stage pairs the same two parties who shared the asymmetric history in the first.

Our regional focus is on countries in Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Applying a global VAR (GVAR) model, we are able to assess the spatial propagation and the time profile of foreign shocks to the region. Our results show that first, the region's real economy reacts nearly equally strongly to an U.S. output shock as it does to a corresponding euro area shock. The pivotal role of the U.S.A. in shaping the global business cycle thus seems to partially offset the region's comparably stronger trade integration with the euro area. Second, an increase in the euro area's short-term interest rate has a negative effect on output in the long-run throughout the region. This effect is stronger in the CIS as well as in Southeastern Europe, while it is comparably milder in Central Europe. A similar result is obtained for an U.S. based interest rate shock. Third, the region is negatively affected by an oil price hike, with the exception of Russia, one of the most important oil exporters worldwide. The oil-driven economic expansion in Russia seems to spill over to other oil-importing - economies in CIS, thereby offsetting the original drag brought about by the hike in oil prices. Finally, our results corroborate the strong integration of advanced economies with the global economy. By contrast, the responses in emerging Europe are found to be more diverse, and country-specifics seem to play a more important role. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (3) (2015) 706-726.

A number of writers have suggested that the school, or style, characterizing an artist's work may have implications for the peak of the age-valuation profile (the age of the artist at the time at which his or her most highly valued works were executed). In particular, shifts of style which change the relative valuation of innovation and originality, versus craftsmanship and experience, have been hypothesized. The second half of the eighteenth century provides an interesting potential test, because socioeconomic and political changes at this time were paralleled by revolutionary change in the fine arts, especially painting, witnessing major changes in subject manner and aesthetic style among prominent artists. We revisit the hypothesis using data on auction sales of works from this time, estimating hedonic age-valuation profiles using a novel data set. We pool our set of artists to estimate profiles for different birth cohorts, also using a specification where profiles shift continuously with year of birth. We also use dimension-reduction and model-averaging techniques to allow estimation of individual profiles for several artists, despite limited sample sizes.","[Galbraith, John W.] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Hodgson, Douglas J.] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Hodgson, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",hodgson.douglas-james@uqam.ca,,,Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC),Fonds quebecois de la recherche sur la societe et la culture (FQRSC)(FQRNT),"We thank Jon Hamilton, Gwendolyn Owens, Tatevik Sekhposyan, the Editor and two referees, and participants in the Second North American Workshop on Cultural Economics (at the 2013 conference of the SEA), the 2013 conference of the Canadian Economics Association, the 2014 CIREQ-McGill colloquium and the 2014 International Conference of the ACEI, for valuable comments.

Using a data set of a flour producing firm, we identify the degree of persistence in prices and quantities by means of techniques based on long memory and long range dependence. Prices are found to be highly persistent in both wheat and maize flour, with orders of integration which are around one or even above one. On the contrary, quantities, though also persistent, appear to be fractionally integrated, with orders of integration in the interval (0, 0.5) pointing towards stationarity, long memory and mean reverting behaviour. Violence is associated with an insignificant increase in prices of both products and a significant decrease in quantities.

Our results show that responding to expropriation risk the private investor is driven to suboptimal investment decisions. When we endogenize the reputational costs of expropriation, our results show that the decision of the government to expropriate largely depends on the type of business being targeted.

Subjects make decisions from a menu of one-shot games, deciding in each between a certain payoff option and an option with payoffs decreasing in the number of individuals that choose it. The certain payoff option represents the decision to vaccinate. The uncertain payoff option represents the decision not to vaccinate and potentially get sick, with one's likelihood of illness increasing with the number of unvaccinated individuals. Both symmetric and asymmetric treatments are considered with probabilistic and non-probabilistic payoffs. In some sessions, a theoretically non-binding limit on the certain payoff option is imposed, representing a limited stock of a vaccine. The results suggest that for symmetric, non-probabilistic treatments, subjects behave close to the inefficient equilibrium prediction, representing undervaccination. Subjects behave more efficiently for probabilistic treatments and asymmetric treatments with non-binding limits, representing an increase in vaccination following the announcement of a vaccine limit.

Few studies examine the existence of potential policy dilemma in the redistribution of R&D resources to achieve purposes of the industrial upgrading by manufacturing servitization' and achieving regional development rebalance by reallocating R&D resources toward low-development regions or sectors. Drawing on the project office dataset of the Local Industrial Innovation Engine Program', with 907 samples, this study intends to provide with empirical evidence to address that manufacturing servitization' has been influencing the formation of R&D alliances further to allocating R&D resource bias to highly developed regions and industrial sectors, rather than revitalizing industrial clusters.

According to our dynamic panel estimates, the following variables are found to significantly affect NPL ratios: real GDP growth, share prices, the exchange rate, and the lending interest rate. In the case of exchange rates, the direction of the effect depends on the extent of foreign exchange lending to unhedged borrowers which is particularly high in countries with pegged or managed exchange rates. In the case of share prices, the impact is found to be larger in countries which have a large stock market relative to GDP.

Taking advantage of efficiency gains from coordination, we propose an alternative allocation of labor, which minimizes extreme poverty while keeping rich countries as well off as in the nationalist situation. This allocation can be decentralized through international taxes and subsidies.

Despite the remarkable progress that social capital and European regional economic growth literatures have experienced over the last two decades, initiatives combining the two are few, and entirely yet to come for the post-1990s period. Recent improvements in data availability allow this gap in the literature to be closed, since they enable the researcher to consider the traditionally disregarded Eastern and Central European (ECE) regions. This is particularly interesting, as they are all transition economies that recently joined the European Union, with relatively low levels of social capital. On the methodological side, we follow the Bayesian paradigm, which enables us to make direct inferences on the parameters to be estimated and deal with parameter uncertainty, leading to a deeper understanding of the relationships being investigated. In particular, we analyze three indicators of social capital, namely social trust, associational activities and social norms. Results suggest that the two former might have some implications for regional growth while social norms are a weaker predictor for growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There are, however, concerns about the reliability of these measures. This paper assesses the extent to which cross-sectional differences in schools' average achievement on standardized tests reflect transitory factors, using data from a 1999-2006 panel of public and private schools in British Columbia, Canada. Sampling variation and one-time mean reverting shocks are shown to be significant sources of cross-sectional variation in schools' mean test scores. The results therefore suggest that public dissemination of information about schools' average achievement on standardized tests could potentially mislead or confuse parents. These results should also encourage caution in the design of policies that attach monetary or nonmonetary rewards or sanctions to schools on the basis of test-based achievement and suggest a need for more sophisticated measures of school performance.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Javdani, M (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Econ, Okanagan Campus, Kelowna, BC V1V 1V7, Canada.",mohsen.javdani@ubc.ca,"Javdani, Mohsen/AAS-9612-2021","Javdani, Mohsen/0000-0002-5341-6881",,,,,53,0,0,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

If the snob effect is greater than the bandwagon effect, the demand function involving both effects is less elastic than the demand function that does not involve network externalities; however, the market demand function becomes increasingly elastic as the bandwagon effect becomes stronger.

We provide empirical evidence that positionality and Internet access are intertwined. Exploiting variation over time in a panel of European households, we find stated material aspirations to be significantly positively related to computer access in areas with advanced Internet infrastructure. Furthermore, we report cross-sectional evidence from the World Values Survey suggesting an indirect negative effect of Internet access on subjective well-being since people who regularly use the Internet as a source of information derive less satisfaction from their income. Together, the empirical findings highlight the importance of information sets for how individuals evaluate their own living conditions relative to others and suggest a vital role for informational globalization to affect positionality.","Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Lohmann, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",steffen.lohmann@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,,,,,,,48,39,41,3,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Our model predicts that, for a wide range of parameter values, firms have a stronger incentive to acquire information when the economy has been in a recession and a pessimistic belief about the state of the economy prevails than after a boom when firms share an optimistic belief. The equilibrium price system, which features endogenous information transmission, dampens aggregate fluctuations by discouraging information acquisition. Our welfare analysis reveals that information acquisition in the decentralized economy is not efficient. This is due to inefficient employment dispersion, arising from information heterogeneity in equilibrium. Time series data for the U.S. economy support the model's prediction of wages being more informative about total factor productivity after recessions than following booms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

I draw on the social ontology developed by Tony Lawson, especially the notion of social positioning. The classical political economists studied the capitalist economy as a process of reproduction and distribution of the economic surplus, where socio-economic order depends on the division of society into social classes. After the marginal revolution, the classical approach is definitely abandoned, in a context where the analysis of human institutions in terms of social positions is progressively replaced by methodological individualism. This leads to a conception where the notion of socio-economic order is interpreted always in terms of market exchange between individuals, and in many cases replaced with a concern with the stability of an equilibrium situation.","[Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Sch Econ & Management, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal; [Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catolica Portuguesa, CEGE, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Catolica Portuguesa, Sch Econ & Management, Rua Diogo Botelho 1327, P-4169005 Porto, Portugal.",nmartins@porto.ucp.pt,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,30,9,9,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this article I concentrate on elaborating relevant aspects of Dewey's contribution, such as his interpretation of habit, instinct, impulse, character, deliberation, choice, custom and growth. His views regarding the possibilities for (and the nature of) the intelligent reform of social institutions are also reviewed.

These predictions are not in accord with the paradoxical outcomes evinced by recent history in some drug markets, where enforcement rose even as prices fell. We show that predictions of the textbook model are not unequivocal, and that when bandwagon effects among scofflaws are introduced, the simple predictions are more likely to be reversed. We next show that even simple models of noncompetitive black markets can elicit paradoxical outcomes. Therefore, we argue that instead of searching for assumptions that lead to paradoxical outcomes, which is the direction the literature has taken, it is better for policy analysis to choose appropriate assumptions for the textbook model. We finish with performing such an analysis for the case of banning menthol cigarettes. Under the most plausible assumptions enforcement will indeed spur violence, although the legal availability of electronic cigarettes may mitigate or reverse this conclusion.","[Prieger, James E.; Kulick, Jonathan] Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA",Pepperdine University,"Prieger, JE (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 24255 PCH, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",James.Prieger@pepperdine.edu; Jonathan.Kulick@pepperdine.edu,"Prieger, James E./AAJ-2620-2020","Prieger, James E./0000-0002-5521-5557",Cornerstone Research,Cornerstone Research,This study was funded by Cornerstone Research under contract to Altria Client Services.

We compare the behavior of homogeneous groups, in which subjects are exogenously assigned the same endowments, with that of heterogeneous groups, in which half the group members have to exert effort to earn their endowments (effort subjects) and the other half are endowed with a windfall of equal value (windfall subjects). If the opportunity to punish is absent, free-riding becomes the ubiquitous form of behavior over time both in homogeneous and in heterogeneous groups. If the opportunity to punish is present, contributions increase overtime, although the two groups do not exhibit any differences in either the amount of contributions or the amount of punishment. Furthermore, effort and windfall subjects make similar contributions in heterogeneous groups. Within the heterogeneous groups, over the entire time interval and conditional on the decision to punish, effort subjects punish (slightly) less severely than those who received windfall endowments.

Since agreement payoffs of responder and dummy are exogenously given, there is no tradeoff between allocator payoff and the payoffs of responder and dummy. Rather, the allocator chooses the size of the pie and thus being the residual claimant defines his own payoff. While in the dictator variant of the envy game, responder and dummy can only refuse their own shares, in the ultimatum variant, the responder can accept or reject the allocator's choice with rejection leading to zero payoffs for all three players. Comparing symmetric and asymmetric agreement payoffs for responder and dummy shows that equality concerns are significantly context-dependent: allocators are willing to leave more money on the table when universal equality can be achieved than when only partial equality is at stake. Similarly, equality seeking of responders is most prominent when universal equality is possible. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The modeled firm has access to multiple types of capital which are substitutes (imperfect or perfect) in production. These capital inputs are differentiated based on durability and heterogeneous marginal effects on the firm's total cost of capital. This approach is kept general but is motivated by the stylized shape of the bond yield curve, wherein high-durability (longer lived) assets command a higher required return on investment (higher bond yield). The results indicate that a regulated firm (relative to an unregulated firm) will over or under-invest in specific assets depending on their durability and the size of the assets' marginal effects on the cost of capital relative to the regulated rate of return. Two specific sources of distortion in the capital structure are identified. The yield curve effect pushes the firm further (relative to the unconstrained case) towards assets with a low marginal contribution to the cost of capital, thus reducing the firm's average cost of capital. The duration effect pushes the firm towards longer lived assets as a means to inflate the steady state capital stock. This is similar to (yet distinct from) the classic Averch and Johnson (Am Econ Rev 52(5):1052-1069, 1962) result.","Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada",University of Calgary,"Fellows, GK (通讯作者)，Univ Calgary, Dept Econ, 2500 Univ Dr NW, Calgary, AB T2N 1N4, Canada.",gkfellow@ucalgary.ca,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Environmental quality and public infrastructural expenditure affect productivity of private inputs in both sectors. Both the sectors pollute environment and receive the benefits of public expenditure on abatement and infrastructure but the burden of tax is imposed only on the formal sector.

During the crisis, however, the Federal Reserve created a number of facilities to support brokers and dealers, money market mutual funds, the commercial paper market, the mortgage-backed securities market, the triparty repo market, and so on. In this paper, we argue that the elimination of specialized banking through the eventual repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act (GSA) has played an important role in the leakage of the public subsidy intended for commercial banks to nonbank financial institutions. In a specialized financial system, which the GSA had helped to create, the use of the lender-of-last-resort safety net could be more comfortably limited to commercial banks. However, the elimination of GSA restrictions on bank-permissible activities has contributed to the rise of a financial system where the lines between regulated and protected banks and the so-called shadow banking system have become blurred. The existence of shadow banking, which is directly or indirectly guaranteed by banks, has made it practically impossible to confine the safety to the regulated banking system. In this context, reforming the lender-of-last-resort institution requires fundamental changes within the financial system itself.","Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Nersisyan, Y (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Econ, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",,,"Nersisyan, Yeva/0000-0002-2034-843X",,,,,34,2,2,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Two forces drive these effects: increasing returns to scale derived from banks' expertise and competition. The first enables bigger banks to survive competition better, have higher asset quality and be more leveraged. It drives banks into a race for expansion. This race toughens competition between banks, which edges out small banks and may worsen all banks' asset quality. Consequently, the banking industry will be dominated by a small number of highly leveraged banks.

The authors detect a self-selection effect for both importing and exporting firms with a stronger effect for importers. The results suggest that the nature of sunk costs varies between importing and exporting activities with importers facing higher sunk costs. Tariffs represent a potentially important source of variation in the variable costs of trading. When taking the tariffs faced by firms into account, the authors find that the self-selection effect associated with sunk costs is still present but greatly reduced with a smaller reduction for importers compared to exporters.

We show that individuals living in states with large mineral resources endowment are more opposed to redistribution than others. We take advantage of both the spatial and the temporal distributions of mineral resources discoveries since 1800 to uncover two mechanisms through which mineral resources can foster ones' opposition to redistribution: either by transmission of values formed in the past, or by the exposure to mineral discoveries during individuals life-time. We show that both mechanisms matter to explain respondents' preferences. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (2) (2015) 243-256.

In this paper, we show how a dominant political party can use insecure property rights to ensure politically compliant voter behavior and how this power is frustrated after the introduction of a land certification program. We test this hypothesis on data covering 10,000 Mexican municipal elections during the country's democratic,transition. Exploiting the gradual rollout of a large-scale land certification program, we find that land titles significantly raised the number of votes for the main opposition parties. Importantly, this effect disappears once the dominant party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has already lost at least one election in the municipality. These results provide an additional explanation of the PRI's downfall and, more generally, illuminate the relationship between political power, institutions and resource allocation.

In general, search frictions and weakness in bargaining position contribute to underinvestment in schooling from an efficiency perspective. Using estimates of a general equilibrium version of the model in which firm vacancy creation decisions are included, we find that minimum wages and schooling subsidies improve aggregate welfare, but have very different welfare impacts across the ability distribution. In particular, policies that maximize the average welfare of workers have strongly negative effects on the welfare of the least able.","NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA; Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy",New York University; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Flinn, C (通讯作者)，NYU, Dept Econ, 19 W 4th St, New York, NY 10012 USA.",christopher.flinn@nyu.edu,,"Flinn, Christopher/0000-0002-7904-1782",C.V.

In this context, we first show that the information friction creates standard credit market distortions that are exacerbated by both capital income taxation and external financing. We subsequently show from both growth and welfare perspectives that the optimal tax rate on capital income decreases with the severity of asymmetric information and the extent of external financing. Alternatively, our analysis suggests that the presence of informational friction in the credit market introduces a rationale for more conservative taxation on capital, especially when the need for external financing is high.","[Ho, Wai-Hong] Univ Macau, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yong] City Univ Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Macau; City University of Hong Kong,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Econ & Finance, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",efywang@cityu.edu.hk,,"WANG, Yong/0000-0003-0610-3521","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [CityU 148309]","Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","We thank Ping Wang and seminar participants at Institute of Economics, Academia Sinica, Einaudi Institute for Economics and Finance (Rome), SKEMA Business School (Sophia Antipolis), University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, World Finance Conference 2013, Hong Kong Economic Association Workshop on Tax Reform 2013, and Asian Meetings of Econometric Society 2014 for helpful comments.

Under asymmetric information, we derive necessary conditions for the marginal damage trading ratios to be optimal, illustrate that the marginal damage trading ratios are generally not optimal, and show how to improve efficiency using optimal trading ratios. We calculate the optimal trading ratios for a global carbon market. The gains from using optimal trading ratios rather than marginal damage trading ratios range from substantial to trivial, which suggests the need for careful consideration of asymmetric information when designing permit markets.

However, the reserve inadvertently signals the auctioneer's type, which drives multiplicity of equilibria. Eliminating belief systems that violate the intuitive criterion yields a unique equilibrium reserve price equal to the seller's consumption value. Paradoxically, even if bidders initially believe that the auctioneer is bound by his reserve almost with certainty, commitment has no value. Commitment is a shorthand for a high cost to re-auction, which may reflect a concern for reputation. Several variations of the model assess the robustness of our results. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing attention has been placed on the evaluation of energy efficiency and CO2 abatement potential in the power sector. However, studies at the micro-level are relatively rare due to serious data limitations. This study uses the 2004 and 2008 Census data of Zhejiang province to construct a non-parametric frontier in order to assess the abatement space of energy and associated CO2 emission from China's coal-fired power enterprises. A Weighted Russell Directional Distance Function (WRDDF) is applied to construct an energy-saving potential index and a CO2 emission-abatement potential index. Both indicators depict the inefficiency level in terms of energy utilization and CO2 emissions of electric power plants. Our results show a substantial variation of energy-saving potential and CO2 abatement potential among enterprises. We find that large power enterprises are less efficient in 2004, but become more efficient than smaller enterprises in 2008. State-owned enterprises (SOE) are not significantly different in 2008 from 2004, but perform better than their non-SOE counterparts in 2008. This change in performance for large enterprises and SOE might be driven by the top-1000 Enterprise Energy Conservation Action that was implemented in 2006. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that the derivation solely on the basis of the propositions about optimising household consumption expenditures is insufficient to guarantee a decreasing aggregate demand function without circular reasoning. This point is clarified by use of a very simple two-commodity production model of long-run steady states due to Spaventa and Nell. To guarantee a decreasing aggregate demand function, the new Keynesian approach must invoke the kinds of propositions used in more traditional derivations, propositions which themselves are in question on capital-theoretic grounds.","[White, Graham] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"White, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",g.white@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Given the nonlinear and time-varying characteristics of international crude oil prices, we propose a novel hybrid method to forecast crude oil prices. First, we use the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method to decompose international crude oil price into a series of independent intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and the residual term. Then, the least square support vector machine together with the particle swarm optimization (LSSVM- PSO) method and the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model are developed to forecast the nonlinear and time-varying components of crude oil prices, respectively. Next, the forecasted crude oil prices of each component are summed as the final forecasted results of crude oil prices. The results show that, the newly proposed hybrid method has a strong forecasting capability for crude oil prices, due to its excellent performance in adaptation to the random sample selection, data frequency and structural breaks in samples. Furthermore, the comparison results also indicate that the new method proves superior in forecasting accuracy to those well-recognized methods for crude oil price forecasting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although FDI can act as a powerful channel for export expansion in a developing country like Mongolia, improved export performance could also be due to other factors, such as movements in prices, competitive exchange rates and world income. In spite of Mongolia's superior export performance, as yet, no study has been conducted to investigate the determinants of Mongolian export demand and supply. Using a panel data set covering 1995-2012 for the mining, manufacturing and primary sectors, we analyse the determinants of export performance. Empirical results suggest that higher world income, higher prices for Mongolian exports and increased FDI inflows have led to improved export performance in Mongolia. There is no statistical evidence to suggest that trade liberalisation and improved provision of basic infrastructure have had any impact on Mongolia's export expansion.","[Davaakhuu, Oyunbadam] Open Soc Forum, Ulaanbaatar 14240, Mongolia; [Sharma, Kishor; Oczkowski, Edward] Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia",Charles Sturt University,"Sharma, K (通讯作者)，Charles Sturt Univ, Sch Accounting & Finance, Wagga Wagga, NSW 2678, Australia.",ksharma@csu.edu.au,"Oczkowski, Eddie/AAY-3706-2020","Oczkowski, Eddie/0000-0003-2071-7116; Sharma, Kishor/0000-0002-7967-0562",,,,,17,3,4,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,APR 3,2015,27.0,2,,,,,256,267,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1026707,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CI6LW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354871800009,0

(2005) consider auctions in which bids are selected from a completely ordered family of securities whose values are tied to the resource being auctioned. The paper defines a notion of relative steepness of families of securities and shows that a steeper family provides greater expected revenue to the seller. Two assumptions are: the buyers are risk neutral; the random variables through which values and signals of the buyers are realized are affiliated. We show that this revenue ranking holds for the second price auction in the case of risk aversion. However, it does not hold if affiliation is relaxed to a less restrictive form of positive dependence, namely first order stochastic dominance (FOSD). We define the relative strong steepness of families of securities and show that it provides a necessary and sufficient condition for comparing two families in the FOSD case.

Spain as a case study,ECONOMIC SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Labour supply; Great recession; Gender; Added worker effect; Discouraged worker effect; Young people labour supply,DECISIONS; YOUTHS,"In this paper, we focus on the effects of the Great Recession on the decisions of young women regarding their labour supply. Considering the profound effect of the economic recession on the Spanish labour market, and in particular on the labour supply of young people, the focus of the empirical part of this paper is on Spain. Using EU-SILC 2007 and 2012 micro data for Spain, the labour supply models of women are estimated by age group, with a particular focus on the 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 age bands, in order to establish how young women living in couples exhibit different labour supply propensities according to their partner's labour market status. Correction is made for the non-random selection of women living in couples in the younger age groups. This first analytical step reveals a negative effect on the likelihood of forming a new household in the context of precarious employment conditions. Analytical results regarding the labour supply of women by age group confirmed a discouraging effect of young children on the labour supply of the youngest mothers, as well as a positive effect from being the owner of a house purchased under mortgage. The literature shows that different effects can be at work within the crisis: an added worker effect (AWE), which is countercyclical labour supply behaviour involving an increase in individual labour supply in response to transitory shocks in the partner's earnings, and a procyclical discouraged worker effect. The resulting estimations of the present study suggest an AWE in 2012 for young women living in couples. While in 2012 the discouragement effect was only prevalent for women over 40, in 2007 it was also prevalent among younger women. Women's higher propensity to enter the labour market when their partner becomes unemployed or is persistently unemployed, coupled with their likelihood to be inactive in the presence of young children, would suggest a need for labour market policies targeted towards young women. Childcare facilities could mitigate the latter effect and produce a more continuous work profile, avoiding the negative effects of work experience interruptions on labour supply during the female lifecycle.

In this article we study whether implementation of affirmative action policies on gender can generate additional effects on an alternative dimension of representation, namely, the age of politicians. We consider an Italian law which introduced gender quotas in candidate lists for local elections in 1993, and was abolished in 1995. As not all municipalities went through elections during this period, we can identify two groups of municipalities and use a difference in differences estimation to analyze the effect of gender quotas on the age of elected politicians. We find that gender quotas are associated with election of politicians that are younger by more than 1 year. The effect occurs mainly due to the reduction in age of elected male politicians and is consistent with the optimizing behavior of parties or of voters.

A centralized organization (called the unitary or U-form) allows price coordination across several markets, whereas with decentralized (the multidivisional or M-form) firms the probability that the antitrust authority will find evidence of collusion on one market while investigating the other is lower. We show that the firm's choice of internal structure depends to a large extent on product substitutability and the instruments used by the antitrust authority.","[Dargaud, Emilie] Univ Lyon 2, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Dargaud, Emilie] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Jacques, Armel] Univ La Reunion, CEMOI, F-97715 St Denis Messag 9, France",Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; University of La Reunion,"Jacques, A (通讯作者)，Univ La Reunion, CEMOI, 15 Ave Rene Cassin, F-97715 St Denis Messag 9, France.",dargaud@gate.cnrs.fr; Armel.Jacques@univ-reunion.fr,,,,,,,39,6,6,1,19,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Using the 2004 and 2011 British Workplace Employment Relations Surveys, the analysis finds that whilst average earnings are significantly higher for men and women across private sector workplaces that have introduced so-called high-performance work practices, the presence of such practices is not associated with a narrowing of the gender pay gap and, if anything, tends to exacerbate the differential in earnings between men and women. Data from the 2004 survey suggest that women are more likely to work in high-performance workplaces, but this is not the case for 2011. There is no evidence that gender segregation is significantly less in high-performance workplaces than in workplaces taking a more traditional route. Policy makers and employing organisations therefore need to be careful in reconciling their performance and equality strategies. In particular, they need to examine whether the former are truly gender-neutral. This requires additional measures, possibly the introduction of human resource audits in the public and private sectors.","[Davies, Rhys] Cardiff Univ, WISERD, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales; [McNabb, Robert; Whitfield, Keith] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Cardiff CF10 3AX, S Glam, Wales",Cardiff University; Cardiff University,"Whitfield, K (通讯作者)，Cardiff Business Sch, Aberconway Bldg,Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",whitfield@cardiff.ac.uk,,,"Department of Trade and Industry/Department for Business, Innovation and Skills; Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service; Economic and Social Research Council; Policy Studies Institute/National Institute of Economic and Social Research; ESRC [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009099/1] Funding Source: researchfish","Department of Trade and Industry/Department for Business, Innovation and Skills; Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Policy Studies Institute/National Institute of Economic and Social Research; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","WISERD, Cardiff University (RD); Cardiff Business School, Cardiff University (RM, KW).

Under IPCC reporting rules, the impacts of energy produced from biomass would not be reported in the energy sector, thereby effectively lowering the emission intensity of a power plant. In this study, a carbon tax is compared to a feed-in tariff for incentivizing conversion of coal plants to co-fire with biomass. In the application, a model of the Alberta electrical grid with an intertie to British Columbia is linked to a fiber transportation model for these provinces. Results indicate that there is an upper threshold on a carbon tax after which retrofitting of coal plants is less efficient than increasing natural gas generating capacity. This is not the case with a feed-in tariff as it specifically targets biomass energy. Although the optimal generating mix achieved with a carbon tax leads to lower aggregate emissions than the mix achieved using a feed-in tariff, it will result in higher average generating costs. Results indicate that it is optimal for Alberta to retrofit approximately 500 MW of current coal capacity (8.6%) to co-fire with biomass, although Alberta wood pellet production acts as a constraint on further conversions.

Still today, nearly 40 years after the introduction of the European Union (EU) 1975 Discrimination Directive and with the end of the 'Roma Decade' (2005-15) in sight, people from the Roma minority have unemployment rates far above-and employment rates and wages far below-those of majority populations. One issue that has received relatively little attention concerns the 'double' discrimination facing Roma women. Not only do Roma women face poorer employment and wage outcomes in the labour market than non-Roma women, in most CSEE countries the gender earnings gap is significantly larger amongst Roma compared to non-Roma. This paper seeks to analyse and explain differences in the gender gap in the earnings of Roma. The paper employs a non-parametric matching approach to identify the main factors underlying the gender difference. Educational attainment plays a relatively small role, explaining only around one-fifth of the gap. Industrial and occupational segregation appear to be playing a strong role as do the civil status of individuals, household socio-economic status and whether or not individuals live in a predominantly Roma community.","[O'Higgins, Niall] Univ Salerno, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy; [O'Higgins, Niall] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Salerno; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"O'Higgins, N (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, DiSES, Via Giovanni Paolo 2 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",nohiggins@unisa.it,"O'Higgins, Shane Niall/B-6063-2014","O'Higgins, Shane Niall/0000-0002-6627-5547",,,,,31,4,4,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Using statistical regression analysis, we investigate if the voting behaviour of MEPs was influenced by the predicted economic impact of CCCTB on their specific country. Our results show that, even after controlling for party, country and individual variables, the economic impact indeed had a significant influence on the voting behaviour of MEPs. In particular, more favourable economic consequences of CCCTB for a country led to a higher chance for MEPs to vote in favour of the CCCTB proposal.

The widely used minimum-effort coordination game has served as a simplified model to better understand this problem. This paper first presents theoretical results that give conditions under which the minimum-effort coordination game exhibits hysteresis. It then uses these theoretical results to develop and confirm some experimental hypotheses using human subjects in the laboratory. The main insight is that play in a given game is heavily dependent on the history of parameters leading up to that game. For example, the experiments show that when cost c=0.5 in the minimum-effort coordination game, there is significantly more high effort if the cost has increased to c=0.5 compared to when the cost has decreased to c=0.5.

Luhmann argued that social systems relieve people from the overwhelming civilizational complexity, but develop autopoietic properties hindering rational solutions to human problems. This argument allows seeing the pecuniary economy as an important complexity-reducing device, which, however, develops excessive autonomy from the embedding societal and ecological environment. For this reason, like other autopoietic systems, the economy has a high chance of becoming societally and ecologically unsustainable. While Veblen criticized the obsession of classical economics with equilibrium and the natural order, Luhmann urged to replace the notion of equilibrium with that of autopoiesis, which focuses attention on the sustainability problem. Accentuating this problem is shown to be the main evolutionary economics implication of Luhmann's work. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses the study by Douglas Allen, The Institutional Revolution, in that context, in order to identify some of the pitfalls in the current attempts by economists to use historical analysis. Next, the paper places his English case into a comparative perspective, helped by the recent insights gained by economic and social history, to see how these pitfalls can be avoided. Based on this, I argue for comparisons at the regional, national and global levels, and for a multidimensional view which includes social contextualization, combined with an open eye for discontinuity in long-run patterns, in order to avoid one-dimensional and teleological approaches to institutional change.","Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Bavel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Hist, Utrecht, Netherlands.",b.j.p.vanbavel@uu.nl,"van Bavel, Bert/K-1377-2015","van Bavel, Bas/0000-0001-8686-0279",,,,,60,15,15,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

At the same time, it is well known that subjects are noisy in their responses and thus may change their behaviour during an experiment. The question then arises as to whether this noise causes average behaviour to change during an experiment. We take the data from an experiment on behaviour under ambiguity, which try to identify which preference functional subjects are using, and analyse it in two halves. We find that, while some individual preferences seem to change from the first to the second half, on average, preferences are unchanged (though there is a reduction in the noise exhibited by subjects in the second half).

We use a panel data set covering 160 million credit card accounts and a difference-in-differences research design that compares changes in outcomes over time for consumer credit cards, which were subject to the regulations, to changes for small business credit cards, which the law did not cover. We estimate that regulatory limits on credit card fees reduced overall borrowing costs by an annualized 1.6% of average daily balances, with a decline of more than 5.3% for consumers with FICO scores below 660. We find no evidence of an offsetting increase in interest charges or a reduction in the volume of credit. Taken together, we estimate that the CARD Act saved consumers $11.9 billion a year. We also analyze a nudge that disclosed the interest savings from paying off balances in 36 months rather than making minimum payments. We detect a small increase in the share of accounts making the 36-month payment value but no evidence of a change in overall payments.

To reconcile this difference, we propose a two-stage model that links appropriation of the CPR and provision of public goods in an attempt to explain the emergence of cooperation in the management of CPRs under environmental uncertainty. Benchmark predictions are derived from the model, and subsequently tested experimentally under different marginal cost-benefit structures concerning the voluntary contribution to the provision of the good. Our results suggest that the severity of the appropriation problem may significantly be mitigated by the presence of an option for voluntarily contributing a fraction of the income surplus from the appropriation phase to the provision of the public good.

In particular, we find current data imply that there is a negative and significant relationship between openness and the sacrifice ratio, regardless of the transmission channel that is proposed.","[Daniels, Joseph P.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Mazumder, Sandeep] Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA; [VanHoose, David D.] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Waco, TX 76798 USA",Marquette University; Wake Forest University; Baylor University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Wake Forest Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7505, Winston Salem, NC 27109 USA.",Joseph.Daniels@marquette.edu; mazumds@wfu.edu; David_VanHoose@baylor.edu,,,,,,,42,6,6,2,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To do this we combine data from an artefactual field experiment with survey data collected from the targeted community. We find that applicants and non-applicants differ in terms of socio-economic characteristics (measured using a survey), as well as selected behavioral traits (elicited using an artefactual field experiment). Even after controlling for a range of socio-economic characteristics, we find that individuals who have higher tolerance for risk, and are more competitive, are more likely to apply to the training program. This suggests that focusing only on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics might not be sufficient to fully explain selection into the program. Participants' behavioral traits are also crucial in influencing take-up rates in such programs. Our results suggest that as a methodology, there is valuable information to be gained by dissecting the black box of unobservables using data on behavioral traits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We use the recent study of Conesa et al. (2009) as an example, but extend it by transitional dynamics. We furthermore develop a general and coherent way of aggregating welfare effects of different individuals and cohorts in the short- and the long-run. Our welfare measure includes the case of a utilitarian social welfare function, yet is not limited to this perspective. We show that the optimality of a high capital income tax rate along the transition crucially depends on the assumption of a utilitarian social welfare function. This objective of the policy maker comprises implicit redistributive objectives across and within cohorts. Based on pure economic efficiency and insurance effects, however, we find a zero capital income tax rate and a less progressive labor income tax schedule to be optimal. Such a tax system receives political support from initial cohorts. A high capital income tax regime on the other hand does not. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We theorize that imported movies (mostly, American movies), which often have bigger budgets and superior moviemaking techniques, suffer from cultural discount in appealing to local (Korean) viewers. By contrast, homemade domestic (Korean) movies appeal to their own national market more effectively with customized cultural content (cultural categorization). Specifically, before movie release, imported movies tend to generate generally lower expectations because of local viewers' cultural discount of those movies. Conversely, local domestic movies tend to generate generally higher but more polarized expectations arising from local viewers' cultural categorization of the movies. These aspects lead domestic movies to perform better in theaters in the number of viewers and the movie's life length. Imported movies, however, attain similar levels of viewer satisfaction because they have smaller and differentiated customer bases. Using multiple-source Korean movie data, we empirically support our theory. Finally, we discuss the practical importance of understanding and strategically utilizing these cultural issues from Hollywood studios' perspective.","[Moon, Sangkil] Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Moon, Sangkil; Bayus, Barry L.; Kim, Junhee] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Yi, Youjae] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Seoul National University (SNU),"Moon, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Belk Coll Business, Dept Mkt, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",smoon13@uncc.edu; Barry_Bayus@unc.edu; youjae@snu.ac.kr; Junhee_Kim@kenan-flagler.unc.edu,"Moon, Sangkil/AFF-4790-2022; YI, Youjae/M-9990-2013","Moon, Sangkil/0000-0002-4883-0498; YI, Youjae/0000-0001-5536-6083; Kim, Junhee/0000-0002-8343-233X",,,,,53,15,15,2,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Evidence shows that the 'high road' to industrialization model - with domestic linkages and skills upgrading - does not accompany growth in exports, as low-skilled assembly, mostly young female workers join the labor force with non-liveable wages and substandard working conditions.

Due to the importance of exchange rate movements to monetary policies, we approach this issue from a currency exchange rate perspective. Specifically, multivariate trend-cycle decomposition is employed to investigate common trends and common cycles among the exchange rates of these countries during the period 1976-2012. Our analysis reveals that the real exchange rates of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand share common cycles in the short term and have common trends in the long term, but the Indonesian currency does not share these relationships. Thus, our results augur well for the synchronization of monetary policies among Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. In contrast, the relatively turbulent dynamics of the Indonesian rupiah evident in frequent bouts of stark depreciation separated by periods of steady depreciation over the past three decades raise questions regarding the readiness of Indonesia for participating in a monetary alliance with the ASEAN-4 nations.","[Basnet, Hem C.] Chadron State Coll, Dept Business, Chadron, NE 69337 USA; [Sharma, Subhash C.] So Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Carbondale, IL 62901 USA; [Vatsa, Puneet] Shell Canada Ltd, Calgary, AB T2P 2H5, Canada",Nebraska State College System; Chadron State College; Southern Illinois University System; Southern Illinois University; Royal Dutch Shell,"Basnet, HC (通讯作者)，Chadron State Coll, Dept Business, Chadron, NE 69337 USA.",hbasnet@csc.edu,"Vatsa, Puneet/G-6893-2019","Vatsa, Puneet/0000-0001-9239-4446",,,,,38,6,6,1,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Among the three major East Asian countries, Japan features the eldest society in the world, while China and Korea also witness a dramatic demographic transformation. One important impact of population ageing is on saving rates. In this paper we seek to investigate the causal relationship between demographics and savings in those three countries by employing a panel of data-set and innovative econometric technique - panel Granger causality test. On balance there is evidence supporting the argument that a growing younger population causes an increase in national saving, albeit not necessarily in household saving.

IC comprises human capital, structural capital, and relational capital. Relational capital consists of two subcomponents: social capital and organizational capital. Human capital's main elements are knowledge, experience, and education. Knowledge is a fundamental resource for any organization (Baden-Fuller & Pitt, 1996; Grant, 1996; Spender, 1996). Entrepreneurial capital was recently introduced as a component of human capital (Audretsch & Keilbach, 2004). A firm's entrepreneurial capital consists of employees who innovate and take risks to change how the firm acts. In addition to addressing IC, this research examines new ICT use. An ICT firm can be defined as a firm that is technologically connected in real time. Technology, information, and communication are the most powerful tools to develop firms (Hafkin & Taggart, 2001). As such, technology, information, and communication may also have profound links to entrepreneurial capital. ICTs and IC are two keys to entrepreneurship (Costa, 2012). ICT firms need their employees' intellectual capital, or else these firms will never achieve long-term sustainability (Madsen, Neergaard, & Ulhoi, 2003). Similarly, intellectual capital benefits from ICT firms to transfer knowledge via networks.","[Albort-Morant, Gema; Blasco-Carreras, Cristina; Rey-Marti, Andrea] Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Albort-Morant, G (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",gema.albort@uv.es; cristina.blasco-carreras@uv.es; andrea.rey@uv.es,,"Albort-Morant, Gema/0000-0002-3796-8571; Rey-Marti, Andrea/0000-0002-6722-1196",,,,,56,1,1,0,2,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,487,493,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600056,0

There is a benevolent center that knows the bidders' valuations and sends private signals to the bidders in order to maximize their expected payoffs. After receiving their signals, bidders compete in a standard first-price auction, that is, without side payments or bid restrictions. We find that to improve on the bidders' payoffs, the signals must depend upon the valuations. If the bidders' signals are restricted to be non-correlated (depend only on the opponent's valuation), then the bidders' payoffs are strictly higher than the larger possible set of signals. If the signals are restricted to be perfectly correlated (public), only two possible signals are needed to achieve the highest bidder payoffs.

The internet survey affords us the opportunity to overcome endogeneity difficulties by imposing exogenous price changes on gasoline consumers to examine the decision-making process behind intended search decisions. We randomly assigned participants to one of five price treatments (either 2.5 or 5% above or below their reported expected price, or no change). We provide a simple empirical model to derive testable implications under prospect theory and use the internet survey to test them. Results indicate that among the respondents who faced prices below their expected price, only 12% chose to search, whereas 45% searched when prices were above. Further, we find results consistent with asymmetric search being driven by prospect theory. The change in consumers' willingness to search is twice as large when prices exceed expectations by 2.5% relative to when prices exceed them by 5% suggesting that consumers derive utility of finding a good deal evaluated relative to a reference price. We show that this result is inconsistent with standard utility theory or consumers using alternative reference prices.","[Castilla, Carolina] Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA; [Haab, Timothy] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",Colgate University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Castilla, C (通讯作者)，Colgate Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, NY 13346 USA.",ccastilla@colgate.edu,,,,,,,19,0,1,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We focus on 12 euro countries for the period 1970-2012. Our empirical results suggest a unidirectional causality running from debt to economic growth for Spain and Portugal and a bidirectional causality for Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland and Italy. No causality in either direction is identified for Austria, Finland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Finally, for France, the tests provide evidence for a unidirectional causality running from GDP growth to debt-to-GDP ratio.

A common procedure within those LI applications is to approximate the market price required for the LI measurement as the ratio of a bank's total revenues to total assets. We discuss the major flaws of this aggregated procedure and propose an adjusted (i.e. business segment-orientated) LI approach, which is then applied to assess the market power of banks in the specific lending business at the country level. Our empirical study is based on an original data set containing all interest-related categories (weighted by the respective loan as well as deposit volumes) in the countries of the European Monetary Union zone (EMU) from 2003 to 2013. Our results reveal that the country-specific market power of banks in the lending business has been substantially underestimated in previous studies based on aggregated outputs. For example, averaged across the five most important economies in the EMU, we detect a calibration factor of four. Our findings corroborate the economic notion that the interest-bearing lending business is a more locally separated, and thus profitable, segment in which competition is attenuated.","[Gischer, Horst; Richter, Toni] Univ Magdeburg, Chair Monetary Econ & Publ Financial Inst, Fac Econ & Management, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany; [Mueller, Holger] Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, Consumer Behav, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University; Otto von Guericke University,"Müller, H (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, Consumer Behav, D-39016 Magdeburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,21,9,9,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The government has both paternalistic and redistributive objectives, and therefore uses its taxation powers to maximize a utilitarian social welfare function that reflects individuals' true (long-run) preferences. Under first-best taxation, quasi-hyperbolic discounting exerts no effect on the level of social welfare attainable. Under second-best taxation, quasi-hyperbolic discounting increases (resp. decreases) the level of social welfare attainable when separating (resp. pooling) taxation is optimal. In stark contrast to previous studies, this result implies that some individuals can actually be better-off in the long run as a result of their short-run impatience. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, only a few empirical studies confirm these claims, or these studies have some limitations. Therefore, in this paper some investigation will be made to see if there is a link between CSR and business performance, i.e. whether companies that have better business performance are also characterized by a higher degree of CSR. Considering that the relationship between corporate social responsibility and business performance of enterprises is largely caused by the number of factors, this study examines this relationship in circumstances specific to the business environment of the Republic of Serbia. The aim of this paper is to examine whether there is a link between CSR and business performance in Serbia. The analysis was conducted by interviewing managers in 184 Serbian companies. In data processing a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and correlation analysis were used. The hypothesis that there is a statistically significant relationship between business performance and their CSR is confirmed, based on empirical data.","[Ivanovic-Djukic, Maja; Lepojevic, Vinko] Univ Nis, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia",University of Nis,"Ivanovic-Djukic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nis, Trg Kralja Aleksandra Ujedinitelja 11, Nish 18000, Serbia.",maja.ivanovic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs; vinko.lepojevic@eknfak.ni.ac.rs,"Ivanovic-Djukic, Maja/W-2611-2019","Lepojevic, Vinko/0000-0002-8364-1078",,,,,54,4,6,0,29,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Crucial knowledge related activities that help organizations to enhance their knowledge base, exploit it efficiently and create values are knowledge integration (KI), knowledge Preservation (KP) and knowledge utilization (KU). Effective KI, KP and KU throughout the organization are essential for its productivity, innovation, and performance improvement. Lately, organizations are facing enormous challenges in efficient integration and sharing of knowledge created by employees while they use their mobile devices for work purposes. Mobile devices and smartphones have become an extension of employee's work environment and increasingly complementing office desktops, notebooks and stationary telephones. This transition is taking place primarily due to their ubiquitous availability, convenient size, reduced cost and simplicity in use. Moreover, technological advancement, better operational systems and ever-increasing quantity of apps ascertain that this trend will continue in the foreseeable future. Professionals use mobile devices actively and create valuable knowledge in the process. Lack of proper integration of these devices with the organization's knowledge management system creates a real problem of having access to this knowledge at a later stage. Important to note that due to real-time nature and its value in existing decision-making process, part of this knowledge is precious and requires particular attention in today's heightened competitive world. This paper proposes a semantic knowledge management system (KMS) framework architecture for transferring and integrating knowledge from mobile devices to organization's knowledge repositories. The proposed framework uses semantic technologies, distributed storage and processing of data, machine learning tools and artificial intelligence agents as foundational technological tools. The paper also posits that organizations should pay serious attention to the knowledge produced using mobile devices since a part of this knowledge is relevant to real-time operational, strategic, and market knowledge.","Grenoble Grad Sch Business, Grenoble, France",Grenoble Ecole Management,"Kabir, N (通讯作者)，Grenoble Grad Sch Business, Grenoble, France.",Nowshade@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,2,2,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,157,164,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600019,0

Additionally, the methods, that have been incorporated in this study, are logical and comparative analysis of literature, synthesis and deduction and graphical methods. The existing literature has shed the light on scarce elaboration of the competitive advantage concept and its augmentation in the context of small and medium enterprises, therefore, a furtherexamination is needed.

We found the investment results to be highly sensitive to cash flow for financial constraint firms. Moreover, in line with previous research, our results showed that the traditional criteria used to identify financially constrained firms led to ambiguous interpretations. Overall, our results propose that the cluster analysis can be used to encompass the various single-criterion approaches, thereby providing a finer measurement of the financial constraint construct and deeper insight into the relationship between investment sensitivity to cash flow and financial constraint.","[La Rocca, Maurizio; Cariola, Alfio] Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Stagliano, Raffaele] Montpellier Res Management, Montpellier Business Sch, F-34185 Montpellier, France; [La Rocca, Tiziana] Univ Messina, Dept Econ Business Environm & Quantitat Methods, I-98122 Messina, Italy",University of Calabria; Universite de Montpellier; Montpellier Business School; University of Messina,"La Rocca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Business Adm & Law, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",m.larocca@unical.it,"La Rocca, Maurizio/L-3143-2019; Cariola, Alfio/T-9213-2019","La Rocca, Maurizio/0000-0002-2097-2865; cariola, alfio/0000-0002-1447-7104; Stagliano, Raffaele/0000-0001-6709-461X",,,,,38,6,8,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In this category we include a set of technological resources, both hardware and software applications, which support different utilization characteristics of knowledge and relational learning (RL) activities, such as: business intelligence, technologies for collaborating and distributing knowledge, knowledge generation and storage, and support hardware for these technologies. An emerging stream of research on IT and RL seeks to guide the application of technologies that support RL. IT is involved in the various knowledge management processes, which include knowledge creation. A great variety of procedures, tools and activities may act as a support to the knowledge generation and creation process. IT contributes to sustainable competitive advantage through its interaction with other resources. Recent literature suggests that RL is a process that plays an important role in enhancing a firm's capabilities and competitive advantage and which may benefit from the judicious application of IT. It has also been argued that for firms to be successful they must complement IT with RL. This study aims to assess the role played by information technology (IT) in relational learning activities (RL). We also examine how IT and RL influence both green innovations (GI) and the development of the customer capital (CC). These relationships have been tested via an empirical analysis carried out with a sample of industrial companies belonging to the Spanish automotive industry. Our findings allow us to confirm that IT acts as an enabler of the RL process and influences on the development of GI, which allow the achievement of a better customer capital (CC).","[Leal-Millan, Antonio; Roldan, Jose; Ortega-Gutierrez, Jaime] Univ Seville, Business Management & Mkt Dept, Seville, Spain; [Leal-Rodriguez, Antonio] Loyola Andalucia Univ, Business Management Dept, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla; Universidad Loyola Andalucia,"Leal-Millán, A (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Business Management & Mkt Dept, Seville, Spain.",aleal@us.es; alleal@uloyola.es; jlroldan@us.es; joguti@us.es,"Leal-Millan, Antonio Genaro/M-2317-2014; Leal-Rodriguez, Antonio/O-3882-2014; Ortega-Gutierrez, Jaime/E-4994-2017; Roldán, José L./E-6307-2010","Leal-Millan, Antonio Genaro/0000-0003-3037-5818; Leal-Rodriguez, Antonio/0000-0002-4403-9658; Roldán, José L./0000-0003-4053-7526; Ortega-Gutierrez, Jaime/0000-0002-1340-0295",,,,,47,0,0,0,12,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,208,216,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600025,0

This paper answers this question by emphasizing the role of process improvements that are influential in product innovation. We construct a firm-level innovative capability score using novel, broad-based, but detailed data on various process improvement practices obtained from firms in Southeast Asia. We then investigate the factors that may affect innovative capability. We also estimate the effect of the innovative capability score on product innovation controlling for research and development intensity and other firm characteristics. Our empirical investigation identifies a chief executive officer (CEO)'s past experience at a foreign or large firm, and buyer pressure to adopt international standards as key determinants of innovative capability. Novel and unique findings from our examination include: (i) the impact of a CEO's past experience at a foreign or large firm on the innovative capability is larger for local enterprises and small- and medium-sized enterprises; (ii) the impact of share of foreign workers in the upper managerial levels only appears to be significant in foreign firms and larger firms; and (iii) buyer pressure is a more likely contributor to innovative capability compared with capital tie-ups with multinational enterprises or joint venture buyers that capture vertical technology transfers. Finally, our empirical results show that a firm in Southeast Asia is more likely to achieve product innovation if the firm has had a higher innovative capability.","[Machikita, Tomohiro] IDE, Wakaba, Chiba 2618545, Japan; [Ueki, Yasushi] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Jakarta, Indonesia",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Machikita, T (通讯作者)，IDE, 3-2-2 Mihama, Wakaba, Chiba 2618545, Japan.",Tomohiro_Machikita@ide.go.jp,,"Ueki, Yasushi/0000-0002-2893-8864","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25380559, 24730233] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,30,11,12,2,63,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

Using a panel data set covering a period from 1993 to 2007 and involving 274 municipalities in Sweden, we establish a positive causal influence of local bank presence on local house prices. There are significant spatial and spillover effects, that is, banks in a municipality affect the housing markets in neighbouring municipalities, although to a lesser extent than in their own municipality.

However, many European countries do not exploit it much in spite of many positive responses made by respected consulting companies. The reasons for this are a very low level of changes in companies, ignorance of opportunities of the given technology and, consequently, an inability to count the return of investment. Therefore, the aim of this article is to introduce a tool for the investment evaluation of cloud computing, which corresponds to the needs of the European business environment and to the properties of this technology. Furthermore, the cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) method is explored. This method is adjusted for cloud computing on the basis of companies' requirements, which were collected from quantitative and qualitative surveys and from the interviews with experts in cloud computing from academic and business environments.

To get this purpose, we develop an empirical application based on a sample of 4.825 Spanish cooperatives and non-cooperatives over the period of 2009-2012. With this sample, we apply panel data and estimate the environment effects (location and interaction) on the productive structure of cooperatives and non-cooperatives.

Firstly, a portfolio of large firms with positive free cash flows, low free cash flow multiples, and low financial leverages was selected. Then it was compared to other firms listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The results were observed in different time periods and exposed to different models. Both buy-and-hold (BHARs) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) were estimated. Mean and median buy-and-hold abnormal returns for the free cash flow portfolio were in most of the years much above the averages for other companies. This was also observed for the whole sample period. The difference between the free cash flow portfolio and other companies was significant in economic and statistical terms during market downturns. It may seem plausible that the free cash flow portfolio outperforms other companies, especially during bear markets. However, the free cash flow anomaly was not always robust to different models and statistical tests and dependable in all the years of the sample period. Negative medians for BHARs and the unfavorable comparison of mean CARs between the free and non-free cash flow portfolio were found.

This article tries to explain this efficiency gap in the industrial sector by empirically estimating the implied discount rates and payback thresholds industrial firms use to evaluate their energy efficiency investments. Using the Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) database from 2002 to 2011, with more than 30000 energy efficiency recommendations, this article builds structural models of firms' evaluation of an energy efficiency project.

This is likely to become an even more common situation with climate change. This paper analyzes the impact of rainfall fluctuations during the gestational period on health at birth in the Brazilian semiarid, highlighting the role of water scarcity as a determinant of early life health. We find that negative rainfall shocks are robustly correlated with higher infant mortality, lower birth weight and shorter gestation periods. Mortality effects are concentrated on intestinal infections and malnutrition, and are greatly minimized when the local public health infrastructure is sufficiently developed (municipality coverage of piped water and sanitation). We also find that effects are stronger during the fetal period (2nd trimester of gestation), for children born during the dry season, and for mortality immediately after birth. Our estimates suggest that expansions in public health infrastructure would be a cost-effective way of reducing the response of infant mortality to rainfall scarcity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Small-and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have limited financial and human resources. The innovative use of collaborative Web 2.0 technologies has the potential of helping SMEs develop and harness intellectual capital. Intellectual capital is the basis for value creation and competitive advantage for SMEs. The acceptance and use of collaborative technologies by the employees in a firm depends to a certain extent on socio-cultural factors, including the national culture. Transition economies, such as Albania after decades of harsh communism have different social and cultural conditions as compared to other developed and developing countries. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the influence of national culture on the acceptance and use of collaborative technologies. Qualitative interviews using semi-structured questions were conducted with 30 managers working in 15 medium-sized enterprises from the 5 main business sectors in Albania, which is a transition economy. Open-ended interview questions were used as the data collection instrument for this qualitative exploratory study. Content analysis was used to analyse the data collected with the semi-structured interviews. This study helps managers understand the role of social and cultural factors on the technology-acceptance behaviour of users. Understanding the technology-acceptance behaviour of users helps managers and organizational leaders in SMEs in preparing a strategy for using collaborative technologies to harness intellectual capital. This study explores the role of social and cultural factors on the use of collaborative technologies. SMEs form a significant part of transition economies, including Albania constituting 99% of registered businesses and 73% of GDP contribution. Results of this study will assist organizational leaders of SMEs in Albania as well as other transition economies with managing intellectual capital in an efficient manner through the use of appropriate Web 2.0 technologies. The use of Web 2.0 technologies helps SMEs harness and manage intellectual capital. The success of these initiatives would depend on the user acceptance of Web 2.0 technologies. This paper addresses an important aspect of managing intellectual capital using Web 2.0 technology through a unique cultural perspective. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of organizational and cultural factors on the acceptance of collaborative Web 2.0 technologies. Compatibility with organizational structure and technological infrastructure, organizational strategy for collaborative Web 2.0 technologies, and top management initiative as well as support were identified as key organizational factors influencing the acceptance of Web 2.0 technologies. Compatibility with sociocultural factors, cultural influence on perception of usefulness, and voluntary participatory behaviour were identified as key cultural factors influencing the acceptance of collaborative Web 2.0 technologies. Incentives for participation and regular organization of relevant training and workshops were also identified as factors influencing the active participation of employees in using collaborative technologies.","Univ New York Tirana, Tirana, Albania",University of New York in Tirana,"Vajjhala, NR (通讯作者)，Univ New York Tirana, Tirana, Albania.",narasimharao@unyt.edu.al,"Vajjhala, Narasimha Rao/A-2047-2012","Vajjhala, Narasimha Rao/0000-0002-8260-2392",,,,,26,4,4,0,19,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,342,349,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600040,0

Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the consumer price index is cointegrated with the unit labour cost and the price of oil. A short-run dynamic model is then estimated in which variations in the output gap are divided into three groups: large-positive; large-negative; and small-medium positive/negative. The results provide convincing evidence that only sufficiently large (positive or negative) variations of the output gap can significantly influence inflation. Put otherwise, relatively small to medium changes in the output gap exert no significant impact on inflation and if not separated, they can somewhat obscure the significant effects associated with large variations of the output gap. This study can lead to greater consensus on the inflation-output gap nexus. The findings remain robust despite the use of different measures of output gap and they are consistent with the modern doctrine but with a new caveat: inflation responds to both positive and negative changes in the output gap as long as such variations are of sizable magnitudes.","Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Business & Law, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Valadkhani, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Sch Business & Law, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",abbas@swin.edu.au,"Valadkhani, Abbas/I-6960-2019","Valadkhani, Abbas/0000-0003-2538-1949",,,,,38,1,1,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

IC includes not only intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights, but also the company's global knowledge, experience, relationships, processes, innovations, market presence and community influence. Due to the intangible nature of IC, it is very difficult to fix a price tag on a specific piece of knowledge. In fact, intangible assets are often measured as the difference between firms' market value and their book value. Since advances in IC come on the heels of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), the continuous expansion of the latter means the relative importance of the former is increasing with respect to tangible capital assets. In fact, intangible resources are recognized to be of value to an organization as they improve its competitive levels, particularly in international markets. In order to increase their IC value, organizations have focused their efforts on improving relational capital by enhancing their relationship with external agents (suppliers, dealers, sellers, and customers). With this aim, most companies have established communication channels with users and customers through ICTs, including websites to promote e-commerce and release products and services, and social media to enhance their corporate image. The growing use of ICTs has not only involved the adoption of new interaction paradigms, but also increased the amount of information shared, which is often of great interest for public and private organizations. The majority of medium-sized and large businesses and public administrations have adapted their structures and internal processes to the realities of globalization and the technology era. However, many of them still need to improve their management practices in order to both acquire and manage IC. One of the most promising ways to acquire IC is to use Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS are computer programs used by public administrators, natural resource managers, marketing and sales analysts, civil engineers, etc., that capture, analyze, store and present spatial data. In parallel with the development of GIS, a new discipline has emerged known as geomarketing (Geographical marketing), which is used to segment the market by considering spatial properties in order to identify the areas where a company may have maximum impact. geomarketing strategies integrate data from company databases and their markets, data from statistical databases on demographic and economic variables, as well as GIS to acquire information from digital maps. The present paper highlights the advantages of employing geomarketing techniques and GIS to acquire IC (human capital and relational capital), which is then used to support decision-making processes at different levels, and ultimately, therefore, increase organizations' market value.","[Wandosell, Gonzalo; Banos, Raul; Concepcion Parra, Maria] Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Business Adm & Management, Murcia, Spain",Universidad Catolica de Murcia,"Wandosell, G (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Murcia, Dept Business Adm & Management, Murcia, Spain.",gwandosell@ucam.edu; rbanos@ucam.edu; mcparra@ucam.edu,"Baños, Raúl/D-6433-2013; Wandosell, Gonzalo/AAE-8645-2020; Parra Meroño, María Concepción/Q-5187-2016","Baños, Raúl/0000-0001-7844-4902; Parra Meroño, María Concepción/0000-0002-0457-4613",,,,,41,1,1,0,22,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,359,366,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600042,0

The oil market characteristics - uncertainty, dynamic and convex demand, and a quantity adjusting cartel - provide in turn an explanation for two different kinds of volatility for oil prices, small and large. Moreover, it makes a difference in such a setting whether OPEC plays in prices (as it did up to 1985) or in quantities (its current policy) and the model implications are compatible with the observed pattern. The numerical example, even accounting for all necessary caveats, suggests that OPEC may not be a perfect cartel but even assuming that OPEC behaves like a duopoly would lead to much larger supplies.

Such rules are commonly motivated by concerns about the legitimacy or representativeness of decisions reached when only a subset of eligible voters participates. A prominent example of this can be found in the context of direct democracy mechanisms, such as referenda and initiatives. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate the consequences of the two most common types of quorum rules: a participation quorum and an approval quorum. We find that both types of quora lead to lower participation rates, dramatically increasing the likelihood of full-fledged electoral boycotts on the part of those who endorse the Status Quo. This discouraging effect is significantly larger under a participation quorum than under an approval quorum.","[Aguiar-Conraria, Luis] Univ Minho, NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Aguiar-Conraria, Luis] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Magalhaes, Pedro C.] Univ Lisbon, Inst Social Sci, Ave Prof Anibal de Bettencourt 9, Lisbon, Portugal; [Vanberg, Christoph A.] Heidelberg Univ, Alfred Weber Inst, Bergheimer Str 58, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany","Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Universidade de Lisboa; Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon (ICS-UL); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg","Aguiar-Conraria, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Aguiar-Conraria, L (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",lfaguiar@eeg.uminho.pt,"Magalhães, Pedro C./B-3197-2010; Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/M-2936-2019","Magalhães, Pedro C./0000-0001-8934-4552; Aguiar-Conraria, Luis/0000-0001-6822-7103",FCT/MEC [UID/ECO/03182/2013]; FEDER; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [UID/ECO/03182/2013] Funding Source: FCT,FCT/MEC(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This work was carried out within the funding with the UID/ECO/03182/2013 reference with the FCT/MEC's financial support through national funding and when applicable co-funded by the FEDER under the PT2020 Partnership Agreement.,,45,6,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

A literature has developed which focuses on optimal tax rates for the top 1 % of the income distribution. In contrast, this paper considers the effect of inequality growth on the structure of a piecewise linear tax system defined over the entire income distribution. Our results suggest that the appropriate response to the increases in inequality would have been a shift towards a tax system with a lower tax rate in the lower half of the distribution together with a highly marginal rate progressive structure in the upper half, a clear differentiation between the top 10 % and the top 1 % and a higher top tax rate. Further inequality growth strengthens these characteristics of the optimal tax structure.","[Andrienko, Yuri; Apps, Patricia] Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Apps, Patricia] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Rees, Ray] Univ Munich, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Rees, Ray] Univ Oslo, Oslo, Norway; [Rees, Ray] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Sydney; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich; University of Oslo; Ifo Institut,"Apps, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Apps, P (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",y.andrienko@sydney.edu.au; patricia.apps@sydney.edu.au; ray.rees@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,Australian Research Council [DP1094021]; Australian Research Council [DP1094021] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The research was supported under the Australian Research Council's Discovery Project funding scheme (Project ID: DP1094021).,,20,5,5,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

It has been argued that asymmetric punishments could reduce bribery by incentivizing whistle-blowing. This paper investigates the role played by asymmetric punishment in a setting where bribe size is determined by Nash bargaining, detection is costly, and detection rates are set endogenously. First, if whistle-blowing is infeasible, the symmetry properties of punishment are irrelevant to bribery deterrence but not to bribe size. Bribery disappears if expected penalties are sufficiently high; otherwise, bribe sizes rise as expected penalties rise. Second, when the bribe-giver may whistle-blow, a switch from symmetric to asymmetric punishment eliminates bribery only if whistle-blowing is cheap and the stakes are low. When bribery persists, multiple bribe sizes could survive in equilibrium. The paper derives parameter values under which each of these outcomes occurs, and discusses implications for welfare and the design of policy.","[Basu, Karna] CUNY, Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Basu, Karna] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Basu, Kaushik; Cordella, Tito] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Basu, Kaushik] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Hunter College (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System; The World Bank; Cornell University,"Basu, K (通讯作者)，CUNY, Hunter Coll, New York, NY 10021 USA.;Basu, K (通讯作者)，CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10021 USA.",kbasu@hunter.cuny.edu; kb40@cornell.edu; tcordella@worldbank.org,"Cordella, Tito/AAN-1891-2020","Cordella, Tito/0000-0001-5520-165X",,,,,57,22,24,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Due to an ageing population, the burden of caregiving is expected to intensify in the next quarter of the century in Europe, especially for mature women. This paper investigates the impact of the provision of constant care for older parents on the mental health of adult daughters, between the ages of 50 and 75, living in different European countries. Data is drawn from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. Information on mental health status is provided by Euro-D depression scale, a measure of depression standardized across European countries. We focus on differences in the effects according to the North-South gradient: we test whether the relationship between informal caregiving and mental health differs across European macro-regions. Our results, robust under different specifications of the propensity score model, reveal a clear North-South gradient: the provision of informal care has a negative and significant impact on daughters' mental health in the Mediterranean countries only, where the amount of resources allocated to the Long Term Care is minimal and the local system of health and social services for the elderly lacks the necessary structures to meet the increasing demand for eldercare.","[Brenna, Elenka] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20121 Milan, Italy; [Di Novi, Cinzia] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fondamenta San Giobbe 873, I-30123 Venice, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Di Novi, C (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Econ, Fondamenta San Giobbe 873, I-30123 Venice, Italy.",cinzia.dinovi@unive.it,"Di Novi, Cinzia/AAK-3184-2021","Di Novi, Cinzia/0000-0002-3536-5507; Brenna, Elenka/0000-0003-3332-9614",Fondazione FarmaFactoring (Milan),Fondazione FarmaFactoring (Milan),"An earlier draft of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the Italian Health Economics Association (AIES), Trento, Italy, at the International Health Economics Association (iHEA) annual conference, Milan, Italy, at the European Federation of Retired and Older Persons (FERPA) Annual Conference, Bruxelles, Belgium, at XII Workshop of Public Economics at Regional and Local Level (PEARL), Alessandria, Italy, and at seminars at the University of Lugano, Marche Polytechnic University, Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

We develop an approach using results from Cardell (1997), who proved the existence of a probability distribution (C(lambda)) that could be used to formulate NL models based on statistically independent variance components. These components can be interpreted as unobserved preference heterogeneity for the choice 'dimensions' used to define NL tree structures. Simulation aside, we consider this formulation to have other practical advantages for empirical work, but it does not appear to have penetrated the literature (possibly due to notational obstacles). We use notation from Daly (2001) to implement an equivalent representation, which also establishes mathematical equivalence between Cardell (1997) and other important results in the NL literature.

We demonstrate that even though firms can earn higher profits under Cournot competition than under Bertrand competition regardless of nature of goods, choosing Bertrand competition is the dominant strategy for firms. This leads firms to face prisoners' dilemma. However, trade liberalization brings about a change from Bertrand to Cournot and increases equilibrium profits if goods are substitutes. If goods are complements, Bertrand competition prevails in spite of the government non-intervention. Hence, a move toward free trade increases not only firms' profits, but also social welfare of both countries irrespective of the nature of goods.","[Choi, Kangsik] Pusan Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Studies, Busan 46241, South Korea; [Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Daegu 42601, South Korea; [Lim, Seonyoung] Busan Metropolitan City, Investment Promot Div, Busan 47545, South Korea",Pusan National University; Keimyung University,"Lee, KD (通讯作者)，Keimyung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",choipnu@pusan.ac.kr; kdlee@kmu.ac.kr; sylim220@gmail.com,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044643],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The authors arc especially indebted to an anonymous referee for careful and constructive comments.

In Italy, only around 13% of the demand for public childcare coverage is met, and the number of applications exceeds the number of places in childcare services in all regions. In conditions of excess demand, municipalities introduce selection criteria to give priority to families for whom access to public childcare appears to be more valuable. We analyse through simulations the consequences of introducing different selection criteria, using a representative Italian sample of households with children under 3 years of age (European Survey on Living and Income Conditions), and the selection criteria employed by six representative Italian municipalities. Our results have interesting policy implications. The benefits for child outcomes and mothers' employment are stronger in municipalities where the selection criteria give priority to more disadvantaged households. However, in these contexts, selected households are less able to contribute to the financial sustainability of the service.","[Del Boca, Daniela; Pronzato, Chiara; Sorrenti, Giuseppe] Univ Turin, Moncalieri To, Italy; [Del Boca, Daniela; Pronzato, Chiara; Sorrenti, Giuseppe] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri To, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Del Boca, D (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Moncalieri To, Italy.;Del Boca, D (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri To, Italy.",dani.delboca@unito.it; chiaradaniela.pronzato@unito.it; giuseppe.sorrenti@unito.it,,,Collegio Carlo Alberto; Compagnia di San Paolo,Collegio Carlo Alberto; Compagnia di San Paolo(Compagnia di San Paolo),"We would like to thank Chris Flinn, Michele Pellizzari, and Katharina Wrohlich for their useful comments on earlier versions of the paper.

As the market becomes more competitive it is certainly no less likely that the cash-in-advance constraint will bind.

The Hong Kong inter-bank RMB offer rate (CNY HIBOR) and the Shanghai inter-bank offer rate (SHIBOR) are used, respectively, as the interest rates for the offshore and onshore RMB markets. The results of our research show that there was significant volatility spillover between the offshore and onshore RMB prior to 21 June 2013 and that direction of the spillover from the SHIBOR to the CNY HIBOR is stronger than that from CNY HIBOR to SHIBOR. However, the spillover declined in strength between 21 June 2013 and 20 April 2016. We also find that the interest rate correlations are low and unstable. Our research reveals that the offshore RMB interest rate has been an independent system that is not determined by the onshore market, and that the determination of the offshore RMB interest rate is very complicated. The Hong Kong market is increasingly playing a more important role in the determination of the RMB. This study contributes to our understanding of the interest rate determination in China and has important implications for policy makers in terms of interest rate policies in the offshore and onshore RMB markets.","[Feng, Yongqi] Jilin Univ, Econ Sch, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tianshu] Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University; Jilin University,"Zhang, TS (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Int Inst Financial Studies, Changchun 130012, Jilin, Peoples R China.",zhangtianshu1983@126.com,"zhang, tian/GZK-6001-2022",,National Social Science Fund of PRC [15ZDA017],National Social Science Fund of PRC,"This work was supported by the National Social Science Fund of PRC 'Promoting the Internationalisation of Renminbi under One Belt And One Road Initiative' (15ZDA017).

In this paper, we explore the institutional frame as a relevant factor for the effectiveness of leadership. We compare subjects' behavior in public-goods experiments that are either framed positively (give-some game) or negatively (take-some game). We observe that leader and follower decisions are sensitive to the institutional frame. Leaders contribute less in the take-some game, and the correlation between leaders' and followers' contribution is weaker in the take-some game. Additionally, using a strategy method to elicit followers' reactions at the individual level, we find evidence for the malleability of followers' revealed cooperation types. Taken together, the leadership institution is found to be less efficient in the take- than in the give-frame, both in games that are played only once and repeatedly.","[Frackenpohl, Gerrit; Hillenbrand, Adrian; Kube, Sebastian] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Hillenbrand, Adrian] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of Bonn; Max Planck Society,"Kube, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",kube@uni-bonn.de,,"Hillenbrand, Adrian/0000-0002-3046-2260",,,,,39,16,19,2,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Intergenerational mobility and equality of opportunity, so the argument goes, is what matters for normative evaluation. In response to this counter, we ask what pattern of intergenerational mobility leads to lower inequality not between individuals but between the dynasties to which they belong? And how does this pattern in turn relate to commonly held views on what constitutes equality of opportunity? We revive and revisit here our earlier contributions which were in the form of working papers (Kanbur and Stiglitz 1982, 1986) in order to engage with the current debate. Focusing on bistochastic transition matrices in order to hold constant the steady state snapshot income distribution, we develop an explicit partial ordering which ranks matrices on the criterion of inequality between infinitely lived dynasties. A general interpretation of our result is that when comparing two transition matrices, if one matrix is further away from the identity matrix then it will lead to lower dynastic inequality. More specifically, the result presents a computational procedure to check if one matrix dominates another on dynastic inequality. We can also assess equality of opportunity, defined as identical prospects irrespective of starting position. We find that this is not necessarily the mobility pattern which minimizes dynastic inequality.","[Kanbur, Ravi] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Stiglitz, Joseph E.] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Cornell University; Columbia University,"Kanbur, R (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",sk145@cornell.edu; jes322@columbia.edu,,,,,,,29,17,17,2,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Using the seemingly-unrelated regression (SUR) and panel-regression models with return, correlation, and volatility equations, we show that excess returns can explain both correlations and volatilities and that own volatility can explain both excess returns and correlations. However, we find that correlations can explain neither excess returns nor volatilities. We find new and important evidence that 'excess returns,' US excess returns,' and 'US volatilities' should be included in the analysis of other countries' correlations and volatilities. The US T-bill-LIBOR interest-rate differential (TED spread) and foreign-exchange market volatility (FXV) negatively affect excess returns; however, the credit-default swap spread's effect is insignificant.

J,"Leshem, D",,,,"Leshem, Dotan",,,What Did the Ancient Greeks Mean by Oikonomia?,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Nearly every economist has at some point in the standard coursework been exposed to a brief explanation that the origin of the word economy can be traced back to the Greek word oikonomia, which in turn is composed of two words: oikos, which is usually translated as household; and nemein, which is best translated as management and dispensation. Thus, the cursory story usually goes, the term oikonomia referred to household management, and while this was in some loose way linked to the idea of budgeting, it has little or no relevance to contemporary economics. This article introduces in more detail what the ancient Greek philosophers meant by oikonomia. It begins with a short history of the word. It then explores some of the key elements of oikonomia, while offering some comparisons and contrasts with modern economic thought. For example, both Ancient Greek oikonomia and contemporary economics study human behavior as a relationship between ends and means which have alternative uses. However, while both approaches hold that the rationality of any economic action is dependent on the frugal use of means, contemporary economics is largely neutral between ends, while in ancient economic theory, an action is considered economically rational only when taken towards a praiseworthy end. Moreover, the ancient philosophers had a distinct view of what constituted such an end-specifically, acting as a philosopher or as an active participant in the life of the city-state.","[Leshem, Dotan] Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel",University of Haifa,"Leshem, D (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-31999 Haifa, Israel.",dotanleshem@yahoo.com,,,,,,,42,37,48,0,5,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The field brings together research in finance and the natural sciences to develop financial and market solutions to some of humanity's most pressing concerns; namely, climate change and shifts in other Earth system processes. Firms need to adjust to these environmental changes, which offer many opportunities for wealth and growth. There are various historical examples of technological breakthroughs over the history of modern markets that have driven growth and wealth; such as, railways, electricity, automobiles, radio, microelectronics, personal computers, biotechnology, and the internet. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement has given the green light to clean technology firms worldwide to start commercializing their patents. This will create the next technological breakthrough - a clean tech revolution that will drive growth and wealth in the same way as earlier breakthroughs.

By using the enterprise surveys carried out by the World Bank in 2005 of nearly 12,400 Chinese firms located in over 100 cities, we find that a rise in the presence of foreign firms increases the extent of the private ownership of domestic firms in a non-linear fashion.

We find evidence of financial liberalization Granger causes stock market efficiency, which is consistent with liberalization leads to efficiency hypothesis. Subsequently, our work makes a fresh contribution to the literature by focusing on informational efficiency of stock markets rather than financial development. Furthermore, we find that a negative long-term relationship between financial liberalization and stock return autocorrelation coexists with a positive short-term relationship between the two. The findings that financial liberalization, which has a deteriorated effect on stock market efficiency in the short-run, but positive impact in the long-run, allow us to draw an analogy similar to the J-curve hypothesis.","[Naghavi, Navaz; Lau, Wee-Yeap] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Naghavi, N (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",navaz.naghavi@gmail.com,"LAU, WEE YEAP/B-2772-2010","LAU, WEE YEAP/0000-0002-3447-9895",,,,,50,11,11,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Team production and remuneration are modeled as a linear public good game with a finite number of periods. The main results are that (a) the appointment of a random allocator improves production so that average incomes of all workers, including the allocator, are higher when compared with voluntary contributions, (b) the introduction of a principal further improves production as well as satisfaction and fairness ratings.

Fertility rates are correlated with short-run economic fluctuations because women delay pregnancy in poor economic times and periods of uncertainty, and increase fertility when conditions improve. Because health insurance reduces the cost of childbirth and medical care for children, the introduction of social health insurance may have the same effect on fertility as a positive income shock. This paper examines whether the introduction of social health insurance in Ghana had a positive, pro-cyclical effect on fertility decisions. Using data from the 2005/2006 Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) conducted shortly after the roll out of the insurance programme and the 2012/2013 GLSS, we compare fertility decisions of insured and uninsured women. To control for self-selection into the insurance programme, we exploit district-level variation in the dates of implementation of the national health insurance to instrument for insurance enrolment. We find evidence of a pro-cyclical fertility effect at the individual level. This is consistent with an increase in national fertility rates observed around the time the programme was introduced. The increase in fertility, however, appears to have been temporary; we find no effect of insurance on fertility in the more recent data.","[Abrokwah, Stephen O.] Swiss Reinsurance Amer Holding Corp, 175 King St, Armonk, NY 10504 USA; [Moser, Christine M.] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, 1903 W Michigan Ave, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA; [Norton, Edward] Univ Michigan, Dept Econ & Hlth Management & Policy, 1415 Washington Hts,M3108 SPH 2, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Western Michigan University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Abrokwah, SO (通讯作者)，Swiss Reinsurance Amer Holding Corp, 175 King St, Armonk, NY 10504 USA.",stephen_abrokwah@swissre.com,"Norton, Edward C/B-2211-2009; , Edward/AAQ-1719-2021",", Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631",,,,,20,3,5,5,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We consider the information transmission problem between two decision makers who take actions in sequence at two decision dates. The first decision maker has private information about a state of nature that is relevant for both decisions, and sends a message to the second. The second decision maker can commit to only observe the message (disclosure), or can retain the option to observe the action of the first decision maker (auditing) or, at some cost, to verify the state. In equilibrium, state verification will never occur and the second decision maker effectively chooses between auditing and disclosure. When the misalignment in preferences reflects an agency bias - a bias in a decision maker's own action relative to that of the other - then the second decision maker chooses to audit in equilibrium. When the misalignment in preferences reflects an ideological bias - one decision maker prefers all actions to be biased relative to the other decision maker - then, for a large enough misalignment, the second decision maker chooses disclosure in equilibrium. Our results indicate that the ability to commit to forego the audit has value in the latter case. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such studies allow variations among countries to be revealed, the contributing factors identified, and the scope for improvement better understood. At the same time, tracking changes or quantifying improvements in energy use or emissions over rime in a country have long been a focus area of researchers and policy makers. To provide a fuller picture on country performance in a multi-country study over time, it would be of interest to integrate the above mentioned spatial and temporal analyses in a single analysis framework. This paper deals with this issue using the technique of index decomposition analysis. A spatial temporal approach is introduced and two application cases are presented to illustrate how the approach can be applied. The first analyzes variations and changes in the aggregate CO2 intensity of electricity production for ten countries from 1990 to 2010, and the second deals with variations and changes in the aggregate energy intensity for eight economic regions of China from 2002 to 2012. In addition, two different ways of presenting the results are introduced. Our study shows that the proposed approach can supplement studies which are conducted purely on a spatial or temporal basis.

This approach is characterized by two key assumptions. The first is that the world interest rate is unaffected by economic developments in the small open economy, an exogeneity assumption. The second assumption is that this exogenous interest rate combined with domestic productivity is sufficient to describe equilibrium choices. We demonstrate the failure of the second assumption by contrasting general and partial equilibrium approaches to the study of a cross-section of small open economies. In doing so, we provide a method for modeling small open economies in general equilibrium that is no more technically demanding than the small open economy approach while preserving much of the value of the general equilibrium approach.

It solves the endogeneity of immigrants' location choices by exploiting a peculiar episode of the German immigration history: the exogenous placement of guest-workers after WWII, one of the largest guest-worker programs on record. The econometric approach accounts for several sources of measurement error and provides a falsification exercise that hypothetically relocates the most language proficient immigrants into ethnic enclaves to test the extent of cross-regional sorting necessary to render the results purely spurious. The results show a robust negative effect of ethnic concentration on immigrants' language ability which is driven by differences in contact rates with natives and not by differences in the willingness to integrate. The paper discusses these findings against the background of a language production function and in the light of feasible policy options to foster the language acquisition of immigrants.

In contrast to previous studies a stock-flow approach is applied to control for the different orders of integration between the stock and flow variables. Panel econometric techniques allowing for international spillovers are employed. Private and public capital stocks are both I(2) and cointegrated. The deviations from the stock equilibrium are not (trend) stationary, but I(1). Utilizing them in a model for investment flows improves the cointegration evidence between the I(1) variables. In fact, private investment flows, GDP and the real interest rate appear to be cointegrated only if the deviations from the stock equilibrium are included. The corresponding error correction equation is well behaved. Therefore, knowledge of the stock relationship is crucial to explain the changes in private investment flows. Overall, the lack of public investment may have restricted private investment and thus GDP growth in the euro area. The results have strong implications for the future direction of fiscal austerity programs to combat the euro area debt crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to synthesize the literature by identifying robust determinants of the shadow economy and addressing related modeling uncertainty. Using three different cross-national shadow measures and employing numerous determinants over hundreds of model combinations, we find that bureaucratic complexity is more significant than monetary severity in driving the shadow economy. Further, the incentives of new shadow entrepreneurs are somewhat different from established shadow operators. A one standard deviation increase in tax complexity increases the overall shadow economy by over ten percent of the mean. In contrast, a similar increase in business startup costs increases the prevalence of new informal entrepreneurs by almost more than double. Further, shadow determinants in developed and developing nations are dissimilar.

J,"Nagel, S",,,,"Nagel, Stefan",,,The Liquidity Premium of Near-Money Assets,QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article examines the link between the opportunity cost of money and time-varying liquidity premia of near-money assets. Higher interest rates imply higher opportunity costs of holding money and hence a higher premium for the liquidity service benefits of assets that are close substitutes for money. Consistent with this theory, short-term interest rates in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada have a strong positive relationship with the liquidity premium of Treasury bills and other near-money assets over periods going back to the 1920s. Once the opportunity cost of money is taken into account, Treasury security supply variables lose their explanatory power for the liquidity premium, except for transitory short-run effects. These findings indicate a high elasticity of substitution between money and near-money assets. As a consequence, a central bank that follows an interest rate operating target not only elastically accommodates and neutralizes shocks to money demand, but effectively also shocks to near-money asset supply and demand.","[Nagel, Stefan] Univ Michigan, Natl Bur Econ Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Nagel, Stefan] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Nagel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Natl Bur Econ Res, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Nagel, S (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,54,94,120,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

It is shown that Eucken's criticism of democracy is directly related to his liberal conviction: similar to Hayek, Eucken anticipates the possibility of interest groups to engage in rent seeking through the democratic process. In view of Hayek's distinction between the basic ideal of democracy and its institutional realisation, it is argued that Eucken's criticism relates to the latter aspect. Furthermore, the paper maintains that a comprehensive liberalism as represented by Eucken and Hayek implies a constitutional concept of democracy.","[Nientiedt, Daniel; Kohler, Ekkehard A.] Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany",,"Nientiedt, D (通讯作者)，Walter Eucken Inst, Goethestr 10, D-79100 Freiburg, Germany.",nientiedt@eucken.de,,,,,,,67,16,18,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This notion of maxmin multi-utility representation,generalizes the recently proposed notions of multi-utility representation for preorders and justifiable preferences for complete and quasitransitive relations.

We define a measure for the degree of cooperation, analogous to the market conduct parameter of Cyert et al. (1973), Geroski et al. (1987), Lofaro (1999), and Symeonidis (2000). This parameter is used to assess the incentives of different OPEC members to collude. We find that heterogeneity in OPEC and the supplies of the non-OPEC fringe create strong incentives against collusion. More specifically, OPEC's supply strategy, although observed to be substantially more restrictive than that of a Cournot-Nash oligopoly, is found to still be more accommodative than that of a perfect cartel. The strategy involves allocating larger than proportionate quotas to smaller and relatively costlier producers, as if to bribe their participation in the cartel. This is in contrast to predictions of the standard cartel model that such producers should be allocated relatively more stringent quotas. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cartel collusion is more likely to besustained for elastic than for inelastic demand. Since global oil demand is well known to be inelastic, this observation provides another structural explanation for why OPEC behavior is inconsistent with that of a perfect cartel. Our study points to multiple headwinds that limit OPEC's ability to mark up the oil price. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The short-lived workers in the safe occupation are however made worse-off, more so when the social objective includes a higher social weight on short-lived individuals to redress the implicit bias towards long-lived that the unweighted utilitarian objective entails. The maximin criterion ensures equal utility for short-lived workers regardless of occupation but those in the safe occupation consume the most when young, the least when old and retire the earliest.

The impact of globalization on the welfare of workers and aggregate output depends on the degree of substitutability between domestic workers and imported inputs. When the degree of substitutability is high (low), then globalization reduces (increases) wages and increases (reduces) unemployment. Irrespective of the substitutability, free trade doesn't maximize the aggregate output. A small tariff (import subsidy) increases aggregate output when the substitutability is low (high), however, it can exacerbate the distributional conflict. Domestic labor market policies such as unemployment benefits and severance payments can protect workers against labor income risk but the firing restrictions do not. Free trade is optimal when labor market policies provide insurance against unemployment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nevertheless, this relationship has been rarely studied in a strategic game. In this paper, we study wealth effects in a strategic contest game. Two opposing effects arise: wealth reduces the marginal cost of effort but it also reduces the marginal benefit of winning the contest. We consider three types of contests which vary depending on whether rents and efforts are commensurable with wealth. Our theoretical analysis shows that the effects of wealth are strongly contest-dependent. It thus does not support general claims that the rich lobby more or that low economic growth and wealth inequality spur conflicts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We find that the transfers reach a small proportion of households with incomes below a relative poverty line, they have high non take-up rates, and large proportions of the recipients are neither poor nor entitled to receive the benefits. Unsurprisingly, although an important income source for poor households, the benefits have a very small impact on reducing the poverty rates. We show that our results are robust to potential underreporting of benefit receipt in the household survey.

Unlike standard models of strategic thinking, in this framework the player's depth of reasoning is endogenously determined, and it can be disentangled from his beliefs over his opponent's cognitive bound. In our approach, individuals act as if they follow a cost-benefit analysis. The depth of reasoning is a function of the player's cognitive abilities and his payoffs. The costs are exogenous and represent the game-theoretical sophistication of the player; the benefit instead is related to the game payoffs. Behaviour is in turn determined by the individual's depth of reasoning and his beliefs about the reasoning process of the opponent. Thus, in our framework, payoffs not only affect individual choices in the traditional sense, but they also shape the cognitive process itself. Our model delivers testable implications on players' chosen actions as incentives and opponents change. We then test the model's predictions with an experiment. We administer different treatments that vary beliefs over payoffs and opponents, as well as beliefs over opponents' beliefs. The results of this experiment, which are not accounted for by current models of reasoning in games, strongly support our theory. We also show that the predictions of our model are highly consistent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with well-known unresolved empirical puzzles. Our approach therefore serves as a novel, unifying framework of strategic thinking that allows for predictions across games.","[Alaoui, Larbi] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Alaoui, Larbi] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Penta, Antonio] Univ Wisconsin Madison, Dept Econ, Madison, WI USA",Pompeu Fabra University; Barcelona School of Economics; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Alaoui, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.;Alaoui, L (通讯作者)，Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Alaoui, Larbi/L-4686-2014","Penta, Antonio/0000-0003-3796-8245",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-25295]; UW-Madison Graduate School Research Grant Competition,Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); UW-Madison Graduate School Research Grant Competition,"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation under project ECO2011-25295 (L.A.) and the UW-Madison Graduate School Research Grant Competition (A.P.).

Our interpretation is that highly trusting individuals tend to assume too much social risk and to be cheated more often, ultimately performing less well than those with a belief close to the mean trustworthiness of the population. However, individuals with overly pessimistic beliefs avoid being cheated, but give up profitable opportunities, therefore underperforming. The cost of either too much or too little trust is comparable to the income lost by forgoing college.

We look at three different unconventional tools: excess liquidity, longer-term refinancing operations and securities held for monetary policy purposes following the decomposition of the ECB's Weekly Financial Statements. We first identify series of ECB policy shocks at the euro area aggregate level by removing the systematic component of each series and controlling for announcement effects. We second include these exogenous shocks in country-specific structural VAR, in which we control for credit demand. The main result is that only the pass-through from the ECB rate to interest rates has been effective. Unconventional policies have had uneven effects and primarily on interest rates.","[Creel, Jerome; Hubert, Paul] Sci Po, OFCE, Paris, France; [Creel, Jerome] ESCP Europe, Paris, France; [Viennot, Mathilde] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; Paris School of Economics,"Hubert, P (通讯作者)，69 Quai Orsay, F-75007 Paris, France.",paul.hubert@sciencespo.fr,,,European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [266800],European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7)(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [grant number no 266800 (FESSUD)].,,28,10,10,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that the existence of asset bubbles is contingent upon the unemployment rate: a bubble (non-bubble) regime arises in equilibrium when unemployment is relative low (high). Our framework focuses on the boom and bust of asset bubbles caused by changes in fundamental variables, not a stochastic probability. Then, as labour market frictions generate a negative relationship between the unemployment rate and economic growth, we find that the bubble regime exhibits a higher growth rate than the non-bubble regime. Furthermore, we show that policy or parameter changes that have a positive influence on the labour market shift the economy from a non-bubble regime to a bubble regime.","[Hashimoto, Ken-ichi] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokko Dai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan; [Im, Ryonghun] Japan Soc Promot Sci, Tokyo, Japan; [Im, Ryonghun] Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Young Scientists, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan",Kobe University; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Kobe University,"Hashimoto, K (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Nada Ku, 2-1 Rokko Dai, Kobe, Hyogo 6578501, Japan.",hashimoto@econ.kobe-u.ac.jp; ryonghunim@gmail.com,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [16K03624, 24730209, 16J04950]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24730209, 16K03624, 16J04950] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) [No. 16K03624], Grant-in-Aid for Young Scientists (B) [No. 24730209], and Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows [No. 16J04950] from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",,42,8,8,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We rely on a New Keynesian DSGE model with a banking sector in which we introduce imperfect information about a limited enforcement problem. Bank managers like to divert resources and can increase the share of diversion. This can only be observed imperfectly by depositors. The ensuing imperfect information generates a higher volatility of the business cycle. Spillovers from the financial sector to the real economy are higher and shocks in general are considerably amplified in the transition period until agents' learning is complete. Volatility and other second-order moments also display an amplification under the learning setup compared with the rational expectations framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Indexation, implemented during the 1981 federal tax overhaul, and active monetary policy, constitute necessary conditions for a unique rational expectations equilibrium in standard New Keynesian models with a generalized, progressive labor income tax. Additionally, fixing the monetary regime shows that indexation reduces overall volatility in the model as well as the contribution of supply-side disturbances. Together, these results support a fiscal extension to the good policy hypothesis of the Great Moderation and encourage further indexation of the United States tax code. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

On the one hand, this firm can benefit from generous tax depreciation allowances, on the other hand it faces a default risk. Our aim is to study the effects of tax depreciation allowances in a risky environment. As will be shown in our numerical analysis, generous tax depreciation allowances lead to a decrease in a firm's leverage and, in most cases, cause a reduction in default risk. This result has a strong policy implication, in that it shows that an investment stimulus pack is expected neither to increase the default risk nor to cause financial instability.","[Panteghini, Paolo M.] Univ Brescia, CESifo, Brescia, Italy; [Panteghini, Paolo M.] Univ Brescia, AccounTax Lab, Brescia, Italy; [Vergalli, Sergio] Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy; [Vergalli, Sergio] FEEM, Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia; University of Brescia; University of Brescia; Fondazione Mattei,"Vergalli, S (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Brescia, Italy.;Vergalli, S (通讯作者)，FEEM, Brescia, Italy.",paolo.panteghini@unibs.it; sergio.vergalli@unibs.it,"Sergio, Vergalli/U-5327-2019; Panteghini, Paolo/P-4581-2015","Panteghini, Paolo/0000-0001-6564-0816",,,,,29,14,15,2,34,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

An Application of an Endogenous Prize Contest with Asymmetric Players,SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RENT-SEEKING; INCENTIVES,"When a manufacturer advertises, what is the impact on retailer advertising? I analyze a contest model of advertising where total advertising by the manufacturer and by retailers determines market size, and the relative level of advertising by each retailer determines market share. If retailers are symmetric I show that there is a crowding-in effect so increased manufacturer advertising increases retail advertising. But if one retailer is stronger, then marginal increases in manufacturer advertising have a crowding-out effect on retailer advertising, while sufficiently large increases have a crowding-in effect by jump-starting competition between retailers for the larger market. Furthermore, asymmetric abilities in such contests can lead the weaker player to effectively drop out of the contest, thereby undermining the ability of increased prizes to increase effort by intensifying competition.","[Ridlon, Robert] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Ridlon, R (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Business Econ & Publ Policy, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",rridlon@indiana.edu,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The former emphasizes variables measured according to formal decision theory; the latter instead emphasizes variables derived from the factor analysis of trait assessments. In a data set on trainee truckers in a large US company, we provide a systematic assessment of the empirical pattern of relationships and correlations between the measurements used in these two approaches by comparing the predictive power of variables derived from personality theory and decision theory for several individual characteristics and outcomes, and relating the two sets of measurements to each other. We show that personality traits have a comparable or stronger statistical predictive power than do economic preferences for several dependent variables, including credit score, job persistence, and heavy truck accidents. They also have strong predictive power for Body Mass Index (BMI) and smoking status. Further, decision theory and personality variables are meaningfully related. For example, we confirm that cognitive ability explains a substantial part of time preferences, and find that Neuroticism and cognitive ability together explain attitudes toward risk. In an experimental game, cognitive skills and Agreeableness explain important aspects of strategic behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper advances the literature on cross-sector correlations by making unemployment an explicit feature of the model. I construct a two-sector model with search and matching friction, wage rigidity, and capital adjustment costs. The model explains the positive cross-sector correlation through characterizing movements into and out of unemployment in both sectors. Moreover, the results suggest a link between the co-movement and the unemployment volatility puzzles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J,"Amato, M; Fantacci, L",,,,"Amato, Massimo; Fantacci, Luca",,,Failures on the market and market failures: a complementary currency for bankruptcy procedures,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bankruptcies; Complementary currencies; Clearing; Liquidity preference,,"One of the most widespread implications of the Great Financial Crisis has been the increase in bankruptcies across advanced economies. The traditional approach to the problem of insolvencies is constrained by deeply ingrained concepts of money and credit and by the institutions in which those concepts are embodied, according to which the only way to discharge a debt is a payment in money. This paper deals with a peculiar project elaborated within the Italian Ministry of Justice to address the problem of the growing amount of uncollectibles involved in bankruptcy procedures. The project entails a new form of articulation between money and credit, which overturns the traditional logic of liquidation by transforming creditors of bankruptcy procedures, passively waiting to be paid, into active operators, capable of sustaining demand. This goal is pursued by converting part of their credits into purchasing power that can be immediately spent in the auctions for the assets of bankrupt companies, thereby increasing the efficiency of bankruptcy procedures, accelerating the reallocation of assets and maximising the satisfaction of creditors. The projects may be seen as a complementary currency characterised by a functional, and not by a territorial, delimitation. It incorporates some of the features that have been recently experimented with, with varying degree of success, within both the official and alternative monetary systems: endogenous money creation, targeted loans and demurrage. The present paper aims at illustrating the theoretical underpinnings of the project and its implication for the question of devising an alternative to current financial institutions.","[Amato, Massimo; Fantacci, Luca] Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy",Bocconi University,"Fantacci, L (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",luca.fantacci@unibocconi.it,"Fantacci, Luca/AAX-6829-2021; Amato, Massimo/AAC-7387-2022","FANTACCI, LUCA/0000-0001-7485-3282",,,,,36,4,5,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

An increase in longevity or expectations thereof puts downward pressure on the real interest rate, as agents build up their savings in anticipation of a longer retirement period. A reduction in the population growth rate has two counteracting effects. On the one hand, capital per-worker rises, thus inducing lower real interest rates through a reduction in the marginal product of capital. On the other hand, the decline in population growth eventually leads to a higher dependency ratio (the fraction of retirees to workers). Because retirees save less than workers, this compositional effect lowers the aggregate savings rate and pushes real rates up. We calibrate a tractable life-cycle model to capture salient features of the demographic transition in developed economies, and find that its overall effect is a reduction of the equilibrium interest rate by at least one and a half percentage points between 1990 and 2014. Demographic trends have important implications for the conduct of monetary policy, especially in light of the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates. Other policies can offset the negative effects of the demographic transition on real rates with different degrees of success. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on three aspects of structural change, which are connected and are correlated to variety, market concentration, and economic growth: (i) product quality; (ii) firms' mark-ups; and (iii) imitation of consumer preferences for price and quality. We model the interactions among several aspects of structural change such as firm size and hierarchical structure, innovation in capital vintages, the emergence of social classes, income distribution, and consumer preferences across and within classes. We find that market concentration has a significant and positive impact on economic growth only in the presence of sufficiently large demand. The strongest effects emerge in the presence of a more skewed firm size distribution and firms producing higher priced and higher quality goods. We find also that this effect is influenced strongly by different aspects of structural change. Changes in the behaviour (or income) of the less wealthy income classes is crucial as is investment in new capital vintages, and the emergence of diverse income classes with heterogeneous consumption preferences. In contrast, we find that supply side product variety, coeteris paribus, has no significant effect on growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previous meta-analyses suggested that the evidence on agglomeration externalities is strongly context-specific. Expanding an earlier analysis of 31 articles, we seek to draw in this paper more robust conclusions by means of the statistical evidence for agglomeration externalities presented in 73 scientific articles, all building on the seminal work of Glaeser etal. (1992). Our results confirm that the heterogeneity among studies is huge and can only be partially accounted for by means of an ordered probit analysis. Additionally, some evidence of publication bias is found. We conclude that the conventional lines of inquiry in this literature may now have reached strongly diminishing returns. New lines of inquiry, using rich micro-level data on firms and workers, dynamic general equilibrium models at the macro level, more attention for spatial and temporal variation in the impacts of agglomeration, and further investigations into the spatial scope of externalities are promising avenues for further research that can enhance our understanding of how agglomeration externalities continue to fuel our increasingly urbanized world.","[de Groot, Henri L.

The prototypical examples of the former are the Allais experiments and of the latter are the Ellsberg experiments. Although the lotteries from the former have objectively specified probabilities, the participants in both kinds of experiments may be susceptible to small deviations in their subjective beliefs. These may result from a variety of factors that are difficult to check in an experimental setting: including deviations in the understanding and trust regarding the experiment, its instructions and its method. Intuitively, an experiment is robust if it is tolerant to small deviations in subjective beliefs in models that are in an appropriate way close to the analyst's model. The contribution of this paper lies in the formalization of these ideas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The more is known about environmental patterns, the more growth can be obtained by redistributing resources accordingly among the evolving sectors (e.g. bet-hedging). Formal equations show that the amount of information about the environmental pattern is directly linked to the growth potential. This can be quantified by treating both information and knowledge formally through metrics like Shannon's mutual information and algorithmic Kolmogorov complexity from information theory and computer science. These mathematical metrics emerge naturally from our evolutionary equations. As such, information becomes a quantifiable ingredient of growth. The policy mechanism to convert information and knowledge into growth is structural adjustment. The presented approach is applied to the empirical case of U.S. export to showcase how information converts into growth potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Consistent with the theory of MNEs, I find that RTAs reduce horizontal FDI from intra-RTA countries and increase export-platform and total FDI from extra-RTA countries. Moreover, the overall effects of RTAs are positive for extra-RTA FDI, but inconclusive for intra-RTA FIR The results also support the effect of integrated markets' economies of scale in inducing extra-RTA FDI.

The main assertion is that stock recommendations create heuristic effects among investors near the publication date of the recommendation. The ambiguity of the recommendations hinders investors' reliable and unequivocal evaluation in investment decisions. There are studies in this field for different stock markets and periods of time, but our research added significant new knowledge about the functioning of the Polish stock exchange.

While some economies rebounded quickly after the 2009 output collapse, others are undergoing a protracted further decline as part of an extensive deleveraging process. At the same time, inflation has been subdued throughout the whole of the euro area and intra-euro-area exchange rates have hardly moved. We interpret these facts through the lens of a two-country model of a currency union. We find that deleveraging in one country generates deflationary spillovers which cannot be contained by monetary policy, as it becomes constrained by the zero lower bound.

The primary objective is to analyze the effect of short-term differences in tenure security in the year of a reallocation, employing the past history of land shifts as a source of exogenous variation in current tenure security. The results show that a decrease in the probability of losing the current plot yields an increase in agricultural inputs and production with no change in non-agricultural investments, conditional on household fixed effects that control for any unobserved and time-invariant characteristics of the household. This suggests that even small increases in the security of tenure enjoyed by households could yield benefits in terms of greater agricultural output. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The paper reviews supply-side determinants of growth using a growth accounting framework, and also assesses major demand-side factors driving potential growth, including exports, capital formation and household consumption.","[Lin, Justin Yifu] Peking Univ, Ctr New Struct Econ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wan, Guanghua] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Res Dept, Tokyo, Japan; [Morgan, Peter J.] Asian Dev Bank Inst, Res Dept, Res, Tokyo, Japan",Peking University,"Morgan, PJ (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank Inst, Res Dept, Res, Tokyo, Japan.",justinlin@nsd.pku.edu.cn; gwan@adbi.org; pmorgan@adbi.org,,,,,,,38,6,6,2,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2016,24.0,5,,,SI,,20,41,,10.1111/cwe.12173,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DW4FM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383598000003,0

When we decompose the aggregate trade balances into the intra balances (trade balance vis-a-vis the euro area) and the extra balances (trade balance vis-a-vis the rest of the world), we find that typically the change in the dynamics of the aggregate trade balance resulted from a change in the dynamics of the intra balance.","[Nieminen, Mika; Junttila, Juha] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of Jyvaskyla,"Nieminen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, SF-40351 Jyvaskyla, Finland.",,"Nieminen, Mika/AAX-4217-2020","Nieminen, Mika/0000-0002-9969-1803; Junttila, Juha/0000-0003-4144-126X",Bjorn Saven Finnish American Scholarship; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,Bjorn Saven Finnish American Scholarship; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,"The authors would like to thank two anonymous referees as well as the participants of the 47th Money, Macro and Finance Research Group Annual Conference at Cardiff University for their comments and Zsolt Darvas (Bruegel) for providing the real effective exchange rate data with specific weighting matrices.

Although researchers have extensively explored the concept of competitiveness in each of these respective categories, an understanding of the relationship between levels of competitiveness is lacking. The simple aggregation of indicators to approximate broader categories of competitiveness is challenged as a robust solution. This paper proposes an alternative solution to aggregating firm-level competitiveness, based on the profit-growth nexus. Using data collected from SMEs in two ICT clusters, the size-profit-growth relationships were tested. Based on 83 Hungarian and 71 Australian responses, positive relationships were found in both samples, demonstrating high cluster-level competitiveness. It is argued that this outcome better represents cluster-level competitiveness based on firm-level data, than other - linear and additive - aggregation methods. However, a comparative examination of the data across the clusters showed significant differences between the results of the two samples, ascertaining limitations for the generalisability of the results.","[Perenyi, Aron] Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Swinburne Business Sch, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship,Int Busi, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Perényi, A (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Swinburne Business Sch, Dept Business Technol & Entrepreneurship,Int Busi, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",aperenyi@swin.edu.au,"Perenyi, Aron/B-3613-2014","Perenyi, Aron/0000-0003-2606-9738",,,,,56,7,7,0,14,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We hypothesise that the number of times that respondents shift their visual attention between the alternatives in a choice set reflects their stated choice certainty. Based on one of the largest samples of eye tracking data in a DCE to date, we find evidence in favor of our hypothesis. We also link eye tracking observations to model-based choice certainty through parameterization of the scale function in a random parameters logit model. We find that choices characterized by more frequent gaze shifting do indeed exhibit a higher degree of error variance, however, this effects is insignificant once response time is controlled for. Overall, findings suggest that eye tracking can provide an observable and exogenous variable indicative of choice certainty, potentially improving the handling of respondent certainty and thus the performance of the choice models in DCEs. However, in our empirical case the benefits of using eye movement data as a proxy for choice certainty in the choice model are small at best, and our results suggest that response time provides a better proxy for stated choice certainty and provides larger improvements in model performance.

Our numerical results show that commitment rules can enforce a determinate and learnable REE for all parameter constellations considered, whereas discretionary rules are not always able to enforce the same desirable outcome in the economy. We also examine different types of misapprehensions in policy-making and find that an incorrect assessment of the economy's true structure by the central bank greatly affects its capability to enforce a determinate and learnable, although suboptimal, REE. Thus, our numerical results highlight the relevance of this type of analysis for the design and conduct of monetary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use a comprehensive newly assembled database including 69 provinces over 20-year sub-samples covering the 1861-1901 period. We find robust evidence that in 1861, at Unification, gender equality in education is still positively associated with the medieval pattern of commerce, along the routes that connected Italian cities among themselves and with the rest of the world. The beneficial effect of medieval commerce on female education relative to male persists after we control for a broad set of confounding factors reflecting the geographic, economic, political, and cultural differentiation of medieval Italy. The long-term influence of medieval commerce dissipates only gradually after nationally-directed educational policies are implemented after Unification. This is consistent with the hypothesis that its transmission occurs through slow-changing cultural beliefs, as confirmed by further suggestive evidence of its influence on contemporary outcomes related to gender and family culture.

Moreover, the one-month-ahead directional forecast is found to perform significantly better than a 50:50 coin toss.

Following this methodology, we find that longer civil conflicts are associated with a faster recovery process. We further investigate this issue by exploring correlations with components of GDP, military spending, institutions and aid and find heterogeneous effects of these channels by duration of conflict. Higher government spending is correlated with faster recoveries post longer conflicts, and higher consumption spending is linked to faster recoveries following shorter conflicts. Military spending appears to be driving the government expenditure that makes countries recover from longer conflicts.

Inflationary shocks when transmitted to real output growth cause a shift of investment to fixed return products as a hedge against the uncertainty of returns on equity investment under Islamic profit-loss sharing contracts. This study examines the transmission of inflationary shocks to the real economy for nine Muslim-majority countries (Bahrain, Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey) that have introduced Islamic banking, all except Iran within dual-banking systems. A structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) framework is deployed to understand macroeconomic relationships using annual data from the late 1970s to 2014. The key finding is that inflationary shocks affect real interest and exchange rates which in turn impact real output growth. The paper argues that the absorption of inflationary shocks in real interest and exchange rates is the outcome of rigidities in nominal interest and exchange rates within repressed financial systems. Policy regimes that allow for greater adjustment in nominal interest and exchange rates under a deregulated financial system would offer better shock absorption capacity which would lead to less volatility in inflation, real interest and exchange rates, and real output growth. The resulting more stable macroeconomic environment would be more conducive to the development of an Islamic financial sector that would promote economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on small sets of players such as countries in a geographically confined area, we use the concept of evolutionary stability in finite populations. We find that players' evolutionarily stable preferences widen the range of peaceful resource allocations that are rejected in favor of violent conflict, compared to the Nash equilibrium outcomes. Relative advantages in fighting strength are reflected in the equilibrium set of peaceful resource allocations.","[Konrad, Kai A.; Morath, Florian] Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Dept Publ Econ, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Morath, F (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Dept Publ Econ, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",florian.morath@tax.mpg.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB/TR 15],German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was financially supported by German Research Foundation (DFG) [grant number SFB/TR 15].,,57,7,7,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

A closer look at the interval production task,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Overconfidence; Miscalibration; Methodology; Experimental economics; Experimental finance,CONFIDENCE; ACCURACY; JUDGMENT,"The most common test for overconfidence in the form of miscalibration-the interval production task (IP)-is based on the assumption that people internalize requested confidence levels. We demonstrate experimentally that decision makers' perceived confidence is, however, unaffected by variations in the requested confidence level. In addition, we find large heterogeneity in perceived confidence that the traditional IP measure fails to account for. We show that the alternative measure based on decision makers' perceived confidence by contrast yields coherent, moderate overconfidence levels. Our evidence suggests that the consistency of the two measures is limited and that they are related to different individual characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Relative productivities are broken down into the human capital embodied in skilled workers and relative physical productivities (reflecting production techniques). I find that skilled workers from poorer countries embody less human capital and are also relatively less physically productive. Furthermore, results show that production techniques are inappropriate for most low-income countries, and these countries experience large increases in GDP per capita by increasing the relative physical productivity of skilled to unskilled workers. This suggests that there are significant barriers to the adoption of skill-complementary technologies.","[Okoye, Dozie] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Okoye, D (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, 6214 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",cokoye@dal.ca,,"Okoye, Dozie/0000-0003-0545-1786",,,,,65,4,4,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-6598,1468-2354,,INT ECON REV,Int.
