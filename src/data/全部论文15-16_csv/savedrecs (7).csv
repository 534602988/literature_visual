We develop a sectoral model to show how changes in the regulations governing cellulosic fuel production affect the equilibrium quantity of cellulosic ethanol. Based on model calibration for Washington State, we find that existing low-cost waivers purchased by obligated parties in lieu of cellulosic fuel production negate the effectiveness of the Renewable Fuel Standard to induce the production and consumption of cellulosic biofuels. However, raising waiver price slightly relative to the status quo significantly increases the equilibrium quantity of cellulosic ethanol. The high cost of cellulosic ethanol production is often cited as the cause of the lack of cellulosic ethanol production, which is used to justify low waiver prices. Our policy message is the converse: the low current waiver price significantly contributes to the cellulosic ethanol market stagnation in the context of the current biofuel policy.

The empirical analysis is based on a randomized controlled trial, conducted in two different counties. We find no effects on women but positive effects for men. In one county, the program increased men's earnings in the short term by 9%, possibly by taxing leisure. In the second county, earnings also increased in the longer run, by about 9%, possibly because of a removal of labor market frictions. The positive effects of the program are heterogeneous, with taxing of leisure time primarily affecting low income earners while removing labor market frictions affecting high income earners.

Results suggest that consolidation greatly increased profitability in an industry with otherwise declining profitability. Groups with broader national coverage attract more advertising per station. Joint ownership of two stations within a market and network ownership both allow for significant cost savings. There is some evidence that within-market consolidation allows stations to achieve local market power.

I construct an OLG general equilibrium model with recursive preferences and housing disaster shocks. The likelihood and magnitude of housing disasters are inferred from historical housing market experiences in the OECD. The model shows that despite the rarity of housing disasters, Canadian households would willingly give up 6 percent of their non-housing consumption each year to eliminate the housing disaster risk. The welfare evaluation of this risk, however, varies considerably across age groups. The risk translates into a welfare loss of as much as 16 percent of annual non-housing consumption for the old, but a welfare gain of 2 percent for the young. This asymmetry stems from the fact that, compared to the old, younger households suffer less from house price declines in disaster periods, due to smaller holdings of housing assets, and benefit from lower house prices in normal periods, due to the negative price effect of disaster risk.

By employing high frequency data, we find that both leverage and volatility feedback effects are at work and highly persistent in the U.S. REIT market. The leverage effect dominates the volatility feedback effect. More importantly, both effects are found nonlinear - a feature matching the tendency of the financial market to often change its behavior. Further analysis suggests that the nonlinearity arises from multiple sources (e.g. regime switching, structural breaks, and outliers). Our findings are robust to different data sampling frequencies. All in all, they lead to a better understanding of the recent movement of REIT volatility and have profound implications for asset pricing. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The increase in innovative activity is concentrated among private-to-private transactions with a 14% increase in the quality-adjusted patent stock.

The effect of alcohol drinking on bargaining,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Alcohol consumption; Bargaining; Cursed equilibrium; Adverse selection,EMPLOYMENT,"Alcohol drinking during business negotiation is a very common practice, particularly in some East Asian countries. Does alcohol consumption affect negotiator's strategy and consequently the outcome of the negotiation? If so, what is the mechanism through which alcohol impacts negotiator's behavior? We investigate the effect of a moderate amount of alcohol on negotiation using controlled experiments. Subjects are randomly matched into pairs to play a bargaining game with adverse selection. In the game, each subject is given a private endowment. The total endowment is scaled up and shared equally between the pair provided that they agree to collaborate. It is found that a moderate amount of alcohol consumption increases subjects' willingness to collaborate, thus improving their average payoff. We find that alcohol consumption increases neither subjects' preference for risk nor altruism. A possible explanation for the increase in the likelihood of collaboration is that subjects under the influence of alcohol are more cursed in the sense of Eyster and Rabin (2005), which is supported by the estimation results of a structural model of quantal response equilibrium.

It is an updated and improved version of the original battle of perspectives model, described in Janssen (1996) and Janssen/de Vries (1998). The model integrates agents with differing beliefs about economic growth and the sensitivity of the climate system and places them in environments corresponding or non-corresponding to their beliefs. In a second step, different agent types are ruling the world conjointly. Using a learning procedure based on some operators known from Genetic Algorithms, the model shows how they adapt wrong beliefs over time. It is thus an evolutionary model of climate protection decisions. The paper argues that such models may help in analyzing why cost-minimizing protection paths, derived from integrated assessment models A la Nordhaus/Sztorc (2013), are not followed. Although this view is supported by numerous authors, few such models exist. With the battle of perspectives 2.0 the paper offers a contribution to their development.

In addition, an aging Japanese society implies that public expenditures and transfers payments relative to output are projected to continue to rise until at least 2050. In this paper we use a standard growth model to measure the size of this burden in the form of additional taxes required to finance these projected expenditures and to stabilize government debt. The fiscal adjustment needed is very large, in the range of 30-40% of total consumption expenditures. Using a distorting tax such as the consumption tax or the labor income tax requires either tax to rise to unprecedented highs, although the former is much less distorting than the latter. The extremely high tax rates we find highlight the importance of considering alternatives that attenuate the projected increases in public spending and/or enlarge the tax base. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The prioritized projects of the MPAC mainly focus on specific hard or soft infrastructure projects connecting one remote area of an ASEAN member state to another and thus fail to capture the full potential of the infrastructure because of neglected important links within a state. On the other hand, the CADP emphasizes the importance of economic corridors or linkages between a large cluster and another cluster. Our simulation analysis shows that CADP projects will result in an addition to gross domestic product (GDP) of $US 1544bn over the period from 2021 to 2030 (in 2010 dollars) or an impact on ASEAN countries that is 12 times larger than MPAC projects. The results strongly suggest that the CADP projects should be adopted and implemented to fully realize the potential economic growth of the ASEAN countries.

The results obtained indicate a causal relation proceeding from deviation between the growth rates of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and target GDP to variation in the three-month market interest rate. The same analyses do not, however, appear to confirm the existence of a significant inverse causal relation from variation in the market interest rate to deviation between the nominal and target GDP growth rates. Similar results were obtained on replacing the market interest rate with the European Central Bank refinancing interest rate. This confirmation of only one of the two directions of causality does not support an interpretation of monetary policy based on the nominal GDP targeting rule and gives rise to doubt in more general terms as to the applicability of the Taylor rule and all the conventional rules of monetary policy to the case in question. The results appear instead to be more in line with other possible approaches, such as those based on post Keynesian analyses of monetary theory and policy and more specifically the so-called solvency rule (Brancaccio and Fontana, 2013, 2015). These lines of research challenge the simplistic argument that the scope of monetary policy consists in the stabilization of inflation, real GDP, or nominal income around a natural equilibrium level. Rather, they suggest that central banks actually follow a more complex purpose, which is the political regulation of the financial system with particular reference to the relations between creditors and debtors and the related solvency of economic units.","[Brancaccio, Emiliano] Univ Sannio, Polit Econ & Int Econ, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Benevento, Italy; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Leeds, Monetary Econ, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Fontana, Giuseppe] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Benevento, Italy; [Lopreite, Milena] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Catanzaro, Italy; [Realfonzo, Riccardo] Univ Sannio, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Polit Econ, Benevento, Italy",University of Sannio; University of Leeds; University of Sannio; Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro; University of Sannio,"Brancaccio, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sannio, Polit Econ & Int Econ, Dept Law Econ Management & Quantitat Methods DEMM, Benevento, Italy.",,"LOPREITE, Milena/HTN-0875-2023","LOPREITE, Milena/0000-0002-4093-9309; BRANCACCIO, Emiliano/0000-0001-7765-3892",,,,,61,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

J,"Collier, P",,,,"Collier, Paul",,,The cultural foundations of economic failure: A conceptual toolkit,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION,,,English,Article,,,,,,Culture; Beliefs; Social networks; Cultural change,,"This paper proposes a framework for integrating mental constructs into economic analysis. It considers three types of belief: identities, narratives and norms. Identities influence preferences; narratives influence how causal relationships are (mis)understood; norms determine self-imposed constraints. The beliefs are acquired pre-rationally, through participation in social networks which are initial endowments; subsequent choice of network participation is path dependent. Actors rationally maximize their utility subject to these beliefs, but the beliefs themselves are contaminated by these endowments of irrationality. In equilibrium, beliefs and networks are locally stable and constitute a 'culture': the culture can be that of an organization, an entire society, or a family. Local stability is achieved partly through interactions between the three types of belief, and partly through the interaction of beliefs and networks. A dysfunctional culture generates behaviour that yields bad outcomes. If these forces are strong, Bayesian updating from mistakes can be frustrated: dysfunctional cultures can be traps. Principals can use various control variables to improve (or preserve) outcomes by targeting beliefs. The framework enables a systematic approach to dysfunctional cultures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, at a rational expectations equilibrium, the agents' expectations may follow from beliefs that explain poorly the observed history, even among those rationalizing their choices. This paper shows, firstly, that if agents hold rationally formed expectations instead - in the sense of following from beliefs that explain history better than any other beliefs justifying their choices - then allocations unsupported by rational expectations can be shown to be equilibrium outcomes. By means of this result, it is established, secondly, that adding the common knowledge of the rationality of the formation of expectations to that of the rationality of choices and of market clearing, still does not suffice to guarantee rational expectations. Finally, the rationally formed expectations equilibria produced in this paper exhibit a sunspot-like volatility that, interestingly enough, do not rely on an explicit sunspot mechanism.","[Davila, Julio] Univ C Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium",,"Dávila, J (通讯作者)，Univ C Louvain, Ctr Operat Res & Econometr, Louvain La Neuve, Belgium.",julio.davila@uclouvain.be,"DAVILA, Julio/ABE-2802-2020","DAVILA, Julio/0000-0002-5827-9118","Belgian F.R.S-FNRS [MIS-Ulysse 6007.09, PDR T.0044.13]",Belgian F.R.S-FNRS(Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS),Research funding from the research grants MIS-Ulysse 6007.09 and PDR T.0044.13 of the Belgian F.R.S-FNRS is gratefully acknowledged.,,25,1,1,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

The vehicle of analysis is a medium-scale New Keynesian DSGE model consisting of two heterogeneous countries. The model is solved using data from Germany and Italy. Our solutions imply that a switch to flexible exchange rates and independent monetary policies would have negligible welfare implications. A similar result applies when we add interregional fiscal transfers as insurance. By contrast, the addition of fiscal transfers as redistribution has non-trivial implications and these depend crucially on whether such one-sided transfers trigger moral hazard behavior.","[Economides, George; Philippopoulos, Apostolis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece; [Economides, George; Philippopoulos, Apostolis] CESifo, Athens, Greece; [Varthalitis, Petros] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Glasgow,"Economides, G (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Athens, Greece.;Economides, G (通讯作者)，CESifo, Athens, Greece.",gecon@aueb.gr; aphil@aueb.gr; petros.Varthalitis@glasgow.ac.uk,"Economides, George/AAI-2663-2021","Varthalitis, Petros/0000-0003-3159-3040",,,,,65,3,3,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

In a partial equilibrium setting we find that such agency costs are significantly lower under mean-reverting (MR) dynamics, when compared to the ubiquitous geometric Brownian motion (GBM). The difference is attributed to the stationarity of the MR process. In addition, through the application of a novel agency cost decomposition, we show that for a larger speed of mean reversion, agency costs are driven mainly by suboptimal timing decisions, as opposed to suboptimal financing decisions. In contrast, under the standard GBM assumption the agency costs are driven mainly by suboptimal financing decisions for large growth rates and by suboptimal timing decisions for smaller or negative growth rates.

We find tentative evidence that quantitative easing (QE) stimulated the level of aggregate investment through the interest rate channel by narrowing corporate bond spread. In particular, the Fed's purchases of mortgage-backed securities were found to have a statistically significant effect on aggregate private investment. Moreover, using a GARCH model, we find that QE has led to a reduction in the volatility of private investment. This finding remains robust with a QE dummy variable as an alternative measure of the unconventional monetary policy. The study also indicates how different aspects of QE influence private investment and its volatility.","[Khemraj, Tarron; Yu, Sherry] New Coll Florida, Div Social Sci, Sarasota, FL USA",State University System of Florida; New College Florida,"Khemraj, T (通讯作者)，New Coll Florida, Div Social Sci, Sarasota, FL USA.",tkhemraj@ncf.edu,,"Khemraj, Tarron/0000-0001-8209-9187; Yu, Sherry/0000-0002-5067-4455",,,,,15,8,9,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Although empirical studies on home production are usually conducted using time use data, we use data collected by scanners, which cover daily goods purchased by over 10,000 households over 3 years. Based on the composition of daily food expenditures for foods consumed, we measure how many products are made using time-consuming processes at home, and examine if time-consuming home production is discouraged by mothers' employment away from home. Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity among households using the panel structure of our scanner data, we first show that mothers' out-of-home employment has a negative effect on home cooking. This effect is shared across economic classes, particularly when mothers work part-time, as compared with non-working mothers. Second, we show that this negative effect is more apparent in the low economic class. Households in this class show a particular decrease in time-consuming home cooking, especially when the mothers work part-time. Third, the smaller negative effect among the higher class can be explained by stronger health-consciousness and aversion to less-healthy products in this class.","[Kohara, Miki] Osaka Univ, OSIPP, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Kamiya, Yusuke] Ryukoku Univ, Kyoto, Japan",Osaka University; Ryukoku University,"Kohara, M (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, OSIPP, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",kohara@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Japanese Government; MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03512, 24530249, 16H06322] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) of the Japanese Government(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We appreciate Intage Inc. for allowing us to use their scanner data.

While analysis of the effects of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) most commonly focuses on the trade effects, the closeness of the link between trade and investment implies that the effect of an FTA on foreign direct investment (FDI) is also potentially significant. FTAs may stimulate FDI through the effects of market expansion and vertical fragmentation, while they may also reduce FDI through a plant rationalization effect. The overall effect of an FTA on FDI flows is an empirical question. This paper examines the impact of ACFTA on FDI flows through an econometric model that captures the influence of East Asian production networks on FDI, which we expect to be an important explanatory factor. The model finds that ACFTA has a significant and positive effect on FDI flows. A brief survey of the theoretical literature on the welfare and other related effects of FDI serves to emphasize that the extent to which individual member countries of the ACFTA will benefit from this increase in FDI will depend in important ways on the policies pursued in each country.

Producers are reluctant to develop these drugs under the common market conditions because the demand for these drugs does not guarantee return on investments into research and development of such products. Patients with orphan diseases, however, have the same rights for treatment as any other patient. To stimulate the research and development of drugs for orphan diseases, the governmental offices introduce various incentives for health and biotechnological industry.

Two treatments create environments where either saving or borrowing is required for optimal consumption. Since both treatments share the same optimal consumption levels, observed consumption choices can be directly compared across treatments. The experimental findings imply that deviations from optimal behavior are higher when subjects have to borrow than when they have to save in order to consume optimally, suggesting debt aversion. Signifiant under-consumption is observed when subjects have to borrow in order to reach optimal consumption. In line with previous experiments, weak evidence is found suggesting that subjects over-consume when saving is necessary for optimal consumption.","[Meissner, Thomas] Berlin Univ Technol, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Meissner, Thomas] Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France",Technical University of Berlin; Grenoble Ecole Management,"Meissner, T (通讯作者)，Berlin Univ Technol, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany.;Meissner, T (通讯作者)，Grenoble Ecole Management, 12 Rue Pierre Semard, F-38000 Grenoble, France.",meissnet@gmail.com,,"Meissner, Thomas/0000-0002-3508-0237",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [CRC 649],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am grateful for valuable comments by Frank Heinemann, Dorothea Kubler, Dietmar Fehr and participants of the Berlin Behavioral Economics Colloquium and the Barcelona GSE Summer Forum Workshop on Theoretical and Experimental Macroeconomics.

This requires a deeper understanding of the cyclical properties of the intensive margins of search in this market. Using the American Time Use Survey we construct an indicator of shopping time. It includes both searching and purchasing goods and is based on 25 time use categories (out of more than 400 categories). We find that average time spent shopping declined in the aggregate over the period 2008-2010 compared to 2005-2007. The decline was largest for the unemployed who went from spending more time shopping for goods than the employed to roughly the same, or even less, time. Cross-state and individual regressions indicate pro-cyclical consumer shopping time in the goods market.

In particular the paper considers the factors that encourage such facilities to adopt environmental management systems (EMS) and how that adoption affects compliance behavior. The analysis provides a relatively rare look into the behavior of small and conditionally-exempt generators (CEG) since such facilities are seldom inspected or examined. The analysis finds that CEGs are less likely to adopt an EMS relative to more strictly regulated facilities as are smaller and privately held facilities, but that local enforcement activity encourages adoption. For CEGs, EMS adoption does have a significant positive effect on overall compliance. Additionally at both small and CEG facilities, EMS adoption has a significant positive effect on one particular aspect of compliance behavior, the presence of best practices for waste storage.","[Stafford, Sarah L.] Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA USA",William & Mary,"Stafford, SL (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA USA.",slstaf@wm.edu,,"Stafford, Sarah/0000-0003-2233-5728",,,,,21,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

We use an endogenous broad capital model based on foreign direct investment (FDI) induced agglomeration economies and human capital. By applying a Markov chain approach to a new dataset that exploits micro-aggregated sub-national FDI statistics, the analysis provides insights into regional income growth dynamics within the EU. Our results indicate a weak process of overall income convergence across EU regions. This does not apply to the dynamics within Central and East European countries (CEECs), where we find indications of a poverty trap. In contrast to FDI, regional human capital seems to be associated with higher income levels. However, we identify a positive interaction of FDI and human capital in their relation with income growth dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abatement potential in Latin America, among other things, is influenced by its development status, the large contributions of non-CO2 and land use change CO2 emissions, and energy endowments. In most scenarios in this study, the economic potential to reduce fossil fuel CO2 as well as non-CO2 emissions in Latin America in 2050 is lower than in the rest of the world (in total) when measured against 2010 emissions, due largely to higher emission growth in Latin America than in the rest of the world in the absence of abatement. The potential to reduce land use change CO2 emissions is complicated by a wide range of factors and is not addressed in this paper (land use emissions are largely addressed in a companion paper). The study confirms the results of previous research that the variation in abatement costs across models may vary by an order of magnitude or more, limiting the value of these assessments and supporting continued calls for research on the degree to which models are effectively representing key local circumstances that influence costs and available abatement options. Finally, a review of policies in place in several Latin American countries at the time of this writing finds that they would be of varying success in meeting the emission levels proposed by the most recent IPCC reports to limit global temperature change to 2 degrees C.

We measure the probability of apprehension by clearance rates and study their effects on crime rates, employing a panel of Canadian provinces from 1986 to 2005.

Our data set ranges from 1992 to 2015 and consists of approximately 926,000 observations. As such, this paper constitutes the most extensive and comprehensive work conducted so far on European power markets, to the best of our knowledge. Unlike most of the literature that treats price as a continuous variable and attempts to model its trajectory, this paper adopts a unique approach and regards each hour in a day a separate market. The results show, in post-2008 period, the most expensive electricity is consumed in Turkey, Ireland, and UK while the cheapest power is in Russia, Nordic countries, and Czech Republic. Russia, Poland, and Czech Republic have the least volatile markets while France, Ireland, and Portugal have the most volatile ones. Volatility has decreased in many European countries in post-2008 period. Besides, we find magnitude effect is usually larger than the leverage effect, meaning that the absolute value of price change is relatively more important than the sign of the change (whether it is an increase or a decrease) to explain volatility in European day-ahead power markets. Moreover, the results imply there is not a uniform inverse leverage effect in electricity prices; that is, price increases are more destabilizing in some European markets (e.g. Poland, Slovenia, Ireland, Netherlands) than comparable price decreases but vice versa also holds true in some other countries (e.g. Portugal and France). Leverage (or inverse leverage) effect in post-2008 period is relatively stronger in Portugal, France, and Ireland, but its impact is quite limited in Turkey and Germany. Furthermore, although the impact of seasonality on prices is obvious, a specific pattern cannot be identified. Finally, large changes in the volatility will affect future volatilities for a relatively longer period of time in Nordic countries, Ireland, and the UK while changes in current volatility will have less effect on future volatilities in Czech Republic, Russia, and Turkey.

We compare two carbon tax scenarios with a business-as-usual scenario of anticipated future energy demand. In the short term, with carbon prices reaching around $15/tCO(2) by 2030, most models agree that the reduction in consumer spending, as a proxy for welfare, is limited to about 03%. By 2050, at carbon prices of $165/tCO(2), there is much more divergence in the estimated impact on consumer spending as well as GDP across models and regions, which reflects uncertainties about technology costs and substitution opportunities between technologies. We observe that the consequences of increasingly higher carbon prices, in terms of reduced consumer spending and GDP, tend to be fairly linear with the carbon price in our CGE models. However, the consequences are divergent and nonlinear in our econometric model, that is linked to an energy system model that simulates step-changes in technology substitution. The results of one model show that climate policy measures can have positive effects on consumer spending and GDP, which results from an investment stimulus and the redistribution of carbon price revenues to consumers.

The results show that the National Teacher Training Project (NTTP) deviates from official policy objectives in several respects. The subjects of training programs and training content are not fully compliant with policy objectives. In addition, training opportunities are offered to a smaller proportion of rural teachers than urban teachers. It is found that the proportion of teachers and principals satisfied with the NTTP is lower than that for other types of training. Therefore, measures should be taken to increase training opportunities for rural teachers and to ensure the quality of training for all teachers.","[Liu, Hongyan; Chang, Fang] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Loyalka, Prashant] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Shaanxi Normal University; Peking University; Stanford University,"Chang, F (通讯作者)，Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China.",lhy871211@126.com; cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn; changfang4421@163.com; prashantstanford9@gmail.com,"Loyalka, Prashant/Y-6174-2018; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023",,Ministry of Educaion of China [B16031]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473240],Ministry of Educaion of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study is financed by the 111 Project from Ministry of Educaion of China (Grant No. B16031) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 71473240).,,37,11,11,11,72,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2016,24.0,3,,,SI,,86,104,,10.1111/cwe.12160,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957200007,0

We find that fiscal policy in Ecuador seems to be sustainable, explained by its policy of debt payment through oil revenues, rather than by a fiscal discipline that dollarization is supposed to encourage. The non-oil tax revenues variable is a purely adjusting variable. This result suggests that in a dollarized country that cannot benefit from the seignorage' revenues, the reliance on volatile oil revenues and on smoothing tax revenues leaves the economy's fiscal sustainability vulnerable.","[Mari Del Cristo, Maria Lorena; Gomez-Puig, Marta] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona, Spain; [Gomez-Puig, Marta] RFA IREA, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Gómez-Puig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ Theory, Barcelona, Spain.;Gómez-Puig, M (通讯作者)，RFA IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",marta.gomezpuig@ub.edu,"Gómez-Puig, Marta/E-4408-2016","Gómez-Puig, Marta/0000-0001-8349-2829",Government of Spain [ECO2013-4836],Government of Spain(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the by the Government of Spain under grant number ECO2013-4836.,,40,2,6,8,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The reform obligated linguistic minority students to take a standardized school exit test in Ukrainian, thus denying them access to translated versions of the test. We study the implications of this reform for students in schools with Hungarian and Romanian/Moldovan languages of instruction. Using school-level data and employing difference-in-difference estimation techniques, we find that the reform resulted in a decline in the number of subjects taken by minority students. They particularly withdrew from linguistically-demanding subjects such as History and Biology, taking more Math instead. Given the implications for minority students' fields of future study, the reform may have affected their educational outcomes in a distortive way.

Households' stated WTP is estimated using the choice experiment (CE) method. The data used in the estimations come from 350 in-person interviews conducted during the period 5-22 August 2008 in North Cyprus. Compensating variation (CV) estimates for a zero-outage scenario are calculated using the parameter estimates from the mixed logit (ML) model; these are 6.65 YTL (Turkish lira) per month (3.02 USD) for summer and 25.83 YTL per month (11.74 USD) for winter. In order to avoid the cost of outages, households are willing to incur a 3.6% and a 13.9% increase in their monthly electricity bill for summer and winter, respectively. The WTP per hour unserved is 0.28 YTL (0.13 USD) for summer, and 1.08 YTL (0.49 USD) for winter. A preliminary cost-benefit analysis indicates that the annualized economic benefits are approximately 42.7 million YTL (19.4 million USD) for the residential sector. This would justify an investment in additional generation capacity of approximately 268 MW, which is far more than that which is needed to eliminate the service reliability problem.

A person's type is the probability of him choosing a contemplative action. To test the typology, results of 10 games are analyzed. Actions in each game were classified depending on whether their response time was more or less, respectively, than the median response time of all subjects who played the game. It is argued that fast actions are more instinctive and slow actions are more contemplative. A subject's contemplative index (CI) is defined as the proportion of games in which he chose a contemplative action. It is found that for 8 of the 10 games, the CI in the other 9 games is positively correlated with a player's choice of a contemplative action in that game (average Spearman correlation of 9%). The CI is used to shed light on the nature of choice in five additional games.","[Rubinstein, Ariel] Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Rubinstein, Ariel] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",Tel Aviv University; New York University,"Rubinstein, A (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.;Rubinstein, A (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,ERC [269143]; European Research Council (ERC) [269143] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"My thanks to Hadar Binsky for his devoted help in analyzing the data and to Eli Zvuluny for 12 years of dedicated assistance in building and maintaining the site http://gametheory.tau.ac.il.

Using police reported and court based official statistics and the difference-in-difference strategy, it is found that Canadian youth offenders were less likely to be charged by police and less likely to receive a custodial sentence following the YCJA. These changes were relatively large for less serious crime and small or insignificant for more serious crime. In response to these changes in the certainty of sanctions, less serious youth crime increased while the direction of change for more serious youth crime was less clear.

The article contributes to the debate on the matter, specifically on two methodological aspects: 1) the proper analysis of data to confirm the hypothesis of a research, and 2) the replication of scientific findings in order to evaluate them. The first aspect, based on Haavelmo's monograph of 1944 entitled The probabilistic approach to econometrics, implies that economists should make sure that the probabilistic assumptions of the statistical models used in their research are met. The second aspect suggests that the replications are a means to show the fragility (arose by errors of mishandling databases or inadequate specification of statistical models), or the strength (arose from the robustness of the results from changes in time period, the economy under analysis, the specification of the variables, the estimation methods, etc.) of the results reported in a published research. The article contributes with an illustration of our own methodological proposal: it is a replication of an article by Kakkar (2001), entitled Long run actual exchange rates: Evidence from Mexico, published in the journal Economics Letters.","[De Jesus Romo, Veronica] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Romo, VD (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Econ, Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",veronica.dejesus@ciencias.unam.mx,,,,,,,42,1,1,0,2,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, INST GEOGRAFIA",COYOACAN C P,"CIUDAD UNIV, FAC ECONOMIA, CIRCUITO INTEROR S-N, 1ER PISO, EDIFICIO B, COYOACAN C P, 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

We find that subsidy programs created a large transfer of public funding to private schools, suggesting that every dollar of funding increased revenue by a dollar or more. Turning to the incidence of subsidies and the impact of subsidies on enrollment, our findings depend on the type of program introduced: programs that restrict eligibility to certain groups of students create large enrollment gains but no change in price, while programs that offer unrestricted subsidies lead to price increases but no change in enrollment.

These airports are some of the largest sources of air pollution in the US, and they experience large changes in daily air pollution emissions depending on the amount of time planes spend idling on the tarmac. Excess airplane idling, measured as residual daily taxi time, is due to network delays originating in the Eastern US. This idiosyncratic variation in daily airplane taxi time significantly impacts the health of local residents, largely driven by increased levels of carbon monoxide (CO) exposure. We use this variation in daily airport congestion to estimate the population dose-response of health outcomes to daily CO exposure, examining hospitalization rates for asthma, respiratory, and heart-related emergency room admissions. A one standard deviation increase in daily pollution levels leads to an additional $540 thousand in hospitalization costs for respiratory and heart-related admissions for the 6 million individuals living within 10 km (6.2 miles) of the airports in California. These health effects occur at levels of CO exposure far below existing Environmental Protection Agency mandates, and our results suggest there may be sizable morbidity benefits from lowering the existing CO standard.","[Schlenker, Wolfram] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Schlenker, Wolfram; Walker, W.

An inversion of the familiar gravity model makes it possible to infer trade costs based on the observed pattern of trade and production across economies. Analysis of trade costs calculated in this way shows that although intra-and extra-APEC trade costs fell during the sample period, they did not do so substantially more quickly than elsewhere in the world. Indeed, the region taken as a whole did not meet the 10% reduction goal. However, a considerable number of individual economies not only met the goal, they greatly exceeded it. Consistent with their outward oriented development strategies and leverage of global and regional value chains, some APEC economies saw very rapid falls in their trade costs over the 2002-2010 period, Viet Nam being a standout performer. Overall, about one third of the forum's membership for which consistent data are available met or exceeded the 10% reduction goal. APEC's two Trade Facilitation Action Plans can therefore be seen as having had mixed records of success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper uses provincial data on illegal land uses during the period 1999-2010 as a proxy for the intensity of land conflicts to investigate the effects of foreign direct investment (FDI) and fiscal decentralization on jurisdictional land conflicts. The results show that the FDI growth rate has a positive and significant impact on the growth rate of illegal land use when there is a high degree of fiscal decentralization. We thus provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that regional competition for FDI, as shaped by fiscal decentralization, tends to raise conflicts over land in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Even though the reported unit cost growth rates differ between equipment type and the individual studies, all of the studies find the unit cost growth rates of each military equipment type exceeding inflation. Various explanations proposed by different authors are reviewed. Unit cost growth studies omit corrections for quality changes of equipment, unlike the standard practice in inflation calculation. By bringing the military capability perspective into the discussion of unit cost growth, this article proposes a new approach to equipment unit cost growth, thereby enabling the collective evaluation of quality change with price change. This approach is demonstrated through a case study involving an armoured personnel carrier (APC). Although the price of the APC had increased sixfold with only a minor improvement in transportation capability, the proposed approach shows that the purchasing decisions of its successive generations may have still been cost-effective. The APC case demonstrated that the proposed approach can be successfully applied and yield meaningful results.","[Lehtonen, Juha-Matti; Anteroinen, Jukka] Natl Def Univ, Dept Mil Technol, Helsinki, Finland; [Anteroinen, Jukka] Def Command, Operat Div, Helsinki, Finland",,"Lehtonen, JM (通讯作者)，Natl Def Univ, Dept Mil Technol, Helsinki, Finland.",juha-matti.lehtonen@mil.fi,"Lehtonen, Juha-Matti/AAU-3569-2020","Lehtonen, Juha-Matti/0000-0003-3151-2618",,,,,41,0,0,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Endogenous debt limits on secured and unsecured loans slow down capital reallocation, preventing the equalization of risk-adjusted equity yields across sectors.

The Lindahl equilibrium, which provides the system of prices that sustains the first-best social optimum in an economy with non rival goods, appears as a benchmark. First, its comparison with the standard Schumpeterian equilibrium A la Aghion and Howitt (Econometrica (60)2:323-351 1992) enables us to shed a new light on the issue of non-optimality of the latter. Second, the Lindahl equilibrium also allows us to revisit the issue of R&D incentives in presence of cumulative innovations. Finally, this benchmark may be a first step to understand how knowledge is exchanged in new technology sectors.","[Gray, Elie; Grimaud, Andre] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Blvd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Sch Econ, LERNA, 20 Blvd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France; [Grimaud, Andre] Univ Toulouse, IDEI, Toulouse Sch Econ, 20 Blvd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Gray, E (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Blvd Lascrosses,BP 7010, F-31068 Toulouse 7, France.",e.gray@tbs-education.fr; andre.grimaud@tse-fr.eu,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We find evidence that the SO2 market operates in ways that are not inconsistent with an efficient market - prices that reflect marginal abatement costs - after the first few years of the program but before a court decision that introduced significant uncertainty into the market in mid-2008. Our empirical analysis finds that the SO2 market, similar to other emission markets studied in the literature, can remain relatively inefficient for several years after launch. We also find that market volatility increases in response to all types of communications from the administrator, suggesting that the development of a formal communication strategy, possibly similar to that used by central banks, would reduce price volatility and increase the efficiency of the market.

In so doing I also provide some comments on the current state of economics, since these provide some context for an appreciation of what Martins is trying to achieve. Martins is focused on making the positive case for classical political economy (CPE) as a form of theory that is quite different from the modern mainstream. For Martins that difference is based on its approach to the distribution of a surplus expressed through a social ontology that is based on historical open systems and in which the key aspect of open systems is the institutional and hence deliberative activity by which the surplus is decided, which is ultimately an issue for ethics. It is through a 'Cambridge tradition', focusing on Sraffa, Keynes, Lawson and Sen, that CPE, a classical social theory and ethical deliberation are brought together. Bringing them together is an act of synthesis and I conclude by providing a constructive critique of the terms of this synthesis.","[Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Beckett Univ, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England.",jamieamorgan@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,72,11,11,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Drawing on duality theory, this paper decomposes changes in energy demand into substitution and output effects using annual sector-level production data for Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia and China (BRIIC) for the period 1995-2009. Unlike previous studies, this study analyzed the economic properties of the underlying production technology. Results indicate that changes in energy demand are strongly dominated by substitution effects. More importantly, an intriguing finding that emerges from our analysis is the role of economies of scale and factor accumulation, as opposed to technical progress, in giving rise to the growth performance of sampled economies.

However, there is very little empirical evidence concerning these practices in developing countries with young democracies. Using a primary panel of 86 rural Chinese administrative villages that have undergone transitions to democracy over the past two decades, we show that the neighbourhood effect also exists in a young democracy, albeit at a lower magnitude than in a mature democracy. Elected chairs of village committees who have served more than one term respond positively to the provision of public projects in neighbouring villages by increasing both the number of public projects and the funding allocated to undertake them. In contrast, appointed party secretaries with more than 1 year of service are insensitive to neighbours' performance. In addition, village leaders are strategic in timing the arrival of public projects to increase the probability of re-election: in the year preceding elections, both the number and budget of public projects increase significantly. In this sense, politicians in young and old democracies behave alike.","[Agostini, Claudio A.] Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile; [Brown, Philip] GeoSource Capital, New York, NY USA; [Zhang, Xiaobo] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Washington, DC USA",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez; CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Agostini, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Adolfo Ibanez, Diagonal Torres 2640, Santiago, Chile.",claudio.agostini@uai.cl,"Agostini, Claudio A./HLG-7336-2023; Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/B-4948-2016","Agostini, Claudio A./0000-0002-3916-1501; Stahlmann-Brown, Philip/0000-0003-4310-1103",,,,,36,2,2,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Given that the EKC hypothesis postulates an inverted U-shaped relationship between emissions and output, the study tests for cointegration between per capita CO2 emissions, per capita real GDP and the squared values of per capita real GDP. The evidence from panel cointegration methodologies is mixed. This result might arise due to time dependence of cointegrating coefficients. The time varying cointegration approaches provide strong evidence in favor of time-varying cointegration parameters. Furthermore, based on the quantile cointegration approach, the results indicate that the EKC hypothesis holds in 12 out of the 15 countries. However, even for these three countries, the EKC hypothesis seems to hold at certain quantiles. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Traditionally, social cleavages are seen as the underlying cause of political conflicts. It is clear, however, that a violent con fat itself can shape partisan, social, and national identities. In this paper, we ask whether social conflicts unite or divide the society by studying the effects of Ukraine's military conflict with Russia on online social ties between Ukrainian provinces (oblasts). In order to do that, we collected original data on the cross-regional structure of politically relevant online communication among users of VKontakte social networking site. We analyze the panel of provinces spanning the most active phases of domestic protests and military conflict and isolate the effects of province-specific war casualties on the nature of inter-provincial online communication. The results show that war casualties entice strong emotional response in the corresponding provinces, but do not necessarily increase the level of social cohesion in interprovincial online communication. We find that the intensity of military conflict entices online activism, but activates regional rather than nation-wide network connections. We also find that military conflict tends to polarize some regions of Ukraine, especially in the East. Our research brings attention to the underexplored areas in the study of civil conflict and political identities by documenting the ways the former may affect the latter.

Numerous candidate regressors have been motivated by alternative theories and tested by a multitude of empirical studies, but not one trade regressor has been robustly related to growth. In this paper, we leverage Melitz's (2003) insights regarding sectoral export dynamics and Feenstra and Kee's (2008) approach to productivity and sectoral export diversity to propose a structured approach to trade and growth determinants. Instead of relying on aggregate trade measures as previous studies have done, we examine the diversity of sectoral exports and the development of broad-based comparative advantage as a potential growth determinant. Controlling for model uncertainty and endogeneity, we find that export diversity serves as a crucial growth determinant for low-income countries, an effect that weakens with the level of development.","[Eicher, Theo S.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Kuenzel, David J.] Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Wesleyan University,"Kuenzel, DJ (通讯作者)，Wesleyan Univ, Middletown, CT 06459 USA.",dkuenzel@wesleyan.edu,"Kuenzel, David/L-4212-2019; Eicher, Theo/HZL-8034-2023","Kuenzel, David/0000-0001-7429-3246;",UK's Department for International Development (DFID),UK's Department for International Development (DFID),"We thank Chih Ming Tan, Andros Kourtellos and Chris Papageorgiou for sharing their data and for extensive discussions.

We estimate the relative demand for lumpectomy using variation in distance to the nearest radiation facility, and estimate that the top-up policy increases social welfare by $700-2,500 per patient relative to two common alternatives.

It is motivated by two issues associated with characteristic features of the Chinese economy. First, foreign ownership restrictions can potentially inhibit Chinese acquiring firms' use of equity to finance overseas M&A deals. Second, the ability of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to secure favorable loan terms may provide them an incentive to rely more on cash financing. We collate data from four databases to obtain a sample of over 6000 M&A deals that were completed during the 1997-2014 period. We find evidence to support the first supposition but not the second.

Detection of asymmetric fluctuations in economic activity is important for policymakers since effective monetary policy relies on asymmetric business cycle fluctuations in all the series. The asymmetric deviations from the long-term growth trend in each of the series are modeled using regime switching models and artificial neural networks. The results based on nonlinear switching time series models reveal strong evidence of business cycle asymmetries in most of the series. The results based on in-sample approximations from artificial neural networks show statistically significant evidence of asymmetries in all the series. Similar results are obtained when jackknife out-of-sample approximations from artificial neural networks are used. Thus, the study results show statistically significant evidence of asymmetries in all the series which indicates that business cycle fluctuations in the series are asymmetric, thus alike. Therefore, the impact of monetary policy shocks on the output and the other macroeconomic variables can be anticipated using nonlinear models only. The results on asymmetric business cycle fluctuations in real GDP are in line with recent studies but in sharp contrast with Balke and Fomby (1994). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It looks into the possibility of K-SURE and KCAB reactivating its 2004 MOU to give more jurisdictional protection to K-SURE's indemnities recovery transactions. Design/methodology/approach - This paper first introduces a brief elucidation about export insurance provided by K-SURE and the necessity of arbitration in the export insurance, and a summary of a subrogation arbitration case referred to the KCAB by K-SURE in 2005. Cognizant of the 2004 MOU between K-SURE and KCAB, as well as the foreign and domestic developments in arbitration, the paper then analyzes legal principles of subrogation by insurer, as well as domestic and overseas precedents on the matters of assignment of claim and arbitration by subrogation. Findings - While it appears that there is still no universally recognized authority nor established court precedents applying arbitration by subrogation, the authors discovered that similar to Korea, most of leading courts in the world have consistently held that the assignee can request and be requested for arbitration pursuant to the arbitration agreement contained in the assigned contract. The paper concludes that the K-SURE now can be admitted as a party having proper standing in the arbitration proceedings so long as the specific claim right under the contract which includes the arbitration agreement is assigned to the K-SURE. Originality/value - This paper suggests a possible plan to increase recoveries in export insurance. The outcome of the research is expected to enhance the arbitration system on the back of increasing numbers of arbitration related to export insurance, to improve the balance sheet of K-SURE and ultimately, to help the Korean economy by collecting export insurance recoveries which will lead to saving Korean people's tax.","[Ahn, Keon-Hyung] Daejeon Univ, Dept Int Commerce, Daejeon, South Korea; [Kim, Pil-Joon] K SURE, Seoul, South Korea",Daejeon University,"Kim, PJ (通讯作者)，K SURE, Seoul, South Korea.",kpj0326@ksure.or.kr,"AHN, Keon-Hyung/F-3955-2016",,Daejeon University fund [201600950001],Daejeon University fund,This research was supported by Daejeon University fund (201600950001).,,27,0,0,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Data show that a majority of sporting events is sponsored and that investment in sponsorship is increasing every year. Companies are demanding more research to better understand their investment efficacy. Involvement is a key element in processing sponsorship information in consumers' minds. This variable affects consumer behavior and moderates the sponsor image transfer. The study of involvement could give guidance for the design of appropriate and functional advertising campaigns. The research proposes segmenting and modelling sport consumer behaviour in sponsorship by their level of involvement with the event. For this task, we propose a model for image transfer between the sponsored entity and the sponsor. Using Finite Mix Partial Least Square methods, two sample segments are achieved. The data were obtained with a web banner during an international tennis event. In conclusion, the least involved individuals do not process the image transfer effect, as opposed to the individuals who are more involved. In the theoretical field, this paper is the first to include segmentation by Finite Mix in sponsorship research. Finally, attraction and involvement strategies are proposed based on the characteristics for each of the variables in this model, for example, regular meetings for fans, autograph signings and weekly chat sessions on the web site. This study provides guidance for companies about how to increase their customers' willingness to purchase, how to improve their image, how to increase supporters' involvement and finally, how to design effective communication for supporters according to their level of involvement.","[Alonso-Dos-Santos, Manuel] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Ave Alonso de Ribera 2850, Concepcion 4090541, Chile; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Sporto St 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Calabuig-Moreno, Ferran] Univ Valencia, C Gasco Oliag 3, E-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Montoro-Rios, Francisco.

A key component of this programme is to adopt more trade liberalisation policies that can generate a variety of economic activities, particularly more jobs. Although the integration with the world market bears the promise of prosperity for the developing and transitional economies, such integration may also adversely affect such economies. Preceding studies regarding labour market and international trade policies are still inconclusive and raise questions that require further examination; particularly in terms of whether exposure to the external sector can create or destroy jobs. The present study evaluates how Malaysia labour market has responded to the economic globalisation of the country. The study focuses on the long-run impact of economic globalisation on unemployment within the period between 1980 and 2014. The study uses autoregressive distributive lags method to examine the pattern of the relationship. The results show that economic globalisation have significant and positive impact on reducing unemployment in Malaysia in the long run. These findings indicate that policy-makers in Malaysia should facilitate the economy globalisation to maintain the current low level of unemployment rate.","[Awad, Atif] Univ Sharjah, Dept Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Youssof, Ishak] Univ Kebangsaan Malaysia, Dept Econ, Sch Econ, Bangi, Malaysia",University of Sharjah; Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Awad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sharjah, Dept Finance & Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",aawoad@sharjah.ac.ae,"Awad, Atif/Q-8741-2019","Awad, Atif/0000-0003-1556-803X",,,,,48,12,12,4,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The analysis is performed on a large data set of Italian firms, covering both manufacturing and services sectors, as well as large and small firms. We show that non-convex adjustment costs affect different capital inputs in different ways, depending on their degree of firm-specificity. The results confirm the Bloom model: flow adjustment costs explain investment in R&D and, to a lesser extent, in non-R&D intangibles. However, it struggles to explain tangible investment plans because of the ambiguous effect of the stock adjustment costs.","[Bontempi, Maria Elena] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Bontempi, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Str Maggiore 45, I-40125 Bologna, Italy.",mariaelena.bontempi@unibo.it,"bontempi, maria elena/F-4927-2012","bontempi, maria elena/0000-0001-9633-3499",,,,,64,13,14,1,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Hence, by construction RDs are analytically tractable and flexible diffusion processes. Existing literature on RDs has mostly focused on time-homogeneous transformations, which to a significant extent fail to explore the full potential of RDs from both theoretical and practical points of view. In this paper, we propose flexible and economically justifiable time variations to the transformations of RDs. Concentrating on the Constant Elasticity Variance (CEV) RDs, we consider nonlinear dynamics for our time-varying transformations with both deterministic and stochastic designs. Such time variations can greatly enhance the flexibility of RDs while maintaining sufficient tractability of the resulting models. In the meantime, our modeling approach enjoys the benefits of classical inferential techniques such as the Maximum Likelihood (ML). Our application to the UK and the US short-term interest rates suggests that from an empirical point of view time-varying transformations are highly relevant and statistically significant. We expect that the proposed models can describe more truthfully the dynamic time-varying behavior of economic and financial variables and potentially improve out-of-sample forecasts significantly.

A closer examination of the evidence shows that in fact both reasons contributed to causing the crisis, but it also suggests that its depth has a more proximate cause in the political collapse of the federal government in 2015, which led Brazilian society to an impasse for which a solution is not yet in view.","[Cardim De Carvalho, Fernando J.] Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA; [Cardim De Carvalho, Fernando J.] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"De Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Bard Coll, Levy Econ Inst, Annandale on Hudson, NY 12504 USA.;De Carvalho, FJC (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,"Brazilian National Research Council, CNPq","Brazilian National Research Council, CNPq(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ))","Fernando J.

Our analysis differs from other approaches in that (i) a new firm is associated with the creation of a new product in such a way that a planned expenditure of resources is required (e.g. R&D), and (ii) an accumulation law for the growth of the number of firms is assumed.

This problem seems to be crucial for contemporary pension reforms in many countries forced by deteriorating demographics. Many of them face the challenge of an increasing pensionable age, which usually meets with social resistance, although the economic reasoning for such a policy is rather obvious. However, in this study the problem of retirement age is related to pension regimes theory. The paper contributes to the literature on optimal retirement age as well as comparative studies on pension systems, including pension regimes typology. The main goal is to answer the question whether the relation between state and market in a pension system affects the statutory and effective retirement age. The results of the study generally confirm the negative relation between the involvement of the state in a pension system and the statutory as well as the effective age of retirement. The empirical study is conducted on the basis of statistical data for 30 OECD countries. The method employed is mainly based on comparative analysis of selected statistical parameters, a hypothesis test for difference between means as well as correlation analysis. The paper consists of following sections. After an initial part of an introductory character, the literature on retirement age and pension regimes typology is reviewed. Then the conceptual framework for pension regimes typology employed in the study is presented. The next section includes the empirical study.

For doing so, we apply the propensity score matching methodology to a dataset extracted from the Survey on Adult Participation in Learning Activities. Results show that adult participation in non-formal education has a positive effect on individual employability.

The model shows that when benefits are conditional on school success or when the program has a binding duration limit, the CCT reduces teenage pregnancy rates. Using original data, we estimate this relation for two different CCT programs implemented in Bogota, Colombia. The two programs differ in that only one of them conditions benefit renewal on school success. The empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the model. Only the program that conditions renewal of the transfer, reduces average teenage pregnancy rates. We also find that, also consistent with our model, the other program reduces teenage pregnancy rates only for those girls for which the duration limit is binding.","[Maldonado, Dario] Univ Los Andes, Sch Govt, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Darwin; Gallego, Juan] Univ Rosario, Dept Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Cortes, Darwin; Gallego, Juan] Univ Rosario, CeiBA Complejidad, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad del Rosario; Universidad del Rosario; CEIBA,"Maldonado, D (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Sch Govt, Cra 1 19-27,Bloque Au,Piso 3, Bogota, Colombia.",dmaldonadoc@uniandes.edu.co,"Maldonado, Dario/JAC-9219-2023; Cortes, Darwin/F-5161-2016; Gallego, Juan M./F-9009-2016","Cortes, Darwin/0000-0003-2280-9452; Maldonado, Dario/0000-0003-3544-208X; Gallego, Juan M./0000-0002-8997-1107",PEP-BID-GRADE Teenage Childbearing Initiative in Latin America [PIERI 11887]; FIUR from Universidad del Rosario,PEP-BID-GRADE Teenage Childbearing Initiative in Latin America; FIUR from Universidad del Rosario,"This paper is part of the project Evaluating policies to reduce teenage childbearing in Bogota, Colombia: the effect of policies reducing costs of education faced by households (PIERI 11887) funded by PEP-BID-GRADE Teenage Childbearing Initiative in Latin America and the Caribbean and by FIUR from Universidad del Rosario.",,38,6,6,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

For the US semiconductor industry, a strengthening of the patent regime in the 1980s was followed by a sharp increase in patenting but had almost no impact on R&D expenditure. This paper attempts to understand this patent paradox by taking some of the industry features into account. We present a model of invention and product development in complex industries where product development involves putting together a large number of inventions and where licensing of patentable inventions is common. While a stronger patent regime leads to higher patenting in both in presence and absence of licensing, the positive relationship between patenting and R&D is weakened in presence of licensing since licensing provides an alternative way of accessing inventions. A stronger patent regime, therefore, may only create weak incentives to increase R&D, while strongly increasing patenting activities in such an industry.","[Dey, Soma] Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, Delhi 110007, India",University of Delhi,"Dey, S (通讯作者)，Univ Delhi, Fac Management Studies, Delhi 110007, India.",soma.dey@fms.edu,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Such agenda-sensitivity opens the door to manipulation by agenda setters. I define three types of agenda-insensitivity ('basic', 'full', and 'focal') and for each type axiomatically characterize the aggregation procedures satisfying it. Two axioms turn out to be central for agenda-insensitivity: the familiar independence axiom, requiring propositionwise aggregation, and the axiom of implicit consensus preservation, requiring the respect of any (possibly implicit) consensus. As the paper's second contribution, I prove a new impossibility theorem whereby these two axioms imply dictatorial aggregation for almost all agendas. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines the relationship between the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and economic growth of Czech regions. The paper is based on primary research data collected within the Community Innovation Survey in Czech Republic. This survey provides a unique source of data on various aspects of innovation development in SMEs, such as their objectives, cooperation, funding, etc. We show that the share of innovative SMEs has a strong positive impact on the economic accounts of NUTS 4 regions. We also show that this effect has origins in the structure of intellectual capital (both human and structural) of SMEs. We use the data from the Community Innovation Survey to develop the proxy variables of the components of regional SMEs' intellectual capital. We use structural equation models to demonstrate the statistical significancy of these effects and various direct and indirect effects of the share of innovative SMEs on the indicators of regional economic performance. The results show that new-to-firm innovative SMEs are critical for regional economies based on innovation adoption strategy. Human and structural capital represent important prerequisites for this strategy. This has important policy implications, supporting the role of regional embededness to sustain the role of SMEs. This can also provide some generalizations on the contribution of SMEs for national economies.","[Gardiner, Richard; Hajek, Petr] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Gardiner, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",richardgardiner18@yahoo.com; petr.hajek@upce.cz,"Hajek, Petr/JYQ-5812-2024","Hajek, Petr/0000-0001-5579-1215",,,,,19,1,2,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,630,637,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100068,0

This article shows that studying how time is allocated among individual options is also valuable in helping researchers to understand the impact default options have on decision makers' attention allocation, as approximated by how the time is allocated. The study of this impact generates new insights into the well-known choice phenomenon of status quo bias, which typically refers to decision makers' tendency to stick to a default option. By designing a series of novel experiments, I find that this bias arises even when the choice is among prizes of fixed monetary value expressed in arithmetic form. I also find asymmetric attention (i.e., more time devoted to default options) and strikingly asymmetric choice errors; specifically, decision makers fail to select an alternative better than the default 28% of the time, while they incorrectly select an alternative worse than the default only 11% of the time; and provide evidence supporting a causal relationship between asymmetric attention and asymmetric errors.

Not material product is realized on this market, but an individual service which has no compatibles at the date of making of contract and realizing of which is related to high technical risk. That is why a client accrues the right to use the scientific and technological potential of the developer (engineering company) and its subcontractors only from the pay for eventual outcome. As tools we used the methods of economic analysis of business performance, strategic management approach, innovation management, financial management, administrative diagnostics, business reengineering, and such general scientific approaches as analysis and synthesis, system approach to business external and internal environment, social and economic conditions and processes, forming generalized criteria and operating rates.","[Grudina, S.

Thus, the findings support a large role of self-selection in accounting for export decision, but little gain from learning-by-exporting in the case of Vietnamese Small medium sized enterprises (SMEs).

Only 20 % of respondents perceives procedural and political nature of strategic planning and considers that today it is not possible to plan in such a way as during the planning euphoria and it is necessary to seek planning procedures to increase agility and enforceability of the strategic plans. They mainly perceive moderation, communication and information role of strategic planning.

These data identify whether the bank has free or fee checking on NIC accounts and, where relevant, the fee and minimum balance to avoid the fee. Appealing to shrouded equilibrium theory, we hypothesize that banks, and particularly small banks, will avoid drawing the attention of myopic, low-income types by having stable policies, or will attempt to confuse depositors with contradictory policy shifts in the fee and minimum balance requirements. Competition and small bank size should favour consumers, but the meaning of favour' is complicated by large depositors and the banks subsidizing small depositors with NIC accounts.The results support the avoid attention hypothesis, particularly for single-market banks, and weakly support the confuse depositors hypothesis. The largest banks, including three too big to fail banks, are most responsive to competition, with single-market banks far less responsive. Competition may be responsible for a dramatic decline in free checking among the largest banks, and substantial increases in minimum balances for those banks, since these effectively reduced subsidies. Simultaneously, single-market banks became more likely to offer free checking.","[Kashian, Russell] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Drago, Robert] Precis Numer, Springfield, MA 01108 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Kashian, R (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA.",kashianr@uww.edu,,,,,,,28,1,1,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize why and how such happens and furthermore, has two research purposes. First is to explain why studies in e-Trade performance show controversial results, such as some showing positive while others are not. Second is to investigate the relationship among research constructs such as e-Trade benefits, e-Trade use, asset specificity, and exporting firm's capability. Design/methodology/approach - This study considers multiple dimensions and evolutionary perspective of e-Trade performance. Structural equation model adopts the measures of firm's capability, e-Trade use, and benefits to analyze e-Trade performance. Performance was divided into organizational net benefits (ONB) and industrial net benefits. Several hypotheses were suggested to test the relationship among the variables in the model. Basic moderator effect represented as an interaction between asset specificity and other constructs. In total, 295 exporting firms have participated in the survey and their responses were utilized for analysis. Findings - This study shows that e-Trade performance should consider maturity as well as multiple stages among constructs. Critical paths were found among capability factors, process use (PU), ONB, and asset specificity. Results also show that information capability and marketing capability (MC) are determinant factors on e-Trade performance. In addition, MC and level of PU are read to be determinant factors of ONB. Furthermore, small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs') asset specificity, with level of capability and e-Trade use moderates their e-Trade performance. Research limitations/implications - Asset specificity of SMEs has to be managed in a positive direction. Government's e-Trade supporting programs for SMEs should be transformed in a way that can foster the growth of capability and self-sustainment. It reads to be inevitable to amend the current characteristics of e-Trade services. Furthermore, developing a specialized e-Trade service for large firms will also be in need. And utilizing exporting firm's financial data would bemore advisable testing the hypotheses. Originality/value - Most works in information system as well as in e-Trade area report controversial performance results and this paper suggests an alternative model by combining asset specificity into capability and e-Trade use. Study on e-Trade performance is complicated and needs to consider multiple dimensions as well as their stages.

Accompanied to the normative method, as part of research methodology, following methods were used: comparative method, historical and statistical method and secondary researches. Due to the changes of the Croatian Constitution in 2010, 22 national minorities were included in its Foundation Source, as well as Croatian citizens, who are guaranteed equality with citizens of Croatian nationality and the realization of national rights in accordance with the democratic norms of the United Nations and countries of the free world. In eastern Croatia there are towns and municipalities with increased concentration of ethnic minorities (Serbs, Slovaks, Hungarians and the Czech). However, the development index shows that all minority local units range within from below 50% to barely 75% of the average development of the Republic of Croatia. In contrast to the good development of the area with territorially concentrated minorities in some European countries (Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria...), territorially concentrated minorities in Eastern Croatia show extremely below-average development status. Some documents promote economic and social development of members of ethnic minorities. At the global level, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities obliges countries to consider appropriate measures so that members of minorities could fully participate in the economic progress and development in their country. In the European context, the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities also provides special rights to national minorities inhabited in the areas which traditionally or in substantial number belong to national minorities. In the Croatian perspective, the Constitutional Law on National Minorities specifies how ethnic and multicultural diversity and spirit of understanding, respect and tolerance contribute to promotion of the development of the Republic of Croatia. Based on the constitutional position and achieved development position of territorially concentrated minorities in Eastern Croatia, it is proposed that the Republic of Croatia takes certain measures in order to improve the level of development of areas where national minorities traditionally live.","[Marinac, Antun; Emanovic, Tena] Polytecn Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia; [Gazilj, Nikolina] Off Entrepreneurial Dev, Dragutina Lermana 10, Pozega 34000, Croatia",,"Marinac, A (通讯作者)，Polytecn Pozega, Vukovarska 17, Pozega 34000, Croatia.",amarinac@vup.hr; nikolina.gazilj1@gmail.com; tena.emanovic1@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,2,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,466,476,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600047,0

This paper presents a formal model of institutional evolution that is based on the dynamic interactions between formal and informal institutions and economic development; the main features of the model is consistent with the fundamental theories that shed light to institutional evolution, namely the collective action and transaction cost theories, as well as dialectics. As informal institutional quality accumulates like technological know-how, while the level of formal institutional quality is chosen by the government to maximize welfare, subject to the economic and political costs. The solution of the model yields a punctuated trajectory of formal institutional evolution. Simulations reveal that the extent of diversity in informal institutional quality across a country delays formal institutional reforms. We also observe that, both the optimal quality of formal institutions and welfare are higher the more homogeneous is the country with respect to its informal institutions or the cultural attributes.

The evolution from cash accounting to accrual accounting took place during three time periods within the timeframe 1991-2015. For each of these time periods we investigated influential factors such as period, place, people, practices, propagation, products, and profession. The study shows that under the influence of the international managerial public reform and the internal factors analysed, the public accounting system shifts from the old values of the post-communist period to new reference bases such as International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). The results of the study place Romania, an East European country, on the map of international public sector accounting systems as a relatively new arrival but with serious intentions of integration.","[Nistor, Cristina Silvia; Deaconu, Adela] Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania",Babes Bolyai University from Cluj,"Nistor, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Babes Bolyai, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",cristina.nistor@econ.ubbcluj.ro,"Nistor, Cristina Silvia/G-2735-2017; DEACONU, Adela/E-3889-2013","Nistor, Cristina Silvia/0000-0002-4246-1847; DEACONU, Adela/0000-0002-7898-2740","Executive Agency Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation; National Scientific Research Council through the Human Resources Programme [PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0265]","Executive Agency Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS)Unitatea Executiva pentru Finantarea Invatamantului Superior, a Cercetarii, Dezvoltarii si Inovarii (UEFISCDI)); National Scientific Research Council through the Human Resources Programme(Consiliul National al Cercetarii Stiintifice (CNCS))","This work was financed with the support of the Executive Agency Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation Funding and the National Scientific Research Council, through the Human Resources Programme, project code: PN-II-RU-TE-2014-4-0265.",,65,8,8,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Design/methodology/approach - A research model was designed on the mechanism of Korean exporters' utilizing 3PL and the collaborative relationships (CR) between exporters and logistics service providers (LSPs) in supply chain management context. The mechanism means what triggers the Korean exporters to choose LSPs in overseas trade. Conclusions were drawn from survey data gathered from 146 exporters in Korea. Structural equation model with partial least square was employed to measure the statistical significance of the hypothesized model paths. Findings - This study provides evidence that exporters' evaluation on the customization of LSPs' service capacities, the reasonability of LSPs' service fees and the information sharing are three important prerequisites to CR between exporters and LSPs. This study is focussed on exporters' performance such as consistency of secure delivery (SD), exporters' logistics cost savings (CS) and exporters' satisfaction. The results show a strong support for this study, with positive and significant effects of CR on the consistency of SD, exporters' logistics CS and exporters' satisfaction. Practical implications - This study proves that exporters' performance derived from the CR results in exporters' loyalty to LSPs, which means LSPs' performance. Originality/value - There are very few studies on utilization of 3PL related to delivery of export goods to overseas buyers and relevant exporters' performance. However, this study has particularly explored the mechanism in the relation of exporters' using 3PL and its performance.","[Park, Yoon-Hwan] Korea Int Trade Assoc, World Trade Acad, Seoul, South Korea; [Jeong, Yoon-Say] Dankook Univ, Sch Econ & Int Trade, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Park, YH (通讯作者)，Korea Int Trade Assoc, World Trade Acad, Seoul, South Korea.",roypark@kita.net,,,,,,,58,4,6,1,14,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

More developed, economically larger, and technologically advanced countries are also the major exporters of new products, spanning a wide range of product categories with high unit values.

The unit root tests are applied to 214 U.S. post-war macroeconomic time series (the same data set as in Stock and Watson, 1999 and Lundbergh, Terasvirta, and van Dijk, 2003), and the overall rejection rate allowing for a linear (nonlinear) trend specification is 50% (67%). The highest rejection rate by an individual test is 40% (53%) and it arises from a time-varying steepness model. The lowest rejection rate of an individual test is the one by the ADF test and equals 12% (19%). The steps of unit root testing and model building are illustrated in more detail for U.S. unemployment rates.

This corresponds to a spending of $233 per person in the world at 2010 constant prices, an amount close to the GDP per capita of the poorest country in the world. Therefore, it is important for economists to understand the allocation of resources to this sector of the economy. I present a model that explores the determinants of a country's level of military spending. I show how greater gains from trade can lead to greater military expenditures to protect them. It is also found that expansion in the demand for a country's tradable commodities, that is, an improvement in that country's terms of trade, will impact defense spending. Several other propositions emerge from the model which are then empirically tested using both pooled and time series data.

We explicitly test the relative PPP hypothesis in light of the short-run price volatility using monthly, bimonthly and quarterly data from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2012. Our findings suggest that the empirical test results from the entire sample period do not support the relative PPP hypothesis. However, the results from the sample period excluding the Asian Financial Crisis period show that the relative PPP hypothesis holds for the Korean won-US dollar market with a moderate magnitude of inflation impact, but not for the Korean won-Japanese yen market. Abrupt changes in exchange rates during the crisis period may have affected the relationship between inflation and exchange rates. This result also suggests that factors other than inflation might have affected the Korean won Japanese yen exchange rate.","[Shim, Hyein] Korea Credit Bur, Retail Finance Res Dept, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Hyeyoen] Chung Ang Univ, Sch Econ, Seoul 156756, South Korea; [Kim, Sunghyun; Ryu, Doojin] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Ryu, D (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Coll Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",sharpjin@skku.edu,"Ryu, Doojin/AAZ-3318-2020","Ryu, Doojin/0000-0002-0059-4887; Shim, Hyein/0000-0002-9595-5509; Kim, Sunghyun/0000-0002-9326-1028",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8060964].,,44,8,10,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The aim of this paper is to identify motivational factors for undergraduate students for entrepreneurial intention. The empirical research was carried on with 19 motivational items (to provide employment, to provide job security, to get Opportunities in the market, to Earn a reasonable living, to take advantage of my creative talent, for my own satisfaction and growth, to be my own boss, to realize my dream, for my personal freedom, to challenge myself, good economic environment, I enjoy taking risk, to invest personal savings, to use the skill learned in the polytechnic, entrepreneurial family culture, increase my prestige and status follow the example of someone that I admire, enjoy myself, to maintain my family) for entrepreneurs and survey was collected from students of Department of Management Undergraduate Professional Study in Sibenik. The Department of Management Undergraduate Professional Study is a part of Polytechnic of Sibenik, and it consists of two studies: Tourism management and IT management, both in duration of 6 semesters. The principal component analysis and descriptive statistics, were used for data analysis.

People living in a particular territory have a need to independently decide matters, which are directly linked to their interests. Initially in most European countries the scope of rights on local self-government differs. The emergence of the European Union raised the need to establish a unifonn standard for local self-governments. The continuing globalization creates the need for empowering the local level. Interconnection and cooperation of local self-government with local businesses and non-governmental sector is playing an increasingly greater role in the age of globalization. Quality in local self-government may be judged from several aspects. One of the aspects which directly affect the quality of life is security. The role of local self-government, inter alia, is to ensure public order, protect the environment and cooperate in the protection of citizens against threats to life and health. This task can be fulfilled only by the quality of the security services. Evaluation of the quality of public services is very important for the management of municipality. Therefore, local self governments are introducing quality assessment and building a quality management system. The paper deals with examination of the quality of services in the field of security in the selected municipality based on a survey of public opinion. The aim is to identify the perception of security of citizens, as an aspect of quality management in local self-government and propose measures for effective actions to enhance the sense of security.","[Soltes, Viktor] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Secur Management, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Stofkova, Zuzana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Dept Econ, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Soltés, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Dept Secur Management, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",Viktor.Soltes@fbi.uniza.sk; Zuzana.Stofkova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Stofkova, Zuzana/B-8635-2017; Soltes, Viktor/E-4014-2017","Stofkova, Zuzana/0000-0003-0209-2079; Soltes, Viktor/0000-0002-2237-2249",,,,,16,9,9,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2060,2067,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800256,0

We use the bootstrap Granger full sample causality, and the sub-sample rolling window approach and results indicate the unidirectional causality running from the PPI to the CPI. By taking the structural changes into consideration, the full sample causal relationship is unstable and such results are misappropriated. Further, we use a time-varying rolling window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationship between the PPI and the CPI. It indicates the existence of bi-directional causality between the two series in several sub-samples and the result supports the neoclassical profit-maximizing model, which shows that PPI plays a key role in the CPI in the Slovakia. We find that the PPI has a more contributing role to the CPI so the central bank can minimise the inflation by taking certain predictive measures to keep the input prices under control. The central bank should consider the reliable response of the prices at an aggregated and disaggregated level of production in the formulation of inflation targeting.","[Su, Chi-Wei] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Khan, Khalid] Ocean Univ China, Sch Econ, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Lobont, Oana-Ramona] West Univ Timisoara, Dept Finance, Pestalozzi St 16, Timisoara 300115, Romania; [Sung, Hao-Chang] Jinan Univ, Coll Econ, Dept Finance, 601 Huangpu Ave West, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China; West University of Timisoara; Jinan University,"Su, CW (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, 238 Songling Rd, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",cwsu7137@gmail.com; shah_khan884@yahoo.com; oana.lobont@e-uvt.ro; frrg4125@hotmail.com,"Lobont, Oana-Ramona/AAP-8584-2020; khan, khalid/AAP-6364-2020; Lobont, Oana Ramona/AHA-3609-2022; Sung, Hao-Chang/ABP-4794-2022; Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021","Lobont, Oana Ramona/0000-0002-2942-3715; Sung, Hao-Chang/0000-0002-0437-9754;","National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155, 15BJY011]; Iceland, Liechtensteinn and Norway through the project 15-SEE-PC-RO-TIMISOA01 ActiveGovEdu [2/24/07.2015]","National Social Science Foundation; Iceland, Liechtensteinn and Norway through the project 15-SEE-PC-RO-TIMISOA01 ActiveGovEdu","This research is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant number: 15BJY155 and 15BJY011), and Supported by a grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway through the project 15-SEE-PC-RO-TIMISOA01 ActiveGovEdu, Contract No. 2/24/07.2015.",,50,5,6,0,9,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

Furthermore, we examine if growth responds differently to corruption and bureaucracy in the new EU members by means of two group-specific interaction variables to capture possible different responses to corruption and bureaucracy. The analysis reveals evidence of conditional convergence in the enlarged EU, with investment share, foreign direct investment, human capital, and country openness appearing as robust growth drivers.

I first document some general analytical results that highlight the central role of the price (accumulative) distribution in linking the hazard function and the impulse response function. I find that nominal rigidity underlying increasing hazard functions is more successful than real rigidity in replicating realistic macro persistence. In addition, numerical simulations show that the interaction between the increasing hazard function and the real rigidity provides a powerful propagation mechanism for monetary shocks.","[Yao, Fang] Reserve Bank New Zealand, Wellington, New Zealand; [Yao, Fang] Univ Erlangen Nuermberg, Nurnberg, Germany",Reserve Bank of New Zealand; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Yao, F (通讯作者)，POB 2498, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",fang.yao@rbnz.govt.nz,,,Reserve Bank of New Zealand; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,Reserve Bank of New Zealand; University of Erlangen-Nuremberg,"I am grateful to Michael Burda, Carlos Carvalho, Christian Merkl, Alexander Meyer-Gohde, Kevin Sheedy, Lutz Weinke, Alexander Wolman, and other seminar participants at the Deutsche Bundesbank and in Berlin for helpful comments.

Historians have established that massive technology imports made possible sustained economic growth and early industrialization during this period, but have not systematically explored the degree to which the skills and know-how embodied in new imported technologies stimulated adaptive and inventive activity in Mexico. Did imported technologies stimulate local technological creativity, or were Mexican technicians largely isolated from the adoption and use of imported techniques? The evidence shows that imports did stimulate patenting activity by Mexicans, although this response was modest in relation to increased patenting by inventors from North Atlantic countries. In general, Mexican inventors focused on activities outside the core technical advances on the global frontier, and often on activities that were more entrepreneurial than technical, although we can observe several important exceptions. These findings support the argument that technological capabilities were scarce in Mexico and local technicians had few opportunities to engage with and learn from imported know-how.","[Beatty, Edward] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Hist, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Beatty, Edward] Univ Notre Dame, Keough Sch Global Affairs, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Beatty, E (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Hist, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ebeatty@nd.edu,,,,,,,46,2,3,0,12,UNIV CHILE DEPT ECONOMICS,SANTIAGO,"DIAGONAL PARAGUAY 257, REGISTRO PROPIEDAD INTELECTUAL 112.761, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0718-5286,,,ESTUD ECONOMIA,Estud.

Given that the price risk is negatively correlated with the inflation risk in the sense of expectation dependence, we show that the firm optimally opts for an over-hedge (under-hedge) if the firm's coefficient of relative risk aversion is everywhere no greater (no smaller) than unity. We show further that banning the firm from forward trading may induce the firm to produce more or less, depending on whether the price risk premium is positive or negative, respectively. While the price risk premium is unambiguously negative in the absence of the inflation risk, it is not the case when the inflation risk prevails. In contrast to the conventional wisdom, forward hedging needs not always promote production should firms take inflation seriously.","[Broll, Udo] Tech Univ Dresden, Sch Int Studies ZIS, Dept Econ & Business, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Hong Kong,"Broll, U (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Sch Int Studies ZIS, Dept Econ & Business, Helmholzstr 10, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",udo.broll@tu-dresden.de,,,,,,,8,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1617-982X,1617-9838,,PORT ECON J,Port.

Nevertheless, some form of status quo bias, which may consist of a combination of loss aversion, gain attraction, regret avoidance, and dislike of trading, and which may be enhanced by indifference between the goods offered, probably remains as an important influence on the trading rate.

The existence of constraints on policy alternatives is estimated for 11 Eurozone countries from 2002 till 2012. The sample is then divided into pre- (2002-2008) and post-crisis (2009-2012) periods. A further division between the PIIGS and the non-PIIGS is then applied. The results show the validity of the trilemma for the whole Euro area and for the whole period but with some distinction between the pre- and post-crisis periods and between the PIIGS and the non-PIIGS countries.

Identification of invoking a NMW is possible by reference to a pre-period (prior to 1999) without a NMW. Separate identification of the effect of incremental changes (and year interaction effects) in the NMW is facilitated by variation in the bite of the NMW across local labour markets. We address the issues of possible endogeneity and dynamic structure of employment rate changes, regional demand side shocks induced by the recession, and take account of the spatial dependence of local labour markets. Using system GMM, we conclude that there is no discernable effect of the NMW introduction or its uprating on employment but show how more na ve estimation may have revealed the various widely different positive and negative effects found in the literature.

We discuss the potential for regulated insurancemarkets to outperform single-payer public insurance. We use as an example the private Medicare plans that now provide insurance to almost a third of seniors in the United States. The evidence suggests that private plans can limit costs and potentially appeal to enrollees, and that well-designed risk adjustment can mitigate market failures due to adverse selection. However, fostering competition between insurers, especially in smaller markets, is difficult. We discuss how future research might illuminate the relative advantages of public and private health insurance.","[Einav, Liran; Levin, Jonathan] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Einav, L (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",leinav@stanford.edu; jdlevin@stanford.edu,,,Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research,Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research,"This paper is based on the Alfred Marshall Lecture delivered by Einav at the EEA-ESEM meetings in Toulouse on August 28, 2014.

Relative to unionisation, two alternative regimes are analysed and compared: 'decentralised unionisation', involving firm-specific unions, and 'centralised unionisation', in which an industry-wide union sets a uniform wage for the entire industry. The 'reversal result' - that is, profits are higher under Bertrand than under Cournot applies irrespective of the unionisation regime and for a very wide range of product differentiation. Moreover, it is more likely to occur when unionisation is decentralised than centralised and, especially when products are not too much differentiated, the profit differential in favour of price competition is also larger in the presence of firm-specific unions. However, if firm owners not only delegate the choice of the strategic variable but also that of the competition regime, managers always opt to compete in quantities, thus generating an inefficient choice for owners.","[Fanti, Luciano; Meccheri, Nicola] Univ Pisa, I-56124 Pisa, Italy; [Meccheri, Nicola] Rimini Ctr Econ Anal, Rimini, Italy",University of Pisa,"Meccheri, N (通讯作者)，Univ Pisa, Dept Econ & Management, Via C Ridolfi 10, I-56124 Pisa, Italy.",nicola.meccheri@unipi.it,"Meccheri, Nicola/AGK-0269-2022","Meccheri, Nicola/0000-0002-2251-0365",,,,,66,10,10,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

Laboratory experiments have largely confirmed this prediction, though the results of recent field experiments have been mixed, especially in developing countries. I create a multiround trading market in Uganda to explore the efficiency of trading and test whether traders' personal traits are associated with market efficiency and individual bargaining success. To test the effects of individual traits, I utilize data on measures of the traders' human and physical capital, risk and time preferences, and social orientation, specifically pro- and antisocial behavior and aggression. I find that the buyers' and sellers' relative levels of social orientation and human capital are associated with levels of market efficiency within rounds. Measures of social orientation, however, are less associated with individual success. I also find that rents obtained in the experiment are strongly associated with the wealth levels of participants two years later, but this association is limited to those who were randomly assigned to be buyers in the experiment. I present evidence that this association is driven by greater buyer bargaining ability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In practical energy policy analysis, the typical indicator used as a proxy for energy efficiency is energy intensity. However, this simple indicator is not necessarily an accurate measure given changes in energy intensity are a function of changes in several factors as well as 'true' energy efficiency; hence, it is difficult to make conclusions for energy policy based upon simple energy intensity measures. Related to this, some published academic papers over the last few years have attempted to use empirical methods to measure the efficient use of energy based on the economic theory of production. However, these studies do not generally provide a systematic discussion of the theoretical basis nor the possible parametric empirical approaches that are available for estimating the level of energy efficiency. The objective of this paper, therefore, is to sketch out and explain from an economic perspective the theoretical framework as well as the empirical methods for measuring the level of energy efficiency. Additionally, in the second part of the paper, some of the empirical studies that have attempted to measure energy efficiency using such an economics approach are summarized and discussed.

The GE model as presented by Arrow, Debreu and McKenzie is a non-process model; and the original theory deals with the non-constructive proofs of existence of competitive equilibria (CEs). To associate this theory with GE it is necessary to recast the basic model as a process model. The GE model is enlarged and specified as a playable game by adding rules to describe the mechanisms that carry process. Although we believe that GE was a great intellectual achievement, it strangled dynamics and the type of low dimensional equilibrium dynamics of the rational expectations school is profoundly misleading. It turns out that, by remodeling GE as a process model even with only one or two strategic moves, Pandora's Box of mechanisms appears and the functions of markets, money and default conditions all emerge as logical necessities. It is shown that the opportunity for process innovation can be described minimally and formally modeled by considering the availability of a new process as a function of a controlled stochastic variable where success depends on chance modified by the level of investment. The Schumpeterian concept of breaking the circular flow of capital appears naturally as a disequilibrium phenomenon where the extra resources are captured by a strategic disequilibrating allocation of money.

This paper uses a computable general equilibrium model to compare a number of rules for sharing the burden of emission reductions among Canadian provinces. Because of the substantial heterogeneity among Canadian provinces, these different rules imply significantly different relative abatement effort among provinces, and also significantly different welfare implications. We compare these archetypal burden sharing rules to existing provincial emission reduction commitments and find that none of the standard burden sharing rules comes close to existing commitments.","[Boehringer, Christoph] Carl von Ossietzky Univ Oldenburg, Dept Econ, D-26111 Oldenburg, Germany; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rivers, Nicholas] Univ Ottawa, Inst Environm, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Rutherford, Thomas] Univ Wisconsin, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Wigle, Randall] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Balsillie Sch Int Affairs, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Wigle, Randall] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada",Carl von Ossietzky Universitat Oldenburg; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Waterloo; Wilfrid Laurier University; Wilfrid Laurier University,"Rivers, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",nrivers@uOttawa.ca,,,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Research Chairs program; Carbon Management Canada,Social Science and Humanities Research Council Canada Research Chairs program; Carbon Management Canada,"We acknowledge support from and cooperation with Environment and Climate Change Canada in developing the multi-provincial CGE model for Canada, which is used for the analysis.

We model a two-sided market, where Content Providers (CPs) and consumers interact through Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and CPs sell consumers' attention to advertisers. Under Net Neutrality, a zero-price rule is enforced. By contrast, in the Unregulated Regime, ISPs make access to their subscribers for CPs conditional on payment of a termination fee. Multiple impressions of an ad on the same consumer are partially wasteful. Thus, equilibrium ad rates decrease when audiences overlap. We show that ISPs may strategically set termination fees to induce fragmentation. This takes place when advertising revenues are potentially large but strongly diminished by competition among CPs, and when consumers are not highly sensitive to content availability. We therefore identify an important link between termination fees, the online advertising market and Internet fragmentation. We extend the model to account for multi-homing consumers, vertically integrated ISPs, third-party advertising platforms and heterogeneous CPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce two stability concepts and provide sufficient and necessary conditions on the network structure that guarantee existence, in cases of the absence of externalities, link-based externalities and crowding externalities. We show that institutional arrangements based on socioeconomic roles and leadership guarantee stability. In particular, the stability of more complex economic outcomes requires more strict and complex institutional rules to govern economic interactions.

By deriving the stability condition of multi-country equilibrium, we show that DMI is hardly compatible with stability. If there are two or more DMI countries, wealth distribution is necessarily unstable and hence inequality is inevitably divergent. In the presence of a DMI country, the number of interdependent countries should be small enough for stability. To integrate capital markets, participant countries must thus arrange jointly certain stabilizing international schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The explicit solutions of the robust consumption and portfolio choice problem are obtained, the implications of the four factors for consumption and portfolio choice are discussed, and then the dynamics of consumption and the formula of asset pricing are derived. It is shown that the combined effects of habit formation which stems from past consumption, the spirit of capitalism which endows investors with direct wealth preferences, recursive utility which allows the separation of risk aversion and intertemporal substitution and robustness which takes account of model uncertainty can better interpret the consumption smoothing puzzle and the equity premium puzzle than cases which only consider one factor.","[Wang, Haijun] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Math, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Haijun] Shanghai Key Lab Financial Informat Technol, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hou, L.

The charges may affect international competitiveness of the country, since they are applied to the domestically produced, but not to the imported commodities. We investigate how such environmental taxation of six main pollutants affects the Czech competitiveness. Using computable general equilibrium modeling with bottom-up approach, we consider a small-open economy with endogenous unemployment and ten types of taxes. A distinction between taxes on products and taxes on production is essential for analysis of a fiscal policy. Emissions reduction is possible in our model either through substitution with less polluting inputs, or a reduction of output, or through technical abatement. The last channel for emission reduction is ignored by other studies. The results show that the imports should not be affected by the tax reform, except for coal. Exports will increase in the non-energy-intensive and the biomass industries, but it will decrease in the chemical, the coal, and the metal industries. The overall effect on the trade balance is slightly negative.

The cash benefit was first introduced in 1995 and the replacement rate was 25%. The replacement rate was raised from 25% to 40% in 2001. During this period, the maximum duration of paid leave and that of job-protection remained unchanged, and therefore, I can isolate the effects of changes in the amount of cash benefit from those due to changes in duration of leave. By comparing the job continuity of women who gave birth to their child before the reform and those who did so after the reform, I find little evidence that the labour supply pattern of new mothers changed in response to the increased cash benefit.

An activist regime, in which the central bank exploits its own information to engage in stabilization, is found to be unambiguously superior to a noninterventionist regime, where the central bank maintains a constant setting of policy but publicly discloses its own information.","[James, Jonathan G.; Lawler, Phillip] Swansea Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales",Swansea University,"Lawler, P (通讯作者)，Swansea Univ, Coll Business & Econ, Singleton Pk, Swansea SA2 8PP, W Glam, Wales.",jonathan.g.james@swansea.ac.uk; p.lawler@swansea.ac.uk,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,Royal Economic Society; Leverhulme Trust,Royal Economic Society; Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),The authors express thanks to an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

This article directly examines the impact of fiscal policy on incumbents' reelection prospects by focusing on the impact of public investment. This impact is estimated using a panel of 20 countries belonging in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development over the period 1972-1999. We find that the level of public investment in the earlier years of an incumbent's term in office improves their reelection prospects, whereas election year manipulation of public investment is neither rewarded nor punished. Our evidence also suggests that, after controlling for the level of deficit and public investment, the level of government revenue both in the election and nonelection years does not seem to affect reelection prospects. Moreover, we find that deficit creation during elections and in nonelection years are not rewarded by voters.","[Katsimi, Margarita] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Athens 10434, Greece; [Sarantides, Vassilis] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DT, S Yorkshire, England",Athens University of Economics & Business; University of Sheffield,"Katsimi, M (通讯作者)，Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Int & European Econ Studies, Patision Str 76, Athens 10434, Greece.",mkatsimi@aueb.gr; v.saranti-des@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Sarantides, Vassilis/0000-0001-9096-4505",,,,,67,7,8,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

In more than thirty villages of rural Uganda, we conduct a social survey to document social links between pairs of individuals within a village, and separately elicit individual risk attitudes using an incentivized task. Our findings reveal that the difference in risk attitudes between two individuals is significantly and positively related to the presence of interpersonal conflict between them. This relationship is particularly strong among kin. By contrast, the strength of risk aversion per se is not related to conflict. Further, we conduct simulations that suggest that the relationship cannot be solely explained by diverging attitudes after the severing of social ties as a result of interpersonal conflict.

Our results suggest that while the overall level of education and intergenerational education mobility has increased over time, there are considerable regional and gender differences. Daughters' education attainment is still relatively highly correlated with their parents compared to sons and the extent of absolute upward mobility was modest while immobility and downward mobility have remained relatively steady during the last five decades. During this period, relative education opportunities have increased over time at lower education levels, while the trend has been comparatively stable at higher levels.","[Ranasinghe, Rasika] Univ Adelaide, Workplace Innovat & Social Res Ctr, Adelaide, SA 5067, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Ranasinghe, R (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Workplace Innovat & Social Res Ctr, 230 North Tce, Adelaide, SA 5067, Australia.",rranasinghe@gmail.com,,"Ranasinghe, Rasika/0000-0002-3773-1910","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

I develop a highly tractable general equilibrium model of international trade with heterogeneous firms and non-homothetic consumer preferences that positively links prices of tradables to consumer income. Guided by the model's testable prediction, I estimate the elasticity of price with respect to per capita income from a unique data set that I construct, which features prices of 245 identical goods sold in 29 European, Asian, and North American markets via the Internet by Spain's second largest apparel manufacturer-Mango. I find that doubling a destination's per capita income results in an 18% increase in the price of identical items sold there. Per capita income differences account for a third, whereas shipping cost differences can explain up to a third of the cross-country price variations of identical items purchased via the Internet by consumers who do not take advantage of quantity discounts. The price elasticity estimates compare favourably to estimates that I obtain from a standard data set that features prices across retail locations around the world, suggesting that variable mark-ups play a key role in accounting for observed cross-country differences in prices of tradables.","[Simonovska, Ina] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Simonovska, Ina] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Simonovska, I (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",,,,University of Minnesota; Princeton University,University of Minnesota(University of Minnesota System); Princeton University(Princeton University),"I am grateful to my Ph.D. thesis advisors Timothy Kehoe and Fabrizio Perri for their continued guidance and encouragement throughout this project.

Research, however, has yet to examine how an individual's perceptions of congruence with an object may impact the endowment effect. This research fills this gap by examining how branding impacts the endowment effect. Using self-congruence theory, this paper demonstrates that self-congruence with a brand will impact both the price a seller is willing to accept for an object and the price a buyer is willing to pay for an object. Moreover, self-congruence with the brand impacts valuation only when it is positive with no effect shown under conditions of brand incongruence. Furthermore, this research demonstrates that the endowment effect can be qualified under specific conditions of asymmetry in self-congruence with the brand between the seller and the buyer. Specifically, buyers with high perceptions of self-congruence with the brand will be willing to pay a price that is not statistically different to that of the price demanded by sellers who are incongruent with the brand. Conversely, the disparity between valuations, as compared to a control, is increased when the seller is congruent, but the buyer is incongruent with the brand. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These policies can generate trade frictions. For example, in the Canadian renewable energy dispute the EU and Japan claimed that Feed in Tariff (FIT) programs in Ontario constitute discriminatory subsidies because of a local content requirement (LCR) clause that is incompatible with World Trade Organization obligations. This paper investigates this issue using an international quality differentiated duopoly model in which power generation equipment producers compete on price. FIT programs including those with a LCR are compared for their impacts on trade, profits, amount of renewable electricity produced, and welfare. When sales are taken into account, the results confirm discrimination. However, introducing a difference in the quality of the power generation equipment produced on both sides of the border has a moderating effect on the results.

Before the game starts, the principal decides on a rule of midterm review: whether the subjective interim performance or the agent's ability (or both or neither) will be evaluated at the end of the first stage. Review results can be used to determine the agent's replacement and compensation. I show that conducting an ability appraisal removes the feedback role of interim performance evaluation (IPE) and undermines the principal's honesty in reporting the subjective IPE result. A key result is that no incentive scheme based on a subjective IPE is enforceable in the presence of an ability appraisal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, a growing body of empirical literature has attempted to understand the effect of lacking legal status on immigrants' outcomes and behaviour. The main difficulties in this field are the scarcity of data and the identification challenge posed by endogenous selection into legal status. The vast majority of these articles have therefore used amnesty programmes (or similar policy changes) to establish causal relationships. In this article, we propose a first systematic review of the empirical literature for the USA and Europe on the impact of legal status on different immigrants' outcomes. We then present some new evidence of the relationship between labour market outcomes and legal status in the Italian context. In our empirical analysis, we first provide some descriptive evidence on differences in the outcomes for groups with different residence statuses, and we then exploit a specific amnesty programme to produce causal estimates of the impact of legal status. Our results confirm previous findings in the literature and show that the design of the specific amnesty analysed matters in shaping its effects.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, with a superabundant level of reserve balances in the banking system having been created as a result of the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchase programs, this approach to implementing monetary policy will no longer work. This paper provides a primer on the Fed's implementation of monetary policy. We use the standard textbook model to illustrate why the approach used by the Federal Reserve before the financial crisis to keep the federal funds rate near the Federal Open Market Committee's target will not work in current circumstances, and explain the approach that the Committee intends to use instead when it decides to begin raising short-term interest rates.","[Ihrig, Jane E.; Meade, Ellen E.; Weinbach, Gretchen C.] Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Ihrig, JE (通讯作者)，Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, Div Monetary Affairs, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",jane.e.ihrig@frb.gov; ellen.meade@frb.gov; gweinbach@frb.gov,,,,,,,11,14,18,2,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We extend previous research in two ways. First, by allowing for a more flexible relationship between SoL and income, the structure of the estimated disability cost and equivalence scale is not dictated by a restrictive functional form assumption. Second, we allow for the latent nature of disability and SoL, addressing measurement error in the disability and SoL indicators in surveys. We find that disability costs are strongly related to severity of disability, and vary with income in absolute and proportionate terms. Older people above the median disability level require an extra 99 pound per week (2007 prices) on average to reach the SoL of an otherwise similar person at the median. Costs faced by older people in the highest decile of disability average 180 pound.","[Morciano, Marcello; Hancock, Ruth] Univ E Anglia, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Pudney, Stephen] Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of East Anglia; University of Essex,"Morciano, M (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Hlth Econ Grp, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",m.morciano@uea.ac.uk,"Morciano, Marcello/K-3083-2019; Morciano, Marcello/D-5030-2017","Morciano, Marcello/0000-0002-0009-5201; Morciano, Marcello/0000-0002-0009-5201; Pudney, Stephen/0000-0002-5697-0976","Nuffield Foundation; Australian Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H00811X/1, 1012024, ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L009153/1, ES/H00811X/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Nuffield Foundation; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Economic and Social Research Council through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Note: This work was supported by the Nuffield Foundation, by the Australian Research Council, and by the Economic and Social Research Council through the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change (MiSoC).

First, we show that the bias in equilibrium technology in the resource-poor North is determined by its relative abundance of human capital and physical capital. Secondly, we show that the equilibrium bias in technology in the resource-abundant South is dependent positively (negatively) on the relative abundance (scarcity) of skilled (unskilled) labour and the relative abundance (scarcity) of physical (natural) capital in the North. This force is dampened by the relative scarcity of skilled labour and physical capital in the South. These forces drive wage inequality, high cost of capital and skill technology mismatch in the South, all of which are bad for growth.

We present evidence suggesting the presence of a perceived instrumental benefit of individual political communication. Subjects may send a sometimes costly comment on another person's choice of how to donate to two rival political groups. Subjects who may comment before the choice is made - when they may have some persuasive impact - are more than twice as likely to comment as those who may only send a message after the decision. When the timing of the messages - pre- or post-decision - remains fixed, but the experimenter alone receives the message, there is no difference in the proportion of messages sent pre- and post-decision. Moreover, most of the comments made to the decision-maker prior to the decision use an imperative construction, while few do so after the decision is made or when writing to the experimenter alone. Taken together, these results indicate that political expression is both expressive and instrumental. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The regional input-output model built on the example of the Vysoeina region serves as a tool for the analysis. To perform the impact analysis a regional input-output table for the Vysoeina region was constructed by using GRIT method. A part of the analysis is the identification of factors that influence the size of the impacts found. The main findings show that analysed measures have positive impact on regional economy of the Vysoeina region, mainly in terms of impacts on production. However, final impacts on production, income and employment are very low. Impact analysis indicates that investment in tourism represents an important factor leading to the improvement of Vysoeina region's economy.","Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Bednaríková, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Prague, Czech Republic.",bednarikova.zuzana@uzei.cz,,,,,,,45,8,8,0,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We study potential explanations for this phenomenon. After adjusting for the difference in the cost of living across provinces, we find that some of the cross-province differences in real wages could be related to the quality of labour, industry composition and geographic location of provinces. These factors, taken together, explain approximately half of the cross-province real wage variation. Interestingly, we find that interprovincial government transfers have not offset regional wage differences during the time period we consider. We also demonstrate that interprovincial migration, while driven in part by levels and changes in wage differences across provinces, did not help offset these differences. These results are consistent with findings in the literature that cross-province labour mobility in China is still limited.","[Candelaria, Christopher] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Daly, Mary; Hale, Galina] Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA",Stanford University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco,"Hale, G (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, 101 Market St,MS1130, San Francisco, CA 94105 USA.",galina.b.hale@sf.frb.org,,,,,,,28,3,3,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

While periods of upswing are characterised by a well documented 'virtuous circle' between innovation inputs, new products and export success, during downswings most of the positive relationships and feedbacks tend to break down. The findings of Guarascio et al. in (University of Urbino DESP WP 1406, 2014) on the long-term relationships between R&D, new products and exports are confirmed and qualified with major novelties. But when the period of analysis is split between periods of upswing and downswing-following Lucchese and Pianta in (Comparat Econ Stud, 54: 341-359, 2012)-significantly different relationships emerge. These results are obtained through an approach that combines several complementary perspectives. A Schumpeterian view on the diversity of technological change allows to disentangle the specificities and effects of innovation inputs and outputs, and of new products and new processes. A structural change perspective on the role of demand as a driver of innovation and on the importance of open economies allows to link industries' dynamics with international competitiveness. A business cycle perspective crossing the two previous approaches sheds new light on the fragility of key economic relationships and on the long term damage that recessions may cause to the 'virtuous circle' of innovation and performance. The model we propose links exports, R&D and innovation success in a system of three simultaneous equations allowing for the presence of feedbacks loops among key variables. The empirical test is carried out for the period 1995-2010 at the industry level, on 21 manufacturing and 17 service sectors; country coverage includes Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, representing a very large part of the European economy.","[Guarascio, Dario] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Pianta, Mario] Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy; [Lucchese, Matteo] Ist Nazl Stat, Istat, Rome, Italy; [Bogliacino, Francesco] Univ Nacl Colombia, Bogota, Colombia",Sapienza University Rome; University of Urbino; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Pianta, M (通讯作者)，Univ Urbino Carlo Bo, Urbino, Italy.",mario.pianta@uniurb.it,"Guarascio, Dario/AAF-4189-2019","Guarascio, Dario/0000-0002-2748-6472; Bogliacino, Francesco/0000-0001-8874-8846",,,,,85,19,19,1,25,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

Furthermore, we show that focusing our attention on fixed-price contracts as a form of formal contracts is without loss of generality. The key driving force is a possibility that the relation-specific investment decreases the surplus under no trade.

However, only in a few studies has trade balance been decomposed into intra balance, trade balance vis-a-vis the euro area, and extra balance, trade balance vis-a-vis the rest of the world. This decomposition is necessary for us to understand why some core euro area countries are acting as financial intermediaries for the periphery countries. Furthermore, the determinants of intra and extra balances might be different because nominal exchange rate cannot adjust between the EMU countries while their financial markets are highly integrated. Thus, we apply this decomposition and supplement the previous studies by including a larger set of theoretically plausible explanatory variables, which is derived from the current account literature. Our contribution is twofold: We observe that, contrary to Schmitz and von Hagen (2011), the introduction of a common currency has not increased the elasticity of net capital flows to per capita incomes within the euro area for the member countries. On the other hand, there is a great heterogeneity among the usual determinants of trade balances whether those contribute to intra balances or extra balances. These results increase our understanding of the imbalances in the euro area. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It asserts that the debate should distinguish between ex-ante and ex-post perspectives. Ex-post, i.e. once the research is done, instrumentalism might be given priority because in this situation, significant predictive power is the key. On the other hand, ex-ante, i.e. before any model revealed its predictive power, only realism may give a hint of which direction is promising to pay off the effort. Thus both realism and instrumentalism play their role in the scientific activity, depending on the stage of the research. In this paper I argue that in order to develop economic realism, we should have recourse to phenomenology. Phenomenology analyses the thought constructs of ordinary people, classifies them and seeks the underlying invariant structure. Realistic social science should build on these invariant structures; only then the link to social reality is not lost.","[Svoboda, Miroslav] Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Svoboda, Miroslav] Univ JE Purkyne, Usti Nad Labem, Czech Republic",Anglo-American University; University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Svoboda, M (通讯作者)，Angloamer Univ, Prague, Czech Republic.",miroslav.svoboda@aauni.edu,"Svoboda, Miroslav/AAE-5534-2020",,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

When VIXs are over specific thresholds (30.69 and 31.04), the stock returns in G-10 and ASEAN-5 display moderate and similar persistence effects and make lagged stock returns become more important when evaluating current stock returns. The spillover effects occur from VIX to stock returns. The speculation behavior of stock markets in ASEAN-5 is higher than that in G-10; however, the result in the efficiency of stock markets is the opposite.","[Wu, Po-Chin; Tai, Xue-Ling] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Chungli 320, Taiwan; [Pan, Sheng-Chieh] China Univ Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, 200 Chung Pei Rd, Chungli 320, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,4,4,1,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42.0,3,,,,,597,613,,10.1007/s10663-014-9266-y,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800006,0

Estimates of the model for Spanish regions show that (i) knowledge creation depends on local R&D effort, on the amount of knowledge in use, and on knowledge creation in neighboring regions; and (ii) assimilation of new knowledge depends on local knowledge creation and on assimilation of knowledge in neighboring regions. Both processes include region-specific context fixed effects and region-specific time effects, representing region-specific dynamic influences. The results imply that (a) efficiency gains at regional level may be achieved by investing locally in the creation of new knowledge, either technological or organizational; (b) creation of knowledge in a region may be promoted by using greater amounts of already existing knowledge, as well as by increasing local R&D effort; (c) both knowledge creation and knowledge assimilation spread to/from neighboring regions; and (d) regional contexts influence both knowledge creation and knowledge assimilation separately.","[Vila, Luis E.; Pavia, Jose M.] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain; [Cabrer, Bernardi] Univ Valencia, Dept Econ Anal, Valencia 46022, Spain",University of Valencia; University of Valencia,"Pavía, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ, Valencia 46022, Spain.",jose.m.pavia@uv.es,"Bernardi, Cabrer-Borras/P-5073-2016; Pavia, Jose M.

As a consequence, incentives are often considered ethically superior to regulations because they are voluntary rather than coercive. But incentives can also be viewed as one way to get others to do what they otherwise would not; that is, as a form of power. When incentives are viewed in this light, many ethical questions arise in addition to voluntariness: What are the responsibilities of the powerful in using incentives? Can incentives be manipulative or exploitative, even if people are free to refuse them? Like all other forms of power, incentives can be abused. This paper develops criteria for distinguishing their legitimate from their illegitimate uses, viz. legitimacy of purpose, voluntariness, and effect on character. The criteria are then applied to three cases: plea bargaining, recruiting medical research subjects, and motivating children to learn. Thinking of incentives in terms of power relations, rather than as a form of trade, yields a strikingly different account of the ethical issues involved in their use.","Duke Univ, Polit Sci & Philosophy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Grant, RW (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Polit Sci & Philosophy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",grant@duke.edu,,,,,,,59,10,13,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

With added exogenous taste heterogeneity, endogenous spatial heterogeneity drives profits below their levels with only taste heterogeneity. Finally, we introduce multiple product lines and show that when product costs differ across lines, firms earn positive profits as long as consumer preferences over lines are imperfectly correlated.","[Graham, Brett] Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, Xiamen 361006, Fujian Province, Peoples R China; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Champaign, IL 61820 USA; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Xiamen University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University of Warwick,"Graham, B (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ, Wang Yanan Inst Studies Econ, 422 Siming South Rd, Xiamen 361006, Fujian Province, Peoples R China.",danber@illinois.edu; bgraham.wise@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,14,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

However, in many markets, the matching is determined in decentralized fashion and continues to change. This paper considers infinitely-repeated matching games, where firms whose positions become vacant make offers to workers, who then decide which offers to accept and the game continues. We study how the stationary-equilibrium outcome depends on whether players commit to their employment relationships. We show that, without commitment from either side of the market (i.e., each contract expires in a period), the equilibrium matching is stable in all periods. With one-sided commitment (where firms offer tenured jobs) or two-sided commitment, the final matching may be unstable. With one-sided commitment, the final matching may be one where all workers are worse off and all firms are better off than in every stable matching, implying that the workers are made worse off by job protection.

We show that restricting trading opportunities after an initial round of trade is always optimal. Under a sufficient condition it is optimal to subsidize trades only at time zero while imposing prohibitively high taxes afterwards. If interventions are required to generate a Pareto improvement over laissez-faire then trade is only restricted for a short amount of time. If additional sellers can arrive later, the optimal policy entails asset purchases and price controls. Subsidies can greatly enhance welfare but can be detrimental if provided with delay.

We find a high level of financial inclusion in China manifested by greater use of formal account and formal savings than in the other BRICS. Financial exclusion, i.e., not having a formal account, is mainly voluntary. The use of formal credit is however less frequent in China than in the other BRICS. Borrowing through family or friends is the most common way of obtaining credit in all the BRICS countries, but other channels for borrowing are not very commonly used by individuals in China. We find that higher income, better education, being a man, and being older are associated with greater use of formal accounts and formal credit in China. Income and education influence the use of alternative sources of borrowing. Overall financial inclusion does not constitute a major problem in China, but such limited use of formal credit can create a challenge for further economic development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In our framework, individuals choose when to stop working and, given eligibility criteria, when/if to apply for disability and pension benefits. Agents are heterogeneous in skills and receive exogenous shocks to health throughout their life.

Our study uses the dynamic generalized method of moments approach with a panel database containing 171 Chinese commercial banks. We find that bank capital has significant influence on bank profitability and risk, but its impact has declined since China joined the WTO in 2001. For different sized groups, the impact of capital on profitability exhibits a distinct trend. The effects of capital on bank risk are different for large and small banks depending on the risk variables used for the Chinese banking industry.","[Lee, Chien-Chiang; Ning, Shao-Lin] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Lee, Chi-Chuan] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Management, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China",National Sun Yat Sen University; Beijing Normal University; Beijing Normal University Zhuhai,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Management, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw; d014030006@student.nsysu.edu.tw; leechichuan@bnuz.edu.cn,"Lee, Chi-Chuan/AAD-2211-2020; Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chi-Chuan/0000-0003-0644-1168; Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,40,12,15,5,57,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2015,23.0,4,,,,,19,39,,10.1111/cwe.12119,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN3MG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358330100002,0

We show that the freedom to set different mechanisms at different histories can give the planner an additional leverage to deter undesirable behavior even if the mechanisms are restricted to be simple and finite. Specifically, we construct a history-dependent sequence of simple mechanisms such that, with minor qualifications, every pure subgame perfect equilibrium delivers the correct social choice at every history, while every mixed equilibrium is strictly Pareto-dominated. More importantly, when faced with agents with a preference for less complex strategies at the margin, the (efficient) social choice function can be repeatedly implemented in subgame perfect equilibrium in pure or mixed strategies. Our results demonstrate a positive role for complexity considerations in mechanism design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper compares alternative preference consistent methods for estimating spatial price differences in a large heterogeneous country, namely India, that are benchmarked against the spatial prices generated by the Laspyeres and Tornqvist price indices. Unlike the use of conventional price indices, the use of demand-systems-based methods allows the incorporation of price-induced substitution effects between items. The paper illustrates the usefulness of the methodology by using the exact spatial price indices, in conjunction with the inequality-sensitive welfare measure due to Sen, to rank the Indian states and examine changes in ranking during one of the most significant periods in independent India.

In China's case, transformed illiquid central bank liabilities could double or triple the stock of government bonds. Central bank liabilities can be transformed into government bonds either through the government's purchase of foreign exchange reserves held by the central bank or by the government overfunding its borrowing requirement and depositing the proceeds in the central bank. The overfunding approach is preferred if, for financial stability reasons, it is judged prudent to leave the central bank with sufficient resources to serve itself as lender of last resort in foreign currency to the banking system. In the case of China, public debt consolidation could also contribute to further liberalizing the Chinese banking system, wider international use of the renminbi and more balanced holdings of key currency government bonds.","[McCauley, Robert] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Basel, Switzerland; [Ma, Guonan] Fung Global Inst, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"McCauley, R (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Basel, Switzerland.",Robert.mccauley@bis.org; Guonanma@fginstitute.org,,,,,,,24,5,5,0,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2015,23.0,4,,,,,1,18,,10.1111/cwe.12118,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN3MG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358330100001,0

In so doing, we represent welfare as a linear combination of the variance of a common term in an equilibrium strategy and that of an idiosyncratic term, which are referred to as the common variance and the idiosyncratic variance of actions, respectively. The ratio of their coefficients is a key parameter in our condition. If the coefficient of the common variance is relatively large, welfare necessarily increases, but if it is relatively small, welfare can decrease.

Using the ORBIS database, we show that intangible asset endowment of subsidiaries and the supply-chain complexity of MNE groups explain aggregate profit-shifting trends. According to our estimates, subsidiaries with no intangibles react to an incremental increase of the tax rate by reducing reported profits by 0.76 %, while subsidiaries with above median intangible endowment decrease their profits by 1.2 %. This difference is significant at the 5 % level. We find an even more pronounced difference in the observed semi-elasticities comparing affiliates belonging to simple (0.52) and more complex MNEs (1.92), suggesting a significantly larger sensitivity to CIT rate changes of the latter group. Moreover, we incorporate country-specific transfer pricing mitigation measures (documentation requirements) into our analysis. We find significant mitigation effects, which vary depending on the drivers identified in our analysis. On average, estimated profit shifting among MNE subsidiaries in our sample is reduced by 52 % 2 years after the introduction of mandatory documentation requirements. We do, however, not find a significant effect on affiliates with high intangible endowments, whereas documentation reduces profit shifting of subsidiaries within complex MNE groups. Our analysis suggests that complexity poses less of a challenge to effective domestic enforcement than the appropriate pricing of intangible assets. These findings thus provide additional insights on profit-shifting risks and mitigation effects conditional on firm attributes, which may support the design of anti-avoidance approaches and help guide the allocation of scarce analytical and enforcement resources.","[Beer, Sebastian; Loeprick, Jan] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria; [Loeprick, Jan] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Vienna University of Economics & Business; The World Bank,"Beer, S (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Vienna, Austria.",sebastian.beer@wu.ac.at,,"Loeprick, Jan/0000-0002-8562-1636",Austrian Science Fund [FWF: W 1235-G16]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [W1235] Funding Source: Austrian Science Fund (FWF),Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)); Austrian Science Fund (FWF)(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers, participants of the DIBT research seminar at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, participants of the annual doctoral meeting at the Centre for Business Taxation of the University of Oxford, as well as participants of the Investment Climate Department research workshop on business taxation at the World Bank for their helpful comments.

J,"Caldentey, EP; Vernengo, M",,,,"Caldentey, Esteban Perez; Vernengo, Matias",,,Towards an understanding of crisis episodes in Latin America: a post-Keynesian approach,REVIEW OF KEYNESIAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,business fluctuations; Great Recession; Latin America,,"Conventional wisdom about the business cycle in Latin America assumes that monetary shocks cause deviations from the optimal path, and that the triggering factor in the cycle is excess credit and liquidity. Furthermore, in this view the origin of the contraction is ultimately related to the excesses during the expansion. For that reason it follows that avoiding the worst conditions during the bust entails applying restrictive economic policies during the expansion (that is, the boom) in the business cycle including reining in government expenditures and reducing liquidity to private agents. In this paper we develop an alternative approach that suggests that fiscal restraint may not have a significant impact in reducing the risks of a crisis, and that excessive fiscal conservatism might actually exacerbate problems. In the case of Central America, the efforts to reduce fiscal imbalances, in conjunction with the persistent current-account deficits, implied that financial inflows, with remittances being particularly important in some cases, allowed for an expansion of a private spending boom that proved unsustainable once the Great Recession led to a sharp fall in external funds. In the case of South America, the commodity boom created conditions for growth without hitting the external constraint. Fiscal restraint in the South American context has resulted, in some cases, in lower rates of growth than what otherwise would have been possible as a result of the absence of an external constraint. Yet the lower reliance on external funds has made South American countries less vulnerable to the external shock waves of the Great Recession than Central American economies.","[Caldentey, Esteban Perez] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile; [Vernengo, Matias] Bucknell Univ, Lewisburg, PA 17837 USA",Bucknell University,"Caldentey, EP (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This may lead to the slowdown of economic and institutional reforms sometimes followed by a lack of support for reform in popular votes at election time. Conditions under which this situation may occur are identified. The model is empirically tested for the period 1990-2001, encompassing more than fifteen East European countries. Results of the analysis suggest that the impact of external pressure expressed as the amount of U.S. loans on voting outcomes in transitional countries is significant. Consistent with prior expectations, a new class of private landowners and farmers support further privatization and market orientation and consequently vote for Western-oriented parties. Likewise, a new system of market based economies brings along more volatility and uncertainty creating an income based population segmentation and inequality. Higher fertility rates which are typically associated with lower income levels lead to fewer votes going to reformist, pro-market parties. Hence, foreign investors will clearly have to target the more affluent segment of populations in transitional economies for more support.","N Dakota State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58108 USA",North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovic, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, NDSU Dept 7610, Fargo, ND 58108 USA.",Dragan.Miljkovic@ndsu.edu,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

A model of the German market is built from publicly available data. Various constraints on the supply side such as operational characteristics of power plants are described, characterized and ultimately formulated as constraints of a cost-minimization problem. Unknown power plant characteristics are estimated by expert opinions or are inferred indirectly from other data. Several scenarios testing the impact of constraints and modelling approaches are analysed. In addition, a future scenario simulating the year 2016 is used to forecast price developments under the ongoing massive renewable energy growth. Finally, results are discussed with respect to price forecasting accuracy with a focus on the changes in the volatility of prices.","[Sumbera, Jiri; Dlouhy, Martin] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Sumbera, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Fac Informat & Stat, Prague, Czech Republic.",sumbera@jikos.cz; dlouhy@vse.cz,"Dlouhy, Martin/I-3913-2018",,,,,,11,3,3,0,5,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

However when measuring hedging performance, the role of returns and investor risk aversion has generally been neglected in the literature, by its focus on minimum variance hedging. In this paper we address this by using utility based performance metrics to evaluate the hedging effectiveness of utility based hedges for hedgers with both moderate and high risk aversion together with the more traditional minimum variance approach. To examine this for an energy hedger, we apply our approach to WTI Crude Oil, for three different hedging horizons, daily, weekly and monthly. We find significant differences between the minimum variance and utility based hedging strategies in-sample for all frequencies. However performance differentials between the different strategies are small and not economically significant. Out-of-sample results support these findings across all frequencies.

Under certain circumstances, any policy which promotes CSR diffusion induces a reduction in income inequality.

Unless the cost of adjustment is zero, the domestic tax on foreign-source income should always be set to ensure the optimal allocation of the mobile factor between domestic and foreign assets and should follow the classical rules in the literature; national optimality requires the deduction rule, and global optimality requires the credit rule. Only in the zero-cost case does exemption become optimal. Allowances can be set so as to ensure that domestic and foreign asset purchases are undistorted by the tax system: this requires a cash-flow tax on domestic investment in the greenfield case, and a cross-border cash flow tax on foreign investment in both cases. These basic results extend to various extensions of the model, notably: (i) when a profit-shifting motive is present; and (ii) to some extent, when a corporate income tax is in place. The introduction of tax administration costs into the model can explain the empirical trend towards the use of the exemption regime. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The antitrust implications of the model depend on the relative degree of oligopoly rivalry in the upstream and downstream markets. Firms strategically precommit to setting prices in the less rivalrous market, which serves to soften competition in the more rivalrous market, resulting in anticompetitive effects. Bertrand prices emerge in equilibrium when the markets are equally rivalrous, while Cournot outcomes arise with upstream monopsony or downstream monopoly markets.

Our criterion stipulates that a mechanism must be stable based solely on the probabilities that each student will be assigned to different schools, i.e., the assignment must be viewed as stable even before students know which school they will end up going to. This is in contrast to much of the existing literature, which has instead focused on ex post stability, meaning that assignments are deemed stable after students are assigned to schools. Armed with this criterion for evaluating mechanisms, we show that one of the mechanisms that has attracted the most attentiondeferred acceptance with random tie-breakingis not ex ante stable and under some circumstances can lead to ex ante discrimination among some students. We then propose two new mechanisms, which satisfy two notions of ex ante stability we introducea strong one and a weak oneand we show that these mechanisms are optimal within the class of mechanisms that satisfy these respective criteria.","[Kesten, Onur] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Uenver, M.

The prime motivation behind this study is the absence of an empirical study into this research issue exclusively on Indian economy. The empirical results obtained by estimating an Error Correction Model (ECM) using Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) show that energy price rise has negative effect on the investment of firms in the manufacturing sector. The negative effect is transmitted to the firm's investment through both demand-side and supply-side factors. The transmission also depends upon factors such as the energy intensity of production. The results also show that the sales-growth-investment relationship becomes weak in the face of the rising prices of the energy which could be due to the cautious approach to investment adopted by the firms. Therefore, it calls for the attention of the policy makers to evolve a comprehensive energy-policy to ensure continuous supply of energy at affordable prices to the manufacturers.

While persistence in the Nordic and Southern countries has declined over time, it has remained relatively steady in the rest of Europe. Our analysis highlights the importance of a detailed gender analysis in studying intergenerational persistence, finding that mothers' education is a stronger determinant of daughters' (instead of sons') education and fathers' education a stronger determinant of the education of their sons.

Unlike other published studies on the relationship between globalization and inflation, which mostly use Phillips curve models, this paper uses multivariate dynamic models to examine the dynamic interactions between globalization and inflation in China. Empirical results with quarterly data spanning from 1995 to 2012 show that the global output gap significantly affects the dynamics of inflation in China. In particular, the global output gap is superior to the domestic output gap in predicting domestic inflation. Impulse response and variance decomposition analyses reinforce this finding. Our results indicate that the central bank of China should take developments in global output into account in its monetary policy-making process.","[Zhang, Chengsi; Wang, Fang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chengsi; Song, Ke] Renmin Univ China, China Financial Policy Res Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Renmin University of China,"Wang, F (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Finance, Beijing, Peoples R China.",zhangcs@ruc.edu.cn; wangfruc@ruc.edu.cn,,,,,,,20,8,10,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2015,23.0,3,,,,,79,96,,10.1111/cwe.12115,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CI1IY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354498400005,0

The utility discount rate is assumed to be constant and to reflect either the uncertainty about the existence of future generations or a pure preference for the present. The authors question the unique status of discounted utilitarianism and discuss the implications of alternative criteria addressing the key issues of equity in risky situations and variable population. To do so, they introduce a class of intertemporal social objectives, named Expected Prioritarian Equally Distributed Equivalent (EPEDE) criteria. The class is more flexible than discounted utilitarianism in terms of population ethics and it disentangles risk aversion and inequality aversion. The authors show that these social objectives imply interesting modifications of the Ramsey formula, and shed new light on Weitzman's dismal theorem.","[Fleurbaey, Marc] Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fleurbaey, Marc] Ctr Human Values, New York, NY USA; [Zuber, Stephane] Paris Sch Econ CNRS, Paris, France",Princeton University; Paris School of Economics,"Fleurbaey, M (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Woodrow Wilson Sch, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",mfleurba@princeton.edu,"Fleurbaey, Marc/HHS-9231-2022; Zuber, Stephane/D-3424-2014","Zuber, Stephane/0000-0002-4111-2397",Chair on Welfare Economics and Social Justice at the Institute for Global Studies (FMSH - Paris); Franco-Swedish Program on Economics and Philosophy (FMSH - Risksbankens Jubileumsfond); ANR project EquiRisk [ANR-12-INEG-0006-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-INEG-0006] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Chair on Welfare Economics and Social Justice at the Institute for Global Studies (FMSH - Paris); Franco-Swedish Program on Economics and Philosophy (FMSH - Risksbankens Jubileumsfond); ANR project EquiRisk(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This research has been supported by the Chair on Welfare Economics and Social Justice at the Institute for Global Studies (FMSH - Paris), the Franco-Swedish Program on Economics and Philosophy (FMSH - Risksbankens Jubileumsfond), and the ANR project EquiRisk, Grant # ANR-12-INEG-0006-01.

In this paper we identify GHG emissions for which metropolitan areas assume responsibility by allocating emissions embodied in import and export products to regions of either consumption or production in the cases of three US metropolitan areas. The case studies show that embodied emissions in both export and import products accounted for 63-73% of total GHG emissions directly and indirectly pertaining to these metropolitan economies. These findings suggest that an accounting method that incorporates emissions embodied in product trade has relevance to the development of local policies that govern actions ranging from redirecting metropolitan development patterns toward low carbon emissions to promoting sustainable consumption behavior, particularly those involving the collaboration of cities.","Incheon Dev Inst, Inchon, South Korea",,"Choi, T (通讯作者)，Incheon Dev Inst, Inchon, South Korea.",tchoi3@gmail.com,,,,,,,43,14,18,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Education has been particularly effective in reducing inequality in Africa. Some of the results suggest that secondary schooling appears to have a stronger effect than primary schooling, though this finding is not always robust. The heterogeneity in reported estimates can be largely explained by differences in the specification of the econometric model and measure of inequality and education.","[Doucouliagos, Hristos; Manning, Elizabeth] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Deakin University,,,"Abdullah, Abdul Jabbar/CAF-5963-2022","Doucouliagos, Hristos/0000-0001-5269-3556","Centre for Economic and Policy Analysis, Deakin University","Centre for Economic and Policy Analysis, Deakin University","An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 2011 MAER-NET Colloquium, University of Cambridge, September 16-18, 2011.

A search externality creates congestion, which causes aggregate output to be inefficient. Because of the informational frictions that give rise to money, households are unable to insure themselves perfectly against aggregate shocks. This gives rise to a welfare-improving role for monetary policy that works by adjusting the nominal interest rate in response to these shocks. Optimal policy is determined by choosing a set of state-contingent nominal interest rates to maximize the expected lifetime utility of the agents subject to the constraints of being an equilibrium.","[Berentsen, Aleksander] Univ Basel, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Berentsen, Aleksander; Waller, Christopher] Fed Reserve Bank, St Louis, MO USA; [Waller, Christopher] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Basel; Federal Reserve System - USA; University of Notre Dame,"Berentsen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basel, Dept Econ, Peter Merian Weg 6, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",aleksander.berentsen@unibas.ch,"Waller, Christopher/I-5755-2016","Waller, Christopher/0000-0003-2406-9910",Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; CES in Munich; Kellogg Institute at the University of Notre Dame; Bank for International Settlements,Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland; Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; CES in Munich; Kellogg Institute at the University of Notre Dame; Bank for International Settlements,"The views expressed are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily reflect official positions of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Federal Reserve System, or the Board of Governors.

We formulate a neoclassical growth model in which agents devote time to either produce or predate. When the elasticity of substitution between labour and capital is lower than one, the labour share rises with capital, reducing the incentive to predate and increasing the incentive to produce throughout the transition. Consequently, a feedback process between capital accumulation and predation arises, which amplifies income differences generated by differences in productivity.

The cyclical movements of output generate, through Okun's law, employment variations in the heterogeneous labor market. The core of the resulting Keynesian macrodynamics is however given by credit-financed investment behavior and loan-rate setting by credit suppliers. The framework is constructed in such way that simplified, lower dimensional versions of the model can be obtained by setting parameters describing specific feedback effects from one sector to another equal to zero. Starting from such low dimensional sub-dynamics, we show the local stability of the full 7D model through a cascade of stable matrices approach if the feedback chains are sufficiently tranquil in their transmission mechanisms.

However, after the move by the FED in 1994, commercial banks responded immediately by changing their prime lending rate to the Federal Funds Rate plus a three-percent spread.

However, the rapid expansion of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton varieties and less regulated seed industry also resulted in a large amount of Bt cotton varieties that bypassed China's biosafety regulations. This study shows that the Bt cotton varieties without biosafety certificates (BC) have been widely used by farmers in practice.

Firms choose price and quantity simultaneously, leaving open the possibility for non-market-clearing outcomes. The strategy of the most successful firm is imitated. Behaviour in the stochastically stable outcome depends on the level of market differentiation and corresponds exactly with the Nash equilibrium outcome of the underlying stage game. For high level of differentiation, firms end up at the monopoly outcome. For intermediate level of differentiation, they gravitate to a mutually non-aggressive outcome where price is higher than the monopoly price. For low level of differentiation, firms price at a mark-up above the marginal cost. Market-clearing always results endogenously. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While they are separate from the stock of scientific ideas that are essential to production, history shows that social values and scientific ideas are interdependent. This paper explores the relationship between social values and long-run growth in an endogenous growth framework and highlights the underlying mechanism. We view both scientific ideas and social values as some sort of social capital that accumulates through a society's aggregate experience and also as goods that generate utility flows with rational addiction or habit formation at the social level when combined with individuals' time investment (learning-by-doing). We demonstrate the mechanism through which social values affect long-run economic growth. In particular, (i) we derive the conditions under which either the economy grows with social values as in the usual modern economies or it is dominated by social values with economic distress; and (ii) finally we show the applicability of the model to some episodes.

First, we better capture potential playing time by accounting for time lost to injuries or suspension.

The difference can largely be explained by the fact that a majority of donors do not adjust their nominal donations in response to a change in subsidy.

Empirical analysis using a VAR model indicates that a rise in these holdings of the real debt-to-GDP ratio increases both the three-month and ten-year U.S. nominal yields in a statistically significant manner. The maturity composition of debt is also found to matter: innovations in holdings of long-term debt affect the term structure, while increases in short-term debt affect inflation expectations. These effects of changes in holdings of debt on the yield curve can be derived in a general equilibrium model in which the government issues exponentially-maturing riskless debt, financed by lump-sum taxes, and the optimizing agents are adaptive learners. On calibrating the average maturity of debt in the model to match that of U.S. Treasury debt since the 1980s, I find that positive innovations in government debt lead to increases in asset yields. This is because agents do not learn the principle of Ricardian equivalence exactly, and perceive increases in holdings of government bonds as a rise in their net wealth. Imposing rational expectations on the agents eliminates this channel, and changes in holdings of government debt have no effect on yields. The learning model also implies that as the real debt-to-GDP ratio increases, and the average maturity of debt becomes longer, the agents become less likely to learn that Ricardian equivalence holds.

We use more than 10 years of data on the performance of female jockeys in U.K. and Irish horse racing - a sport where, uniquely, men and women compete side-by-side - to evaluate the presence of such discrimination. The odds produced by the betting market provide a window onto society's beliefs about the abilities of women in a male-dominated occupation. We find that women are slightly underestimated, winning 03% more races than the market predicts. Female jockeys are underestimated to a greater extent in jump racing, where their participation is low. We discuss possible reasons for this association. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find that spillovers occur when others observe punishment outside their own social dilemma.

This framework measures well-being by considering 11 dimensions covering both current material conditions and quality of life, while also recognizing the importance of taking account the sustainability of well-being in the future. This framework has been populated with indicators for each dimension, whose selection has relied on international standards on measurement and was made in consultation with experts and National Statistical Offices of OECD countries. The paper also discusses the pros and cons of various approaches for presenting and disseminating information on multidimensional well-being to different audiencesincluding the OECDBetter Life Index, an interactive web tool.

The BO decomposition depends on the chosen counterfactual reference parameter representing no discrimination. One popular way to choose the reference parameter is simply using the pooled sample, and another way is allowing different intercepts in the pooled sample. This paper points out two problems in the latter. First, the reference slopes are a matrix-weighted average of the two group slopes where the weights depend only on the variances of the two groups, not on the levels; the levels may represent the competing forces to primarily influence the reference parameter, but the role of the variances should be secondary at best. Second, the reference intercept is arbitrary: the same BO decomposition holds with vastly different reference intercepts.","Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Lee, MJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",myoungjae@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Myoung-jae/0000-0002-3935-7491",,,,,22,6,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Based on a total sample of 120 Islamic and conventional bank subsidiaries, we test whether foreign bank lending for Islamic and conventional banks is determined by different factors. We estimate a model that includes subsidiary and parent bank characteristics as well as host and home country variables. Our empirical findings show that lending is negatively affected by the fragility of conventional parent banks' subsidiaries. Nevertheless, we show that parent Islamic banks do not significantly affect lending by subsidiaries. Finally, we examine the market discipline regarding the transmission of liquidity shocks. We also find that reduction in foreign Islamic bank lending is stronger for those that are dependent on the interbank market. We establish that the depositors react to a deterioration of bank performance and punish their institutions by withdrawing their money. We show that market discipline has a more important role for Islamic banks, whereas liquidity needs determine the change in conventional banks.","[Mili, Mehdi] Univ Bahrain, Coll Business Adm, Zallaq, Bahrain; [Sahut, Jean-Michel] IPAG, Sch Business, Paris, France; [Trimeche, Eryj] IHEC Sousse, Sousse Medina, Tunisia",University of Bahrain; Universite de Sousse,"Mili, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bahrain, Coll Business Adm, Zallaq, Bahrain.",,"SAHUT, Jean-Michel/HNT-0171-2023","Mili, Mehdi/0000-0003-1957-2503",College of Business Administration at the University of Bahrain,College of Business Administration at the University of Bahrain,Mehdi Mili is an associate professor of finance in the College of Business Administration at the University of Bahrain.

In this paper, we therefore study the long- and short-term relationship between regional public debt intensities and economic output (growth) for German federal states between 1970 and 2010. We estimate dynamic error correction models, which account for heterogeneous transmission mechanisms among federal states and the presence of unobserved common factors such as global macroeconomic shocks. Our findings hint at a significantly negative relationship between regional public debt and per capita GDP in the long run. We further demonstrate that this negative long-term effect is not negligible for the interregional differences in per capita GDP levels. Linking our empirical findings to the current policy debate on fiscal consolidation, we show along the lines of the German case that the decision of enacting a constitutional debt brake for subnational governments to limit the degree of discretionary spending policies together with supplementary measures - such as joint capital market operations by the central and state-level governments to lower borrowing costs - may provide new stimuli for a European-wide debate on the feasibility of solid fiscal consolidation.

Moreover, they weigh more heavily recent events compared to events occurring in the distant past. This paper analyzes the implications of such learning for stock pricing in a model with finitely lived agents. Individuals learn about the rate of change of the stock price and of dividends using a weighted decreasing-gain algorithm. As a result of waves of optimism and pessimism, the stock price exhibits stochastic fluctuations around the rational expectations equilibrium. Conditional on the historical path of dividends, the model produces a price-dividend ratio which is in line with the evidence for the last century, except for the dot-com bubble in the 1990s.

We find that cash flow patterns capture more information on business life cycle stages than firm age and have a stronger impact on capital structure decision-making. We also find that the adjustment speed of capital structure varies significantly across life cycle stages and that non-sequential transitions over life cycle stages play an important role in the determination of capital structure.

We analyze the relationship between a lifetime of marital status changes and wealth levels near retirement age. We consider type of change whether from divorce, widowing, remarriage, number and timing of changes, and duration in marriage. We document that lifetime marriage experiences of individuals nearing retirement are very diverse: only about one-half of all individuals experience one continuous marriage throughout their lives. We model the impact of marriage on wealth independent of lifetime earnings, mortality risk, risk aversion and other important confounding factors. Consideration of financial, housing, and public and private pension wealth reveal that unadjusted wealth differences between married, remarried and not married individuals are large; as duration of marriage increases, so does wealth; and lifetime earnings as well as future claims on public and private pensions explain most of the wealth differences by marital status for men but less so for women.","[Zissimopoulos, Julie M.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Karney, Benjamin R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [Rauer, Amy J.] Auburn Univ, Auburn, AL 36849 USA",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Auburn University System; Auburn University,"Zissimopoulos, JM (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, 3335 S Figueroa St Unit A, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",Julie.Zissimopoulos@usc.edu,"Karney, Benjamin/AAG-1632-2019","Karney, Benjamin/0000-0002-9063-6162",,,,,45,32,32,1,44,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

Two groups compete for the right to allocate society's resources. We allow for costly intergroup mobility. The winning group offers an allocation, which the opposition can accept or reject, and wage conflict. Agents can also switch group membership. Expropriating a large share of resources increases political strength by attracting opposition members, but implies a higher threat of conflict. Our main finding is that the possibility of intergroup mobility affects the likelihood of conflict in a nonmonotonic way.

Importantly, it is the stakes of the dictator in the economy, in the form of capital ownership, that drive the support of individuals. In highly unequal societies ruled by a capital-rich dictator endowed with the power to tax and appropriate at will, the elites will support dictatorial policies given that they can generate higher growth rates than the ones obtained under democracy. This support arises unconditionally to special benefits to the elites and despite the total absence of checks and balances on the dictator. (C) 2013 Association for Comparative Economic Studies.

We examine the influences on contestant behavior of the observability and timing of preceding bids, allocation rules for the situation when no bids occur (random prize allocation vs. prize loss) and matching protocol for repeated contests involving pairs of bidders. Our results show that the simultaneous presence of three factors (simultaneous bids, random prize allocation if no bids occur and fixed matching) allows contestants to coordinate to realize efficient outcomes (underbidding). However, the absence of one of these factors causes overbidding to return. From the perspective of theoretical prediction, the decision to allocate the prize even when no bids occur (no fight, no loss) should be irrelevant. However, this allocation decision may strongly influence behaviour (by encouraging submission of efficient and minimal bids) if combined with features that encourage collusion (fixed matching and symmetry).","[Godoy, Sara] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Melendez-Jimenez, Miguel A.; Morales, Antonio J.] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Malaga 29013, Spain",University of Essex; Universidad de Malaga,"Morales, A (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Malaga 29013, Spain.",amorales@uma.es,"Morales, Antonio J/A-4426-2013","Morales, Antonio J/0000-0002-2843-8245; Melendez Jimenez, Miguel Angel/0000-0001-5350-3726",,,,,32,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

We consider inflation expectations based on the Bureau of Economic Research (BER) quarterly survey observed from 2000Q1 to 2013Q1. We estimate inflation expectations of individual agents as the weighted average of lagged inflation and the inflation target. The results indicate that expectations are heterogeneous across agents. Expectations of price setters (business and unions) are closely related to each other and are higher than the upper bound of the official target band, while expectations of analysts are within the target band. In addition, expectations of price setters are somewhat related to lagged inflation and the opposite is true for analysts. The results reveal that the SARB has successfully anchored expectations of analysts but that price setters have not sufficiently used the focal point implicit in the inflation targeting regime. The implication is that the SARB may be pushed to accommodate private agents' expectations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the univariate portion of the paper, the performances of various Markov-switching models are tested against a single-state benchmark model through the use of in-sample goodness-of-fit and predictive ability measures. In the multivariate context, the single-state and Markov-switching models are comparatively assessed according to their usefulness in constructing optimal stock portfolios. Accounting for structural breaks in the conditional variance process, conventional GARCH effects remain important in capturing heteroscedasticity. However, those univariate models including a GARCH term perform comparatively poorly when used for forecasting purposes. In the multivariate study, the use of Markov-switching variance-covariance estimates improves risk-adjusted portfolio returns relative to portfolios constructed using the more conventional single-state models. While there is evidence that some Markov-switching models can provide better forecasts and higher risk-adjusted returns than those models which include GARCH effects, the inability of the simpler Markov-switching models to fully capture heteroscedasticity in the data remains problematic.

We build a simple model to identify the causes and consequences of such problems. In the model, firms bid toll charges for a fixed-term highway concession, with the lowest bid winning the auction. The winner builds and operates the highway for the fixed concession period. Each bidder has a privately known construction cost and there is common uncertainty regarding the level of demand that will result for the completed highway. Because it is costly for the government to reassign the concession, it is exposed to a holdup problem, which bidders can exploit through the strategic use of debt. Each firm chooses its financial structure to provide optimal insurance against downside demand risk: the credible threat of default is used to extort an additional transfer payment from the government. We derive the optimal financial structure and equilibrium bidding behavior and show that (i) the auction remains efficient, but (ii) bids are lower than they would be if all bidders were cash-financed, and (iii) the more efficient the winning firm, the more likely it is to require a government bailout and the higher the expected transfer it extracts from the government. We discuss potential resolutions of this problem, including the use of least-present-value-of-revenue auctions.","[Menezes, Flavio] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia; [Ryan, Matthew] Auckland Univ Technol, Dept Econ, Auckland 1142, New Zealand",University of Queensland; Auckland University of Technology,"Menezes, F (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au; matthew.ryan@aut.ac.nz,"Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551",,,,,25,13,14,1,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

I find that the content of PTAs also matters: when visa-and-asylum and labour market related provisions are included in PTAs, this further stimulates bilateral migration flows.

Because the information provided in company financial statements has significant economic and social consequences for various parties, external auditors are needed to minimize litigation. Therefore, it is important for audit firms' risk management teams to evaluate which clients to accept. In this paper, we propose a client acceptance method (CAM) that uses a technique for order preference using similarity to the ideal solution (i.e. TOPSIS) approach to evaluate potential new clients using a decision-making method with interval-valued fuzzy numbers (IVFNs). Through a case study, this paper shows that this CAM results in a high Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient (0.9 to 1.0) with human judgment. This result indicates that CAM could help decision makers evaluate potential clients before acceptance, especially when there are several potential clients but limited resources to provide services. The CAM also could help audit firms more easily ensure that decision makers are complying with firm policies concerning client acceptance through the establishment of uncertainty factor weights.","[Lai, Hung-Lin] Chihlee Inst Technol, Dept Accounting Informat, New Taipei City 22050, Taiwan; [Chen, Ting-Yu] Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, Grad Inst Business & Management, Coll Management, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan",Chang Gung University,"Chen, TY (通讯作者)，Chang Gung Univ, Dept Ind & Business Management, Grad Inst Business & Management, Coll Management, 259 Wen Hwa 1st Rd, Taoyuan 333, Taiwan.",tychen@mail.cgu.edu.tw,", Ting-Yu/AAC-7043-2019",", Ting-Yu/0000-0002-2171-4139",,,,,43,12,12,1,25,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

It attempts to answer the question of how changes in the labor market after the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis affected industrialization and labor market performance. The paper generates three main findings. First, the responsiveness of output to employment and wages to employment declined substantially over the period 1996-2006 but recovered in 2009. The decline could be a consequence of the implementation of rigid labor laws since 2003. The recovery in 2009 may reflect firms' adjustment period to the new environment or simply that firms found different opportunities. Second, exporters generally show higher employment elasticity than non-exporters. However, since the implementation of the labor law, exporters tend to retain employment more than non-exporters when wages rise. Third, exporters began substituting labor with machinery as wages started rising.","[Narjoko, Dionisius; Putra, Chandra Tri] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia",Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Narjoko, D (通讯作者)，Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",dion.narjoko@eria.org,"Putra, Chandra/ABC-9262-2020; Putra, Chandra/JKI-3465-2023","Putra, Chandra/0000-0002-2670-5610",,,,,22,4,4,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Third, we test whether the abnormal returns in the process have significant effects on the index returns and volatilities. Results reveals that calendar anomalies still exist and the volatility pattern across days of the week and months of the year are statistically different.

At the same time, the international conditions have been favorable, so it is hard to assess to what extent the success in stabilizing inflation should be attributed to good luck and to what extent to the specific policy framework. In this paper, we provide a novel look at the dynamics of inflation under inflation targeting, focusing on three Central European (CE) countries that adopted the IT regime at similar times and in similar environments. We use the framework of the open economy New Keynesian Phillips curve (NKPC) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to recover changes in price-setting and expectation formation behavior and volatility of shocks. We employ Bayesian model averaging to tackle the uncertainty in the selection of instrumental variables and to account for the possible country-specific nature of inflation dynamics. The results suggest that inflation targeting does not itself automatically trigger changes in the inflation process, and the way the framework is implemented might matter. In particular, we find rather heterogeneous evolution of intrinsic inflation persistence and volatility of inflation shocks across these countries despite the fact that all three formally introduced inflation targeting a decade ago.

The article provides empirical insights about CSFs in individual stages of BPM adoption. We find that the guidance of external consultants was very important, although this factor is not commonly recognised in the literature. The article shows that the identification of well-known CSFs of BPM adoption gives only a limited view since the factors change between stages.

Up to 77.19% of average annual labour input growth is from quality improvement. Further decomposition reveals that the most important source of growth is educational attainment, followed by age structure. Moreover, we find that Taiwan's average annual GDP growth rate does not result from capital investment but from the contribution of a stable labour input to economic growth. Taiwan is a newly industrialized country, but because of the diminishing returns to capital, the catch-up effect has been slower than hoped. Additional capital investment has a relatively small effect on productivity, and the main source of the continuous economic growth rate is from labour quality, especially from highly skilled human capital.

For the purposes of empirical testing, a longitudinal analysis was employed for 24 differently developed countries to estimate the relationship between different types of entrepreneurial activity and GDP growth rate, controlling for the impact of countries' developmental stage and time. The data were obtained from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database and complemented with data from other international sources. The results confirmed that entrepreneurship activity, especially innovation-oriented one, is correlated with economic growth, but this relationship is influenced by the economy's developmental stage as well as by specific characteristics of certain years included in the analysis.

The EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS, 1993) is a management instrument to improve environmental performance of organisations. The EU Ecolabel (1992) is a part of the EU sustainable consumption and production policy, which is also one of ten themes in the EU Sustainable Development Strategy. Usage of these voluntary schemes can affect the Resource productivity, which is a headline indicator in this theme, and ultimately lead to sustainable development. However, the positive effects in the EU countries take place with time lags after their introduction. The longer lags are typical of the EMAS. The aim of this Paper is to assess the usage of the voluntary instruments in the EU countries and to evaluate their contribution to sustainable development on the basis of examining their relations to resource productivity.","VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Drastichová, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",magdalena.drastichova@vsb.cz,"Drastichová, Magdaléna/ABE-6264-2020","Drastichova, Magdalena/0000-0003-0441-9725",,,,,25,1,1,0,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The issuers of securities, namely banks that achieve good business results, may be in a dilemma whether to buy back their shares so as to slow down the share price decrease and manage capital. In this paper, the cointegration tests, Granger causality test and equilibrium error correction model were applied to examine: 1) interdependencies of stock exchange indexes in SEE countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Montenegro, Republic of Srpska, Macedonia - FYROM and Bulgaria); 2) interdependencies of most actively traded shares in Serbia and the representative index. The main conclusion is that it is not possible to successfully use the share buyback to stop or reduce the share price fall on a shallow capital market of SEE countries. This is opposite to what successful banks can do on deep capital markets. In interpreting quantitative results it is necessary to be cautious because of a small number of banks from SEE which were able to use share repurchase.","[Dukic, Dorde] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia; [Dukic, Malisa] Belgrade Banking Acad, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Dukic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",djukicmalisa@hotmail.com,"Djukic, Djordje/ABA-2293-2020","Djukic, Djordje/0000-0001-5969-3882","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia [179065, 47009, 179015]","Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","This paper is a part of research project No. 179065, 47009 and 179015 supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Serbia.

Causality, running from per capita product to income inequality, and a negative and significant overall effect are estimated. However, after the regime shifts - mainly estimated to occur in the 1980s - the connection is no longer meaningful.

Interestingly, the results show that none of the forecasting techniques are able to outperform the RW at horizons of 1 and 9 steps ahead, and on average, the exponential smoothing model is seen providing the best forecasts in terms of the lowest root mean squared error over the 24-month forecasting horizons.

We test the model in a laboratory experiment paying particular attention to how behavioral motivations other than payoff-maximization affect the strength of the model's result. We find that the result is no longer statistically significant when we allow for non-payoff-maximizing behavior at each stage of the game. Introducing communication has an interesting effect as it influences different forms of non-payoff-maximizing behavior asymmetrically and leads to the model's result again becoming significant. All in all, we find strong experimental support for Konrad and Thum's model even though we observe considerable amounts of non-payoff-maximizing behavior that is not accounted for in the original model.

On both markets, using a classical framework, cointegration appears superior and effective. On the U.S. market and also in Japan to a lower extent, pairs trading strategies exhibited an impressive performance during the 2008 financial crisis. Bearish periods are associated with a high level of the VIX index: the 'investor fear gauge'. Using a modified trading system, this article examines the link between pairs trading performance and volatility/VIX timing.

Our methodology consists of the recently developed test of Phillips, Shi and Yu (2014) for mildly explosive processes, and the Phillips and Sul (2007) method for modelling convergence among random variables. We find evidence of explosive behaviour in index levels of seven of the 14 markets. In contrast, explosive dynamics are found in only one price/dividend ratio. More than half of the episodes of explosive behaviour are date-stamped to periods prior to the 2007-2009 financial crisis. We also discover a number of periods over which the markets converge towards a common trend. Interestingly, all of the convergence intervals coincide either with periods of crisis, or with periods of market exuberance. For instance, evidence of convergence is found during the 2000 dot-com crash, the 2007-2009 subprime crisis and the 2010-2013 European sovereign debt crisis, as well as over the bubble period of 2004-2005.","[Joyeux, Roselyne; Milunovich, George] Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Milunovich, G (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",george.milunovich@mq.edu.au,"Milunovich, George/GQP-9591-2022","Milunovich, George/0000-0003-0697-0684; Joyeux, Roselyne/0000-0002-3823-9135",Australian Research Council [DP120102239],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),Australian Research Council Discovery Grant DP120102239.,,41,11,14,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because construction firms' strategies are specific and they are unwilling to share them, it is difficult to determine these strategies clearly. In this regard, instead of determining their strategies, it was aimed to categorize them according to Miles and Snow's Strategy Typology. Toward this aim, 50 large-scale construction firms in Turkey were surveyed by a questionnaire. In this context, Miles and Snow's Typology was first investigated, and possible goals of each strategic group were determined. Then, a SWOT analysis was applied to firms to determine their current positions in the market, and their primary goals were asked. The results revealed that construction firms with the same goals show similar characteristics and thus can be categorized as defenders, prospectors, and analyzers, according to Miles and Snow's Typology.","[Kazaz, Aynur; Er, Bayram; Ozdemir, B.

Our results suggest that the German surplus reflects a succession of distinct shocks. Mono-causal explanations of the surplus are thus insufficient. The most important factors driving the German surplus were positive shocks to the German saving rate and to ROW demand for German exports, as well as German labour market reforms and other positive German aggregate supply shocks. The key shocks that drove the rise in the German CA tended to worsen the REA trade balance, but had a weak effect on REA real activity. Our analysis suggests these driving factors are likely to be slowly eroded, leading to a very gradual reduction of the German CA surplus. An expansion in German government consumption and investment would raise German GDP and reduce the CA surplus, but the effects on the surplus would be weak.","[Kollmann, Robert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; Univ Paris Est, CEPR, Paris, France; European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Brussels, Belgium; European Commiss, DG ECFIN, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; European Commission Joint Research Centre,"Kollmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",robert.kollmann@ulb.ac.be,,"Vogel, Lukas/0000-0002-8106-2750; Ratto, Marco/0000-0003-4390-0175",,,,,71,54,54,0,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

It also explores the volatility spillover dynamics between those markets and US Monetary policy, oil prices, global financial risk and uncertainty factors. The recently developed Hafner and Herwartz (2006)'s causality-in-variance test provides evidence of risk transfers between these seemingly different equity markets, indicating a contagion between them during the full sample and the subperiods. The volatility structure of these markets is dominated by short-run volatility in the first period and by high long-run volatility in the second period. The volatility impulse response analysis indicates a similar volatility transmission pattern although it is characterized by a more volatile and short-lived structure in the second period.

Despite internal and external pressures, there is no obvious evidence that Korea's allocation rule converges with international guidelines that recommend greater consideration of recipient needs and aid effectiveness and less consideration of donor interests.","[Park, Bokyeong] Kyung Hee Univ, Yongin 446701, South Korea; [Lee, Hongshik] Korea Univ, Seoul 136705, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Korea University,"Park, B (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, 1732 Daeyoung Daero, Yongin 446701, South Korea.",bokyeong23@khu.ac.kr; honglee@korea.ac.kr,"Park, Bokyeong/AAK-8927-2020","Park, Bokyeong/0000-0001-7745-1430",Kyung Hee University [KHU-20130680],Kyung Hee University,This study is supported by an academic grant from Kyung Hee University in 2013 (KHU-20130680).,,23,1,1,2,17,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Using the statistical data we provide comparison of the number of foreign workers and the unemployment rate in the Czech Republic and analyze the skill levels of jobs that the foreigners occupy. To test the possible effects of the presence of the foreign workers we use the theory of the search models and regression analysis and check for possible effects of foreign workers on the dynamics of wages and unemployment rate.

Our approach is consistent with the economically rational expectations theory (Feige and Pearce, 1976), which states that information costs and agents' aversion to misestimating future exchange rates determine the optimal amounts of information on which they base their expectations. The time variability of the cost/aversion ratios justifies at the aggregate level a representation of expectations as a linear combination of the traditional extrapolative, adaptive and regressive processes augmented by a forward market component, whose parameters are allowed to change over time. This mixed expectation model with unstable heterogeneity is validated by our Kalman filter estimation results for the two currencies and the two horizons considered. Although the relative importance of the fundamentalists' (chartists') is found to increase (decrease) with the time-horizon, chartist behaviour appears to dominate fundamentalist behaviour for both horizons. Central bank intervention is then effective in stabilizing the foreign exchange markets if it encourages fundamentalist activity.","[Prat, Georges] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Prat, Georges; Uctum, Remzi] CNRS, EconomiX, Nanterre, France; [Prat, Georges; Uctum, Remzi] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Nanterre, France",IPAG Business School; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Nanterre,"Uctum, R (通讯作者)，CNRS, EconomiX, Nanterre, France.",uctum@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,91,5,5,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Experts are the stars among knowledge workers, and they manage more knowledge than the average worker. The Enneagram is a complex dynamic system to evaluate human personality, human motives and the way how people think and behave. The exercise is not new; for centuries the Christian, Judaist and Islam churches used the Enneagram for the management and development of high church officials, who could definitely be classified as knowledge workers. The Enneagram works with nine personality types, three subtypes, and nine levels of personal development. It also recognises special interrelations between types based on an individual's particular life situation. All the mentioned factors together enable us to understand individual's behaviour, to predict it, influence it and also to help the individual's future development in accordance to his abilities and strong features. We used information from the Enneagram's organization, and on the various types of leaders selected by the Enneagram website, and analysed that information in the light of the known theories on KM. We concluded that each one of the nine type of the Enneagram personality is linked to a prominent facet of KM: 1) Values, Change and unlearning 2) Knowledge networks; 3) Knowledge leaders; 4) Thinking out the box;; 5) Creation of knowledge; 6) Trust.; 7) Risk; 8) Charisma; 9) Servant leaders respectively. The practical implication of the paper is that not all the experts manage knowledge equally, and that they have different priorities on KM according to their personality type. The paper is limited because it is basically a first attempt and should be completed by extensive and deep empirical studies.","[Tome, Eduardo; Mladkova, Ludmila] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Europeia,"Tome, E (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal.",eduardo.tome@clix.pt; mladkova@vse.cz,"tome, eduardo/F-2308-2011","tome, eduardo/0000-0001-6335-5501",,,,,28,0,1,0,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,324,333,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600038,0

Research approach - The current trend towards the digitisation of higher education and the virtual university, has raised questions about the contribution of human capital and the potential benefits that might arise from enhanced educational delivery. This is a qualitative case study in one of the largest Open University and investigates two research questions: 1) what are the elements of human capital in the University? 2) how does the human capital impact performance, in terms of providing 'value adding' to the University? This study utilises resource-based theory from the perspective of strategic management. The data is gathered through in-depth semi-structured interviews and NVivo software is employed to help analyse the data. Findings - This study is in progress and the tentative findings are: firstly, amongst the elements of human capital, the development of human capital in open university is primarily influenced by the organisational culture and leadership; secondly, the open and distance learning systems in which OU operates has resulted in a sustained and competitive advantage for OU and applied to human capital practice through integrative and coordinative mechanism towards the intended 'value add' aimed at by the university. Research limitation/practical implication - This is a single case study focusing on human capital as the most strategic asset of intellectual capital. Amongst three major themes of intellectual capital research, this is limited to the question of how human capital is mobilised in attempts to make organisations perform towards defined values. This study enhances the literature on tertiary education institutions, and contributes the relevance of human capital as it is applied in the context of higher education sector.","Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University,"Wardini, AK (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",a.kusumawardini@murdoch.edu.au,,,,,,,34,0,1,0,0,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,474,483,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600055,0

On the basis of two indicators of liquidity risk, we estimate the same group of determinants that co-create microeconomic factors (credit risk, effectiveness level, size of the bank, financial leverage level, engagement in the interbank market) and macroeconomic factors (weighted average for interest rates of the unsecured market of interbank O/N deposits, domestic credit provided by the banking sector to GDP, inflation, GDP). The determinants of liquidity risk specific for banks operating in the countries of the so-called Old European Union are slightly different from those for banks operating in the countries classified as the so-called New European Union. However, we can indicate a group of internal determinants that affect the level of liquidity risk, regardless of the form of liquidity risk measure adopted, and the country in which they operate (margin volume, credit risk level, and engagement in the interbank market). A significant difference in terms of the diagnosed flexibility is the effect of the weighted average interest rates of the unsecured market of interbank O/N deposits on the level of banks liquidity.

This article aims to explore whether a liquidity factor plays a role in explaining the second moment (i.e. the volatility) of housing prices. Housing price volatility is measured as the conditional variance of a Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model under the Adaptive Expectations framework. The empirical evidence reveals that volatility transmits from smaller housing units to larger housing units, which indirectly supports the trade-up effect discussed in the literature. In addition, less liquid housing classes are more sensitive to unexpected liquidity shocks, and the starter housing class is extraordinarily sensitive to negative liquidity shocks. Consistent with friction search theory, pricing errors are alleviated as the trading volume increases, because the valuation price tends to be more accurate as more information is available.","Jinan Univ, Dept Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Zheng, X (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Dept Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",bsxzheng@gmail.com,"Zheng, Xian/B-4625-2010; zheng, xian/HJJ-1413-2023","zheng, xian/0000-0001-6197-1220",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473105]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [12JNYH002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71473105], and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [grant number 12JNYH002].",,42,9,9,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results indicate that households in Germany receive family-and marriage-related transfers of considerable monetary value, yet there is also substantial variation behind the population average. Moreover, it is shown that some measures, such as income tax splitting, may make individuals in fact worse off, in financial terms, over the long course, as a result of negative labour supply incentives which are reinforced through detrimental effects on human capital accumulation (JEL codes: C53, C54, J12, J13, J22).","[Bonin, Holger] Univ Kassel, ZEW Mannheim, Kassel, Germany; [Bonin, Holger] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Reuss, Karsten] VDI Technol Zentrum, Dusseldorf, Germany; [Stichnoth, Holger] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Universitat Kassel; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bonin, H (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, ZEW Mannheim, Kassel, Germany.;Bonin, H (通讯作者)，Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany.",bonin@iza.org; kreuss@arcor.de; stichnoth@zew.de,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

We investigate three distinct aspects of stock market trading activities, namely stock market liquidity, returns and volatility as predictors of U.S. recessions. We also conduct a horserace comparison in the recession forecasting power between various stock market liquidity measures. We show that i) lower stock market liquidity signals recessions; ii) stock market liquidity (returns) forecasts recessions up to three quarters (two quarters) into the future, while stock market volatility has no forecasting power; iii) stock market liquidity as computed by stock transaction costs and by stock price changes to trading volume forecast recessions better than other measures in the literature; iv) stock market liquidity-based models outperform the survey of professional forecasters' estimates of recession probabilities, and hence the results suggest that professional forecasters may need to incorporate stock market liquidity in their forecasts.

We provide evidence on the repayment motive using data from the Mexican conditional cash transfer program PROGRESA/Oportunidades (PO). PO pays a transfer to parents for sending their children to school. Thus, if private transfers from adult children to parents are in part repayment for parental schooling investments made in the past, then PO should decrease these transfers-parents were already exogenously compensated by the government for sending their kids to school and not to work. Exploiting the exogenous variation in the amount of cash transfers a household receives from PO for sending its children to school, we compare the private transfers received in 2007 by parental households who had children 0-16 in 1997 and started receiving the programs' benefits in 1998 with the transfers received by similar parental households who started receiving benefits in 1999. Results suggest a repayment motive exists.

We study the effect of these institutional features on the sector's efficiency using a long panel data of firms, with a two-stage estimation procedure. First, we use nonparametric data envelopment analysis techniques to estimate input usage efficiency, following a conditional approach that controls for differences in the environments in which the firms operate. Second, we estimate semiparametric censored regressions, using fixed effects to control for unobserved sources of heterogeneity. Our results point to a differential effect of private and mixed public-private companies. In particular, having the performance of public operators as the benchmark, efficiency is relatively higher for private firms, but lower when the service is delegated to a mixed public-private firm. In the latter case, the effects diverge by contract type: when the contract is of the cost reimbursement type, performance is lower than the public firm benchmark, while for other contract types, there are no statistically significant differences.","[Diaz, Guillermo; Charles, Vincent] PUCP, Ctr Catolica Grad Business Sch, Calle Daniel Alomia Robles 125, Lima, Peru",Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru,"Díaz, G (通讯作者)，PUCP, Ctr Catolica Grad Business Sch, Calle Daniel Alomia Robles 125, Lima, Peru.",jgdiazg@pucp.pe; vcharles@pucp.pe,"Charles, V./AAS-7987-2020; Charles, Vincent/HZK-5038-2023","Charles, V./0000-0001-8943-5681; Diaz, Guillermo/0000-0002-4675-6677",,,,,31,4,4,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Policy simulations reveal that the welfare gains are increasing in the degree of habit formation and economically significant for a range of values consistent with U.S. data. I trace these results to the supply-side effects that deep habits impart on the economy and show that they ultimately weaken the stabilization trade-offs facing a discretionary planner. Most of the inefficiencies from discretion, it turns out, can be avoided by installing commitment regimes that last just two years or less. Extending the commitment horizon further delivers marginal welfare gains that are trivial by comparison. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We formulate the research agenda in terms of the Euro Dominance Hypothesis. The situation of the non-euro EU countries with derogation in terms of joining the EMU; like the Czech Republic, is similar to the pre-euro situation of the euro area countries, in which the problem of the stability of the European Mechanism System was predominant. We investigate the co-movement of interest rates between the Czech Republic and the Eurozone to assess the potential costs of monetary integration. Using cointegration and VECM methods we show that the ECB monetary policy influences monetary policy in the Czech Republic and the actual level of monetary independence in the Czech Republic is much lower than it is presumed. Therefore, we argue that for the Czech Republic the cost of the joining the EMU will be lower than expected.","[Goczek, Lukasz; Mycielska, Dagmara] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Goczek, L (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",lgoczek@wne.uw.edu.pl; dmycielska@wne.uw.edu.pl,"Goczek, Lukasz/Q-2725-2019; Mycielska, Dagmara/A-8840-2014","Goczek, Lukasz/0000-0001-5391-9131; Mycielska, Dagmara/0000-0002-5175-1096",National Science Center [2013/09/D/HS4/01051],"National Science Center(National Science Centre, Poland)",The article was prepared as a part of the Project Measuring Monetary Independence in the Context of Joining Eurozone: Evidence from the Countries with Derogation funded by the National Science Center granted by the Decision No. 2013/09/D/HS4/01051.,,28,2,2,2,10,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

However, the optimal way to implement such policies in the Euro area is a question open to debate, given that countries have to coordinate. In this paper, we propose a two-country, two-sector monetary union dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model (DSGE) with housing to analyze the optimal implementation of macroprudential policies in the Euro area. Currently, Spain is the only country within the EU that has not established a macroprudential regulator. We use Spain as a natural experiment to study the effects of a lack of coordination in the use of macroprudential policies in the European Monetary Union (EMU). We focus on a particular macroprudential policy, a rule regarding the loan-to-value ratio, which responds countercyclically to credit booms. We find that such a policy is welfare enhancing for the Euro area. Nevertheless, if one country does not implement the policy, but the rest of the EMU does, as in the current situation with Spain, this country still yields some benefits as a result of its partners' implementation of the policy because it gains from a more stable financial system without incurring any output costs. However, if all Euro countries actively implement the policy, the welfare gains for all of them are larger. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper explores political budget cycles in China's provinces. Using data from Chinese provinces from 1980 to 2006, the analysis finds that the effects of a provincial leader's tenure on political budget cycles are minimal, implying a weak causal relationship between spending composition and a politician's time in office at the provincial level. However, there exists a national coordinated cycle associated with the timing of the National Congress of the Communist Party (NCCP). Two years prior to the NCCP, politicians are likely to shift public spending toward capital expenditures, such as innovation funds and capital construction, and away from current expenditures, such as agricultural subsidies. The opposite pattern occurs during the year of the NCCP, when politicians increase current expenditures, such as social expenditures and government administration, and decrease capital expenditures. The increased capital expenditures 2 years prior to the NCCP are accompanied by an increase in taxation and total aggregate spending. The empirical results indicate that provincial budget cycles are mainly driven by national policies rather than by provincial leaders' personal career incentives. Chinese leaders' fiscal behaviors are constrained by the dynamics of the national leadership transition, resulting in similar distortions to those found in the democratic countries.","[Tsai, Pi-Han] Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Tsai, PH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Coll Econ, 38 Zheda Rd, Hangzhou 310027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",pihant@zju.edu.cn,,"Tsai, Pi-Han/0000-0001-5292-0659",Real Estate Investment Research Center of Zhejiang University of China,Real Estate Investment Research Center of Zhejiang University of China,"I would like to thank Dan Bogart, Jan Brueckner, Michelle Garfinkel, Michael McBride, Stergios Skaperdas, Su Yang, Guoxiong Zhang, the editor, two anonymous referees, and the participants of numerous seminars for helpful comments.

Due to persistent long memory and the presence of the asymmetric effect in all asset markets we applied DCC-FIAPARCH model. The estimated negative DCC parameters in all scrutinized countries confirmed that portfolio balanced theory has predominance in the short run in all selected economies. DCC parameters revealed significant time-varying behaviour, especially during the major crisis periods. By embedding dummy variables in the variance equations, we came to the conclusion that global shocks affect the volatility of DCCs. Particularly, it happened during the Global Financial Crisis and European sovereign debt crisis, but the effects were not linearly equal in all countries. Complementary rolling analysis unveils how conditional volatilities of analysed assets influence DCC. The results suggested that exchange rate conditional volatility has higher influence on DCC than stock conditional volatility.","[Zivkov, Dejan; Njegic, Jovan] Univ Novi Sad, Business Sch Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Mirovic, Vera] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Novi Sad,"Zivkov, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Business Sch Novi Sad, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia.",dejanzivkov@gmail.com; jovan.nj@gmail.com; veramirovicns@gmail.com,"Njegic, Jovan/K-9087-2019",,,,,,37,11,12,0,12,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

We develop necessary and sufficient conditions for stochastic choice data to be consistent with satisficing, assuming that preferences are fixed, but search order may change randomly. The model predicts that stochastic choice can only occur amongst elements that are always chosen, while all other choices must be consistent with standard utility maximization. Adding the assumption that the probability distribution over search orders is the same for all choice sets makes the satisficing model a subset of the class of random utility models.

For this purpose six markets KSE100 (Karachi, Pakistan), BSE Sensex (Mumbai, India), NIKKEI 225 (Tokyo, Japan), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) (Shanghai, China) and KOSPI (Seoul, South Korea) were considered. Stock market indices comprise of daily data from the period January 2002 to December 2009. The graphical representation of time series shows the preliminary examination of stock behaviors. The analysis shows the high correlation and heteroskedastic trend (volatility) among the stock markets in selected time period. After preliminary analysis the formal descriptive method of mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation have been applied for measuring and ranking purposes. The results show that KOSPI has the highest average annual return of 12.67% and followed by BSE with 11.61%, whereas, KSE 100 has the least annual average returns of 9.31%. The highest volatility coefficient of 3.097 has been observed in Hang Seng (Hong Kong) followed by 2.87 in Nikkei (Tokyo). However, the KSE 100 observed the lowest volatility coefficient of 2.078. Bartlett's test is applied for the inferential analysis to investigate whether the equality of volatility is the same in each market return. Finally, GARCH (1,1) model is applied which concludes a significant ARCH (1) and GARCH (1) effects and confirms all markets' returns are statistically significant since p < 0.01 and their Long Run Average Variances (LRAV) range from 1.52% to 2.54% for KSE100 Index and Shanghai Stock Exchange respectively.","[Ahmad, Nawaz] Iqra Univ, Dept Business Adm, Def View, Shaheed E Millat Rd, Karachi 75500, Pakistan; [Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem] Ind Univ, Dept Business Adm, Block 17, Karachi 75500, Pakistan; [Vveinhardt, Jolita; Streimikiene, Dalia] Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",Iqra University; Lithuanian Sports University,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Sports Univ, Inst Sport Sci & Innovat, Sporto G 6, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia@mail.lei.lt,"Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/B-9632-2016; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/J-5017-2019; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020","Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Ahmed, Rizwan Raheem/0000-0001-5844-5502; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/0000-0002-6029-7868; Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912",,,,,67,11,11,0,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

The low interest rates and a lack of proper oversight, combined with a perception that housing prices will always move north, brought the sub-prime crisis in the USA and the subsequent Global Financial Crisis' and European crisis. The Quantitative Easing policy in advanced economies (AE) created an even more permissive global liquidity. The externality affecting emerging markets (EM) took the form of massive capital inflows, first channelled through banks where the global banks-mostly headquartered in Europe-played a significant role and then through capital market with fund managers being the protagonist. The augmented liquidity spurred growth in EM but also elevated the risk of financial instability. Capital flows reversal, slower growth and less benign external conditions have put EM in a quandary. The uncertainty is heightened by a non-synchronised monetary policy in AE (Great Divergence'). To the extent that standard policies have become ineffective, and to defend from externality caused by AE's unilateral policy (financial nationalism), it is argued that EM can put a damper on the dangerous component of capital inflows. As part of macroprudential policy, such a measure is equivalent with discouraging risky behaviour to prevent financial instability and worsening income inequality.","[Azis, Iwan J.] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Azis, Iwan J.] Univ Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia",Cornell University; University of Indonesia,"Azis, IJ (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Azis, IJ (通讯作者)，Univ Indonesia, Jakarta, Indonesia.",ija1@cornell.edu,,,,,,,29,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

The program increased labor supply among men and education among women, with accompanying shifts in labor market specialization. Ten years after deworming treatment, men who were eligible as boys stay enrolled for more years of primary school, work 17% more hours each week, spend more time in nonagricultural self-employment, are more likely to hold manufacturing jobs, and miss one fewer meal per week. Women who were in treatment schools as girls are approximately one quarter more likely to have attended secondary school, halving the gender gap. They reallocate time from traditional agriculture into cash crops and nonagricultural self-employment. We estimate a conservative annualized financial internal rate of return to deworming of 32%, and show that mass deworming may generate more in future government revenue than it costs in subsidies.","[Baird, Sarah] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",George Washington University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Baird, S (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,"Miguel, Edward/0000-0001-6927-709X","NIH [R01-TW05612, R01-HD044475]; NSF [SES-0418110, SES-0962614]; World Bank; Social Science Research Council; Berkeley Population Center",NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); World Bank(The World Bank India); Social Science Research Council; Berkeley Population Center,"We thank Kevin Audi, Pierre Bachas, Chris Blattman, Seth Blumberg, Hana Brown, Lorenzo Casaburi, Lisa Chen, Garret Christensen, Evan DeFilippis, Lauren Falcao, Francois Gerard, Eva Arceo Gomez, Felipe Gonzalez, Jonas Hjort, Gerald Ipapa, Maryam Janani, Anne Karing, Jen Kwok, Andrew Fischer Lees, Leah Luben, Jamie McCasland, Owen Ozier, Kristianna Post, Adina Rom, Martin Rotemberg, Jon Schellenberg, Changcheng Song, Sebastian Stumpner, Paula Vinchery, Michael Walker, Paul Wang, Zhaoning Wang and Ethan Yeh for providing excellent research assistance on the KLPS project.

We also ask whether firm performance is affected by such policies. Our experiment consists of three treatments. In the baseline (no quota) treatment, groups of two employers and six potential job candidates are formed. Employers have to hire two workers based on information on candidate characteristics including gender and years and subject of study. The second, low penalty, treatment is identical to the baseline except there is a quota such that at least half of the employees hired must be women. If this quota is not respected, the firm has to pay a penalty. The last, high penalty, treatment is the same as the low penalty treatment except that the penalty is significantly higher. We find that women are ranked unfavorably in the absence of a quota, and the introduction of a quota significantly reduces gender discrimination. Firm performance is not affected by the introduction of quotas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For evaluating and comparing the risk adjusted alternative profit efficiency of different ownership groups in the Indian banking industry, the study employs a DEA-based meta profit frontier framework that accounts for technological heterogeneity across groups. The results highlight that profit efficiency of banks declined mildly during the global financial crisis, but then recovered quickly after the crisis. However, the global financial crisis had a differentiated impact across ownership groups. New private banks observed largest drag in the profit efficiency during the crisis years. The analysis of technology gap ratio provides that foreign banks employed best-practice production technology, and were observed to be the technology leaders of the Indian banking industry.

A hypothetical CO2 technology performance standard, giving rise to a shadow price on CO2 emissions, was specified as part of the study design. In this work we see gas generation rapidly replacing coal generation. To understand the fate of coal based generation, it is important to examine trends at a granular level. An important feature of our model, the Electricity Supply and Investment Model (ESIM) is that it contains a unit inventory with unit characteristics and a memory of how each unit is operated over time. Cycling damages that individual coal units incur are a function of cumulative wear and tear over time. The expected remaining life of a cycled coal unit will depend on the severity of the cycling and for how many years. Deteriorating operating characteristics of a cycled unit over time results in higher operating costs, slipping down the dispatch loading order, and hence an acceleration of cycling damage, that is, a viscous circle of decline. The rate of CFPP retirements will increase for lower gas prices, higher price on CO2 emissions, and greater penetration of variable and intermittent renewables.

Delayering has led to increases in revenue and inter-governmental transfers for county governments, but the associated enlarged span of control makes it difficult for upper-level governments to coordinate and monitor local ones. This has led to a reduction in county governments' total public expenditure and pro growth expenditure, as well as an increase in land corruption.

Assuming the former when the latter is relevant can lead to wrong decisions. With the aid of a stylized model that describes a bank's decision on how to allocate loans, the authors discuss policy insights for decision making under Knightian uncertainty. They use the info-gap robust satisficing approach to derive a trade-off between confidence and performance (analogous to confidence intervals in the Bayesian approach but without assignment of probabilities). The authors show that this trade off can be interpreted as a cost of robustness. They show that the robustness analysis can lead to a reversal of policy preference from the putative optimum. The authors then compare this approach to the min-max method which is the other main non-probabilistic approach available in the literature.

To do so, we distinguish explicitly between episodes of internal conflict where contestants mobilized along the lines of ethnicity and ones where mobilization occurred along other markers of group identity. Using alternative definitions of civil war and System GMM estimation to address the endogeneity of conflict and per capita income, we obtain a negative contemporaneous impact of non-ethnic civil war on economic growth over the period 1975-2005. By contrast, the impact of ethnic war is statistically insignificant.","[Biswas, Arnab; O'Reilly, Colin] Univ Wisconsin Stout, Dept Social Sci, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA; [Bang, James T.] St Ambrose Univ, Dept Finance Econ & Decis Sci, Davenport, IA USA; [Mitra, Aniruddha] Bard Coll, Econ Program, Annandale On Hudson, NY USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Stout; Saint Ambrose University,"Biswas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Stout, Dept Social Sci, Menomonie, WI 54751 USA.",biswasa@uwstout.edu,"O'Reilly, Colin/ADN-9734-2022; Bang, James T./AAI-5922-2020","O'Reilly, Colin/0000-0002-9691-2017; Bang, James T./0000-0002-7701-8220",,,,,19,5,5,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

I study a competition game between microfinance institutions (MFIs) offering joint-liability loans and moneylenders offering individual loans in presence of adverse selection. I show that one unintended consequence of the entry of a microfinance sector in local credit markets can be to trigger an increase in the equilibrium informal interest rate, because MFIs tend to attract a disproportionately-safe share of the borrower pool away from incumbent moneylenders. The existence of such composition externality depends crucially on the size of the microfinance sector and the risk composition of the borrower pool. The model predicts a non-linearly increasing relationship between informal interest rates and MFIs' capacity in relatively safe credit markets, and no relationship in risky villages. I show evidence supporting these predictions, using a first-hand panel database that records all credit transactions over 8 years for a sample of about 1000 households living in Indian villages with extensive space and time variation in the size of their microfinance sector.

However, its effects were far from uniform. While parts of Asia and Africa continued to grow fast, Europe experienced a large set back. This paper emphasizes three important factors: differences across countries in technological development; differences in capacities to exploit the opportunities offered by technology; and differences in the ability to compete in international market. A formal model, based on this approach, is developed and applied to data for 100 countries in the period 1997-2012. Empirical indicators reflecting the various factors are developed, a dataset constructed and econometric estimates of the model performed. The results are used to explore the factors behind the slowdown in economic growth, with a particular emphasis on the continuing stagnation in Europe. A major factor turns out to be the increased financialization of the economy. The negative effect of the growth of finance prior to the crisis is especially pronounced for the countries that suffered most during the crisis.","[Fagerberg, Jan] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture TIK, Oslo, Norway; [Fagerberg, Jan] Aalborg Univ, IKE, Dept Business & Management, Aalborg, Denmark; [Fagerberg, Jan; Srholec, Martin] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden; [Srholec, Martin] Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Econ, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Oslo; Aalborg University; Lund University; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Srholec, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, Lund, Sweden.;Srholec, M (通讯作者)，Acad Sci Czech Republic, Inst Econ, CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",martin.srholec@circle.lu.se,"Srholec, Martin/C-4254-2012","Srholec, Martin/0000-0001-6115-4116","VINNOVA [2010-01370]; Czech Science Foundation [P402/10/2310]; Czech Academy of Sciences [RVO 67985998, Strategie AV21]",VINNOVA(Vinnova); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Czech Academy of Sciences(Czech Academy of Sciences),"Financial support from the VINNOVA Core Funding of Centers for Innovation Systems (project 2010-01370 on 'Transformation and Growth in Innovation Systems: Innovation Policy for Global Competitiveness of SMEs and R&I Milieus'), Czech Science Foundation (project P402/10/2310 on 'Innovation, productivity and policy: What can we learn from micro data?') and Czech Academy of Sciences (institutional support RVO 67985998 and agenda 'Strategie AV21') are gratefully acknowledged.

On the other hand, higher savings by the first transitional generation lead to faster capital accumulation, which benefits younger generations.

This paper builds a model of fertility choice with dynastic altruism, age-structured population and aggregate productivity shocks. We show that, under reasonable parameter values, fertility is pro-cyclical and that, following a shock, fertility continues to cycle. Applied to the U.S. experience in the 20th century, the Great Depression generates a baby bust of 58% of that seen in the U.S. in the 1930s, followed by a Baby Boom of 77% of that seen in the U.S. in the 1950s. As observed in U.S. estate data, the model predicts that small cohorts receive relatively large per child transfers from parents.

However, that the destructive part of creative destruction is a social and economic cost and therefore biases our estimate of the impact of the innovation on GDP is hardly acknowledged, with the notable exception of Witt (1996. Innovations, Externalities and the Problem of Economic Progress. Public Choice 89: 113-30). Admittedly, during the First and Second Industrial Revolutions the magnitude of the destructive component of innovation was no doubt small compared to the net value added to GDP. However, we conjecture that recently the destructive component of innovations has increased relative to the size of the creative component as the new technologies are often creating products which are close substitutes for the ones they replace whose value depreciates substantially in the process of destruction. Consequently, the contribution of recent innovations to GDP is likely upwardly biased.

To evaluate this story, we develop a simple model that incorporates two key frictions: asymmetric information about borrowers' risk of default and a fixed cost of developing each contract lenders offer. Innovations that ameliorate asymmetric information or reduce this fixed cost have large extensive margin effects via the entry of new lending contracts targeted at riskier borrowers. This results in more defaults and borrowing, and increased dispersion of interest rates. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances and Federal Reserve Board interest rate data, we find evidence supporting these predictions. Specifically, the dispersion of credit card interest rates nearly tripled while the new cardholders of the late 1980s and 1990s had riskier observable characteristics than existing cardholders. Our calculations suggest that these new cardholders accounted for over 20% of the rise in bank credit card debt and delinquencies between 1989 and 1998.","[Livshits, Igor; Mac Gee, James C.] Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Tertilt, Michele] Univ Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of Mannheim,"Livshits, I (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,,"Livshits, Igor/0000-0002-1069-9172; Tertilt, Michele/0000-0003-0605-4141",Economic Policy Research Institute; Social Science and Humanities Research Council; National Science Foundation [SES-0748889],Economic Policy Research Institute; Social Science and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank KartikAthreya as well as seminar participants at numerous conferences and institutions for helpful comments.

The concept of innovation systems - at the regional, sectoral and national levels - have been highly influential. Previous literature developing the concept of innovation systems has stressed the importance of institutions, networks and knowledge bases at the regional, sectoral and national levels. This paper primarily draws upon an evolutionary and Schumpeterian economics perspective, in the following three senses. The conceptualization of 'innnovation spaces' focuses upon how and why firm search for innovations is influenced the opportunities within certain geographical contexts. This means that the firm create opportunities and can span different context, but they are influence by the context in term of the access, flow and co-evolution of ideas, resources, technology, people and knowledge, which help stimulate business innovation in terms of products, process and services. The paper concludes with an agenda for future research and especially the need to focus on globalization as a process of intensifying linkages across the globe.","[McKelvey, Maureen] Univ Gothenburg, IIE, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"McKelvey, M (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, IIE, Dept Econ & Soc, Gothenburg, Sweden.",maureen.mckelvey@handels.gu.se,,,,,,,80,13,14,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

In the model, banks borrow ( use leverage) to allocate resources to productive projects and provide liquidity. When banks do not actively issue new equity, aggregate outcomes depend on the level of equity in the financial sector. Equilibrium is inefficient because agents do not internalize how their decisions affect volatility, aggregate leverage, and the returns on assets. Leverage creates systemic risk, which increases the frequency and duration of crises. Limiting leverage decreases asset price volatility and increases expected returns, which decrease the likelihood that the financial sector is undercapitalized.","[Phelan, Gregory] Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Schapiro Hall,24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Phelan, G (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Dept Econ, Schapiro Hall,24 Hopkins Hall Dr, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",gp4@williams.edu,,,,,,,28,14,16,0,15,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

This view suggests that there is little role that can be played by domestic policy to break this linkage. This need not be the case. We show that the linkage between surges and booms is not as strong as is often assumed. One problem with most previous studies is that a wide range of measures for both surges and booms has been used with little checking of the robustness of results. We deal with this issue by replicating 14 different measures of capital surges (gross and net) and 5 credit boom proxies from the literature on a sample of 46 countries from 1981-2010. A second difficulty is that some previous studies have not distinguished between the proportions of surges followed by booms and booms preceded by surges. We found substantial differences between these two relationships. While there is a good deal of variation in the individual correlations the vast majority of the calculated probabilities of a surge being followed by a credit boom fall within the range of 4 % to 13 %. Although the proportion of credit booms preceded by surges is higher, the correlations for both directions are much lower than are frequently assumed. While the probabilities of a surge being followed by a credit boom generally increased from the 1980s to the 1990s they fell again in the 2000s, suggesting the possibility that authorities have become better at limiting the adverse effects of surges on domestic credit growth.","[Amri, Puspa D.] Ithaca Coll, Dept Econ, 953 Danby Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Richey, Greg M.] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Accounting & Finance, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Richey, Greg M.; Willett, Thomas D.] CIEPS, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Grad Univ, Claremont, CA USA; [Willett, Thomas D.] Claremont Mckenna Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont Colleges; Claremont McKenna College; Claremont Graduate School,"Amri, PD (通讯作者)，Ithaca Coll, Dept Econ, 953 Danby Rd, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",pamri@ithaca.edu,,"Amri, Puspa/0000-0001-7919-6517",,,,,51,19,23,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To measure spatial spillover and labor pooling effects, we use the control variables of intra-city labor movement and the number of employees in each manufacturing sector who graduated from local higher educational institutions. The research is based on a panel data analysis of 200 Korean cities during the five-year period from 2004 to 2008.

The justification for the caps rests to a large extent on the argument that these cards have, for certain merchants, become must-take cards rather than wanna-take cards. That is, there are merchants who accept payment cards not because they bring net convenience benefits but out of fear of losing profitable business to card-accepting competitors.

We propose an alternative view: even when private markets are efficient, costly bankruptcies will occur and benevolent governments without commitment will bail out firms to avoid bankruptcy costs. Bailouts then introduce inefficiencies where none had existed. Although granting the government orderly resolution powers which allow it to rewrite private contracts improves on bailout outcomes, regulating leverage and taxing size is needed to achieve the relevant constrained efficient outcome, the sustainably efficient outcome. This outcome respects governments' incentives to intervene when they lack commitment.","[Chari, V. V.; Kehoe, Patrick J.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Chari, V.

In some countries (particularly in France), extensive public policies have been put in place to develop demand and create employment by explicitly seeking to democratize consumption, which still predominantly concerns more affluent households. By using both quantitative and qualitative data, this paper aims to gain a better understanding of the factors of demand for these services and to examine the possibility of bringing the process of democratization to a successful conclusion. Due to the originality of the data used, my approach differs from previous research in two main areas: first, it highlights the lack of democratization of the consumption of these services (among working-age households), and second, it identifies the two forms of inequality underlying their development.","[Devetter, Francois-Xavier] Univ Lille, CLERSE, TELECOM Lille BP 20145 Rue Marconi,Cite Sci, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France",Universite de Lille,"Devetter, FX (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, CLERSE, TELECOM Lille BP 20145 Rue Marconi,Cite Sci, F-59650 Villeneuve Dascq, France.",devetter@telecom-lille1.eu,,"DEVETTER, Francois-Xavier/0000-0002-5535-1786",,,,,87,7,7,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

In order to study exchange rate movements, one frequently exploits the so-called Dornbusch overshooting model. However, the model is controversial from a theoretical point of view: it explains exchange rate movements by a number of fundamental variables but ignores how novel information in the form of news can enter the market. As a remedy, this article adjusts for information dissemination by performing a multivariate analysis to compare the classical overshooting model with an extended variant that includes news sentiment. Our results show that news sentiment has a substantial explanatory power of 11% of the exchange rate forecasting error variance. In addition, we also find statistical evidence that a shock in news sentiment may lead to overshooting.","[Feuerriegel, Stefan; Wolff, Georg; Neumann, Dirk] Univ Freiburg, Finance Res Grp, Chair Informat Syst Res, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Feuerriegel, S (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Finance Res Grp, Chair Informat Syst Res, Freiburg, Germany.",stefan.feuerriegel@is.uni-freiburg.de,"Feuerriegel, Stefan/ABD-6599-2021","Feuerriegel, Stefan/0000-0001-7856-8729; Neumann, Dirk/0000-0003-2178-3705",,,,,47,5,6,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It stresses the importance of considering the stock and not just the flow of new infrastructure investment. It draws attention to the information about the balance sheet that is contained for all sectors of the economy in the National Accounts, as part of their integrated stock-flow structure. While there appears to be no internationally agreed convention about the definition of infrastructure, the National Accounts information can be used to construct time series estimates for the infrastructure on a common sense view of its coverage. In constant price terms, the ratio of the infrastructure stock to gross value added appears to have risen since the mid-1990s, back towards the levels of the 1970s. But that is not true in current price terms, where the ratio remains well below the levels of the 1970s. The explanation seems to be that a relative price effect has occurred: infrastructure has become cheaper in relative terms but that has not resulted in increased infrastructure intensity. The article notes other information about the state of the UK infrastructure. As they mature, the Whole of Government Accounts should be a rich source of information. So, too, might the UK Capital Services index. Ultimately, all this information could feed into a more systematic growth accounting framework for the UK.","[Grice, Joe] Off Natl Stat, London, England",,"Grice, J (通讯作者)，Off Natl Stat, London, England.",joe.grice@ons.gov.uk,,,,,,,11,4,4,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

However, the heterogeneous influence of the multiscale market components on the entire oil-stock interaction has still been covered. Our objective is to further explore that which time scale is more essential to the integrated market interaction and the dynamic evolution of decisive time scale over time. The Brent spot oil price and the Morgan Stanley Capital International world stock index on a daily frequency were selected as the sample data, and the wavelet transform, the gray correlation, and network analyses were applied succinctly to conduct holistic and dynamical analyses. The primary findings are as follows: The wavelet-decomposed results indicate that impacts of oil price shocks on the oil-stock nexus differ in the long- and short-terms. From the holistic aspect, the growing wavelet variance with time scales demonstrates that long-term changes could lead to structure changes in trend of original market interactions. The wavelet correlation proves that short-term components are dominant in the original interaction and capture the dynamic information effectively. There are no significant lead-lag relations between the original oil-stock interaction and its components. From the dynamic perspective, it is confirmed that components from both the long and short terms are determined. The low and high transmission ability could be helpful to discover the structure changes caused by long-term components and modes controlling more information associated with the short-term components, respectively. The clustering effect limits major modes into a small amount. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The results fail to provide strong contagion evidence between conventional and Islamic equity and bond indices, supporting the decoupling hypothesis, of the Islamic securities.

This study focuses on the misallocation of production factors across plants, which has been shown in past studies to substantially reduce aggregate productivity. The study provides new evidence on the effect of employment protection on resource misallocation using a large data set of manufacturing plants covering more than 90 countries. For measuring misallocation, I use the within-industry dispersion of the marginal product of labor and total factor productivity. The results show that higher cost of dismissing redundant workers is positively associated with misallocation. This effect appears to be larger in industries that have greater demand for adjusting labor, that is, in industries with intrinsically high layoff rates, and in expanding or shrinking industries.

Meanwhile, empirical investigations of the relationship between prices and credit are often based on national-level data, which is then tested for structural breaks and asymmetric responses, usually with subsamples. Earlier author argues that local markets are structurally different from one another and so the coefficients of any estimated housing market model should vary from region to region. We investigate differences in the price-credit relationship for 12 regions of the UK. Markov-switching is introduced to capture asymmetric market behaviours and turning points. Results show that credit abundance had a large impact on house prices in Greater London and nearby regions alongside a strong positive feedback effect from past house price movements. This impact is even larger in Greater London and the South East of England when house prices are falling, which are the only instances where the credit effect is more prominent than the positive feedback effect. A strong positive feedback effect from past lending activity is also present in the loan dynamics. Furthermore, bubble probabilities extracted using a discrete Kalman filter neatly capture market turning points.","[Xiao, Qin] Univ Hull, Sch Business, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England; [Devaney, Steven] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England",University of Hull; University of Reading,"Xiao, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Cottingham Rd, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",q.xiao@hull.ac.uk,,"Devaney, Steven/0000-0002-1916-2558",,,,,47,3,3,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It finds strong evidence of dynamic adjustment in China's OFDI stock with an agglomeration effect The dynamic adjustment and agglomeration effects are stronger in high-tech countries than in low-tech ones but indifferent in host country's resource endowments and income levels. The empirical results suggest that there exists a substantial adjustment cost in China's OFDI and that China's existing OFDI stock can gradually adjust toward its long-term equilibrium level, which is not only greater but also more volatile than the actual stock. Of particular interest is that we find a strong and positive relationship between lagged inward FDI (IFDI) and contemporaneous OFDI, implying that capital outflow from China has been partially induced by the countries which have invested in China.

Although the firm size distribution does not follow Zipf distribution in China, it is approaching Zipf distribution over time. In general, financing constraints have a robustly negative effect on the size distribution of firms. Furthermore, firms in Western China grow significantly more equally after controlling for financing constraints. However, the effect of financing constraints in Central China is significantly negative, and the effect of financing constraints on firm size distribution in Eastern China is insignificant.

Considering structural changes, we assess the stability of the parameters and find that both the short-run and long-run relationships between the two estimated variables are unstable. This result suggests that full-sample causality tests cannot be relied upon. We instead employ a time-varying (bootstrap) rolling-window approach to revisit the dynamic causal relationship, and we find that the CPI is affected by the REER for several sub-samples due to the role of exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) under the managed floating exchange rate regime in China. These findings provide further proof of the impact of stable exchange rates on the maintenance of relatively steady price levels especially during the economic crisis and economic reform in China. The policy implication of these findings is that maintaining exchange rate stability is beneficial for controlling inflation during the economic crisis and economic reform.","[Su, Chi Wei; Zhang, Heng-Guo] Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chang, Hsu-Ling] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Accounting & Informat, Taichung, Taiwan; [Nian, Rui] Ocean Univ China, Dept Informat Sci & Engn, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China",Ocean University of China; Ocean University of China,"Zhang, HG (通讯作者)，Ocean Univ China, Dept Finance, Qingdao, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zszhg@126.com,"Su, Chi Wei/ABE-4976-2021",,National Social Science Foundation [15BJY155]; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project [14YJA790049],National Social Science Foundation; Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project,"This work is supported by the National Social Science Foundation (Grant number: 15BJY155), and Ministry of Education's Humanities and Social Science Research Project (Grant number: 14YJA790049).",,63,6,6,0,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We find that corruption in lending is higher when state-owned banks or family-owned banks provide a higher proportion of credit to the economy, in both developed and developing countries. A stronger regulatory environment, either through a stronger supervisory regime or a higher quality of external audits, helps to curtail bank lending corruption if induced by family-controlled ownership, but not if induced by state-controlled ownership. We further find that controlled-ownership of banks by other banks contributes to reduce corruption in lending; the same applies to widely-held ownership of banks, but only for developed countries.

Median inflation has tended to be higher than in other regions of the developing world, such as MENA and Latin America. Inflation is highly persistent and is higher in countries that are less politically stable, in those without hard-peg exchange rate regimes, and in those with larger fiscal deficits. Inflation has declined over time, at least at the upper end of the distribution. There is no evidence that commitment devices such as inflation targeting have reduced inflation, but in SSA the sample is confined to two countries. Inflation typically spikes after a devaluation, and is sensitive to supply-side shocks. Movements in the real price of oil and rice (but not maize) have significantly affected the inflation rate. In countries that are poor in oil and minerals and therefore more reliant on agriculture, output growth is negatively correlated with inflation, presumably because, when the harvest is good and agricultural output is high, the extra supply reduces food prices. Fiscal balances also display considerable persistence and are more favourable in resource-rich and politically stable countries and in those with hard-peg exchange rate regimes, and have improved over time.","[Bleaney, Michael] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England; [Francisco, Manuela] World Bank, Latin Amer & Caribbean Reg, Cent Amer, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",University of Nottingham; The World Bank,"Bleaney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham, England.",michael.bleaney@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,9,7,7,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Increases in fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a pollutant that readily penetrates indoors, leads to significant decreases in productivity, with effects arising at levels below air quality standards. In contrast, pollutants that do not travel indoors, such as ozone, have little, if any, effect on productivity. This effect of outdoor pollution on indoor worker productivity suggests an overlooked consequence of pollution.

The model is calibrated on 46 emerging market and developing economies for which we evaluate the upper bound for the welfare gain from financial integration. For plausible values of preference parameters and actual levels of financial integration, the mean welfare gain from financial integration is around 13.5% of initial wealth.

The countries share a number of similarities that make the comparison interesting, including high levels of inequality given their levels of development, high inequality of opportunity, large and racially diverse populations, and similar sizes of government. The U.S. achieves higher redistribution through direct taxes and transfers, primarily because Brazil underutilizes personal income taxes and keeps its progressive cash and food transfer programs small, while its larger transfer programs are less progressive. When public spending on health and non-tertiary education is added to income using the government cost approach, however, the two countries achieve similar levels of redistribution.","[Higgins, Sean; Lustig, Nora; Ruble, Whitney] Tulane Univ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Smeeding, Timothy M.] Univ Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Tulane University; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Higgins, S (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 206 Tilton Hall,6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",shiggins@tulane.edu,,,,,,,91,11,14,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

According to behavioural finance, investor greed and fear would form irrational behaviour and affect their portfolio allocation. Although well-known mechanical investment strategy of dollar cost averaging (DCA) and value averaging (VA) could eliminate the problems of when to purchase, there are still some disadvantages to consider. For example, using a DCA strategy may be able to decrease volatility in portfolio so as to not effect investment decision, but it gives no rule for selling and may increase the opportunity cost of time if investors start deducted at peak prices. On the other hand, VA gives more aggressive sell signals to control the value of the portfolio to the level desired, but the investor may not have enough money purchase of a large number of shares in sharp decline period. Therefore, we use VA as main strategy and Bollinger Band as assist indicator for check for volatility for entry or exit. Through analysis and simulation, the new strategy we design does improve the performance during both bull and bear market periods.","[Lai, Hung-Cheng; Huang, Sz-Chi] Overseas Chinese Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Tseng-Chan] Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Trade, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Tseng, TC (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Ningbo Inst Technol, Sch Econ & Trade, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",tctseng@nit.zju.edu.cn,,,,,,,12,2,5,1,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We use data on World Cup tournaments in alpine skiing for the period of 19922014 and exploit close races as a source of randomness for ranking positions. Since the allocation of media attention is skewed towards the winner and athletes on the podium, we can estimate the causal effect of media attention. Our results document that ranking schemes generate sharp discontinuities in media attention even in close competitions. However, both regression discontinuity and instrumental variables estimates reveal that biased media attention neither affects prices nor quantities in the betting market.

In its application of the methodology to four resource-poor yet economically advanced island economies in East Asia Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, this study establishes a novel framework to conceptualize energy security. The framework incorporates three dimensions: vulnerability, efficiency, and sustainability, three indicators being allocated to each dimension. The study finds that all the three dimensions are critical for the resource-poor economies but have different weights in each of them. An urgent task for these four economies is to implement energy efficiency and conservation measures. Liberalization of electricity sector can be a helpful tool to reduce energy consumption and increase efficiency.

We build a macroeconomic model in which countercyclical lending standards emerge as an equilibrium outcome. In the model, banks compete on lending rates as well as collateral requirements. The presence of lending relationships between firms and banks gives rise to endogenous fluctuations in interest rate margins and collateral requirements. We demonstrate that endogenous credit standards amplify business cycles, driving up output volatility by around 25% when compared to a model without lending relationships. Finally, we show that in order to combat the effects of endogenous credit standards on macroeconomic volatility, a countercyclical loan-to-value ratio is an effective macro prudential policy tool.

It is shown that this result extends to n players each with strategic leverage if the social reference includes the own action. This multiplicity results in an open loop setting, which renders in almost all other cases a unique intertemporal Nash equilibrium. Finally, the cooperative solution exhibits non-standard features: the possibility of converging to the (stationary inferior) agricultural equilibrium and that is due to an unstable node while an unstable spiral can render the unique outcome of full industrialization.

Using data from the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR), we find that the utilization rate of dentures increases from approximately 50% to 63% around the threshold, implying that the extensive margin elasticity of denture usage with respect to the coinsurance rate is about -0.41. In addition, we find this jump is almost entirely due to the change in the rate among women. On the other hand, we do not find a significant improvement in self-reported chewing ability, although chewing ability may not be the only social benefit from dentures.

The main trade-off is one in which specialization allows the implementation of any possible effort profile, while multitasking constraint the set of implementable effort profiles. Yet, the implementation of any effort profile in this set is less expensive than the equivalent profile under specialization. The principal prefers multitasking to specialization except when tasks are complements and the output after success is small enough so that it is not second-best optimal to implement high effort in each task. This result is robust to several extensions such as the existence of multiple performance measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Our experimental design uses a restricted environment in which a particular form of truncation is always a best response. We find that subjects do not truncate their preferences more often when truncation is profitable. They do, however, truncate their preferences less often when truncation is dangerous - that is, when there is a risk of over-truncating and remaining unmatched.

This form of wholesale pricing occurred recently in UK Telecoms, and the issue became extensively debated in the law courts. A major concern in deciding the merits of the case lay with the question of whether or not the introduction of tiered wholesale pricing created incentives for retailers to actually reduce their prices. This paper examines the incentive for the case where the wholesale tariff is a non-linear continuous differentiable function. It is shown that so long as the tariff is strictly increasing, convex, and positive only for retail prices greater than the maximum retailer marginal cost, then there is indeed an incentive to reduce price, whatever the actual gradient of the tariff schedule.","[Dobbs, Ian M.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Newcastle University - UK,"Dobbs, IM (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",I.M.Dobbs@ncl.ac.uk,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Unsophisticated agents are hit with frictions that lower the return to a conventional asset they hold. Sophisticated agents construct financial innovations that are perfect substitutes for the conventional asset, but are not subject to the friction. In the absence of complete information, unsophisticated agents learn about innovations through a contagion process, as they encounter competitors who have already adopted them. The model yields two equilibria: in one, the innovation persists; in the other, it disappears. Only one equilibrium is stable, and this is determined by the strength of the contagion and by early strategic interactions between sophisticated agents. The model suggests mechanisms for several empirical regularities in the financial innovation literature. Additionally, two applications demonstrate how to estimate the contagion parameter with a short time series of data, and how to use it to predict whether a financial innovation will spread.","[Hull, Isaiah] Sveriges Riksbank, Div Res, Stockholm, Sweden",Sveriges Riksbank,"Hull, I (通讯作者)，Sveriges Riksbank, Div Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",isaiah.hull@riksbank.se,,,,,,,29,5,5,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

I then provide a brief summary of the eight parts of the book before focusing on the analytical core, the analysis of 'accumulation in the long run' that is provided in Book II. Next I outline the critical reception of the book in the late 1950s and Robinson's reaction to it, both then and later in her career. I conclude by documenting the rather limited influence of The Accumulation of Capital in the longer term, even among heterodox economists, and conclude that the book was a noble failure.","[King, J.

In this paper, we explore this issue by examining the relationship between the involvement of foreign banks in the banking systems and the volatility of key macroeconomic variables in normal and crisis periods. Using a sample of 20 Emerging European countries from 1998 to 2013, we find that an increase in the assets of foreign banks in the banking system reduces output and consumption growth volatility in general but does not significantly affect the volatility of investments. However, these banks were found to play a significant role in increasing output, consumption and investment volatility in 2009. Our findings suggest that foreign banks' harmful impact during the global crisis was only temporary and that they seem to help Emerging European countries stabilize macroeconomic volatility in normal times and after the global crisis.","[Onder, Zeynep; Ozyildirim, Suheyla] Bilkent Univ, Fac Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Önder, Z (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Fac Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey.",zonder@bilkent.edu.tr; suheyla@bilkent.edu.tr,,"Onder, Zeynep/0000-0002-9260-6557",TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) [110K369],TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),"This study is supported by TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey) with project number 110K369.

While Tobin's q describes the expected future earnings related to those projected by the book value, the price-earnings ratio compares future growth of earnings based on the projection of current earnings. In other words, a high price-earnings ratio might indicate that investors are willing to rely on future earnings growth, even though current earnings are low. By using an unbalanced panel of about 500 listed firms from Germany over the period 1987-2007, we find that including the price-earnings ratio in the investment equation does not change the explanatory power of Tobin's q. Most notably, the price-earnings ratio exerts a positive and significant impact on investment. These results are robust to the inclusion of a measure of the firm's internal funds and of fixed effects and also to the use of different estimators.","[Pietrovito, Filomena] Univ Molise, Dipartimento Econ Gest Soc & Ist, Campobasso, Italy",University of Molise,"Pietrovito, F (通讯作者)，Univ Molise, Dipartimento Econ Gest Soc & Ist, Campobasso, Italy.",filomena.pietrovito@unimol.it,"Pietrovito, Filomena/ABI-2485-2020","Pietrovito, Filomena/0000-0002-3768-9791",,,,,24,1,1,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

On the one hand, standard approaches fail to account for its persistence in a credible way due to their implicit assumption that the economy is internally stable. On the other, heterodox approaches fail to regain consensus. While often correctly stressing that the roots of the GR lie not only in developments within the financial sector but also in a lack of aggregate demand, they fail to devise an alternative method for showing why this problem has arisen in a systematic way. This paper fills the gap by proposing a new framework called the 'balanced stability approach'. Its specific contribution is to stress that the low demand problem is rooted in a wide range of structural changes which arise in the so-called 'new economy'.","[Togati, Teodoro Dario] Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Togati, TD (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, I-10124 Turin, Italy.",dario.togati@unito.it,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Coal prices can be quite uncertain and highly volatile, often experiencing large changes. Understanding the data-generating process of coal prices would seem critical, both from a market perspective and from a policy perspective. This study investigates the appropriate stochastic process underlying coal prices. Commonly assumed processes, such as geometric Brownian motion fail to properly account for the arrival of unanticipated information which inflicts rapid changes - or jumps - in energy markets. Such discontinuities can manifest fat tails' in the distribution of returns. To investigate the possibility of time-varying volatility, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic models are also incorporated into the analysis. We find compelling empirical evidence that discontinuities must not be ignored, with US coal prices experiencing jumps every few days. The result has implications for the potential closure of coal-fired plants in response to cheaper alternatives or climate-based regulations.","[Wilmot, Neil A.] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Wilmot, NA (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA.",nwilmot@d.umn.edu,,"Wilmot, Neil/0000-0002-2525-0757",,,,,15,1,1,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The incumbent may or may not know the entrant's quality. The model reveals a separating equilibrium where the entrant's high price signals its high quality when the proportion of informed consumers is at some intermediate value. The case in which the incumbent knows the entrant's quality generates two additional equilibria. When the proportion of informed consumers is large enough, firms choose their prices as in the complete information case. The entrant's high price in combination with the incumbent's low price signals the entrant's high quality. When the proportion of informed consumers is at some intermediate value, the incumbent's high price signals the entrant's low quality, while its low price signals the entrant's high quality. Interestingly, we find that entry may be facilitated with informational product differentiation.","[Wu, Fulan] Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Wu, FL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wufulan09@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

However, children may also disrupt marital stability as they will induce dramatic changes into the household allocation of money and time. In particular, children conceived before or after first marriage may be valued differently by the spouses and this may lead to marital conflicts. It is difficult to assign a priori the direction of the effect of children on marriage stability, and causality may run either way, as couples who anticipate a separation are more likely to have fewer children than those who are happy together, while children born before first marriage may be associated with a lower marriage attachment of their parents. Here, we follow an empirical approach and take advantage of the richness of the data on pre-marital history from the 24 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth79, to estimate the effect of children conceived before or after first marriage on marital stability. We find a significant deterrent effect of young children conceived during first marriage to the likelihood of divorce, while children conceived before first marriage are found to have a disruptive effect on marital stability.

The transition from the autocratic to a more democratic regime takes place only if the citizens decide to revolt against the elite. The occurrence of a revolution primarily depends on the autocratic regime vulnerability and the level of inequalities, both being driven by the elite's redistribution and repression policies. First, we show that when a political transition is inevitable, the elite choose the maximum rate of redistribution to lengthen their period in office. Second, we find that the duration of the autocratic regime is linked to resource abundance, and how it relates to the elite's policies. More resources lead to a shorter reign of a redistributive regime, which may not be the case of a repressive regime. Finally, we interpret the Arab spring sequence in light of our findings.

We argue that their pessimistic results with respect to schooling investment is due to the use of an imprecise proxy. Indeed, when life expectancy increases at time t, only the cohort born at t should increase its human capital investment. On the contrary, [Acemoglu, D., Johnson, S., 2006.

In each repetition of the game, groups of size n <= M are randomly and anonymously matched from a fixed population of size M to play the n-player PD stage game. We provide conditions for which the contagious strategy (Kandori, 1992) sustains a social norm of cooperation among all M players. Our main finding is that if agents are sufficiently patient, a social norm of society-wide cooperation becomes easier to sustain under the contagious strategy as n increases toward M. In an experiment where the population size M is fixed and conditions identified by our theoretical analysis hold, we find strong evidence that cooperation rates are higher with larger group sizes than with smaller group sizes in treatments where each subject interacts with M 1 robot players who follow the contagious strategy. When the number of human subjects increases in the population, the cooperation rates decrease significantly, indicating that it is the strategic uncertainty among the human subjects that hinders cooperation.

In practice, however, the growth of economic openness has not been accompanied by the expected improvements in corruption for 34 African countries between 1990 and 2009. This paper presents a plausible explanation for this conundrum. Results from panel data regression analyses indicate that a switch from trading with the Advanced Economies to trading with China increases the perceived corruption level. For instance, in a representative African country, a 10% point substitution from trading with the Advanced Economies to trading with China makes its ICRG corruption score decline-indicating increased corruption-by 29%.","[Gokcekus, Omer] Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA; [Suzuki, Yui] Musashi Univ, Fac Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Seton Hall University,"Gokcekus, O (通讯作者)，Seton Hall Univ, Sch Diplomacy & Int Relat, S Orange, NJ 07079 USA.",omer.gokcekus@shu.edu; yui-szk@cc.musashi.ac.jp,,"Gokcekus, Omer/0000-0001-8109-5918",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03368] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,37,1,1,2,14,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

In the present paper we discuss different mechanisms suggested in the literature to explain this distribution of firm sizes. The paper uses the China Industrial Enterprises Database to study the distribution (firm size in terms of the number of employees, capital, and gross profit) for the provinces of China for the years 1998-2008. We estimate the power-law distribution and confirm its plausibility using the KS test and the log-likelihood ratio vs. lognormal and exponential distributions. The analysis on regional levels allows an assessment of regional effects on differences in the distribution; we discuss possible explanations for the observed patterns in the light of the recent regional economic development and the economic reforms in the PRC.

Top income mobility is assessed in three dimensions: (i) persistence in top income fractiles and its stability over time, (ii) measures of individual mobility that are not dependent on the fractile size: the degree of mobility between equally sized groups and mobility in ranks, and (iii) mobility's impact on top income shares. Persistence in top income fractiles is comparatively high and fairly stable across the analyzed period. Top income recipients are less prone to downward mobility and see less variation in annual ranks than less rich tax units. Mobility's impact on income concentration is moderate.

Non-linear models have increasingly featured, along with linear counterparts, in the forecasting literature. In this study, we focus on forecasting South African inflation by means of non-linear models and using a long historical dataset of seasonally adjusted monthly inflation rates spanning from 1921:02 to 2013:01. For an emerging market economy such as South Africa, non-linearities can be a salient feature of such long data, hence the relevance of evaluating non-linear models' forecast performance. In the same vein, given the fact that 1969:10 marks the beginning of a protracted rising trend in South African inflation data, we estimate the models for an in-sample period of 1921:02-1966:09 and evaluate 1, 4, 12, and 24 step-ahead forecasts over an out-of-sample period of 1966:10-2013:01. In addition, using a weighted loss function specification, we evaluate the forecast performance of different non-linear models across various extreme economic environments and forecast horizons. In general, we find that no competing model consistently and significantly beats the LoLiMoT's performance in forecasting South African inflation.","[Kanda, Patrick T.; Balcilar, Mehmet; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Balcilar, Mehmet; Bahramian, Pejman] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkish Republi, Turkey",University of Pretoria; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",Rangan.Gupta@up.ac.za,"BALCILAR, MEHMET/K-7346-2019; Bahramian, Pejman/Q-5212-2019","BALCILAR, MEHMET/0000-0001-9694-5196; Bahramian, Pejman/0000-0002-8917-6306",,,,,35,1,1,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Meanwhile, the solar photovoltaic (PV) industry is growing rapidly in the U.S. and generating many jobs that represent employment opportunities for laid off coal workers. In order to determine the viability of a smooth transition from coal to PV-related employment, this paper provides an analysis of the cost to retrain current coal workers for solar photovoltaic industry employment in the U.S. The current coal industry positions are determined, the skill sets are evaluated and the salaries are tabulated. For each type of coal position, the closest equivalent PV position is determined and then the re-training time and investment are quantified. These values are applied on a state-by-state basis for coal producing states employing the bulk of coal workers as a function of time using a reverse seniority retirement program for the current American fleet of coal-powered plants. The results show that a relatively minor investment in retraining would allow the vast majority of coal workers to switch to PV-related positions even in the event of the elimination of the coal industry.

Good growth performance between 1960 and 1985, and the boom between 1985 and 1995, led to an aspiration for Thailand to become an advanced economy by 2020. This was completely derailed by the 1997 financial crisis. It took eight years for the economic overhang from the crisis to fully dissipate. Thailand then entered a period of political crisis, which has continued to the present. After 1997, the growth drivers changed substantially, with exports becoming the main growth driver and investment collapsing. Growth has been slower than before the financial crisis and Thailand is now one of the worse growth performers in ASEAN. Export is now less effective in driving growth and there is a need to revive investment as the future growth driver. There remain many challenges to Thailand's long-term growth. The paper suggests a number of policy directions to make investment effective as the future growth driver.","[Sussangkarn, Chalongphob; Nikomborirak, Deunden] Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Soi Ramkhamhaeng 39, Bangkok 10310, Thailand",,"Sussangkarn, C; Nikomborirak, D (通讯作者)，Thailand Dev Res Inst, 565 Soi Ramkhamhaeng 39, Bangkok 10310, Thailand.",chalongp@tdri.or.th; deunden@tdri.or.th,,,,,,,10,1,3,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Our estimation sample is large, virtually free of attrition, and allows us to control for the factors conditional on which the prizes were randomly assigned. In adults, we find no evidence that wealth impacts mortality or health care utilization, with the possible exception of a small reduction in the consumption of mental health drugs. Our estimates allow us to rule out effects on 10-year mortality one sixth as large as the cross-sectional wealth-mortality gradient. In our intergenerational analyses, we find that wealth increases children's health care utilization in the years following the lottery and may also reduce obesity risk. The effects on most other child outcomes, including drug consumption, scholastic performance, and skills, can usually be bounded to a tight interval around zero. Overall, our findings suggest that in affluent countries with extensive social safety nets, causal effects of wealth are not a major source of the wealth-mortality gradients, nor of the observed relationships between child developmental outcomes and household income.","[Cesarini, David] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA; IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; Stockholm Univ, Inst Int Econ Studies, Stockholm, Sweden; Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",New York University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); National Bureau of Economic Research; Stockholm School of Economics; Stockholm University; University of Cambridge,"Cesarini, D (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"Cesarini, David/JDD-2467-2023","Cesarini, David/0000-0002-0043-009X; Ostling, Robert/0000-0002-5099-2584; Lindqvist, Erik/0000-0002-9488-5385","Swedish Research Council [B0213903]; Hedelius Wallander Foundation [P2011:0032:1]; Russell Sage Foundation [83-14-14]; NSF [1326635]; Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research [2011-1437]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1326635] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Hedelius Wallander Foundation; Russell Sage Foundation; NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","We thank Dan Benjamin, Anders Bjorklund, Dalton Conley, Tom Cunningham, Partha Dasgupta, George Davey Smith, Oskar Erixson, Jennifer Jennings, Sandy Jencks, Magnus Johannesson, Larry Katz, David Laibson, Mikael Lindahl, Rita Ginja, Matthew Notowidigdo, Per Petterson-Lidbom, Erik Plug, Johan Reutfors, Bruce Sacerdote, Jim Smith, Jonas Vlachos, and four anynomous referees for constructive suggestions that helped us improve the article.

The international macro literature, which is primarily concerned with short-run business cycle fluctuations, assigns a low value to this parameter. The international trade literature, which is more concerned with long-run changes in trade flows following a change in relative prices, assigns a high value to this parameter. This paper constructs a model where this discrepancy between the short- and long-run elasticities is due to frictions in distribution. Goods need to be combined with a local non-traded input, distribution capital, which is good specific. Home and foreign goods may be close substitutes, but if distribution capital is slow to adjust then agents cannot shift their consumption in the short run following a change in relative prices, and home and foreign goods appear as poor substitutes in the short run. In the long run this distribution capital can be reallocated, and agents can shift their purchases following a change in relative prices. Thus the observed substitutability gets larger as time passes. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper offers a different view. Employing analytical and numerically solved general equilibrium models, it provides plausible conditions under which a more conventional form of regulation-namely, the use of a clean energy standard (CES)-is more cost-effective. The models reveal that the CES distorts factor markets less because it is a smaller implicit tax on factors of production. This advantage more than offsets the disadvantages of the CES when minor emissions reductions are involved.","[Goulder, Lawrence H.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Landau Econ Bldg,579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94306 USA; [Hafstead, Marc A.

Given the dearth of information in this area, it draws on fieldwork conducted among metal workers. In particular, the paper analyzes how consumer credit has become a part of daily life of workers, driven by socio-economic and institutional factors. The results show that consumer debt in Turkey has become a part of the daily life of workers as a consequence of, first, growing dependence on debt to support basic reproduction of labor power, and second, of the banks' increasing orientation towards consumer lending. These findings also signal the deepening of the already unequal power relation between banks and wage earners.","[Karacimen, Elif] Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, Rize, Turkey",Recep Tayyip Erdogan University,"Karacimen, E (通讯作者)，Recep Tayyip Erdogan Univ, Dept Econ, Fener Mah, TR-53100 Rize, Turkey.",elifkaracimen@gmail.com,"Karacimen, Elif/K-7876-2019","Karacimen, Elif/0000-0001-6851-3564",,,,,40,13,15,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

However, models within this literature have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the product-level response of firms to changes in trade costs. This paper attempts to resolve these contradictions by employing Bayesian techniques to estimate the product portfolio response throughout the distribution of US firms following the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement of 1989. I find evidence of a differential response among firms that are heterogeneous in terms of their involvement in foreign markets. Firms with less than 10-20% of total sales accounted for by foreign markets reduced product diversification as trade costs fell, while more foreign-oriented firms increased diversification.

Examples include labor markets, housing markets, and markets for financial assets. We characterize equilibrium, and identify the dynamics of transaction prices, trading patterns, and the average quality in the market. When the horizon is finite, the surplus in the unique equilibrium exceeds the competitive surplus; as traders become perfectly patient, the market becomes completely illiquid at all but the first and last dates, but the surplus remains above the competitive surplus. When the horizon is infinite, the surplus realized equals the static competitive surplus. We study policies aimed at improving market performance, and show that subsidies to low quality or to trades at a low price, taxes on high quality, restrictions on trading opportunities, or government purchases may raise the surplus.

At their core is a set of global economic and environmental accounts which capture a complete set of inter-industry and inter-regional relationships in the global economy in a consistent manner. While much attention is focused on the raw data and parameterization required to expand or add sectoral detail to IAMs, only rarely is there discussion of how different matrix balancing methods (i.e. translating disparate raw data sources into the consistent database) affect modeling results. This article offers an in-depth look into the database-modeling nexus in IAMs, focusing on the electric power sector which is both a major source of CO2 emissions and a critical vehicle for climate change mitigation. Comparisons of the prevailing matrix balancing algorithms show how the choice of database reconciliation methodology affects modeling results using policy relevant simulations in the context of the electric power sector. The resulting insights can be applied to the disaggregation of other, technology rich sectors in the economy. We conclude that appropriate selection of database reconciliation methodologies can reduce the deviation between bottom-up and top-down modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Economists have sought to provide more realistic theories of the firm through attributing to them functions of minimisation of transaction costs, accommodation of bounded rationality, assembly of information, etc. These functions are seen as supplementary to their role as participants in a broadly neoclassical market framework. This paper suggests that the theories do nothing to increase the understanding of the firm; rather, they deepen the misconceptions that arise from the neoclassical model. The paper proposes a theory of companies as bargaining agencies meeting a viability condition in the context of situation-related consumer demand. The proposed concept integrates the important phenomena of technological innovation and distance fully into the concept of company operations.","[Spread, Patrick] Saikile, 29 Moorland Close, Witney OX28 6LN, Oxon, England",,"Spread, P (通讯作者)，Saikile, 29 Moorland Close, Witney OX28 6LN, Oxon, England.",pat-rick.spread@btopenworld.com,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The level of technical efficiency is measured using a stochastic frontier production function approach. Based on estimation results from instrumental variable panel quantile regressions we find that there is a positive significant effect of off-farm employment on the level of farm technical efficiency. We also find that fragmentation of farmland is a barrier to the improvement of technical efficiency. In addition, we find a downward trend in the level of agricultural technical efficiency among our sample. Therefore, the Chinese Government should stimulate agricultural mechanization and the development of farming techniques to improve technical efficiency in the context of increasing off-farm employment.","[Zhang, Linxiu; Su, Weiliang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing 100864, Peoples R China; [Su, Weiliang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Sino Danish Ctr Educ & Res, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Eriksson, Tor] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business Econ, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Liu, Chengfang] Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China","Chinese Academy of Sciences; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Aarhus University; Peking University","Liu, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Adv Agr Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China.",lxzhang.ccap@igsnrr.ac.cn; suwl.12b@igsnrr.ac.cn; tor@econ.au.dk; cfliu.ccap@pku.edu.cn,"ZHANG, LIN/GYD-9123-2022; Zhang, Lin/HZH-4842-2023; li, zhang/JHV-1750-2023","Eriksson, Tor/0000-0001-9309-5499; Su, Weiliang/0000-0003-0697-7907","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012, 71473240, 71473239]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71333012, 71473240 and 71473239).",,45,22,23,4,47,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2016,24.0,3,,,SI,,37,51,,10.1111/cwe.12157,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957200004,0

When the new' panel unit root tests are carried out relative to the Euro area rate as reference, we confirm the results of previous studies that support the RIP hypothesis, and the results of the old' tests used as a benchmark. Nevertheless, when the new' tests are performed using the average of the CEECs' rate as reference, our results are mitigated, revealing that the hypothesis of CEECs' interest rates convergence cannot be taken for granted. From a robustness analysis perspective, our findings indicate that the RIP hypothesis for CEECs should be considered with caution, because the RIP hypothesis is sensitive to the retained reference rate for computing the real interest rate differential, and also to the retained countries in the sample.","[Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu] Politehn Univ Timisoara, Dept Management, P Ta Victoriei 2, Timisoara 300006, Romania; [Albulescu, Claudiu Tiberiu; Pepin, Dominique] Univ Poitiers, CRIEF, Poitiers, France; [Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] IFHE Univ, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Polytechnic University of Timisoara; Universite de Poitiers; The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE),"Albulescu, CT (通讯作者)，Politehn Univ Timisoara, P Ta Victoriei 2, Timisoara 300006, Romania.",claudiu.albulescu@upt.ro,"ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/AAI-7850-2020; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/0000-0003-2875-1749; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263",,,,,61,5,6,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Building on previous literature, we propose a framework to account for differences in initial characteristics in evaluating policy performance. We apply the proposed framework to the appraisal of poverty reduction and show that initial characteristics can considerably affect performance. The framework advances by explicitly quantifying the importance of the non-linearity of the growth elasticity of poverty reduction. Whilst wealthier countries did perform better in reducing poverty during 1995-2008, after equalizing the mean of the initial distribution of income the situation reverses, with the poorest countries going from being the worse to being the best performers in poverty reduction.","[Allwine, Melanie] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Rigolini, Jamele; Lopez-Calva, Luis F.] World Bank, 185 Alvarez Calderon,Piso 7, Lima, Peru; [Rigolini, Jamele] IZA, Zurich, Switzerland",George Washington University; The World Bank,"Rigolini, J (通讯作者)，World Bank, 185 Alvarez Calderon,Piso 7, Lima, Peru.;Rigolini, J (通讯作者)，IZA, Zurich, Switzerland.",jrigolini@nyu.edu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Under duopoly with committed bargaining, the fixed wage is the Nash equilibrium; with flexible bargaining, an agreement between the incumbent firm and its union about profit sharing arises as Nash equilibrium, if the union is not too strong.

We examine two methodological questions which affect many studies of communication in games, particularly those studying the relationship between communication and cooperation in supergames. We show that making it easier for subjects to reach an agreement (by allowing more rounds of communication) does not increase cooperation with a limited message space treatment. Thus, limited message space treatments are not a good substitute for the use of chat. Making the game longer, thereby making the connection between the first period and the continuation game more obvious, also has little impact on cooperation. For both the two-and three-period versions of our game we find substantial amounts of contingent play. This implies that use of a finitely repeated game, which has a number of methodological advantages, maintains the main properties of the underlying supergame.","[Cooper, David J.] Florida State Univ, 113 Collegiate Loop,Room 275, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Cooper, David J.] Univ E Anglia, 113 Collegiate Loop,Room 275, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Cooper, David J.] Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Cooper, David J.] DICE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Cooper, David J.] Norwich Res Pk, CEPR, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Kuhn, Kai-Uwe] Univ Michigan, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Kuhn, Kai-Uwe] CEPR, 611 Tappan St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of East Anglia; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, 113 Collegiate Loop,Room 275, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.;Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, 113 Collegiate Loop,Room 275, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.;Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，DICE, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.;Cooper, DJ (通讯作者)，Norwich Res Pk, CEPR, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",djcooper@fsu.edu; kukuhn@umich.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0720993],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We would like to thank the National Science Foundation (SES-0720993) for funding these experiments.

Focusing on this consumer endogeneity of health insurance policy choice, we examine the individual moral hazard welfare implications of a reduction in the price of medical care, which is a potential consequence of the ACA. We show that endogenous policy choice plays a key role in determining the welfare outcome. While moral hazard welfare improvement is not precluded, a distinctly possible outcome is that the consumer revises his/her choice of insurance policy so as to retain some portion of the reduction in expenditure risk caused by the medical care price decrease. In this event, moral hazard welfare loss is higher than it was before the price decrease, although the increased loss is tempered by the endogenous contract choice effect. This result resuscitates an old conventional wisdom.

Our approach relies on the interaction between idiosyncratic shocks of firms and the network structure of firms. We analytically study this phenomenon using the adjacency matrix of a complete network and we present a simulation with more general random adjacency matrices. We also check empirically, using Italian data, the relationship between the network structure and the Solow residual. In particular, in the empirical part, we find two main results: firstly, the relationship between the Solow residual and the measure of connectivity of firms is positive, in accordance with the analytical results. Secondly, we find that the measure of connectivity is pro-cyclical with the annual growth rate of industrial production.","[Guzzini, Enrico] Univ E Campus, Via Isimbardi 10, I-22060 Novedrate, CO, Italy; [Palestrini, Antonio] Univ Politecn Marche, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy",Universita Ecampus; Marche Polytechnic University,"Palestrini, A (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Piazzale Martelli 8, I-60121 Ancona, Italy.",enrico.guzzini@uniecampus.it; ants.pal@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1860-711X,1860-7128,,J ECON INTERACT COOR,J.

Moreover, the different educational attainments of temporary emigrants have different effects on school enrollment. Specifically, the proportion of temporary emigrants with high school education positively affects middle school enrollment, while the proportion of temporary emigrants with middle school education negatively affects high school enrollment.

But most existing studies are cross-sectional and can shed little light on the economy-wide forces that shift public opinion on immigration. In this paper I use the six rounds of the European Social Survey (2002-2012) to test the effects of macro-level shocks on immigration opinion for 20 countries. For Europe as a whole the shifts in opinion have been remarkably mild but with differences between countries that reflect the severity of the recession. Pro-immigration opinion is negatively related to the share of immigrants in the population and to the share of social benefits in GDP, but only weakly to unemployment. These effects are common across different socioeconomic groups and there is little evidence of divergence in opinion. The continuing rise in support for right wing populist parties during the recession owes more to growing Euro-scepticism than to a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment.","[Hatton, Timothy J.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Hatton, Timothy J.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Hatton, Timothy J.] CEPR, London, England",University of Essex; Australian National University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.;Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.;Hatton, TJ (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",,,,,,,,70,66,74,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

More specifically, in addition to the declines in tariffs, we investigate the impact on imports of the gradual removal of non-tariff barriers (NTBs) as agreed within the WTO's accession protocol in 2001 (such as import quotas, licenses and tendering requirements). We document that while manufacturing imports mainly increase because of tariff cuts, agricultural imports grow due to the elimination of import licenses. However, we provide evidence that quota elimination is associated with a redistribution of imports along a larger range of countries, whereas tendering liberalization is connected to an import reallocation from OECD to non-OECD countries. Finally, we also find that MT protection is complementary to tariff protection and discriminating against foreign-owned manufacturing firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Under standard preferences, the value of life may rise faster than consumption, leading society to value safety over consumption growth.

In comparison with the major R&D countries, benefits attributable to spillovers are found to be more sizable for the rest of the OECD countries. This result is consistent with the observed convergence of competitiveness between the two groups of countries during 1990-2009. Moreover, our empirical results suggest China's trade-related spillovers can produce both positive and negative effects on OECD countries' industrial competitiveness. The persistence of the spillover effects is found even after controlling for trade openness creating possible spurious association. Finally, our finding TFP growth as the competitiveness driver stresses the consequential role of STI (science, technology, and innovation) policies in supporting sustainable and balanced growth.

The authors apply the dynamic Olley-Pakes decomposition with entry and exit proposed by Melitz and Polanec (Dynamic Olley-Pakes Productivity Decomposition with Entry and Exit, 2015), which allows them to decompose the change in aggregate productivity into contributions of surviving firms, entering firms and exiting firms. The study shows that in China, the combined contribution of the three components capturing reallocation amounts to almost half of the change in aggregate productivity. The between-firm market reallocation is found to contribute the most among the three components, followed by the exit of inefficient producers. It also shows that the aggregate productivity growth generated by the dynamics of exporting firms in foreign markets varies according to ownership, location and industry. More specifically, the data suggest that private firms, firms situated in the eastern region of China and firms from high-concentration industries provide a higher contribution to the growth of aggregate productivity.","[Huang, Xiaobing] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Gannan, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaolian] Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Tourism & Hist, Gannan, Jiangxi, Peoples R China",Gannan Normal University; Gannan Normal University,"Huang, XB (通讯作者)，Gannan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Gannan, Jiangxi, Peoples R China.",huangxiaobing1234@126.com,"zhang, shuai/IVU-7877-2023; XIONG, LIU/JOK-5886-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023",,,,,,30,0,0,0,21,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 22,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,20168.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-8,0.0,,,31,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7HE,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372962500001,0

Results indicate that Japan generated 43 million metric tons (or 0.3%, with a 95% confidence interval) of additional CO2 emissions in 2011 following the earthquake. The increase in CO2 emissions stemmed from the combined effects of decreased electricity consumption due to energy conservation efforts and the substitution of fossil fuels for nuclear power following the Tohoku Earthquake. Results also show considerable spatial variation in the impacts of the earthquake on net CO2 emissions. A majority of the prefectures (40 of 47 prefectures, or 85%) were predicted to experience higher CO2 emissions after the Tohoku Earthquake while the remaining (7 prefectures) were predicted to experience lower CO2 emissions. Our findings suggest that Japan and countries under similar risks may want to reformulate energy policy by emphasizing utilization of diverse power and energy sources, including more renewable energy production and electricity conservation. The policy reform should also consider spatial variation in the combined effects of reduced reliance on nuclear power and increased CO2 conversion factors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We simulate an occupational choice model with heterogeneous agents in entrepreneurial ability.

Specifically, the expected income loss from excluding 5 percent of women is 2.5 percent, while the loss is 10 percent if they are all employers. We find that gender gaps cause an average income loss of 15 percent in the OECD, 40 percent of which is due to entrepreneurship gaps.

Our main goal is to investigate whether high-frequency trading exacerbates market volatility and generates flash crashes. In the model, low-frequency agents adopt trading rules based on chronological time and can switch between fundamentalist and chartist strategies. By contrast, high-frequency traders activation is event-driven and depends on price fluctuations. High-frequency traders use directional strategies to exploit market information produced by low-frequency traders. Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that the model replicates the main stylized facts of financial markets. Furthermore, we find that the presence of high-frequency traders increases market volatility and plays a fundamental role in the generation of flash crashes. The emergence of flash crashes is explained by two salient characteristics of high-frequency traders, i.e., their ability to i. generate high bid-ask spreads and ii. synchronize on the sell side of the limit order book. Finally, we find that higher rates of order cancellation by high-frequency traders increase the incidence of flash crashes but reduce their duration.","[Leal, Sandrine Jacob] CEREFIGE ICN Business Sch, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France; [Napoletano, Mauro] SKEMA Business Sch, OFCE, 60 Rue Dostoievski, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Napoletano, Mauro; Roventini, Andrea; Fagiolo, Giorgio] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Ist Econ, Piazza Martiri Liberta 33, I-56127 Pisa, Italy; [Roventini, Andrea] OFCE, Sophia Antipolis, France",Universite de Lorraine; SKEMA Business School; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Leal, SJ (通讯作者)，CEREFIGE ICN Business Sch, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France.",sandrine.jacob-leal@icn-groupe.fr; mauro.napoletano@sciencespo.fr; aroventini@sssup.it; giorgio.fagiolo@sssup.it,"Fagiolo, Giorgio/HGB-6892-2022; Fagiolo, Giorgio/AAI-6807-2021; Roventini, Andrea/K-3314-2017; ROVENTINI, Andrea/N-4699-2019","Fagiolo, Giorgio/0000-0001-5355-3352; Roventini, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; ROVENTINI, Andrea/0000-0001-5518-3084; Napoletano, Mauro/0000-0002-8128-6674",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) [220],Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),"We are grateful to Sylvain Barde, Francesca Chiaromonte, Jean-Luc Gaffard, Nobi Hanaki, Alan Kirman, Fabrizio Lillo, FrankWesterhoff, and two anonymous referees for stimulating comments and fruitful discussions.

Due to the endogeneity problem among the variables of interest, as indicated by the findings from the Granger Causality test, weak exogeneity test, and Directed Acyclic Graphs, the use of the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method was deemed appropriate. The SUR model demonstrated that there was low level of substitutability among fossil fuels, but the small magnitude of the estimated coefficient indicates that natural gas, oil, and coal are more properly classified as independent goods than as substitutes of each other within the US market. Income elasticities for all three fossil fuels indicate that they are normal goods. Several external shocks have significant impact on demand for each of the fossil fuels. Slightly lower explanatory power of oil demand equation may be explained with the fact that the model did not include US oil imports although the US economy has been dependent, to some degree, on imported oil.

Our analysis specifically focuses on Brazilian producers' supply responses, consumers' driving demand and fuel choice, ethanol trade, land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and social welfare. The model results show that (i) under a low ethanol blending rate, conventional vehicles would be driven significantly less while flex-fuel and ethanol-dedicated vehicles would not be affected significantly; (ii) lowering the fuel taxes adversely affects the competitiveness of sugarcane ethanol against gasoline blends, thus lowering producers' surplus; and (iii) while a reduction in fuel taxes is advantageous in terms of overall social welfare, it has serious environmental impacts by increasing the GHG emissions from transportation fuels consumed in Brazil.

The hump-shaped relationship between industrialization (measured by employment or output shares) and incomes has shifted downwards and moved closer to the origin. This means countries are running out of industrialization opportunities sooner and at much lower levels of income compared to the experience of early industrializers. Asian countries and manufactures exporters have been largely insulated from those trends, while Latin American countries have been especially hard hit. Advanced economies have lost considerable employment (especially of the low-skill type), but they have done surprisingly well in terms of manufacturing output shares at constant prices. While these trends are not very recent, the evidence suggests both globalization and labor-saving technological progress in manufacturing have been behind these developments.

This provides evidence that statistical arbitrage is entirely feasible at the time, and it is plausible that a significant portion of the trading volume in 1999 is due to high-frequency trading.","[Anderson, Bing] Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Finance Area, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA",California State University System; California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo,"Anderson, B (通讯作者)，Calif Polytech State Univ San Luis Obispo, Orfalea Coll Business, Finance Area, San Luis Obispo, CA 93407 USA.",bianders@calpoly.edu,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

To rationalize these stylized facts, we build a quantitative sovereign debt model that incorporates preemptive and post-default renegotiations.

Also, the persistence itself, measured in terms of the differencing parameter is relevant, with orders of integration in the series found to be positive though smaller than 1 and thus implying mean reversion.

We study randomized lotteries for access to the New York City (NYC) Summer Youth Employment Program (SYEP), the largest summer youth employment program in the United States, by merging SYEP administrative data on 294,100 lottery participants to IRS data on the universe of U.S. tax records; to New York State administrative incarceration data; and to NYC administrative cause of death data. In assessing the three rationales, we find that (i) SYEP participation causes average earnings and the probability of employment to increase in the year of program participation, with modest contemporaneous crowdout of other earnings and employment; (ii) SYEP participation causes a modest decrease in average earnings for three years following the program and has no impact on college enrollment; and (iii) SYEP participation decreases the probability of incarceration and decreases the probability of mortality, which has important and potentially pivotal implications for analyzing the net benefits of the program.","[Gelber, Alexander] Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC USA; Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research; United States Department of the Treasury; University of Pennsylvania,"Gelber, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Goldman Sch Publ Policy, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",,,,Human Resources Center at the Wharton School; UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment; CGIF,Human Resources Center at the Wharton School; UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment; CGIF,"We thank the Human Resources Center at the Wharton School and the UC Berkeley Institute for Research on Labor and Employment and CGIF for financial support.

Two drawbacks of these models have, however, been underlined in the literature: first, the models do not usually converge to their normal rate of capacity utilization; second, the models do not include the Harrodian principle of dynamic instability. Some Sraffian economists have long been arguing that the presence of non-capacity creating autonomous expenditures provides a mechanism that brings back the model to normal rates of capacity utilization, while safeguarding the main Keynesian message and without going back to classical conclusions. The present article provides a very simple proof of this, showing within a neo-Kaleckian model that the Harrodian principle of dynamic instability gets tamed by the presence of autonomous consumer expenditures.","[Lavoie, Marc] Univ Ottawa, Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa,"Lavoie, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",mlavoie@uottawa.ca,,,INET,INET,"This article has been presented at the Keynesian Summer School in Berlin in July 2013, at the IMK Berlin conference in October 2013, at an INET-sponsored workshop at the Fields Institute in Toronto in November 2013, and at a seminar at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in December 2014.

First, the evidence ensures significant information transmission between equity-related uncertainty and the oil price, and shows remarkable differences in transmission patterns before and after the crisis. Second, the results show that exogenous shocks can intensify information transmission between oil prices and uncertainty in terms of both the mean and volatility spillover effects.

Agricultural producers in transition economies face an additional risk factor - changes in the institutional protection of property rights. This paper illustrates how institutional uncertainty may affect investment, land use, and crop mix patterns. In particular, in the Ukrainian example, the rights of tenants are viewed as uncertain in anticipation of establishment of an open market for sale of agricultural land. Establishment of the land market in Ukraine has been postponed several times over the last 15 years and a significant number of lease contracts are not formalized. A large panel of farm-level data was used to show that a higher share of rented land is associated with a lower share of land used for investment intensive perennial crops controlling for prices and other factors. The difference in response to uncertainty is found to be significant among three crop types: perennials, grains and oil crops. The implication is that the lower level of protection of use rights and uncertainty regarding the future regulation of land sales market lead to under-investments in more capital intensive crops. As a result, tenants deviate from the optimal crop mix, reducing the productivity of tenant farms. Farms under 200 ha are affected most negatively as they are less likely to be able to access the level of legal and political protection enjoyed by large farms.

Our results indicate that the welfare effects of capital market integration differ depending on whether governments are active or passive in attracting capital. In the absence of active governments, capital market integration benefits the country with a competitive labour market whereas it harms the unionized country.

TFP data refer to 2008. The empirical setting is based on the multilevel modeling which provides two main results. Firstly, we show that TFP heterogeneity is largely due to firm-specific features (85% of TFP variability in the empty model). Interestingly, we find that some key-drivers of firm performance (size, family management, group membership, innovations and human capital) are significantly related to TFP, but do not, on the whole, absorb much of firm TFP variance, implying that differences in productivity are due to notable yet unobservable firm characteristics. Secondly, as far the role of localization is concerned, we demonstrate that the country effect is more influential than region effect in explaining individual productivity. Net of the country effect, the localization in different European regions explains about 5% of TFP firm heterogeneity. When considering the case of three individual countries, France, Italy and Spain, location in different regions explains 5.3% of TFP heterogeneity in Italy, while this proportion is lower (3.6%) in France and higher (9.9%) in Spain.","[Aiello, Francesco; Ricotta, Fernanda] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy",University of Calabria,"Aiello, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Cosenza, Italy.",francesco.aiello@unical.it,"Aiello, Francesco/J-1252-2014","Aiello, Francesco/0000-0001-7533-4927",,,,,81,18,20,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

In the paper, the factors affecting capital structure is examined by testing 77 Turkish manufacturing firms traded on Borsa Istanbul, with 308 observations from 2010 to 2013. Non-manufacturing firms were not included in the study since their incentives are different compared to manufacturing firms. In the paper, different levels of leverage are employed as proxies for capital structure. Using Leverage (LEV) and Debt to Equity (DE) as proxies for capital structure (leverage) on panel data analysis, the significant relationship is found between independent variables used in models and capital structure. Size, profitability, tangibility, growth opportunity, equity turnover, dividend paying and maturity are used as the firm's specific variables that affect a firm's capital structure decision. In addition, Altman's-Z score is employed as proxy for bankruptcy risk. Empirical results present that there are significant relationships between firm's specific variables and capital structure, except equity turnover. The coefficients of bankruptcy risk as measured by Altman Z score for all models are negative and significant. General evaluation suggests that the obtained results conform to the trade off theory better than the pecking-order theory.","[Akpinar, Onur] Kocaeli Univ, Sch Tourism & Hotel Management, Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Akpinar, O (通讯作者)，Kocaeli Univ, Sch Tourism & Hotel Management, Kocaeli, Turkey.",onur.akpinar@yahoo.com,"AKPINAR, ONUR/F-7691-2018","AKPINAR, ONUR/0000-0003-1899-5395",,,,,24,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,527,534,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100055,0

We compare acquisitions undertaken during financial crises so called fire-sale FDI with acquisitions made during non-crisis periods to examine whether the outcomes differ in the ways predicted by the model. Foreign acquisitions are driven by two sources of value creation. First, acquisitions by a foreign firm relax the target's credit constraint (i.e., a liquidity motive). Second, acquisitions exploit operational synergies between the target and the acquirer (i.e., a synergistic motive). During crises credit conditions tighten in the target economy and the liquidity motive dominates. The model predicts that during crisis relative to non-crisis periods, (1) the likelihood of foreign acquisitions is higher; (2) the proportion of foreign acquisitions in the same industry is lower; (3) the average size of ownership stakes is lower; and (4) the duration of acquisitions is lower (i.e., acquisition stakes are more likely to be flipped). We find support for (1) but not for the other three predictions. The results thus suggest that foreign acquisitions in emerging markets do not differ in these important ways between crisis and normal periods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis was performed on individual data on ca 36% of all employees in the Czech Republic. The results showed significant increase of returns to white-collar occupation and a decrease of returns to education during the years 2008 - 2014.

Although sporadic, recent theoretical and empirical studies reveal that researchers of consumer behaviour should also place considerable attention on the analysis of issues related to consumer irrationality. In order to disclose the expression of consumer irrationality in decision-making related to purchasing and consumption, scenarios associated with price perception were chosen for analysis in this paper allowing determination of a possible economically rational decision and a comparison with decisions made by consumers thereof. Theoretically sound assumptions in relation to consumer irrationality expression in the context of price perception and relations with consumer behaviour were tested on fast-moving consumption goods (FMCG). In the study of experimental scenarios, the authors of the paper analysed 8 assumptions related to irrationality expression in the context of price perception. In the case of FMCG, 6 assumptions were confirmed as significant from the perspective of irrational price perception, of which 5 were at the company level and 1 at the consumer level. In order to reveal possible relations between irrational price perception and consumer behaviour, a survey of experiment participants was performed. The results demonstrated a significant relation between these variables in terms of all the assumptions confirmed during the experiment.","[Banyte, Jurate; Rutelione, Ausra; Gadeikiene, Agne; Belkeviciute, Justina] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Banyte, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurate.banyte@ktu.lt; ausra.rutelione@ktu.lt; agne.gadeikiene@ktu.lt; justina.belkeviciute@gmail.com,"Gadeikienė, Agnė/AAV-1568-2020","Gadeikienė, Agnė/0000-0001-7719-4980",,,,,26,2,3,8,28,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Real estate prices can be volatile in the short run, and therefore, investors need to hedge themselves to avoid negative returns. This problem is due to the systematic and unsystematic components of real estate risk. Systematic risk refers to risk that applies to all similar properties, while unsystematic risk refers to risk that applies only to the property that needs to be hedged. The systematic component of real estate risk can be mitigated by proper use of real estate derivatives, such as forwards, futures, options and swaps. These are instruments whose underlying asset is the index, which is composed of real estate in the region with a similar purpose as the property being hedged. This study examines some of the major benefits and difficulties of using real estate derivatives for hedging real estate, using data from the U.S. commercial real estate market, such as those from Ishares U.S. Real Estate Exchange Traded Fund, General Growth Properties Inc., Simon Property Group Inc., The Macerich Company, and Vornado Realty Trust. The daily data are from the period June 19, 2000 and August 24, 2015, with 3,820 pieces of information for each variable.

In addition, there is a gap in the development of creative industries within a country, mainly due to the fact that this kind of industry is exclusively urban ie. related to the city. In the broadest sense, the creative industries include all individuals / organizations that on the basis of creativity as the main input participate in the process of creating a new market value.

A methodological issue addressed in the paper is the specification of the supply of agricultural land in the face of restrictions over its availability, as arises under REDD. By giving magnitudes to the effects of REDD and RED, our simulations provide a defense against environmental skeptics who, in the absence of such estimates, can dismiss these policies as being exorbitantly expensive. Although REDO and RED are in tension with respect to land use, the paper shows that they could be implemented simultaneously without significant global problems for food supply. The paper does however pinpoint some regional problems. Implementation of RED and REDD would cause large increases in food prices in Indonesia and Southern Africa. The methodology used in this paper, if implemented at a more detailed level, could be the basis of working out compensation packages that would be needed to make pervasive RED and REDD policies politically feasible.

The phenomenon of growth of institutional investors is especially important for capital markets in CEE transition countries, including the Republic of Croatia. The goal of this paper is to test the impulse of non-bank financial intermediaries' development, and also the influence of implementing the above-mentioned structure reform on capital markets development in the selected transition countries. By applying a panel data approach on a sample of six CEE countries over the period between 1995 and 2010, we provide further evidence on the specific determinants of emerging European capital markets.","[Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Kusanovic, Tino] Univ Split, Dept Profess Studies, Split, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Split,"Drazenovic, BO (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",bolgic@inet.hr,"Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018","Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/0000-0002-5175-7439",Croatian Science Foundation [IP-2013-11-8174]; University of Rijeka [13.02.1.2.02],Croatian Science Foundation; University of Rijeka,This work was supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project [number IP-2013-11-8174] and by the University of Rijeka under a project [number 13.02.1.2.02].,,29,15,15,2,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We exploit a natural experiment that took place in France in 1983, when the tax administration tightened the requirements to claim charitable deductions. The reform led to a substantial drop in the amount of contributions reported to the administration, which can be credibly attributed to overreporting of charitable contributions before the reform, rather than to a real change in giving behaviors. We show that the reform was also associated with a substantial decline in the absolute value of the elasticity of reported contributions. This finding allows us to partially identify the elasticity of overreporting contributions, which is shown to be large and inferior to 2 in the lax enforcement regime. We further show using bunching of taxpayers at kink-points of the tax schedule that the elasticity of taxable income also experienced a significant decline after the reform. Our results suggest that failure to account for the effect of tax enforcement on both the magnitude and the anatomy of the elasticity of the tax base with respect to the net of tax rate can lead to misleading policy conclusions, both for the global optimal tax rate (when all policy instruments are optimized) and the local optimal tax rate (conditional on all other policy instruments staying at their status quo levels, potentially away from the optimum).

Exploiting a latent threshold modeling strategy that induces time-varying shrinkage of the parameters, we explore a recursive identification switching with a time-varying overidentification for the interest rate zero lower bound. We empirically analyze Japan's monetary policy to illustrate the proposed approach for modeling regime-switching between conventional and unconventional monetary policy periods, and find that the proposed model is preferred over a nested standard time-varying parameter VAR model. The estimation results show that increasing bank reserves lowers long-term interest rates in the unconventional policy periods, and that the impulse responses of inflation and the output gap to a bank reserve shock appear to be positive but highly uncertain.","[Nakajima, Jouchi] Bank Japan, Monetary Affairs Dept, Chuo Ku, Tokyo 1038660, Japan; [Kimura, Takeshi] Bank Japan, Monetary Affairs Dept, Tokyo 1038660, Japan",Bank of Japan; Bank of Japan,"Nakajima, J (通讯作者)，Bank Japan, Monetary Affairs Dept, Chuo Ku, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi,Hongokucho, Tokyo 1038660, Japan.",jouchi.nakajima@boj.or.jp,,,,,,,27,19,19,0,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

Analysing household consumption behaviour is very important due to the existence of linkages between consumption and development on the labour market and it is also particularly important in regard to population ageing, as Slovakia belongs to the group of EU Member States moving from the youngest population at present to the oldest ones in the future. Through identifying expenditure elasticities by employing the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System (QUAIDS) in the analysis of nine groups of consumer goods and services we were able to define what low and high income households consider luxury goods and necessity goods. The results suggest that the development of income inequalities in Slovakia is not fully traced by consumption inequalities and that the financial and economic crisis has played an important role in determining consumption inequalities between low and high income households.","[Konig, Brian] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Konig, Brian; Doval'ova, Gabriela] Inst Econ Res SAS, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia; [Doval'ova, Gabriela] Comenius Univ, Fac Law, Inst Econ Sci, Safarikovo Nam 6,POB 313, Bratislava 81000, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Slovak Academy of Sciences; Comenius University Bratislava,"König, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Econ Informat, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-B, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.;König, B (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Res SAS, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",brian.konig@savba.sk; gabriela.dovalova@savba.sk,,,"Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA [2/0181/15, 2/0026/15]",Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),"This work was supported by the Grant Agency of Slovak Republic - VEGA, Grant No. 2/0181/15 and No. 2/0026/15.",,24,3,3,0,10,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The most essential legal norm in the Slovak Republic focusing on the measurement is the Act No. 431/2002 Coll. on Accounting with the latest amendments. The Slovak Republic with its entry to the European Union has adopted and implemented not only the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union but as well the legal norms related to the accounting which is fully in accordance with the directives of the European Union and sequentially other articles of IFRS have been adopted. Biological assets which are used in agricultural activities are regulated in the individual accounting standard IAS 41 Agriculture.

We deal with approaches based on chaos theory and we focus on nonlinear prediction. The goal of this paper is to analyse the gross domestic product (GDP) and to find chaos in the GDP growth rate time series. At the beginning of our analysis we must deal with the fundamental question regarding the existence of deterministic chaos. We estimated the time delay and the embedding dimension, which is needed for the Lyapunov exponent estimation and for the phase space reconstruction. Subsequently, we computed the largest Lyapunov exponent, which is one of the important indicators of chaos. The results indicated that chaotic behaviors obviously exist in GDP. If the system behaves chaotically, we are forced to accept limited predictions. Deterministic chaos, usually referred to simply as chaos, indicates presence of structure and often very complex order on a global scale but absence of these characteristics on a local scale. In general, chaotic processes can be characterized by irregular and long-telin unpredictable behavior, but this behavior is purely deterministic. Finally we computed predictions using a radial basis function to fit global nonlinear functions to the data.","[Kriz, Radko] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Jana Koziny 1237, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic",University of Hradec Kralove,"Kríz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Sci, Dept Math, Jana Koziny 1237, Hradec Kralove 50003, Czech Republic.",Radko.Kriz@uhk.cz,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1069,1076,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800133,0

The adverse side of such a migration lies in the loss of tax revenues from taxation of capital gains that occur when shifted assets are sold in new country, frequently low-tax jurisdiction. Original home country can prevent loss of tax revenues from taxation of capital gain by imposition of an exit tax. Despite rationale of exit tax its impact in globalized world might be controversial, as it represents barrier to free movement of capital and persons and freedom of establishment, which was mirrored especially in a number of controversial decisions of the CJ EU. This paper investigates presence of the exit tax in the OECD and EU Member States and focuses on the most problematic provision timing and possibility to defer payment of exit tax until the asset is sold which can soften adverse effect of exit tax on international movement of persons.

Similar countries are necessary for computing of counterfactual values, therefore the paper uses countries classified as hybrid regimes for most of the observed period according to several independent sources.

Power supply companies provide consumers the opportunity to purchase green electricity against a higher price, in order to level off both higher production costs from the renewables and boost their further development. Based on their free will, consumers may chose to be supplied with green energy among any utility company and being charged an additional amount for such products, thus contributing to the further use and the implementation of renewable energy sources in the power supply sector, as well as to consumer satisfaction. This paper aims to establish the features contributing to the consumer willingness to additionally pay for electricity obtained from renewables. Hence, it highlights the reasons behind the buyers' or households' readiness to using green electricity, which are found mainly in environmental concerns, altruistic attitudes and personal preferences. It should also be mentioned that consumers prefer electricity deriving from renewable resources, even when they know little about it. Higher education, environmental organisation affiliation and higher income levels are related to the greater willingness to additionally pay for a cleaner energy, since the latter is estimated to curb pollution induced by fossil fuels. Consumers may chose among the most convenient type of renewable resource in the output of green power as well as the amount of additional money to pay for the purchase of such energy. Although this paper presents the up-to-date situation in the research carried out by a number of authors, it may be regarded as the basis for further empiric research on the phenomenon of willingness to pay for green power in the Republic of Croatia.","[Maradin, Dario; Cerovic, Ljerka; Drazenovic, Bojana Olgic] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Maradin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",dmaradin@efri.hr; cerovic@efri.hr; bolgic@inet.hr,"Maradin, Dario/Q-9380-2018; Olgic Drazenovic, Bojana/R-4177-2018","Maradin, Dario/0000-0001-9642-6038;",,,,,22,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,655,663,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600066,0

Education and learning represent important constituents of personal development, leading to a more fulfilled life. Higher level of education is a necessary prerequisite for employment and economic growth. It is well-known that libraries are major centers of sources of knowledge. Public libraries should be the most important local place for acquiring knowledge. In addition, they are expected to facilitate, strengthen, and promote independent learning. Library divisions and services specialized for formal and informal learning should be equipped and organized so as to respond to the needs of a community, creating supportive conditions for lifelong learning. International research points to a prevailing use of information and communications technology in public libraries. Public library users use information and communications technology to find information needed for daily life, education, or business, and to engage in interpersonal communication and social networking. Therefore, the role of public library is considered to be important in increasing digital inclusion. Furthermore, it has been proven that digital inclusion involves personal benefits by enhancing employment prospects. This, in turn, entails increasing benefits for a community in terms of lowering costs and increasing profit. The aim of the present study is to establish the ways how public libraries in the Osijek-Baranya County contribute to the increase of digital inclusion in the local community. Additionally, it aims to point to potential needs for redesigning and repositioning existing libraries' programs and services so as to increase personal benefits of an individual user and the local community as a whole. The research findings shows how libraries in the Osijek-Baranya County get involved and what they do in order to increase the standards of digital inclusion in the local community. Furthermore, the research points to possible strengths or obstacles in fulfilling the goals of a more successful digital inclusion.

To do so, I propose a model of a frictional labor market where heterogeneous workers decide which job to look for and firms decide which technology to adopt. At equilibrium, there is perfect segmentation across sectors, which is determined by a unique threshold of workers' productivity. This threshold is inefficient because of participation and composition externalities. The Pigouvian tax scheme that decentralizes optimal sorting shows that these externalities have opposite signs. Furthermore, their relative strength depends on the distribution of workers' skills, so that when there are many (few) skilled workers, too many (few) high-technology jobs are created.","[Merlino, Luca Paolo] FRS FNRS, Molenbeek St Jean, Belgium; [Merlino, Luca Paolo] Univ Libre Bruxelles, SBSEM, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium",Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique - FNRS; Universite Libre de Bruxelles,"Merlino, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, SBSEM, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",lmerlino@ulb.ac.be,"Merlino, Luca Paolo/S-7861-2017; Merlino, Luca/AAA-4942-2022","Merlino, Luca Paolo/0000-0003-0484-1539; Merlino, Luca/0000-0003-0484-1539","Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ2005-01481/ECON]; FEDER; National Bank of Belgium; ERC [208535]; Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs-, und Technologiefonds (WWTF) [MA 09-017]; European Research Council (ERC) [208535] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); National Bank of Belgium; ERC(European Research Council (ERC)); Wiener Wissenschafts-, Forschungs-, und Technologiefonds (WWTF); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","I would like to thank the associate editor and four anonymous referees, whose comments dramatically improved this paper; Antoni Calvo Armengol (who passed away in November 2007; his energy and support are sorely missed), Melvyn Coles, Jordi Masso, Yves Zenou, and Marcel Jansen for help and guidance; Jan Eeckhout, Matteo Luciani, Marco Giani, Caterina Calsamiglia, Emiliano Carluccio, and participants in the Microeconomic Workshop at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, 4th European Macroeconomics Workshop, and Econometric Society Summer Meeting 2008 for their helpful comments.

International trade realised on the principle of absolute and comparative advantages increases the economic prosperity of national economies because the gains of the winners exceed the losses of the losers regardless of whether or not the economy is exporting or importing. A comparison of the gains and losses from trade shows the theoretical possibility of compensation for the losers by those who gained. In practice, compensation from international trade is rare. For this reason, opening up a market to international trade is an act that raises the economic welfare of some to the detriment of others. The reactions to the loss of welfare of one of the involved parties are obstacles to international trade, for example in the fowl of tariffs and quotas. When analyzing the economic welfare of buyers and sellers on the market, economists often use two tools: the consumer surplus and producer surplus. This paper is an assessment of how the process of globalization in relation with an increased competition affects the growth or decline in consumer surplus and producer surplus and in which way globalization can reduce and strengthen trade restrictions.","[Novy, Milos] Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Novy, M (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fak Ekon, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",novym@kem.zeu.cz,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1563,1570,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800193,0

Results of the financial health assessment are affected by values in the financial statements. Creative accounting can lead to distortion of these values. Additionally, the success of models is also not absolute and it may happen that the result of this assessment will affect negatively the decision of investors, owners and other users of this information. Due to globalization, the International Financial Reporting Standards are used as the accounting system. This accounting system has some advantages in the financial health assessment compared with Czech regulations. Differences in accounting of subsidies, the valuation at fair value, or the classification of biological assets in fixed assets reduce the using of creative accounting compared with our system. Thu, financial statements are not affected so much. In this paper, models IN05, Guroik index, CH -index and 'Rezbova OP model' for the Operational Programme Rural Development are evaluated. The absolute and relative indicators that are most correlated with the actual position of the company, are identified. According to a summary the most important seems to be EBIT and cash flow.

I combine data on literacy rates of administrative districts from the colonial censuses of Nigeria and Ghana from the 1950s with data on slave exports of different ethnic groups. I find a negative and significant relationship between slave export intensity before the colonial era and literacy rates during the colonial era. I also use contemporary data on literacy rates to show that this negative relationship is still present and significant.

The analysis distinguishes between industrial and agricultural trade to take into account the different liberalization schedules. An augmented gravity model is estimated using up-to-date panel data techniques to control for all time-invariant bilateral factors that influence bilateral trade as well as for the so-called multilateral resistance factors. We also control for the endogeneity of the agreements and test for self-selection bias due to the presence of zero trade in our sample. The main findings indicate that North-South-FTAs and South-South-FTAs have a differential impact in terms of increasing trade in MENA countries, with the former being more beneficial in terms of exports for MENA countries, but both showing greater global market integration. We also find that FTAs that include agricultural products, in which MENA countries have a clear comparative advantage, have more favourable effects for these countries than those only including industrial products.","[Parra, M.

One of the factors influencing attendance numbers may be the tallying of repeat visitors. A correlation analysis, which we use as a test of first instance, revealed a statistically significant dependence on the number of visitors to exhibitions and expositions, which may indicate a potential risk of the manipulation of attendance data.","[Pucek, Milan] Natl Museum Agr, Kostelni 44, Prague, Czech Republic; [Placek, Michal] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo Nabrezi 6, Prague, Czech Republic",National Museum of Agriculture; Charles University Prague,"Pucek, M (通讯作者)，Natl Museum Agr, Kostelni 44, Prague, Czech Republic.",milan.pucek@seznam.cz; michalplacek@seznam.cz,"Pucek, Milan Jan/F-3478-2012",,,,,,14,1,1,1,6,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,1040,1046,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-134,0.0,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500135,0

The C-GEM is a global computable equilibrium model that includes energy and economic data provided by China's statistical agencies, calibration of savings, labor productivity, and capital productivity dynamics specific to China's stage of development, and regional aggregation that resolves China's major trading partners. We analyze the combined impact of extending CO2 intensity targets, implemented via a cap-and-trade program, and low carbon energy policies (directives for nuclear power expansion and feed-in tariffs for wind, solar, and biomass energy) through 2050. Although with the policy, simulated CO2 emissions are around 43% lower in 2050 relative to a reference (No Policy) counterfactual, China's CO2 emissions still increase by over 60% between 2010 and 2050. Curbing the rise in China's CO2 emissions will require fully implementing a CO2 price, which will need to rise to levels higher than $25/ton in order to achieve China's stated goal of peaking CO2 emissions by 2030.

The speeding up of the pace of life is probably the most striking impact of all impacts influencing consumer behaviour. It is our everyday experience that we are bombarded with an ever faster flow of information, we travel, eat and shop faster and faster, and so changing consumer needs must be addressed faster and faster by touristic product development, as rapidly consuming tourists expect different advantages of the supply than they did before. The intensification of trends always leads to counter trends, as people cannot stand continuous pressing of time and take a refugee in slowing down (Torocsik 2006). Typical reactions to the stress of time are getting off temporarily or even conscious, final slowing down. Signs of this include wanting homeliness instead of increased mobility; activities giving emotional experiences, instead of chasing achievements; support of local values vs. global ones; search for belonging to a community vs. individualism; new asceticism vs. hedonism - looking for the authentic, instead of the packaged experiences of the tourism sector. These lead to the appearance of a new form of tourism: slow tourism, besides traditional (mass) tourism. Slow tourism is an emerging market segment within the tourism industry that is forecasted to grow annually 10% at least in the coming years. Together with other forms of alternative tourism - ecotourism, sustainable tourism - it allows places unknown for, or forgotten long ago by tourists to become destinations again; this way slow tourism may even be a significant factor in territorial development. Slow tourism can be analysed with two approaches. In the first concept it has three main pillars: doing things at the right speed; changing the attitude towards speed; and seeking quality over quantity. In the other approach slow tourism has two basic components: spending a longer time in one place (which contradicts today's tourism trends, the growing frequency and shortening individual duration of travels) and visiting attractions closer to the place of residence. Different motivations can make tourists become slow tourists. Inspirations include the motivations of the environment and health conscious LOHAS (Lifes of Health and Sustainability) group (Helmke et al 2016, Torocsik 2007) - consciously avoid individual travel with higher carbon footprint, as well as flights, and choose alternative means of travel, or public transportation -, and the intensification of the experience, the depth of involvement (more time, more in-depth experiences, closer touch with the local community). In addition to keeping in touch with the local community, the target audience of slow tourism prefers locally gown and produced foods, which may have considerable local economic and community development impacts and environmental benefits, contributing thereby to making the whole of the tourism sector more sustainable. The authors of the paper identify factors that distinguish fast and slow tourism, and elements of consumer behaviour that must be addressed both in product development and communication at different types of the supply. They also look at what tourism trends support this sort of planning attitude","[Raffay, Zoltan; Torocsik, Maria; Gerdesics, Viktoria] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Inst Mkt & Tourism, Rakoczi Ut 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary",University of Pecs,"Raffay, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, Inst Mkt & Tourism, Rakoczi Ut 80, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary.",raffayz@ktk.pte.hu; torocsik@ktk.pte.hu; gerdesics@ktk.pte.hu,,,,,,,14,1,1,1,16,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,288,297,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600028,0

One of the fundamental conditions for uprising competitive adventage and improvement of economy of particular regions and economy of Croatia in the territory of the European Union are human resources which by their work and efforts create prosperity and sustainable development. Croatian Eastern region represents a great potential for development of economy but she is affected by a high unemployment rate which is a consequence of globalization and economic crisis which strucked Croatian economy in 2008. The roots of problems date back into nineties when Croatia has been hit by war which brought a large stagnation of economy which slowed growth and development. One of the counties of Eastern region is Virovitica county which directs its efforts into uprising and improvement of professional competences young, unemployd and inactive people. By continuous upgrading of development human resources ability of region is recognized by adapting to the market. Aware of the fact that the human capital provides uprising, Virovitica county is encouraging uprising of entrepreneurship and promotes lifelong education but simultaneously pays attention on the balance in private and business life. The point of this paper is indicate on the importance of the development of underdeveloped regions. The key factor of successful development of economy and society in general is highly skilled workforce which directs all odtheir competences to positive progress. Furthermore, by analysis will be determined methodes and results of impacts and measures for self-employed young, unemployd and inactive people which are manifested in increasing nubmer of self-employed people, reduction of unemployment in mentioned groups, in increasing number of programs for employment.

The first question is, how to actually specify what the aim of the social market economy, which was newly added to the Lisbon Threaty as a part of Article 3, means. As a basis, we turn to the original definitions of the term social market economy, which were established in the 50s of the 20th century. Consequently, we analyze, how the definitions evolved up to the present. In the globalized environment, this concept exhibits new expanding features. Based on this broadened definition we can then attempt to answer the second question what policy measures are suitable for sustaining the social market economy model. Completing the institutional architecture of the EU or the Eurozone would restore the ability of the fiscal policy in all countries to act anti cyclically, and that at the time of economic downturn to dampen fluctuations in employment and economic activity, which in the current institutional arrangement is made difficult precisely because of the centralization of the monetary policy and the lack of its usual supplements at a European level. The conclusions were achieved by using the latest sources of economic policy theory and optimum currency area theory in particular.","[Saroch, Stanislav; Smejkal, Vaclav] SKODA AUTO Univ, Na Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic",Skoda Auto University,"Saroch, S (通讯作者)，SKODA AUTO Univ, Na Karmeli 1457, Mlada Boleslav 29301, Czech Republic.",stanislav.saroch@savs.cz; vaclav.smejkal@savs.cz,,,Czech Science Foundation [14-23623S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"This study was prepared under the project of Czech Science Foundation, project registration number 14-23623S.",,23,2,2,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1946,1955,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800242,0

A preliminary data analysis reveals that, in Saudi Arabia, the relative consumption of beef, chicken and fish has a positive growth, while lamb has a negative growth. The average relative price growth rates of beef, chicken and fish are negative, while that of lamb is positive. The expenditure shares of beef, chicken and fish have increased while that of lamb has fallen. The estimation results of the demand system reveal that there is an autonomous trend out of lamb into beef, chicken and fish. The implied income elasticities indicate that beef, lamb and fish are considered to be luxuries, while chicken is a necessity. The demand for all meat products and fish are price inelastic. These elasticities are key inputs for policy analysts in terms of devising policies in relation to meat production, meat imports, taxation and food security issues in Saudi Arabia. The usefulness of the implied elasticities is demonstrated by simulating the consumption of beef, chicken, lamb and fish under various policy scenarios.","[Selvanathan, Saroja; Selvanathan, E.

The findings show that executives of banks with a controlling shareholder and a greater number of independent board members on their remuneration committees are paid above the average for the sample.

Moreover, the Czech Republic can also face outflow of tax bases of the parent companies.","[Solilova, Veronika; Nerudova, Danuse] Mendel Univ Bmo, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Solilová, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Bmo, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ritve@email.cz; d.nerudova@seznam.cz,"Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012; Solilova, Veronika/U-1720-2017","Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107; Solilova, Veronika/0000-0002-9122-539X",project GA CR [13-21683S],project GA CR,The paper presents the results of the research within the project GA CR No. 13-21683S The quantification of the impact of the introduction of Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base on the budget revenues in the Czech Republic.,,28,6,6,0,7,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

The effort of researchers leads to a prediction model with high prediction level, that is either able to predict a bankruptcy of companies or can, with some probability level, classify the companies into a group of failed or a group of non-failed ones. Prediction models used for failure prediction are derived by using various multivariate statistical methods. Often used methods are for example: multivariate discriminant analysis, logistic regression, classification trees, or in the last years, method of neural networks came to the fore. In the article we provide a closer view of these frequently used statistical methods and analyze their advantages and disadvantages in terms of data requirements. Some of the often used methods require the fulfilment of several assumptions, so we will focus on these assumptions, the way they can be tested and possible modification of data in case that some assumption of the method is not met. Proper use of the statistical methods consequently ensures correct using of statistical tools and will lead to creation of a strongly predictive model with statistically significant level of bankruptcy prediction.","[Svabova, Lucia] Univ Zilina, Dept Econ, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Durica, Marek] Univ Zilina, Dept Quantitat Methods & Econ Informat, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Svabova, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Econ, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",lucia.svabova@fpedas.uniza.sk; marek.durica@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Durica, Marek/P-7170-2015; Svabova, Lucia/P-7174-2015","Durica, Marek/0000-0002-2118-166X; Svabova, Lucia/0000-0002-4722-4103",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency - Grant NO.

The findings and implications are important as these companies are expected to be the leading adopters of IAS/IFRS. Firstly, we determined that firms do not implement all IAS/IFRS (international accounting standards/international financial reporting standards) equally; some are used more, some less. As a second stage in the study, we tried to determine what firm characteristics impact compliance with IAS/IFRS.

One of the Long -term issues in comparison the other economic activities is the staff turnover. Based on the axioms of uniqueness of each employee we assume that the causes of departure and remaining in work are different. This is the reason for carrying out researches, which with the correct interpretation are moving forward the scientific knowledge and also have the practical significance. The aim of this paper is to present the views of experts on the causes of employee turnover and clarify the reasons of why employees leave the hotels. In order to achieve the goal of this paper, the survey of employee turnover in selected hotels in Slovakia was conducted. The survey verifies the assumption that by the understanding of the causes of employee turnover it is possible to effectively create an environment that supports the stabilization of the key and competent employees. The result of sociological questioning is the diagnoses of processes that contribute to the stabilization of employees the most.

Before 1960, children from larger families obtained more education, in large part because they had richer and more educated parents. By century's end, these patterns had reversed. Consequently, fertility differentials by income and education historically raised the average education of the next generation, but they now reduce it. Relative to the level of average education, the positive effect of differential fertility in the past exceeded its negative effect in the present. While the reversal of differential fertility is unrelated to changes in GDP per capita, women's work, sectoral composition, or health, roughly half is attributable to rising aggregate education in the parents' generation. The data are consistent with a model in which fertility has a hump-shaped relationship with parental skill, due to a corner solution in which low-skill parents forgo investment in their children. As the returns to child investment rise, the peak of the relationship shifts to the left, reversing the associations under study.","[Vogl, Tom S.] Princeton Univ, NBER, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Vogl, Tom S.] BREAD, St Louis, MO USA",Princeton University; National Bureau of Economic Research,,,,,,,,,79,46,51,9,63,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Gains in adult longevity induce agents to decrease fertility, invest in education, and achieve higher income in order to save more for retirement. Even if working life is shortened by early retirement, this mechanism works as long as adult longevity increases sufficiently. Our model can explain the positive effect of life expectancy on education without contradicting the fact that working life length has not substantially increased, because of retirement.

It offers a periodisation of Ukraine's economic policy since its independence in 1991, suggesting that Ukraine has seen three periods of significant reform and this is by far the most important. The main cause of Ukraine's current economic decline is Russian warfare. The present situation differs greatly from that after the Orange Revolution in late 2004. These reform efforts are more far-reaching than earlier attempts, especially in the energy and banking sectors. Finally, four risks to the present reform wave are discussed. The four big risks to this reform wave lie in Russian warfare, insufficient international funding, lagging reforms in the judicial sector, and the wearing out of the coalition because of economic hardship.","[Aslund, Anders] Atlantic Council, Washington, DC USA",,"Åslund, A (通讯作者)，Atlantic Council, Washington, DC USA.",AAslund@atlantic-council.org,,,,,,,18,1,1,0,10,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

However, the extent to which they achieve beneficial outcomes in practice will turn on the manner in which the new rules are drafted and the approach taken to their enforcement.","[Beaton-Wells, Caron] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Beaton-Wells, C (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",c.beaton-wells@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-9018,1467-8462,,AUST ECON REV,Aust.

In this paper, we propose a solution to effectively reduce the credit and systemic risk inherent to this portfolio - the proposed model can be applied to other mortgage portfolios in trouble as well. The main element of our proposal is income-contingent repayment complemented with effective incentives to motivate debtors to repay their debt. We demonstrate that the proposed scheme is attractive for both the debtors and the lenders; therefore, contrary to some recent policy measures, in this case there is no need for direct state intervention to force modifications to the existing legal contracts. In order to evaluate the possible effects, we simulated a realistic population of borrowers with different age, debt, loan-to-value, and income. Then we calculated the expected income paths, the repayments of the borrowers as well as the profit of the lenders on the basis of the non-performing FX mortgage portfolio. The results underpin that the proposed scheme creates significant value added and, most importantly, that it can effectively reduce the vulnerability of the entire economy to future shocks.","[Berlinger, Edina; Walter, Gyoergy] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary; [Berlinger, Edina] Hungarian Acad Sci, Finance Sub Comm, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Academy of Sciences,"Berlinger, E (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Finance, Budapest, Hungary.",Edina.Berlinger@uni-corvinus.hu; Gyorgy.Walter@uni-corvinus.hu,"Berlinger, Edina/I-3576-2015",,"Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Momentum Programme [LP-004/2010]","Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Momentum Programme","This paper was based on a research supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Momentum Programme (LP-004/2010).",,28,3,3,0,10,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

This research is relevant because this relation is likely to be affected by differences in accounting standards used by companies for financial reporting, in the traditional use of the banking system or capital markets for firm financing, in legal systems and cultural environment. We find that in European stock markets discretionary accruals are positively related with the Corwin and Schultz high-low spread estimator used as a proxy for information asymmetry. Our results suggest that the earnings management component of accruals outweighs the informational component, but the significance of the relation varies across countries. Further, such association tends to be stronger for firms with the highest levels of positive discretionary accruals. Consistent with the evidence provided by the authors, our results also suggest that the high-low spread estimator is more efficient than the closing bid-ask spread when analysing the impact of information quality on information asymmetry.","[Cerqueira, Antonio] Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Pereira, Claudia] Polytech Inst Porto, Ctr Studies Business & Legal Sci, Sch Accounting & Adm Porto, Sao Mamede de Infesta, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Cerqueira, A (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Sch Econ & Management, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",acerqueira.pt@gmail.com; claudial@iscap.ipp.pt,"Pereira, Cláudia/ISU-9263-2023; Pereira, Cláudia/T-5392-2017","Pereira, Cláudia/0000-0002-2643-1824; Pereira, Cláudia/0000-0002-2643-1824; CERQUEIRA, ANTONIO/0000-0002-3114-503X",,,,,32,5,7,1,20,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

In order to test this hypothesis, we use two available liquidity proxies, namely versions of the Amihud illiquidity measure and a measure based on exchange traded fund prices. Our investigation is based on vector autoregressive models for the German stock market between July 2006 and June 2010. The fund-based illiquidity proxy dominates in capturing consistent results for the determination of time-varying market returns. Temporary illiquidity is indeed compensated for by higher market returns. We confirm a bidirectional relation between illiquidity and market returns, i.e. current returns depend on lagged illiquidity and current illiquidity can be determined by a combination of past returns as well as past illiquidity. The relation shows that illiquidity is persistent and driven by market declines. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

According to this usage adopted here, possession refers to control of a resource, but property involves legally sanctioned rights. Strikingly, prominent foundational accounts of the 'economics of property rights' concentrate on possession, downplaying the issue of legitimate legal rights (Alchian, 1965, 1977; Barzel, 1994, 1997, 2002; von Mises, 1981). Some authors in this genre make a distinction between 'economic rights' and 'legal rights' where the former are more to do with possession or the capacity to control. They argue that 'economic rights' are primary and more relevant for understanding behaviour. But it is argued here that legal factors - involving recognition of authority and perceived justice or morality - have also to be brought into the picture to understand human motivation in modern societies, even in the economic sphere. As other authors including Hernando De Soto (2000) have pointed out, the neglect of the legal infrastructure that buttresses property has deleterious implications, including a failure to understand the role of property in supporting collateralized loans for innovation and economic development.","[Hodgson, Geoffrey M.] Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England",University of Hertfordshire,"Hodgson, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Hertfordshire, Hertfordshire Business Sch, Hatfield AL10 9AB, Herts, England.",g.m.hodgson@herts.ac.uk,"Hodgson, Geoffrey/AAQ-8246-2021",,,,,,148,93,100,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

J,"Hodgson, GM",,,,"Hodgson, Geoffrey M.",,,What Humpty Dumpty might have said about property rights - and the need to put them back together again: a response to critics,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FOUNDATIONS,"This is a response to the useful comments by Allen, Barzel and Cole on Hodgson (2015a) on property rights. One section deals with some misrepresentations by Allen and Barzel. For instance, contrary to one interpretation, Hodgson (2015a) did not accuse the 'economics of property rights' of ignoring legal institutions or of making them generally irrelevant. This response further clarifies the standard meaning of rights, showing that it is at variance with usages in the 'economics of property rights'. The issue of moral motivation, and its relevance for legal compliance, are also elaborated. Some arguments in Hodgson (2015a) have been described by critics as mere semantics, but in response it is argued - contrary to philosophical nominalism - that changes in the meanings of words can be analytically significant, and we should treat traditional meanings more seriously, especially when dealing with other disciplines such as law. (The cryptic reference to Humpty Dumpty comes in here).

The implementation and operation of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) involves transaction costs such as internal costs, capital costs, and consultancy and trading costs.

An empirical assessment of nonlinear mean reversion is provided using threshold cointegration, which allows for asymmetric regime-dependent adjustment to the equilibrium relationship between European Union Emission Allowances (EUA) spot and futures prices. The mean reversion process reveals nonlinear and regime-dependent adjustment, and thus the empirical evidence indicates that transaction costs affect the mean reversion behavior and restrain market efficiency and price discovery.","[Kim, Jeonghyun; Seo, Byeongseon] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Coll Life Sci, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",malyang@korea.ac.kr; seomatteo@korea.ac.kr,,"SEO, Byeongseon/0000-0001-6112-4910",,,,,41,0,0,1,8,HITOTSUBASHI UNIV,TOKYO,"HITOTSUBASHI ACADEMY KUNITACHI, TOKYO, JAPAN",0018-280X,2436-097X,,HITOTSUB J ECON,Hitotsubashi J.

A cohort analysis of the individuals entering the German labor market in the years 1999 to 2001 indicates that the raw wage gap of migrants compared to native Germans decreases by 14 log percentage points in the first eight years. The results of a decomposition method based on fixed effects regression models give evidence that this wage adjustment is mostly due to time-varying observable characteristics. Selective return migration, and the trend effects play no role for the aggregate. We find that wage assimilation happens mainly through three channels: first, through the accumulation of firm-specific human capital, which explains approximately 40 percent; second, search gains are approximately the same order of magnitude; and third, the accumulation of general human capital explains one-fifth of the assimilation. We further demonstrate that the importance of these channels differs substantially by the origin groups.","[Lehmer, Florian; Ludsteck, Johannes] Inst Employment Res IAB, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany",,"Ludsteck, J (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Regensburger Str 104, D-90478 Nurnberg, Germany.",johannes.ludsteck@iab.de,,,,,,,39,13,14,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Relying upon the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), we investigate the decline in energy intensity in the EU27 countries between 1995 and 2009. Changes in energy intensity can be attributed to two different drivers: changes in the industrial composition of an economy and changes in its sectoral energy intensities. We conduct a series of index decomposition analyses (IDA) to isolate the effects exerted by these drivers. We then take the findings from the index decomposition analysis and subject them to panel estimations. The objective is to control for factors that may have shaped the evolution of energy intensity in the European Union. We estimate the changes in energy intensity as well as the changes in (energy-relevant) structural change and in the sectoral energy intensities. Therefore, we are able to reveal the channels through which factors such as economic growth, capital intensity, and energy prices affect energy intensity. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We discuss some two-stage static decision criteria proposed in the literature that address state uncertainty in the first stage and model uncertainty in the second (by considering subjective probabilities over models). We consider two approaches to the Ellsberg-type phenomena characteristic of such decision problems: a Bayesian approach based on the distinction between subjective attitudes toward the two kinds of uncertainty; and a non-Bayesian approach that permits multiple subjective probabilities.

In 1938, Harold Hotelling published a forceful and far-reaching proposal for marginal cost pricing entitled The General Welfare in Relation to Problems of Taxation and of Railway and Utility Rates. After several years and many pages of discussion, Ronald Coase gave a name and a clear formulation to the debate in his 1946 article The Marginal Cost Controversy. We will tell much of the story of this controversy by comparing the frameworks of Hotelling and Coase, while also bringing in other contributors and offering some thoughts about contemporary relevance. The arguments marshaled by Coase (and his contemporaries) not only succeeded in this particular debate, as we shall see, but more generally served as part of the foundation for various fields of modern economics, particularly institutional, regulatory, and public choice economics as well as law and economics. Yet the underlying issues are quite difficult to resolve, and the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments for marginal cost pricing can turn on specific elements of the industry.","Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Macalester College,"Taylor, T (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The results imply that households raise their targets for precautionary savings by 4-5 percent of annual income in response to such experiences. Moreover, data are consistent with the argument that targets for savings affect actual savings. Assuming this holds, the results in this paper suggest that consumers may increase their actual savings following large expenditure.","Minist Finance, Washington, DC USA",,"Tokuoka, K (通讯作者)，Minist Finance, Washington, DC USA.",,,,,,,,35,0,0,0,12,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

These strategies are optimal for a CRRA investor if the stock follows a diffusion process, the expected excess return is proportional to its volatility, and the hedging demand is zero. We assess the performance of stable volatility strategies when these restrictive assumptions do not hold, in particular, when the risk premium is not proportional to volatility and when the stock price is subject to jumps. We find that stable volatility strategies are indeed robust or close to robust under a maxmin decision rule. In addition to our theoretical results, we perform a simulation analysis to evaluate strategies that scale the portfolio weight by the volatility, variance or a constant portfolio weight, and also analyze the strategies using empirical excess returns. Both analyses confirm the robustness of stable volatility strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The RCEP intends to harmonise rules and regulations across multiple overlapping free trade agreements in the region, and thereby attract new members. However, it faces several challenges. The mention of a flexibility principle and the ASEAN Way' of decision-making has led many to believe that the RCEP will be yet another low-quality regional trade agreement. However, the RCEP presents all ASEAN members with the opportunity to take a role in setting the agenda for a region-wide agreement. Hence, despite its challenges, ASEAN must make the effort to reach an attractive RCEP vis-a-vis other competing regional agreements. Accordingly, this paper describes what the RCEP is intended to be, how it emerged, and the issues that might affect the agreement's final quality, in order to evaluate if it will establish a new paradigm or a repackaged version of ASEAN's existing trade agreements.","ASEAN Studies Ctr, ISEAS, Singapore, Singapore",,"Das, SB (通讯作者)，ASEAN Studies Ctr, ISEAS, Singapore, Singapore.",sanchita@iseas.edu.sg,,,,,,,35,6,7,4,41,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

First, a stylized asset-pricing model solved under rational expectations is used to derive a fundamental value for house prices and the price-rent ratio. Although the model can explain the sample average of the price-rent ratio, it does not generate the large and persistent fluctuations observed in the data. Then, we consider a rational bubble solution, an extrapolative expectations solution and a near rational bubble solution. In this last solution agents extrapolate the future from the latest realizations and the degree of extrapolation is stronger in good times than in bad times, generating waves of over-optimism. We show that under this solution the model not only is able to match key moments of the data but can also replicate the run up in the US. house prices observed over the 2000-2006 period and the subsequent sharp downturn.

Unlike existing studies, we treat the two industries entirely symmetrically-both are imperfectly competitive, and engage in sector-specific expanding-product-variety or quality-ladder innovation activities. To achieve a more satisfactory analytical characterization, we eliminate scale effects and impose strict concavity rather than linearity on the contribution of skilled labour to industry R&D. With imperfect international knowledge spillovers, an increase in one country's skilled-labour endowment above the other's affects production and R&D activities in both countries, with the resulting increased production and research specialization across countries raising world innovation rates in both industries. Surprisingly, increasing one country's skilled-labour endowment towards the other's can reduce world innovation rates in both industries, on account of the resulting reduced specialization.

According to the simulations, the policy would achieve prompt full recovery from the severe recession without generating any adverse effect on government debt as a percent of GDP or on the inflation rate in either the short run or long run.

The results show that schools moving into automatic-qualifying conferences experienced nearly $12.15million in increased revenue, nearly matched by $10.12 million in added expenditures. Schools moving into any FBS conference saw revenues increase by $6.43 million, with expenses growing $5.03 million. Schools switching conferences to a non-FBS conference did not see a statistically significant change in revenues or expenses. Schools with football programs saw revenues increase by $2.94million and profits increase by close to $1 million.

This makes it problematic to use MRIO-based footprints for national policy-making. This paper develops a potential solution using the Netherlands as case study. The method ensures that the footprint is derived from an MRIO dataset (in our case the World Input-Output Database (WIOD)) that is made consistent with Dutch National accounts data. Furthermore, usage of microdata allows us to separate re-exports at the company level. The adjustment results in a foreign footprint in 2009 that is 22% lower than the original WIOD estimates and a significantly altered country allocation. We demonstrate that already in the data preparation phase due to the treatment of re-exports and margins, large differences arise with Dutch national statistics, which may help explain the variation in footprint estimates across MRIO databases.","[Edens, Bram; Hoekstra, Rutger; Zult, Daan] Stat Netherlands, Natl Accounts Dept, The Hague, Netherlands; [Lemmers, Oscar] Stat Netherlands, Business Stat Dept, Heerlen, Netherlands; [Wilting, Harry] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, Bilthoven, Netherlands; [Wu, Ronghao] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Edens, B (通讯作者)，Stat Netherlands, Natl Accounts Dept, The Hague, Netherlands.",b.edens@cbs.nl,,"Hoekstra, Rutger/0000-0001-6531-9782; Lemmers, Oscar/0000-0003-2051-700X; Wilting, Harry/0000-0002-2330-8820; Zult, Daan/0009-0002-2732-3697",European Commission's FP7 program [290520],European Commission's FP7 program,Part of this work was carried out in the e-Frame (European Framework for Measuring Progress) project funded by the European Commission's FP7 program [grant number 290520].

This is mainly due to the fact that the number of parameters to be estimated is much higher than the number of available data points. Taking advantage of the recent proliferation of input-output databases and by applying an estimation strategy that relies on entropy econometrics, this paper suggests a way to estimate the parameters that characterize non-linear relationships between inputs and output. This non-linear modelling allows for considering time-specific input coefficients, instead of fixed ones. Several types of multipliers can be derived from this non-linear model, and the proposed generalized maximum entropy (GME) estimator allows estimating them from time series or cross-sectional datasets of input-output tables. The proposed GME technique is illustrated by means of an empirical application that estimates the parameters that characterize a non-linear input-output model for the Spanish economy over the period 1995-2011.","[Fernandez-Vazquez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, RegioLab, Oviedo, Spain; [Fernandez-Vazquez, Esteban] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Fernandez-Vazquez, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, RegioLab, Oviedo, Spain.",evazquez@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901",,,,,21,5,5,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Statistical analysis suggests that Chinese investors are attracted to countries with large market size, rich resources and strategic assets, and demand a sound legal system but avoid countries with the best rule of law. Chinese investors do not directly respond to political risk and corruption. However, they favour politically stable locations when seeking markets and care about political stability and corruption control when seeking resources. Institutional factors play a more significant role in the investment decision making prior to the actual investments, but the moderating role of institutions is influential for the actual investments. Chinese investors are more likely to seek markets and resources in developing countries, with careful evaluation of institutional quality.","[He, Canfei; Xie, Xiuzhen] Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Shengjun] Swansea Univ, Swansea, W Glam, Wales",Peking University; Swansea University,"He, CF (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn,"Zhu, Shengjun/AAD-3723-2020",,"Natural Science Foundation of China [41425001, 41271130]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 41425001 and 41271130.,,39,25,33,1,87,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,OCT 2,2015,27.0,4,,,,,448,471,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1084716,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CX3HV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365589000002,0

This effect is specific to individuals who have a criminal identity, because an additional placebo experiment shows that regular citizens do not become more dishonest in response to crime-related reminders. Moreover, our experimental measure of cheating correlates with inmates' offences against in-prison regulation.

Using a sample of 17 countries and filtering out more than 140 domestically operating foreign-owned banks, we examine the determinants of their performance in relation to host country conditions over the period of seven years between 2005 and 2011. Based on our knowledge, we use the largest data set in this respect compared to other researchers. Using system GMM and fixed effects models, we reveal that macroeconomic fundamentals of the host country affect the-foreign-owned banks' performance but do not suffice in explaining it fully. This result points out that sound banks with higher operational efficiency operating in growing economies with low inflation rate tend to perform better than their peers.","[Fiserova, Tereza; Teply, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague, Czech Republic; [Tripe, David] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business; Massey University,"Fiserová, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",tereza.fiserova1@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz; d.w.tripe@massey.ac.nz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018",,Czech Science Foundation [GACR 14-02108S]; University of Economics in Prague [VSE IP100040],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); University of Economics in Prague,Financial support from the Czech Science Foundation (Project No. GACR 14-02108S) and by University of Economics in Prague (Project No. VSE IP100040) is gratefully acknowledged.

Some main findings emerge from the analysis. First, the equilibrium aggregate output and aggregate consumption under fixed-fee and royalty licensing regimes are always greater than those under the no licensing regime. Moreover, the equilibrium aggregate output and consumption under the fixed-fee licensing regime are always greater than those under the royalty licensing regime. Second, with the higher (lower) technology level the patent holder prefers the fixed-fee (royalty) contract. Third, welfare could be improved through technology transfer, and the level of welfare under the fixed-fee licensing regime is higher than that under the royalty licensing regime. Lastly, this paper discusses some extensions of the baseline model.","[Hsieh, Hui-ting] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Acad Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-chong] Feng Chia Univ, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Chen, Kuan-jen] Fu Jen Catholic Univ, Dept Econ, New Taipei, Taiwan",National Chung Cheng University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; Feng Chia University; Fu Jen Catholic University,"Hsieh, HT (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.",anicca1120@gmail.com; cclai@econ.sinica.edu.tw; kjnchen@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

When information on the firms' productivity and surplus is revealed, wage offers represent larger shares of potential gains for workers who, in return, respond with higher performance. Workers respond not only to wages, but also to firms' intentions concerning fairness. We find that, in long-term relationships, transparency is a strong mechanism to promote performance and welfare. It naturally improves relationships between firms and workers, increases workers' welfare, profits from low productivity jobs and boosts the labor market efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Results from the analysis show that those individuals who move within the first 2 years after a job loss experience lower earnings losses, lower reductions in hours worked, and smaller increases in time unemployed when compared to a group of displaced workers who are not geographically mobile during the early years following this life event. Workers who move within the first 2 years after displacement face a lower probability of homeownership when compared to their non-mobile counterparts.

Foreign investor participation broadens the investor base and can give a boost to LCBM development, yet it may also increase volatility of international capital flows.

In a general spatial setting, the set of undercut-proof prices is equivalent to the core of a non-transferable utility coalitional-game, played on the set of outcomes that are feasible in Bertrand competition. The result depends critically on two conditions: First, firms must have unlimited capacity and constant marginal costs. Second, the goods produced by firms must only be differentiated by the spatial characteristics of the market. An application to network markets shows how the undercut-proof equilibrium can be used to describe stable price dispersion and persistent performance differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

As such, a literature has developed that focuses on forecasting the probability of such spike events, moving beyond simply forecasting the level of price. Many univariate time series models have been proposed to deal with spikes within an individual market region. This paper is the first to develop a multivariate self-exciting point process model for dealing with price spikes across connected regions in the Australian National Electricity Market. The importance of the physical infrastructure connecting the regions on the transmission of spikes is examined. It is found that spikes are transmitted between the regions, and the size of spikes is influenced by the available transmission capacity. It is also found that improved risk estimates are obtained when inter-regional linkages are taken into account. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Clements, A. E.; Hurn, A.

This study explores possible alternatives for the AOW. A stochastic partial equilibrium model is used to study intragenerational insurance against longevity and productivity risk. The model shows the welfare, labour-market and saving effects of a shift from a Beveridge towards a Bismarck system in which pension rights depend on labour-market history. The main conclusion is that a shift of first pillar pensions from a Beveridge towards a Bismarck system is not necessarily welfare improving from an ex-ante insurance perspective, i.e. before the veil of ignorance is lifted. Moreover, a means test of the first pillar against wealth income, which implies a lower AOW when an individual has wealth income and a lower pension premium for everyone, does not improve welfare in the setting of the model considered in this study.","[Draper, Nick; Nibbelink, Andre] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands; [Uhde, Johannes] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Econ, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; University of Wurzburg,"Draper, N (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",dagd@cpb.nl; aghn@cpb.nl,,,"Netspar, Network for Studies on Pensions, Ageing and Retirement","Netspar, Network for Studies on Pensions, Ageing and Retirement","Thanks are due to two anonymous referees, Leon Bettendorf, Peter Broer, Arie ten Cate, Casper van Ewijk, Hans Fehr, Rob van Harrevelt, Albert van der Horst, Peter Kooiman, Harry ter Rele, Ward Romp, Bert Smid, Bas ter Weel and Ed Westerhout for their valuable comments.

We focus in particular on key institutional weaknesses that are often important for infrastructure investment. Overall, we show that such weaknesses can be key in determining financing choices, but that they do not all push in the same direction.

In this paper, we test the influence of price and technological competition and two institutional factors, mandatory reporting and monitoring by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and media, on CSP. Combining survey data with CSP ratings from Sustainalytics, we find that technological competition, monitoring by NGOs and media and mandatory CSP reporting foster CSP. However, price competition is not found to significantly influence CSP. This indicates that there is no support for the existence of a trade-off between anti-trust policy and CSP. Furthermore, our findings imply that governments can stimulate CSP by making CSP reporting mandatory.","[Graafland, Johan] Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, CentER, Dept Econ,Dept Philosophy, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Smid, Hugo] Nederlandsche Bank, Afdeling Risicomanagement Toezicht, NL-1000 AB Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University; European Central Bank; De Nederlandsche Bank NV,"Graafland, J (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, CentER, Dept Econ,Dept Philosophy, POB 90153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.j.graafland@uvt.nl; h.smid@dnb.nl,"Baldissera, Annalisa/AHD-6334-2022",,European Union [SSH-2009-2.1.3],European Union(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by the European Union under the seventh framework program theme SSH-2009-2.1.3.,,70,6,8,2,57,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,SEP,2015,163.0,3,,,,,303,322,,10.1007/s10645-015-9255-y,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN8BQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358662400003,0

For this purpose, we make use of unique individual level micro data from the German socioeconomic panel study. In married and cohabiting couples men's net worth, on average, is 33,000 euros higher than women's. We look at five different sets of factors (demographics, income, labor market, inheritances, financial decision-making in the partnership) that might explain this wealth gap. We find that all factors contribute to the explanation of the wealth gap within partnerships, with inheritances and income being particularly relevant. Furthermore, we find that specific characteristics (e.g., self-employment, no migration background, inheritances, high income) that decrease the wealth gap for women increase it for men. For men the respective coefficients are even stronger in absolute terms. When examining intra-partnership financial decision-making, we find the gap to be significantly smaller when the female partner manages the money and larger if the male partner has the last word in financial decisions.","[Grabka, Markus M.; Marcus, Jan] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.] TU Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Sierminska, Eva] DIW Berlin, CEPS INSTEAD, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg; [Sierminska, Eva] IZA, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Grabka, MM (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",mgrabka@diw.de; jmarcus@diw.de; eva.sierminska@ceps.lu,"Marcus, Jan/AAG-1203-2020; Sierminska, Eva/AAJ-6665-2021","Marcus, Jan/0000-0001-9407-6660; Sierminska, Eva/0000-0003-1936-814X",Hans-Boeckler-Foundation [2012-610-4],Hans-Boeckler-Foundation,"The authors would like to thank Francesco Figari, Adam Lederer, Deborah Anne Bowen, the participants of the 2012 IARIW conference, the 2013 ECINEQ conference, 2013 ESA conference, two anonymous referees and the editor Shoshana Grossbard for helpful suggestions and comments.

Our model is tractable enough to yield sharp analytic results, that complement and clarify an emerging empirical literature on labor market adjustment to trade. Existing generations that have accumulated specific human capital in one sector can switch sectors when the economy is hit by a trade shock. Nonetheless, the shock induces few workers to switch, generating a protracted adjustment that operates largely through the entry of new generations. This results in wages being tied to the sector of employment in the short-run but to the skill type in the long-run. Relative to a world with general human capital, welfare is improved for the skill group whose type-intensive sector shrinks. We extend the model to include physical capital and show that the transition is longer when capital is mobile. We also introduce nonpecuniary sector preferences and show that larger gross flows are associated with a longer transition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This particular generalisation has been recommended by a number of econometricians for analysing choice problems in which capturing taste variation and specific non-IIA patterns of substitution are both of modeller's concern. This way, the analyst will be able to limit the number of explanatory variables to the ones whose distributions of coefficients offer behavioural interpretations about taste variation, and leave the imposition of the desired substitution pattern to the GEV core. In this paper, we report on a mixed nested logit application aimed at understanding evacuation behaviour of human crowd, particularly the choice of exit. Evacuees' trade-off between contributing factors are elicited through a data set of stated exit choices. We attempt to improve the realism of the choice experiments by conducting face-to-face interviews with pedestrians (respondents) as they exit a building; and designing scenarios that refer to their recent actual choice of exit. The primary analysis strongly suggests the presence of taste heterogeneity as well as the violation of the IIA assumption (i.e. the presence of a particular pattern of correlation between exit utilities). We propose and estimate a mixed nested logit model through which we accommodate these two econometric aspects of the problem in a unified model. Compared to the counterpart mixed multinomial logit model in which the desired substitution pattern is embodied through specification of the explanatory variables, the proposed model reduces the dimension of simulation in the likelihood maximisation procedure, and also yields a slightly better statistical fit.

The main advantage of the simulation approach lies in its straightforward extension to many assets, which makes it possible to analyze equilibrium in economies with many fundamental assets.

We show that, unlike the case of one good, when the buyer's values for the goods increase, the seller's maximal revenue may well decrease. We then identify two circumstances where monotonicity does obtain: when optimal mechanisms are deterministic and symmetric, and when they have submodular prices. Next, through simple and transparent examples, we clarify the need for and the advantage of randomization when maximizing revenue in the multiple-good versus the one-good case. Finally, we consider seller-favorable mechanisms, the only ones that matter when maximizing revenue. They are essential for our positive monotonicity results, and they also circumvent well known nondifferentiability issues.","[Hart, Sergiu] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Dept Math, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Hart, Sergiu] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Federmann Ctr Study Rat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Reny, Philip J.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; University of Chicago,"Hart, S (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Econ, Dept Math, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel.",hart@huji.ac.il; preny@uchicago.edu,"Hart, Sergiu/B-4724-2008","Hart, Sergiu/0000-0001-8851-6009","European Research Council [FP7-249159]; National Science Foundation [SES-0922535, SES-1227506]",European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"Research partially supported by the European Research Council (FP7-249159) and the National Science Foundation (SES-0922535, SES-1227506).

We find that the RMB price response to exchange rate changes is very small, indicating relatively high exchange rate pass-through into foreign currency denominated prices, while the volume response is moderate and significant. Furthermore, exporters with higher productivity price more to market, though the pass-through is still very high. Other sources of heterogeneity, such as import intensity, distribution costs, income level of the destination countries, and foreign ownership also matter. Moreover, RMB appreciation reduces the probability of entry as well as the probability of continuing in the export market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we find evidence that there exists an education spillover effect of the migrants' social network, which indicates that the education level of the migrants' social network has a significant positive effect on their earnings.

A cross-sectional analysis of 68 developed and developing countries applying two-stage least squares estimations suggests not only that the cognitive dimension of SC (shared codes and languages) is highly important for SC formation across regional origin, but also that countries with a greater degree of linguistic fractionalisation have a lower SC stock. In particular, countries with fractionalized ethnic and linguistic groups, as captured by number of languages and measures of linguistic diversity, tend to have lower levels of social trust, fewer memberships in social organisations, and deteriorated social norms and structures. The negative ethnic fractionalisation effect on SC is also found weaker in higher-income and in non-African countries.","[Wang, Cong; Steiner, Bodo] Univ Southern Denmark, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Wang, C (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Alsion 2, DK-6400 Sonderborg, Denmark.",cong@sam.sdu.dk,,"Wang, Cong/0000-0002-6852-5490; Steiner, Bodo/0000-0002-5357-8856",,,,,122,21,24,1,25,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

A low position limit helps to prevent price manipulations in the spot market, and thus keeps the magnitude of instantaneous price changes within the tolerance range of policymakers. However, setting a position limit that is too low may also have negative effects on market quality. We propose an artificial limit order market with heterogeneous interacting agents to examine the impact of different levels of position limits on market quality, measured as liquidity, return volatility, efficiency of information dissemination, and trading welfare. The simulation model is based on realistic trading mechanisms, investor structure, and order submission behavior observed in the CSI 300 futures market. Our results show that on the basis of the liquidity status in September 2010, raising the position limit from 100 to 300 could significantly improve market quality and at the same time keep the maximum absolute price change per 5 s below the 2% tolerance level. However, the improvement becomes only marginal if the position limit is further increased beyond 300. Therefore, we believe that raising the position limit to a moderate level can enhance the functionality of the CSI 300 futures market, which should benefit the development of the Chinese financial system.

The paper considers a number of alternate models, verifies the validity of the demand model hypotheses and selects a preferred model using the information inaccuracy criterion. The paper then uses the preferred model to forecast meat demand in Australia under various economic policy scenarios. The results show that between 1962 and 2011, meat budget share has more than halved and that consumer taste plays a significant role in shifting the meat consumption in Australia to chicken and pork at the expense of beef and lamb. Beef is a luxury, while mutton, lamb, chicken and pork are necessities. Demand for mutton is price elastic and, beef, lamb, chicken and pork is price inelastic. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We examine different production factors and the degree of openness by dividing the Chinese manufacturing industry into five major categories: capital-intensive business, technological-intensive business, labor-intensive business, open business and non-open business. The results show that offshore outsourcing is positively associated with productivity in the Chinese manufacturing industry as a whole, but less so in labor-intensive industries and more in capital-intensive industries. Moreover, the positive impact of outsourcing on productivity is slightly higher in open industries than in non-open industries. These results shed light on the differential spillover effects of offshore outsourcing on productivity. Our findings suggest that outsourcing structure is important to China's long-run competitive advantage. China's policy-makers should encourage further offshore capital-intensive and technology-intensive activities and focus more on outward-oriented offshore businesses.","[Zhao, Junli] Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Boasson, Vigdis] Cent Michigan Univ, Dept Finance & Law, Mt Pleasant, MI USA",Donghua University; Central Michigan University,"Boasson, V (通讯作者)，Donghua Univ, Glorious Sun Sch Business & Management, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",junlizhao2000@163.com; boass1v@cmich.edu,"zhao, Junli/JWP-6495-2024; Boasson, Vigdis/JGM-7234-2023","Boasson, Vigdis/0000-0002-8621-6026",Shanghai Municipal Education Commission Key Innovation [14ZS065]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Shanghai Soft Science Key project [14692104700],Shanghai Municipal Education Commission Key Innovation; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Shanghai Soft Science Key project,"Junli Zhao, Associate Professor, Glorious Sun School of Business and Management, Donghua University, Shanghai, China.

(J Public Econ 66:99-126, 1997) and tax ratios, adopting a dynamic panel estimation strategy, and explicitly accounting for cross-sectional dependence in the panel. When implicit tax rates are used, the paper shows that the link between tax structure and long-run income per capita is not robust to the adoption of different assumptions on observable and unobservable heterogeneity across countries. When tax ratios are used, there is some evidence of a negative impact of labour taxation on long-run income, but this result is shown to capture non-fiscal effects coming from the evolution of the labour share. Turning to the short run, the research presented here finds strong evidence of a positive effect on per capita income of a tax shift from labour and capital taxation towards consumption taxation, which provides support for fiscal devaluations.","[Arachi, Giampaolo; Bucci, Valeria] Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Casarico, Alessandra] Univ Bocconi, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Arachi, Giampaolo; Casarico, Alessandra] Dondena, Milan, Italy; [Casarico, Alessandra] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Salento; Bocconi University; Bocconi University; Ifo Institut,"Bucci, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dipartimento Sci Econ, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",valeria.bucci@unisalento.it,"Arachi, Giampaolo/N-7179-2015; bucci, valeria/KBA-7499-2024","Arachi, Giampaolo/0000-0001-8100-5820; bucci, valeria/0000-0003-3035-3686",,,,,33,14,14,6,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

I provide results on the existence, uniqueness, and stability under learning of rational expectations equilibrium for alternative specifications of the manner in which monetary policy responds to economic shocks when nominal rigidities are present. Monopolistically competitive producers set prices via staggered price contracts, and households set nominal wages in the same fashion. In this setting, the conditions for determinacy and learnability of rational expectations equilibrium differ from a model where only prices are sticky. I find that when the central bank responds to wage and price inflation and to the output gap, a Taylor principle for wage and price inflation arises that is related to stability under learning dynamics. In other words, a moderate reaction of the interest rate to wage inflation helps to avoid instability under learning and indeterminacy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It also measures the partnership's economy-wide impact empirically, and its role in regional and global integration. An analysis of the trade intensity indices shows that the bilateral trade flow is small considering the other country's importance in world trade, suggesting the existence of great potential for improving trade relations. The computable general equilibrium (CGE) analysis of the economy wide impact of the CEPA suggests that tariff reductions will create a marginal increase in output growth for both India and Japan as compared to the business as usual scenario. In terms of the effect on exports, India's exports to Japan would increase more than those of Japan to India while positive net welfare gains are expected for both countries as a result of trade liberalization. This is in contrast to the study by Ahmed (2010), which finds welfare gains only for Japan, not for India. Furthermore, one of the striking results of the paper is that Japan will not reduce its heavy reliance on the Chinese market, though India will. In general, India, compared to Japan, will gain more, if CEPA materializes by 2020. Japan too will have welfare gains in spite of opening up the agriculture sector with 100% tariff reduction by 2020. Both countries need to accelerate structural reforms to remove the border barriers in addition to reducing tariffs, in order to reap maximum benefit of their economic partnership.

Under this common formulation, the firm under supplies working conditions and effort at its second best, regardless of the share of accident damages borne by the firm. At this optimum, increases in the damage share paid by the firm decrease the compensation to the agent so as to render working conditions and effort unchanged. Shifting the damage share then does not impact the firm's or the agent's welfare. We show that direct regulation of working conditions can improve total surplus, but that the regulation of the damage share is ineffectual. Under first order approximations, we also examine the effects of changes in the hazard level of the job and the efficiency of working conditions.

Four dimensions are conceptualized: Interpersonal trust, institutional trust, trustworthiness, and participation in civil society (formal and informal). The monetary value is obtained by including social capital in a well-being function and estimating the shadow price of social capital. The empirical analysis is based on data from the European Values Survey covering 45 European countries. A generalized ordered response model is estimated to account for possible heterogeneity of social capital indicators among the ten different subjective well-being levels. The results show that on average a one standard deviation increase in interpersonal trust (people's fairness) is worth an extra (sic) 7913 per year in terms of foregone income, the same increase in institutional trust is worth (sic) 7405, and the same increase in the importance of family is worth (sic) 7312. The findings indicate that social capital has significant monetary value to individuals. This should be considered when designing government policies aiming at, e.g., labor market mobility that are accompanied by a decreasing social capital stock that, in turn, may negatively affect economic and political development.

This paper studies the effects of the partition which ended the 1992-1995 Bosnian War on the post-war provision of public schooling. I find that partitioned municipalities provide 58% more primary schools and 37% more teachers (per capita). Driven mainly by convergent preferences for ethnically oriented schools, however, this arrangement delivers distributional consequences: in partitioned municipalities, ethnic majority children are more likely to complete primary schooling, while for ethnic minority children it is the opposite.

Results show that, first, money supply growth is a more effective instrument to curb inflation than the monetary policy interest rate; however, the central bank also adjusts the interest rate to stabilize money supply. Second, investment is an important measure to stimulate the Chinese economy, but it also pushes up money supply growth, which results in higher inflation. Third, the yield curve reacts significantly to innovations to investment growth and money supply growth. The segmentation of China's bond market hinders the efficient implementation of monetary policy, and the monetary policy transmission mechanism is still weak in China. Finally, interactions between the yield curve and the macroeconomy in China are nearly unidirectional. Macroeconomic variables reshape the yield curve, but direct adjustments of the yield curve do not significantly change macroeconomic variables. Due to the incomplete liberalization of financial markets, there exists a wide disjunction between the real economy and financial markets in China.","[Yan, Yifeng; Guo, Ju'e] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Xian 710049, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"Yan, YF (通讯作者)，Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Sch Management, 28 Xianning West Rd, Xian 710049, Peoples R China.",yanyifeng0123@163.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173169],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Address for Correspondence: School of Management, Xi'an Jiaotong University, No. 28, Xianning West Road, Xi'an 710049, China.

This paper studies the mechanisms behind such phenomenon, analyzing data on industries for a large set of countries over a forty year period from 1963 to 2003. We find that during creditless recoveries there is a significant reallocation of resources away from sectors that are more dependent on bank credit, both for their investments and for their short-term liquidity needs. The adverse effects of credit constraints are softened in sectors that rely more on alternative sources of financing, such as trade credit, or in sectors that have more favorable access to credit because of higher collateral. We thus conclude that creditless recoveries do not simply reflect a natural process of deleveraging, but they may imply significant inefficiencies in the allocation of resources.","[Coricelli, Fabrizio] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Coricelli, Fabrizio] CEPR, Paris, France; [Frigerio, Marco] IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy",Paris School of Economics; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Coricelli, F (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",fabrizio.coricelli@gmail.com,"Frigerio, Marco/AAG-3688-2021; Frigerio, Marco/HCH-0605-2022","Frigerio, Marco/0000-0001-6646-9889; Frigerio, Marco/0000-0001-6646-9889",,,,,32,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

For independent distributions, Myerson showed that the optimal auction for risk-neutral bidders remains incentive compatible regardless of bidders' risk attitudes. We show that, for correlated distributions, the same is true when only two bidders are involved, whereas for more bidders, randomization can generate strictly more revenue. However, for risk-neutral bidders, we show this gain is never more than a 5/3-factor. This is a consequence of two results of independent interest: (1) a polynomial-time deran-domization of auctions for two bidders; (2) a polynomial-time computable deterministic auction that 5/3-approximates the optimal revenue extractable from risk-neutral bidders. Moreover, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute optimal auctions for a constant number of bidders, and for any number of bidders we give polynomial-time algorithms with approximation factors arbitrarily close to 3/2.

To handle such a rich specification, I use a simulated likelihood, yet obtain a correct posterior by regarding the draws used for simulation as a latent variable to be augmented in the Bayesian framework; see Flury and Shephard, 2011. I provide a step-by-step guide of the method, report its performance from various perspectives, and compare the method with the existing one for a range of data generating processes and sample sizes.

An equilibrium business cycle model of North-South capital flow with corporate governance frictions between outside investors and corporate insiders explains this phenomenon through two channels. First, weak governance leads to concentrated ownership in the South because international diversification by insiders is penalized by lower stock market valuation. This reduces the float portfolio, or the supply of South assets. Second, weak governance tilts the demand of South outside investors towards domestic assets to hedge labor income risk. This is due to a higher share of labor in income, which increases labor income risk. In addition, the dynamics of investment under insider control leads relative dividend and labor income to be more negatively correlated in the South, making domestic assets a better hedge against local labor income risk. I find that the insider ownership and hedging channels are responsible for at least 29% and 11%, respectively, of the cross-country variation in international diversification. Thus, weak institutions lower international diversification primarily through concentrated ownership of firms, with outsider hedging also playing a quantitatively significant role.

In the basic model where the urban wage rate is exogenously given, the impacts of strengthened rural property rights on rural-urban migration and national welfare are determined by comparisons of the rent-gaining effect and the productivity-enhancing effect. Specifically, if the rent-gaining effect dominates the productivity-enhancing effect, strengthened rural property rights will increase the number of rural-urban migrants and reduce national welfare. Otherwise, the opposite impacts are exerted if the productivity-enhancing effect dominates the rent-gaining effect. When we extend the basic model by considering the endogenously determined urban minimum wage rate, the urban minimum wage determination mechanism is also of great importance in determining the outcomes of the basic model. When we extend the basic model by introducing an urban informal sector, the value of labor's marginal product of the urban informal sector also plays a role in determining the impact of strengthened rural property rights on national welfare. In addition, urban unemployment is also taken into account by the basic and extended models.","[Pi, Jiancai; Zhou, Yu] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Pi, JC (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, 22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",pi2008@nju.edu.cn; zhouyu_0105@hotmail.com,"Pi, Jiancai/AAY-5955-2021; Zhou, Yu/D-1999-2011","Pi, Jiancai/0000-0003-4327-8355;",Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),We would like to thank the editor Till Requate for his sincere help and encouragement.

A quantitative model in which business groups arise endogenously as substitutes for imperfect credit markets explains several stylized facts about establishment size distribution and cross-firm productivity differences. The impact of internal capital markets on economic development is positive: shutting down. business conglomeration in the model calibrated to the Canadian economy would lead to a 3 percent reduction in output per capita. These losses are higher in economies with less developed financial markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

With weekly spot and futures prices we show that three factors are preferred to describe the futures term structure, and the time-varying risk premiums are also significant. Moreover, we found that the market implies a seasonal risk premium with two peaks and troughs in one year, which is important to correctly price the futures by maturity month. Finally, we link this seasonal risk premium to the uncertainty of the US natural gas demand and find a positive relationship between them. These results reveal the complex aspect of the market, and may have useful applications for other commodity sectors.

In particular, the procedures proposed by Perron and Yabu (2009b) are employed to test for a one-time break in the trend function of each price series with no prior knowledge of whether the noise component is stationary or has an autoregressive unit root. Based on the results of the break estimate, the unit root test developed by Kim and Perron (2009) is performed to examine the stationarity of the prices. Finally, we extend the one-break analysis to the case with multiple breaks by employing the break test proposed by Kejriwal and Perron (2010) and the unit root test of Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2009). The results consistently demonstrate evidence of structural breaks and reject the unit root null hypothesis for all the price series, suggesting that energy prices are persistently influenced by long-term economic fundamentals instead of temporal policy changes.

Using this model, we are able to generate inflation dynamics and cyclicality of health that match the US data. When the model is subjected to an expansionary monetary policy shock, it yields different output and inflation responses compared with a two-sector model with homogeneous demand. We show that the trade-off between leisure and health spending plays an important role in model dynamics. The model further predicts different degrees of inflation stabilization across sectors when a shift in the monetary policy occurs.

This paper applies the job creation (JC)/destruction (JD) method to micro data of Japanese manufacturing firms and provides a bird's eye view of the dynamism of globalizing firms in terms of domestic employment, domestic establishments, domestic affiliates, exports, and imports. It examines gross and net changes in domestic operations by multinational enterprises (MNEs) that expand operations abroad (expanding MNEs), compared with non-expanding MNEs and local firms, for the periods of 1998-2002, 2002-06, 2006-08, and 2008-10. It also conducts the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to investigate whether the changes in domestic operations and trade by expanding MNEs are larger than those by other firm types. Major findings are the following: (1) gross changes in domestic employment and domestic operations are much larger than net changes, showing restructuring dynamism and firm heterogeneity; (2) de-industrialization or the shrinkage of the manufacturing sector is not relevant except for the period 1998-2002, though a slight declining trend in manufacturing activities is observed in recent years; (3) expanding multinational small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) tends to enlarge domestic employment and domestic operations, compared with other types of SMEs; (4) expanding MNEs intensify headquarters activities; and (5) expanding multinational SMEs are likely to expand exports and imports more than other types of SMEs.","[Ando, Mitsuyo] Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Kimura, Fukunari] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",Keio University; Keio University,"Ando, M (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Business & Commerce, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",m-ando@fbc.keio.ac.jp; fkimura@econ.keio.ac.jp,"Kimura, Fukunari/AAX-8044-2021",,Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,21,8,8,0,13,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

We extend the methodology pioneered by Feenstra (1994), and Broda and Weinstein (2006), and construct an export price index that adjusts for changes in the set of competitors (variety) and changes in non-price factors (quality in a broad sense) for six ASEAN members (the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) plus China, Japan and Korea. Based on trade data from UN COMTRADE at the Harmonized System six-digit level over the period 2000-2011, we find notable differences between price and non-price competitiveness across markets. China and Vietnam show huge gains in international competitiveness due to non-price factors, while we observe some deterioration in the non-price competitiveness of Japan and Singapore.

Interestingly, the results indicate that the degree of state dependence differs very little between individuals with different characteristics.","[Herault, Nicolas; Kalb, Guyonne] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Zakirova, Rezida] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Zakirova, Rezida] Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne; Boston University; Monash University,"Hérault, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",nherault@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012; Kalb, Guyonne/H-7383-2015","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390; Kalb, Guyonne/0000-0001-6582-8608",Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,Faculty of Business and Economics at the University of Melbourne,"This paper is based on research commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) under the Social Policy Research Services Agreement (2005-2009) with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.

We find that host girls aged six to nine at the arrival of the foster sibling significantly benefit in terms of school enrolment. We do not find any effect on host boys. Although cross-sectional, our survey data enable to implement different estimation strategies to measure the effect of interest limiting estimation bias due to the potential joint determination of decisions to host a foster child and to enrol one's child. Furthermore, we address a second issue commonly encountered by the literature: the identification of the foster children. Two groups are identified: children formally fostered-in and children informally fostered-in. Extending the group of foster children to include children informally fostered-in affects our results. One possible channel for the observed effect on host girls could be the release of liquidity constraints. Indeed the labour supply of mothers increases with the presence of foster girls, likely because foster girls replace them in their household tasks.","Univ Paris 01, IEDES, UMR Dev & Soc 201, F-75231 Paris 05, France",,"Marazyan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, IEDES, UMR Dev & Soc 201, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",karine.marazyan@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,27,2,2,0,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

We employ Markov-switching Bayesian vector autoregressions (MS-BVARs) to gather evidence about the hypothesis on a long annual U.S. sample running from 1890 to 2010. The sample covers several episodes useful for understanding U.S. economic and financial history, which generate variation in the data that aids in identifying credit supply and demand shocks. We identify these shocks within MS-BVARs by tying credit supply and demand movements to inside money and its intertemporal price. The model space is limited to stochastic volatility (SV) in the errors of the MS-BVARs. Of the 15 MS-BVARs estimated, the data favor a MS-BVAR in which economic and financial crises and noncrisis business cycle regimes recur throughout the long annual sample. The best-fitting MS-BVAR also isolates SV regimes in which shocks to inside money dominate aggregate fluctuations.","[Nason, James M.] N Carolina State Univ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; [Nason, James M.] Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Tallman, Ellis W.] Oberlin Coll, Oberlin, OH 44074 USA; [Tallman, Ellis W.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH USA",North Carolina State University; University System of Ohio; Oberlin College; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland,"Nason, JM (通讯作者)，N Carolina State Univ, Dept Econ, Campus Box 8110, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",jmnason@ncsu.edu,"Tallman, Ellis W./AAG-3312-2021","Tallman, Ellis/0000-0001-8387-2768",,,,,61,13,16,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Most of the literature that addresses these questions assumes complete information: agents know in advance the value of linking even with agents they have never met and with whom they have had no previous interaction (direct or indirect). This paper addresses the same questions under the much more natural assumption of incomplete information: agents do not know in advance-but must learn-the value of linking. We show that incomplete information has profound implications for the formation process and the ultimate topology. Under complete information, the network topologies that form and are stable typically consist of agents of relatively high value only. Under incomplete information, a much wider collection of network topologies can emerge and be stable. Moreover, even with the same topology, the locations of agents can be very different: An agent can achieve a central position purely as the result of chance rather than as the result of merit. All of this can occur even in settings where agents eventually learn everything so that information, although initially incomplete, eventually becomes complete. The ultimate network topology depends significantly on the formation history, which is natural and true in practice, and incomplete information makes this phenomenon more prevalent.","[Song, Yangbo] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA; [van der Schaar, Mihaela] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"van der Schaar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Elect Engn, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",darcy07@ucla.edu; mihaela@ee.ucla.edu,,"van der schaar, Mihaela/0000-0003-3933-6049",National Science Foundation (NSF) [CCF-1218136],National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank two anonymous referees for useful comments.

My analysis rests on an institutionalist-Minskyian endogenous instability assumption and maintains that monetary/financial stability is a peculiar public good or specific commons since it concerns all of society and its viability in time, not individuals involved in private financial relations. Consequently, the provision of financial stability becomes essentially a matter of public policy and requires the intervention of public power in order to prevent finance from becoming a public bad. This result relies on the distinction between private normal goods and ambivalent/transversal money (and related financial relations). I point to the necessity of a public organization and tight regulation of finance and financial markets, when standard equilibrium models assume that social optimum and stability can be provided by private self-adjustment and market prices mechanisms.","[Uelgen, Faruk] CREG, Econ, Grenoble, France; [Uelgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble Fac Econ, Grenoble, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，CREG, Econ, Grenoble, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,26,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Next, unlike many previous studies, I do find a positive and significant effect of secondary educational spending deflated using the traditional GDP deflator on both PISA math scores and literacy scores (both significant at the one percent level).

Finally, our causality analysis from panel vector error-correction model suggests that there is a feedback relation between real capital stock and real GDP in both short and long run, a one-way Granger causality running from real GDP to defense spending in both short and long run, and defense spending only Granger causes real capital stock in the long run.","[Chang, Tsangyao] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Finance, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Lee, Chien-Chiang] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chu, Hsiao-Ping] Ling Tung Univ, Dept Business Adm, Taichung, Taiwan",Feng Chia University; National Sun Yat Sen University,"Lee, CC (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan.",cclee@cm.nsysu.edu.tw,"Lee, Chien-Chiang/AAZ-9983-2020","Lee, Chien-Chiang/0000-0003-0037-4347",,,,,64,8,8,1,14,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

These methods were preferred since they are able to deal effectively with the second-order bias problems, an often characteristics of time series data. The impacts of price of crude oil, FDI, trade openness and industry structure are asymmetric which suggests the presence of structural effects in parameters. The impact of crude oil price is negative but becomes stronger post-1989 saving.126% more in energy consumption relative to pre-1989. Also, the impacts of FDI and trade openness are negative and significant but become stronger post-1989 saving 11.2% and 0.8% more in energy consumption relative to the baseline, respectively for every one percentage point increase in FDI and trade openness. The impact of industry value-added is positive and significant but weakens after 1989 consuming 1.8% less in energy for every one percentage point increase in industry value-added relative to the baseline. The energy reducing effect of industry value-added post-1989 reflects improvements in the technical characteristics of industrial sector in Nigeria. Last, the result showed that the absorptive capability and industry characteristics of Nigeria are important determinants of how FDI affects energy intensity. This implies that a more integrated FDI programme (considering the country characteristics) rather than a 'one-fit-all' programme is preferable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I model a city in which free knowledge transfers are bids by experts to entrepreneurs who auction jobs. These knowledge bids resemble a consultant's pitch to a potential client. Two fundamental properties of knowledge underlie the model: First, it is often necessary to reveal some knowledge to demonstrate its value. Second, knowledge is freely reproducible. Larger cities generate more meetings between experts and entrepreneurs, resulting in more learning and better matches. Larger cities also foster competition for jobs, which motivates experts to raise their knowledge bids. These results demonstrate how competitive behavior can be a source of agglomeration economies, and contribute to explain the higher productivity of urban workers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that they are accounted for by the growth in the extractive resources sectors, which benefited less-educated and younger workers the most.

It is known that when players perfectly observe each other's actions, cooperation can be achieved through gradual increases in contribution levels.

These studies, however, do not consider energy prices as a possible driver of energy demand (and hence of emissions) and we find that this omission and the choice of functional form materially alters the outcome in the US case.

We identify a new motivation for redistribution, where individuals support taxation in order to reduce the incentives to sort. We characterize a simple condition over income distributions which implies that even relatively rich voters with income above the mean-will prefer full equality (and thus no sorting) to societies with costly sorting. We show that the condition is satisfied for relatively equal income distributions.

Socio-economic characteristics have a moderate impact, while dwelling characteristics and especially household size have much larger impacts. The largest changes in energy expenditures are due to changes in household size.

Tony Lawson on neoclassical economics and heterodox economics,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Neoclassical; Heterodox; Lawson; Realism; Veblen; Social ontology; Taxonomic science; Evolutionary science,EXPLANATION; REALISM,"In this article I respond to Tony Lawson's 'What is this 'School' called neoclassical economics?' Lawson's paper is provocative because it reformulates neoclassical economics, based on Veblen's original intent, as a mismatch created by recognising the value of an evolutionary approach to the economy whilst remaining over-reliant on elements of a 'taxonomic' approach. For Lawson many heterodox economists may be neoclassical under this description. I argue that there is clearly a case to be heard but that the reformulation of the neoclassical raises a number of issues. There are issues concerning the specific critique of the current usage of the term 'neoclassical'-regarding genealogy and meaning. There are specific issues regarding the further development of the new (old Veblen) definition of the neoclassical: how clear is the definition in a practical context as a way to identify a 'neoclassical group', based on the commitments of the critique and the definition, what does it mean to be 'more realistic', and what is the strategic value of such a provocation for heterodoxy? I argue that the combination of these are reasons for more consideration of issues of social ontology not less insofar as the terms of the argument are incomplete, and this invites both Lawson and those he is criticising to progress the argument, particularly on method.","[Morgan, Jamie] Leeds Metropolitan Univ, Leeds LS1 3HE, W Yorkshire, England",Leeds Beckett University,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Leeds Beckett Univ, Fac Business & Law, Sch Accounting Finance & Econ, Portland Way, Leeds LS1 3HB, W Yorkshire, England.",jamiea.morgan@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,40,9,9,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Although emigration may directly cause brain drain, it generates a flow of knowledge acquired by emigrants abroad back to their home countries, which could be exploited under sound IPR institutions. IPRs can thus stimulate domestic innovation by creating the right environment to absorb potential gains from international migration. Using a panel dataset of emerging and developing countries, we show that emigration has a favorable effect on strengthening the link between IPR protection and innovation by making a new source of knowledge available to domestic innovators.

High rig rates in recent years have restricted development of new oil and gas fields, as well as IOR projects and thus increased the cost for importing countries. Thus, it is important to understand developments in rig rates. Using econometric analysis, we examine the effects on jackup rig rates from gas and oil prices, rig capacity utilisation, contract length and lead time, and rig-specific characteristics like drilling depth capacities and rig classification. Having access to a unique data set from the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), containing contract information, we are able to estimate how contract parameters crucial to the relative bargaining power between rig owners and oil and gas companies affect rig rates. We find that increasing lead times and contract lengths enhance the bargaining power of the rig companies and are likely to be associated with higher rates for new contracts. Further, we find that gas prices are more important for jackup rig rates in the GoM area than oil prices ten percent increase in gas prices leads to nine percent increase in rig rates in the long run, according to our results.

This paper tries to unravel these two effects by exploring a novel empirical strategy based on continuous time duration models with selection. We use a large longitudinal matched employer-employee dataset that allows us to identify about 220,000 individuals who have left their first entrepreneurial experience, out of which over 35,000 became serial entrepreneurs. We evaluate whether entrepreneurial experience acquired in the previous business improves serial entrepreneurs' survival, after taking into account self-selection issues. Our results show that serial entrepreneurs are not a random sample of ex-business owners. Robustness tests based on the estimation of the person-specific effect, using information on individuals' past histories in paid employment, confirm that serial entrepreneurs exhibit, on average, a larger person-specific effect than non-serial business owners. Moreover, ignoring serial entrepreneurs' self-selection overestimates learning by doing effects. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The modern international trade workhorse models (e.g. Melitz, 2003) assume heterogeneous productivity and, implicitly, predict that the ex-post largest exporters in a new product would be the pioneers, since they can pay back exploration costs. However, using detailed data on the early dynamics of new exports in Chile (1990-2007) we show that, on average, pioneers export less than comparable followers in the same new product. Moreover, followers are 40% more likely to enter a product if a pioneer survives more than one year exporting. These facts are consistent with pioneer-to-follower spillovers, or at least with stories in which the cost of entering early is disproportionally higher for larger exporters. Otherwise they would enter first. Firms better at exploration could be worse at exploitation (scale-up) in a new export product. This phenomenon is scarce, though, since in most new products pioneers are not followed, even if they survive. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

[3]. The setup features payoff externalities and strategic complementarily among players, who noncooperatively determine their contributions. We first analyze a two-stage game in which players in the leader group make contributions before the follower group. We construct an exact index to identify the (single) key leader, and demonstrate that the key leader can differ substantially from the key player who most influences the network in the simultaneous-move game. Using Taylor expansions on the strength of network effects, we establish an isomorphism between the optimal leader group selection (targeting) strategy and the classical weighted maximum-cut problem. This approach leads to some design principles for unweighted complete graphs and bipartite graphs. We then allow for an arbitrary sequence of players' moves. If we refine any sequence by making some groups of simultaneous movers act in sequence, their aggregate contribution increases. Consequently, the optimal sequence is a chain structure. When players have homogeneous intrinsic valuations, any chain, arbitrarily ordered, maximizes the aggregate contribution. We further consider the possibility of shrinking the number of stages needed for the optimal sequence. In general, our results hold when the network game exhibits strategic substitutes.

Theory of public choice predicts that either the government wins and business loses (the tollbooth hypothesis) or business wins and the government loses (regulatory capture theory). The theory of gatekeeping predicts that both the government and business win. Furthermore, the third agent's (the population's) pecuniary interests are also supposedly associated with the interests of the first two agents. A series of econometric tests using sub-national data from Russia show that the gatekeeper's interests are indeed positively associated with the interests of the businesses that manage to get admitted to the field of transactions. The population's interests also turn out to be correlated with the interests of the gatekeeper and business. The gains of the three agents tend to be unequally distributed, however. The market system in Russia ultimately works in the interests of state representatives who assume the gatekeeper's role and to a lesser extent in the interests of selected businesses.","[Oleinik, Anton] Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, Canada; [Oleinik, Anton] Russian Acad Sci, Cent Econ & Math Inst, Moscow, Russia",Memorial University Newfoundland; Russian Academy of Sciences; Central Economics & Mathematics Institute RAS,"Oleinik, A (通讯作者)，Mem Univ Newfoundland, St John, NF, Canada.",aoleynik@mun.ca,,,,,,,31,1,1,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,APR 3,2015,27.0,2,,,,,216,232,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1026695,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CI6LW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000354871800006,0

First, to argue that some of Haavelmo's (1944) methodological ideas and insights have been neglected because they are largely at odds with the traditional perspective that views empirical modeling in economics as an exercise in curve-fitting. Second, to make a case that this neglect has contributed to the unreliability of empirical evidence in economics that is largely due to statistical misspecification. The latter affects the reliability of inference by inducing discrepancies between the actual and nominal error probabilities. Third, to argue that the 'bridge pier' between theory and data, as envisaged by Haavelmo, T (1944) [The Probability Approach to Econometrics, Econometrica, 12 (supplement), 1-115], can be completed by blending some of his key methodological ideas and insights into a refined/extended version of the frequentist approach to inference. This new perspective is used to revisit dynamic stochastic general equilibrium modeling in an attempt to bring out the perspicacity and current relevance of some of Haavelmo's neglected ideas.","Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Spanos, A (通讯作者)，Virginia Tech, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",aris@vt.edu,"Spanos, Aris/P-8464-2019",,,,,,88,9,10,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

We explore how the optimal sorting of workers by ability in such environments depends on the degree of effort complementarity within groups. For moderately steep costs of effort, we find that the optimal sorting is balanced (i.e., minimizing the variance in ability between groups) when complementarity is weak, and unbalanced (i.e., maximizing the variance in ability) when complementarity is strong. However, when the cost of effort is sufficiently steep, the optimal sorting can be unbalanced for all levels of complementarity or even alternate between unbalanced and balanced as the level of complementarity increases.

The results generalize the comparative statics and welfare comparisons with respect to preferences in the seminal paper of Crawford and Sobel (Econometrica 50(6):1431-1452, 1982).

It is shown that sunk costs influence industry dynamics by reducing the speed of the replicator dynamics of competitive selection. Based on the theoretical model, we argue that sunk costs should lead to a reduction of market share reallocation dynamics and a larger share of stable firms. We validate these predictions empirically, finding that higher-sunk-cost industries have a larger share of stable firms and display lower market share dynamics.

In this article, we find that contractions in the stock of gross foreign claims on a country-a phenomenon we call gross foreign investment reversals (GIRs)-are also associated with output declines. GIRs are specially harmful during currency, current account, and sudden stop crises in emerging markets. Instrumental variables estimation suggests that this relationship is causal, running from GIR to output. Meanwhile, financial development and stocks of foreign assets can buffer emerging markets against the negative output effects of GIR. Jointly these findings suggest that changes in the composition of the current account, and not just its level or rate of change, can have first-order output effects. Thus, it may be important for future research to identify the determinants of GIR, a subject we only briefly touch on.","[Janus, Thorsten] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA; [Riera-Crichton, Daniel] Bates Coll, Dept Econ, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University of Wyoming,"Janus, T (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",drieracr@bates.edu,"Janus, Thorsten/K-5217-2019","Janus, Thorsten/0000-0002-6989-5258",Bates College (Faculty Development Grant),Bates College (Faculty Development Grant),Bates College (Faculty Development Grant to D.R.-C.),,70,2,2,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Recent research argues that models with persistent growth rate shocks and recursive preferences can solve that puzzle. I show that this result is highly sensitive to the structure of financial markets. When just a bond is traded internationally, then long-run risk generates insufficient exchange rate volatility. A long-run risk model with recursive preferences may generate realistic exchange rate volatility, if all agents efficiently share their consumption risk by trading in complete financial markets; however, this entails massive international wealth transfers, and excessive swings in net foreign asset positions. By contrast, a long-run risk, recursive-preferences model in which only a fraction of households trades in complete markets, while the remaining households lead hand-to-mouth lives, can generate realistic exchange rate and external balance volatility.","[Kollmann, Robert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Kollmann, Robert] CEPR, London EC1V 3PZ, England; [Kollmann, Robert] Univ Paris Est, F-94010 Creteil, France; [Kollmann, Robert] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Globalizat & Monetary Policy Inst, Dallas, TX 75201 USA; [Kollmann, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Australian National University,"Kollmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, CP 114,50 Av Franklin Roosevelt, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",robert_kollmann@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,9,11,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

We find that patterns of trade-induced layoffs are broadly consistent with the predictions for firm-level employment generated by the Melitz (2003) heterogeneous firms theory - the number of trade-induced layoffs increases with firm productivity for non-exporting firms but decreases with firm productivity for exporting firms. The fact that exporting firms incur trade-induced layoffs at all invites a refined interpretation of the theory. Our findings suggest that exporting firms may lay off some workers who work in production for their shrinking domestic segments, while also engaging in some within-firm reallocation of workers. We also find that, even after controlling for productivity and export status, larger firms lay off more workers due to trade competition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The first part provides a brief review of gender issues in the country. The second part presents a gender-based, three-period OLG model that accounts for women's time allocation between market work, child rearing, human capital accumulation, and home production. Bargaining between spouses depends on relative human capital stocks, and thus indirectly on access to infrastructure. The model is calibrated and various experiments are conducted, including investment in infrastructure, a reduction in gender bias in the market place, and a composite pro-growth, pro-gender reform program. The analysis showed that fostering gender equality, which may partly depend on the externalities that infrastructure creates in terms of women's time allocation and bargaining power, may have a substantial impact on long-run growth in Brazil.

Yet, there are no systematic empirical analyses examining how logistic infrastructure interacts with the location decisions made by multinationals. Most studies on the determinants of FDI address the issue of transportation-logistics by examining the impact of distance on the relevant outcome, but distance does not capture by itself the quality of the logistic systems in place. We overcome this shortcoming in the literature by embedding indicators of infrastructure into an empirical framework that examines whether countries with adequate logistic systems attract more vertical FDI and particularly in industries that are more dependent on logistic services. We find that logistic infrastructure positively impacts vertical FDI in addition to the impact typically found on distance. A change from the first quartile to the third quartile of the distribution of logistic infrastructure is associated with an average increase in the number of vertically-integrated subsidiaries equivalent to 29%.

Concerning efficiency of information aggregation or wisdom of the society, it turns out that misrepresentation of opinions need not undermine wisdom, but may even enhance it.

To capture this long-term relationship, a new index of gender equality that stretches back to 1950 is introduced. The determinants of this index are analysed using data on development and religious, legal, and family traditions. We find that variables measuring the long-lasting institutions of countries can be as important as economic development in determining gender equality outcomes.

Others argue that resources will have limited impact without systematic reforms to education governance, teacher incentives, and pedagogy. We examine a program under which school committees at randomly selected Kenyan schools were funded to hire an additional teacher on an annual contract renewable conditional on performance, outside normal Ministry of Education civil-service channels, at one-quarter normal compensation levels. For students randomly assigned to stay with existing classes, test scores did not increase significantly, despite a reduction in class size from 82 to 44 on average. In contrast, scores increased for students assigned to be taught by locally-hired contract teachers. One reason may be that contract teachers had low absence rates, while centrally-hired civil-service teachers in schools randomly assigned contract teachers endogenously reduced their effort. Civil-service teachers also captured rents for their families, with approximately 1/3 of contract teacher positions going to relatives of existing teachers. A governance program that empowered parents within school committees reduced both forms of capture. The best contract teachers obtained civil service jobs overtime, and we estimate large potential dynamic benefits from supplementing a civil service system with locally-hired contract teachers brought in on a probationary basis and granted tenure conditional on performance.

But this well-documented transition has in turn led to a shift in the structure of the food industry, with manufacturers and processors playing an ever-larger role relative to farmers-most prominently in the US and European countries, but also in the developing world. The shift is evident in employment patterns and trade patterns as well as in production and value addition. We argue that regulatory systems and policies still tend to equate food with farming, reflecting the realities of the last century more than the policy challenges of today.","[Gollin, Douglas] Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Gollin, Douglas] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Oxford OX2 6JF, England; [Probst, Lilli Teresa] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Gollin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Int Dev, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",douglas.gollin@qeh.ox.ac.uk; lilli.probst@gmx.de,,,,,,,23,9,9,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We examine the pattern of individuals' earnings growth and explore the importance of mobility as an equaliser of longer-term earnings. We find that progressive earnings growth decreased overall inequality even after considering the re-ranking that occurred in the distribution. This was partly driven by growth of earnings with age and partly by step changes associated with job-to-job moves, promotions and taking on more responsibility. Shocks also acted against this equalising process, most notably job loss, which had substantial negative effects on earnings and disproportionately fell on lower-waged workers.","[Gregg, Paul; Vittori, Claudia] Univ Bath, Dept Social & Policy Sci, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England; [Scutella, Rosanna] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia; [Vittori, Claudia] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Stat Sci, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Bath; University of Melbourne; Sapienza University Rome,"Scutella, R (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",r.scutella@unimelb.edu.au,,,,,,,46,2,2,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0249,1475-4932,,ECON REC,Econ.

Implemented in 2005, this transparency consists of hospitals' collecting and making publicly available a set of hospital quality score measures. The CMS induced participation by financially penalizing hospitals that did not publicly report a specific subset of these measures (called starter measures). Three years into the program, the penalty for non-reporting both the starter measures and other (non-starter) measures was increased. I use a difference-in-differences methodology to analyze the effect of the increased CMS penalty on the likelihood that a hospital publicly reported its starter and non-starter measure scores. I find that the penalty had an economically and statistically insignificant effect on the probability that a hospital publicly reported its starter scores, but a statistically significant 8.0 percent effect (p-value<0.01) on whether it reported its non-starter scores. These findings are robust to a series of alternative empirical specifications.","ABT Associates Inc, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",ABT Associates,"Marier, A (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,17,0,2,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The quality requirements in our paper are not set for the foreign firm but are set to regulate products of different qualities, since in the real world a domestic firm could be a high- or low-quality producer. We find that whether the government should raise the quality requirements depends on the type of competition in which firms engage and the adopted quality requirements. By and large, the government should always set quality requirements raising both firms' quality directly or indirectly, regardless of the quality of the product of the domestic firm. However, if the domestic firm is a high-quality producer, the government should set a quality requirement that enables the domestic firm to monopolize the market when a discriminatory quality requirement is adopted, and should not set any quality requirement when a uniform quality requirement is adopted. Moreover, we show that the quality requirement can actually improve global welfare in most cases.","[Chen, Yu-Yen] Natl Cent Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Chiou, Jiunn-Rong] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Taoyuan 32001, Taiwan; [Lin, Yan-Shu] Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Shoufong 97404, Hualien, Taiwan",National Central University; National Central University; National Dong Hwa University,"Lin, YS (通讯作者)，Natl Dong Hwa Univ, Dept Econ, Shoufong 97404, Hualien, Taiwan.",ylin@mail.ndhu.edu.tw,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

A note on foreign direct employment,APPLIED ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,gravity equation; foreign employment; Great Recession; FDI; banking crises; F21; F20; F23,DIRECT-INVESTMENT; FDI; GRAVITY; ETHICS,"This article studies the effect of credit constraints on the jobs created by multinational enterprises in host countries. Although most FDI is labour intensive, few studies delve into the determinants of foreign direct employment (FDE). This article constructs a model of limited commitment between the financed and financing parties to explain how FDE is affected by financial frictions. Moreover, this study examines FDE's determinants empirically on a global data set including FDE data from 161 countries during 2003-2010 by means of the gravity equation. Results show that credit constraints during the Great Recession roughly halved FDE, tripling the effect on FDI and suggesting that domestic jobs slightly outpaced foreign jobs.","[Paniagua, Jordi; Sapena, Juan] Catholic Univ Valencia San Vicente Martir, Fac Econ & Business, Valencia, Spain",Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir,"Paniagua, J (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Valencia San Vicente Martir, Fac Econ & Business, Valencia, Spain.",jordi.paniagua@ucv.es,"Sapena, Juan/C-6180-2014; Paniagua, Jordi/H-6353-2015","Sapena, Juan/0000-0003-2687-2184; Paniagua, Jordi/0000-0002-8859-0775",,,,,13,7,7,0,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We address this question in a canonical buyer-seller relationship with renegotiation. Our paper provides causal experimental evidence that an initial contract has a highly significant and economically important impact on renegotiation behavior that goes beyond the effect of contracts on bargaining threat points. We compare situations in which an initial contract is renegotiated to strategically equivalent bargaining situations in which no ex-ante contract was written. The ex-ante contract causes sellers to ask for markups that are 45% lower than in strategically equivalent bargaining situations without an initial contract. Moreover, buyers are more likely to reject given markups in renegotiations than in negotiations. These effects do not depend on whether the contract was written under competitive or monopolistic conditions. Our results provide strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that contracts serve as reference points that shape and coordinate the expectations of the contracting parties.","[Bartling, Bjoern] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Schmidt, Klaus M.] Univ Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Zurich; University of Munich,"Bartling, B (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland.",bjoern.bartling@econ.uzh.ch; klaus.schmidt@lmu.de,,"Schmidt, Klaus M./0000-0002-5011-0828; Bartling, Bjorn/0000-0002-9496-266X",,,,,25,29,33,0,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.
