Patients of 18 years or older who were diagnosed with NVAF and used anticoagulant therapy were studied. Treatment patterns and mean daily costs of hospitalization per patient as well as total costs of hospitalization were reported. Comparisons of mean daily costs with those of the previous day were presented to identify statistical cost differences between hospitalization days.Results:A total of 375,560 patients were identified; 67,017 with AF as admitting/primary diagnosis, and 308,543 with AF as a secondary diagnosis. The mean age of the overall population, primary AF diagnosis cohort, and secondary AF diagnosis cohort was 73.8, 67.9, and 75.0 years, while their proportion of females was 46.3%, 45.6%, and 46.5%, respectively. The mean length of stay was 6.8 days, 3.7 days, and 7.5 days for the overall population, the primary AF diagnosis cohort, and the secondary AF diagnosis cohort, respectively. For all cohorts, mean daily costs stabilized on the third day (overall population: $2103; primary AF diagnosis cohort: $1505; secondary AF diagnosis cohort: $2208).Limitations:Claims data may have contained inaccuracies or omissions in coded procedures, diagnoses, or pharmacy claims.Conclusion:The study showed that daily hospitalization costs for NVAF patients stabilized on the third day of hospitalization and that any reduction or prolongation in hospital length of stay could have a significant impact on the cost burden associated with AF.","[Dasta, Joseph F.] Univ Texas, Coll Pharm, Round Rock, TX USA; [Pilon, Dominic; Laliberte, Francois; Germain, Guillaume; Lefebvre, Patrick] Grp Anal Ltee, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Mody, Samir H.; Lopatto, Jessica; Bookhart, Brahim K.] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Raritan, NJ USA; [Nutescu, Edith A.] Univ Illinois, Coll Pharm, Chicago, IL USA",University of Texas System; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Germain, G (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Gauchetiere Ouest 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",guillaume.germain@analysisgroup.com,,"Nutescu, Edith/0000-0002-2651-0020","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ","This research was funded by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, Raritan, NJ.",,22,2,3,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

On the assumption that formulary committees are interested in testable predictions for product performance in target populations and ongoing disease area and therapeutic reviews, the methodological standards that should be applied are those that are accepted in the natural sciences. Claims should be presented in a form that is amenable to falsification. If not, they have no scientific standing. Certainly one can follow ISPOR-SMDM standards for validating the assumptions underpinning a model or simulation. There is clearly an important role for simulations as an input to policy initiatives and developing claims for healthcare interventions and testable hypotheses; however, one would not evaluate such claims on the realism or otherwise of the model. The only standard is one of the model's ability to predict outcomes successfully in a time frame that is practical and useful. No other standard is acceptable.

Adults with < 2 years of data, who were underweight (body mass index (BMI)<18.5kg/m(2)), or had diseases causing major weight change (e.g., malignancy) during the study period (i.e., continuous enrollment in health plans) were excluded. A total of 21 chronic conditions, with established association with obesity in the literature, were identified by diagnosis codes and/or lab test results. The total healthcare costs were measured in each year. The association between annual costs and ORCs was assessed by a regression, which jointly considered all the ORCs. The per-person incremental costs of a single comorbidity, without any of the other ORCs, were calculated. The population-level economic burden was the product of each ORC's incremental costs and the annual prevalence of the ORC among 100,000 individuals. The prevalence of ORCs was stratified by obesity status to estimate the economic burden among 100,000 individuals with obesity and among those without.Results:This study identified 56,895 adults (mean age=47 years; mean BMI=29.6kg/m(2)). The annual prevalence of ORCs ranged from 0.5% for pulmonary embolism (PE) to 41.8% for dyslipidemia. The per-person annual incremental costs of a single ORC ranged from $120 for angina to $1665 for PE. Hypertensive diseases (HTND), dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis were the three most expensive ORCs at the population level; each responsible for $18 million annually among 100000 individuals. HTND and osteoarthritis were much more costly among individuals with obesity than those without obesity.Limitations:Data were from a small geographic region.Conclusions:ORCs are associated with substantial economic burden, especially for those requiring continuous treatments.","[Li, Qian; Blume, Steven W.; Ganz, Michael L.] Evidera, Retrospect Observat Studies, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Huang, Joanna C.; Hammer, Mette] Novo Nordisk Inc, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Evidera; Novo Nordisk,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",qian.li@evidera.com,,,Novo Nordisk Inc.,Novo Nordisk Inc.(Novo Nordisk),This study and manuscript were funded by Novo Nordisk Inc.,,22,45,52,0,20,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Despite publication of technical guides for the conduct of mapping research, guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a new checklist, which aims to promote complete and transparent reporting of mapping studies. The primary audiences for the MAPS statement are researchers reporting mapping studies, the funders of the research, and peer reviewers and editors involved in assessing mapping studies for publication.A de novo list of 29 candidate reporting items and accompanying explanations was created by a working group comprised of six health economists and one Delphi methodologist. Following a two-round, modified Delphi survey with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies and the biomedical journal editorial community, a final set of 23 items deemed essential for transparent reporting, and accompanying explanations, was developed. The items are contained in a user friendly 23 item checklist. They are presented numerically and categorised within six sections, namely: (i) title and abstract; (ii) introduction; (iii) methods; (iv) results; (v) discussion; and (vi) other. The MAPS statement is best applied in conjunction with the accompanying MAPS explanation and elaboration document.It is anticipated that the MAPS statement will improve the clarity, transparency and completeness of reporting of mapping studies. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the MAPS statement is being co-published by seven health economics and quality of life journals, and broader endorsement is encouraged. The MAPS working group plans to assess the need for an update of the reporting checklist in five years' time.","[Petrou, Stavros; Froud, Robert] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford, England; [Dakin, Helen; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ London, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Froud, Robert] Norges Helsehoyskole, Oslo, Norway",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Brunel University,"Petrou, S (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021; Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018; Froud, Robert/AAQ-2429-2021","Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X; Froud, Robert/0000-0002-9193-2297; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544; Gray, Alastair/0000-0003-0239-7278; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862","Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0501681, G0700452] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,27,4,4,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Two main approaches exist to deal with this in network assignment models: Combine all qualities into a single (linear) utility function, or solve a multi-objective problem. The former has the advantages of a unique solution and efficient algorithms; the latter, however, is more general, but leads to many solutions and is difficult to implement in larger systems. In the present paper we present three alternative approaches for combining the principles of multi-objective decision-making with a stochastic user equilibrium model based on random utility theory. The aim is to deduce a tractable, analytic method. The three methods are compared both in terms of their theoretical principles, and in terms of the implied trade-offs, illustrated through simple numerical examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One key issue in airport facility development is that facility performance functions (delay levels as functions of capacity utilization rates) are nonlinear, which complicates the solution method design. Potential demand fluctuations in a deregulated aviation market add another dimension to the decision making process. To solve this problem, a deterministic total cost minimization model is proposed and then extended into stochastic programs, by including uncertainties in traffic forecasts. After the exploration of properties of the delay cost function, an Outer-Approximation (OA) technique which is superior to the existing discrete approximation is designed. After model enhancements, an efficient solution framework based on the OA technique is used to solve the model to its global optimality by interactively generating upper and lower bounds to the objective. Computational tests demonstrate the validity of developed models and efficiency of proposed algorithms. The total cost is reduced by 18.8% with the stochastic program in the numerical example.

Even though some attributes are intrinsically stochastic (e.g. travel times) or are subject to non-negligible measurement errors (e.g. waiting times), they are usually assumed fixed and deterministic. Indeed, even an accurate measurement can be biased as it might differ from the original (experienced) value perceived by the individual. Experimental evidence suggests that discrepancies between the values measured by the modeller and experienced by the individuals can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. On the other hand, there is an important trade-off between data quality and collection costs. This paper explores the inclusion of stochastic variables in discrete choice models through an econometric analysis that allows identifying the most suitable specifications. Various model specifications were experimentally tested using synthetic data; comparisons included tests for unbiased parameter estimation and computation of marginal rates of substitution. Model specifications were also tested using a real case databank featuring two travel time measurements, associated with different levels of accuracy. Results show that in most cases an error components model can effectively deal with stochastic variables. A random coefficients model can only effectively deal with stochastic variables when their randomness is directly proportional to the value of the attribute. Another interesting result is the presence of confounding effects that are very difficult, if not impossible, to isolate when more flexible models are used to capture stochastic variations. Due the presence of confounding effects when estimating flexible models, the estimated parameters should be carefully analysed to avoid misinterpretations. Also, as in previous misspecification tests reported in the literature, the Multinomial Logit model proves to be quite robust for estimating marginal rates of substitution, especially when models are estimated with large samples.

On the other hand, operational decisions such as demand fulfilment and shipment routing will impact on service capacity requirements and utilisation, particularly in the presence of demand uncertainty. This article proposes a two stage stochastic programming model with recourse to deal with the problem of joint service capacity planning and dynamic container routing in liner shipping. The first stage of the model concerns how to determine the optimal service capacity, and the second focuses on the optimal routing of shipments in stochastic and dynamic environments under a given service capacity plan. Initially, SAA (Sample Average Approximation) is employed to solve the model. Noting the computational complexity of the problem, Progressive Hedging Algorithm (PHA) is employed to decompose the SAA model into a number of scenario-based models so that reasonably large scale problems can be solved. To handle larger scale problems, we develop a new solution procedure termed as APHA (Adapted Progressive Hedging Algorithm) that further decomposes the scenario-based model into job (customer order) based models with measurable error bounds.

The estimated results can be biased due to low-sampling size and inaccurate travel diary data. For an accurate calibration of ABM parameters, a maximum-likelihood method that uses multiple sources of roadside observations (link counts and/or plate scanning data) is proposed. Plate scanning information (sensor path information) consists of sequences of times and partial paths that the scanned vehicles are observed over the preinstalled plate scanning locations. Statistical performances of the proposed method are evaluated on a test network using Monte Carlo technique for simulating the link flows and sensor path information. Multiday observations are simulated and derived from the true ABM parameters adopted in the choice models of activity pattern, time of the day, destination and mode. By assuming different number of plate scanning locations and identification rates, impacts of data quantity and data quality on ABM calibration are studied. The results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed model in using plate scanning information for ABM calibration and its potential for large and complex network applications.

We achieve this by combining the advantages of the two principles, namely the definition of unused routes in DUE and of mis-perception in SUE, such that the resulting choice sets of used routes are equilibrated. Two model families are formulated to address this issue: the first is a general version of SUE permitting bounded and discrete error distributions; the second is a Restricted SUE model with an additional constraint that must be satisfied for unused paths. The overall advantage of these model families consists in their ability to combine the unused routes with the use of random utility models for used routes, without the need to pre-specify the choice set. We present model specifications within these families, show illustrative examples, evaluate their relative merits, and identify key directions for further research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study introduces trip length heterogeneity into this analysis and proposes a usage-based, time-varying congestion toll that alleviates congestion while prioritizing shorter trips. Unlike conventional trip-based tolls the scheme is intended to align the fees paid by drivers with the actual congestion damage they do, and to increase the toll's benefits as a result. The scheme is intended to maximize the number of people that finish their trips close to their desired times. The usage-based toll is compared to a traditional, trip-based toll which neglects trip length. It is found that, like trip-based tolls, properly designed usage-based tolls alleviate congestion. But they reduce schedule delay more than trip-based tolls and do so with much smaller user fees. As a result usage-based tolls leave most of those who pay with a large welfare gain. This may increase the tolls' political acceptability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Shipments are assigned based on proximity and cost criteria to build an initial long-haul shipment solution. This initial solution is later improved by the implementation of Tabu Search algorithm. The proximity criterion takes into account the spatial distribution of shipments loads among centers.

This study aimed to describe these patients' treatment patterns, symptoms, and costs. Research design and methods: Retrospective study pooling data from three large administrative databases in the US (08/2011-06/2013). ALK+NSCLC patients with BM and continuous enrollment for >= 60 days before and >= 30 days after the first observed BM diagnosis were identified by pharmacy records for crizotinib among patients with lung cancer and BM diagnostic codes. Main outcome measures: Treatment patterns, symptoms, healthcare resource utilization, and costs, before and after BM diagnosis. Results: Of the 213 crizotinib patients with BM diagnoses meeting the selection criteria, 23.0% had BM prior to NSCLC diagnosis; 47.4% had BM prior to crizotinib initiation; 19.2% during crizotinib treatment; and 10.3% post-crizotinib treatment. For those diagnosed with BM after NSCLC diagnosis, the median time between the NSCLC and BM diagnoses was 88 days. Following the first observed BM diagnosis, 88.7% used chemotherapy, 63.4% had radiotherapy, and 31.9% had stereotactic radiosurgery. The prevalence of BM-related symptoms substantially increased post-BM-diagnosis: fatigue (from 15% to 39%), headaches (from 5% to 24%), and depression (from 5% to 15%). Monthly costs per patient averaged $5983 before the BM diagnosis and $22,645 after diagnosis. Patients' resource utilization increased significantly post-BM-diagnosis, with a 3-fold increase in OP visits and a 6-fold increase in IP stays. Post-BM-diagnosis costs were driven by pharmacy (42.0%), inpatient (29.6%), and outpatient costs (26.0%). Limitations: The study sample was limited to crizotinib-treated patients. Conclusions: Post-BM-diagnosis, patients experience high symptom burden. Post-BM-diagnosis, treatment is highly variable and costly: average monthly costs per patient almost quadrupled post-BM-diagnosis.","[Guerin, Annie; Dea, Katherine; Nitulescu, Roy] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Sasane, Medha; Zhang, Jie; Culver, Kenneth W.] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Wu, Eric Qiong] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.,"Guérin, A (通讯作者)，1000 Gauchetiere Ouest,Bur 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",annie.guerin@analysisgroup.com,,,,,,,0,77,83,0,7,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of Y-90-resin microspheres compared to best supportive care (BSC) from a UK perspective. Methods: Survival data from a comparative retrospective cohort study was analyzed and used in a state-transition cost-effectiveness model, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as the measure of effectiveness. The model incorporated costs for the SIRT procedure, monitoring, further treatment, adverse events, and death. Utility values, reflecting patient quality-of-life, were taken from a published source. Results: SIRT using Y-90-resin microspheres compared to BSC improved overall survival by a mean of 1.12 life years and resulted in a cost per QALY gained of 28,216 pound. In sensitivity analysis, this varied between 25,015- pound 28,817 pound.

Methods: Observational data were obtained from HUGS-Va, a multi-center study from six federally supported hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs). Eligible individuals completed a standardized initial questionnaire and were followed regularly for 2 years to obtain information on work or school absenteeism, time spent arranging hemophilia care, and unpaid hemophilia-related support from caregivers. Data from 1-year healthcare utilization records and 2-year clotting factor dispensing records measured direct medical costs. Indirect costs were imputed using the human capital approach, which uses wages as a proxy measure of work time output. Results: A total of 222 patients with complete data were included in the analysis. Two-thirds had severe hemophilia and the mean age was 21.1 years. The use of prophylaxis in severe hemophilia patients is associated with statistically significant reduction in the numbers of emergency department (ED) visits and bleeding episodes compared with those who were treated episodically. From the societal perspective, mild hemophilia costs $59,101 (median: $7519) annually per person, $84,363 (median: $61,837) for moderate hemophilia, $201,471 (median: $143,431) for severe hemophilia using episodic treatment, and $301,392 (median: $286,198) for severe hemophilia receiving prophylaxis. Clotting factor contributed from 54% of total costs in mild hemophilia to a maximum of 94% for patients with severe hemophilia receiving prophylaxis. Conclusion: Hemophilia is a costly disorder not only because of its high medical expenses, but also due to the high indirect costs incurred.","[Zhou, Zheng-Yi; Johnson, Kathleen A.; Poon, Jiat-Ling; Lou, Mimi; Nichol, Michael B.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Koerper, Marion A.] Univ Calif San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA; [Riske, Brenda] Univ Colorado, Denver, CO 80202 USA; [Baker, Judith R.] Ctr Inherited Blood Disorders, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Baker, Judith R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Ullman, Megan] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Curtis, Randall G.] Factor VIII Comp, Berkeley, CA USA",University of Southern California; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston,"Nichol, MB (通讯作者)，Leonard Schaeffer Ctr Hlth Policy & Econ, Ralph & Goldy Lewis Hall 326, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",mnichol@usc.edu,"Nichol, Michael/AHE-6000-2022; Curtis, Randall G./AAK-6462-2020","Baker, Judith R./0000-0002-7850-0027; Nichol, Michael/0000-0003-4989-9806",Baxter Healthcare Corporation; Bayer Foundation; CSL Behring; Novo Nordisk; Wyeth/Pfizer; Federal Hemophilia Treatment Centers/Region IX; Grifols; CHOC at Home,Baxter Healthcare Corporation; Bayer Foundation(Bayer AG); CSL Behring; Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation); Wyeth/Pfizer(WyethPfizer); Federal Hemophilia Treatment Centers/Region IX; Grifols; CHOC at Home,"This project was supported by grants from Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Bayer Foundation, CSL Behring, Novo Nordisk, and Wyeth/Pfizer, with additional financial support from the Federal Hemophilia Treatment Centers/Region IX, Grifols, and CHOC at Home.",,0,79,84,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The framework combines Bhat's Generalized Heterogeneous Data Model (GHDM) with a spatial (social) formulation to parsimoniously introduce spatial (social) dependencies through latent constructs. The applicability of the spatial GHDM framework is demonstrated through an empirical analysis of spatial dependencies in a multidimensional mixed data bundle comprising a variety of household choices - household commute distance, residential location (density) choice, vehicle ownership, parents' commute mode choice, and children's school mode choice - along with other measurement variables for two latent constructs - parent's safety concerns about children walking/biking to school and active lifestyle propensity. The GHDM framework identifies an intricate web of causal relationships and endogeneity among the endogenous variables. Furthermore, the spatial (social) version of the GHDM model reveals a high level of spatial (social) dependency in the latent active lifestyle propensity of different households and moderate level of spatial dependency in parents' safety concerns. Ignoring spatial (social) dependencies in the empirical model results in inferior data fit, potential bias and statistical insignificance of the parameters corresponding to nominal variables, and underestimation of policy impacts.

In evaluating an uncertain travel time, we explicitly distinguish between risk, where the probability distribution is precisely known, and ambiguity, where it is not. In particular, we propose a new criterion called ambiguity aware CAM travel time (ACT) for evaluating uncertain travel times under various attitudes of risk and ambiguity, which is a preference based on blending the Hurwicz criterion and Constant Absolute Risk Aversion (CARA). More importantly, we show that when the uncertain link travel times are independently distributed, finding the path that minimizes travel time under the ACT criterion is essentially a shortest path problem. We also study the implications on Network Equilibrium (NE) model where travelers on the traffic network are characterized by their knowledge of the network uncertainty as well as their risk and ambiguity attitudes under the ACT. We derive and analyze the existence and uniqueness of solutions under NE. Finally, we obtain the Price of Anarchy that characterizes the inefficiency of this new equilibrium. The computational study suggests that as uncertainty increases, the influence of selfishness on inefficiency diminishes.

The results support the study's argument and show that business performance is maximised when continuous improvement programmes targeted at CSP are carried out at a gradual pace and at regular intervals.

Used as a proxy for real-world static stability, this constraint excessively restricts the container space utilization and has conditioned the algorithms developed for this problem. In this paper we propose a container loading algorithm with static stability constraints based on the static mechanical equilibrium conditions applied to rigid bodies, which derive from Newton's laws of motion. The algorithm is a multi-population biased random-key genetic algorithm, with a new placement procedure that uses the maximal-spaces representation to manage empty spaces, and a layer building strategy to fill the maximal-spaces. The new static stability criterion is embedded in the placement procedure and in the evaluation function of the algorithm. The new algorithm is extensively tested on well-known literature benchmark instances using three variants: no stability constraint, the classical full base support constraint and with the new static stability constraint a comparison is then made with the state-of-the-art algorithms for the CLP. The computational experiments show that by using the new stability criterion it is always possible to achieve a higher percentage of space utilization than with the classical full base support constraint, for all classes of problems, while still guaranteeing static stability. Moreover, for highly heterogeneous cargo the new algorithm with full base support constraint outperforms the other literature approaches, improving the best solutions known for these classes of problems.

Such phenomenon is especially typical in public hospitals. The objective of this study is to estimate the potential cost savings in procurement by Chinese public hospitals when switching from brand originators of anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medications to their generic equivalents between 2012-2014. Method: IMS Health volume and value consumption data (IMS China Hospitals Audit system 2012-2014) were used, which covered all Chinese hospitals with 100 beds and above. The top 60% IMS volume consumption of respective anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic medication with unique dosage form and strength were included. The potential cost savings were calculated from a switch of brand originators with their generic equivalents on the Chinese and international market. An independent sample t-test was conducted to compare the difference of proportion of cost savings in value between the Chinese and international market. Results: An average of 44% (US$44 million) and 87% (US$90 million) and a total of US$1.4 and 2.8 billion (2014US$) could be saved from a switch from originator brand anti-hypertensives and anti-diabetics to domestically and internationally available generic equivalents, respectively. The differences of cost savings (in proportion) between domestic and international market were statistically significant (alpha=0.005, p=0.003, p=0.002, p=0.000). Conclusion: Expensive brand originators dominated the anti-hypertensive and anti-diabetic market in Chinese hospitals between 2012-2014. Preference of brand originators wastes a huge amount of health resources in China and these limited resources could have been used more efficiently. As one of the world's key generic suppliers, if China wants to use its health resource more efficiently on medicines, comprehensive measures are needed to address both demand-side (consumers' low trust in the quality of local generics) and supply-side barriers (health professionals' preference of brand originators).","[Sun, Jing] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr Food & Drug Safety, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China; [Ren, Luo] IMS Inst Healthcare Informat Beijing, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wirtz, Veronika] Boston Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Global Hlth, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College; Boston University,"Sun, J (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Nutr Food & Drug Safety, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",sunjing@sph.pumc.edu.cn,"Wirtz, Veornika/AAG-9712-2019","Wirtz, Veronika J./0000-0002-0863-8768",,,,,31,7,9,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A conceptual model which characterizes the antecedents of supplier hoarding intention is proposed, and validated using survey data. Grounded in the empirical study, an analytical model is then proposed for decision analysis of a two-tier crop supply chain recovering from post-disaster supply disruptions. Analytical results indicate that hoarding behavior reduces the time taken by supply chain members for supply recovery; and however, contributes to mixed effects on the expected profits of supply chain members.

Inevitably, the observed link flows are subject to measurement errors, which will accumulate and propagate in the inference of the unobserved link flows, leading to uncertainty in the inference process. In this paper, we develop a robust network sensor location model for complete link flow observability, while considering the propagation of measurement errors in the link flow inference. Our model development relies on two observations: (1) multiple sensor location schemes exist for the complete inference of the unobserved link flows, and different schemes can have different accumulated variances of the inferred flows as propagated from the measurement errors. (2) Fewer unobserved links involved in the nodal flow conservation equations will have a lower chance of accumulating measurement errors, and hence a lower uncertainty in the inferred link flows. These observations motivate a new way to formulate the sensor location problem. Mathematically, we formulate the problem as min-max and min-sum binary integer linear programs. The objective function minimizes the largest or cumulative number of unobserved links connected to each node, which reduces the chance of incurring higher variances in the inference process. Computationally, the resultant binary integer linear program permits the use of a number of commercial software packages for its globally optimal solution. Furthermore, considering the non-uniqueness of the minimum set of observed links for complete link flow observability, the optimization programs also consider a secondary criterion for selecting the sensor location scheme with the minimum accumulated uncertainty of the complete link flow inference.

Evidence of enrollment in the VHA was required from 365 days before (pre-index) to 360 days after (post-index) the date of the first biologic claim (index date). Included patients had pre-index diagnoses of RA, PsO, PsA, and/or AS. Drug costs were from Federal Supply Schedule or Big Four' in November 2014. Administration costs were VHA fixed costs for infused ($169) and subcutaneous ($25) biologics.Results:Of the 20,465 patients in the analysis, 10,711 received etanercept, 7838 received adalimumab, and 1196 received infliximab as the index biologic. In these patients, across all uses studied, the VHA incurred greater annual cost per treated patient for infliximab ($18,066) compared with adalimumab ($16,523) and etanercept ($16,526). In the first year post-index, approximate to 80% of patients were either persistent on these index biologics or re-started these index biologics after a 45-day treatment gap. Other biologics comprised <5% of the study population, with sample sizes ranging from 3-374 patients each. Cost by indication for biologics used by >20 patients ranged from $15,056 (etanercept) to $17,050 (abatacept) for RA; $16,697 (adalimumab) to $33,163 (ustekinumab) for PsO; $15,035 (etanercept) to $20,465 (infliximab) for PsA; and $14,239 (etanercept) to $18,536 (infliximab) for AS.Limitations:The model was limited to the VHA.

Methods The Centre for Outcomes Research and Effectiveness (CORE) Diabetes Model was used for the cost-utility analysis. Data from three Phase 3 clinical trials (HARMONY 6, HARMONY 4, and HARMONY 3) evaluating albiglutide for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes were used for the baseline characteristics and treatment effects. Utilities and costs were derived from published sources. Results Albiglutide treatment was associated with an improvement in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.099, 0.033, and 0.101 years when compared with insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin, respectively. Over the 50-year time horizon, mean total costs in the albiglutide arm were $4332, $2597, and $2223 more than in the other respective treatments. These costs resulted in an incremental cost-utility ratio of $43,541, $79,166, and $22,094 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for albiglutide vs insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained, there was a 53.0%, 41.5%, and 67.5% probability of albiglutide being cost-effective compared with the other respective treatments. Limitations This analysis was an extrapolation over a 50-year time horizon based on relatively short-term data obtained during clinical trials. It does not take into account potential differences between the respective treatments in adherence and persistence that can influence both effects and costs. Conclusions Albiglutide represents a reasonable treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes based on its cost-utility, relative to insulin lispro, insulin glargine, and sitagliptin.","[Bruhn, David] GlaxoSmithKline, 5 Moore Dr,POB 13398, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Martin, Alan A.] GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Tavares, Ruben] GlaxoSmithKline, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Hunt, Barnaby; Pollock, Richard F.] Ossian Hlth Econ & Commun GmbH, Basel, Switzerland",GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline; GlaxoSmithKline,"Bruhn, D (通讯作者)，GlaxoSmithKline, 5 Moore Dr,POB 13398, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.",david.x.bruhn@gsk.com,,"Pollock, Richard/0000-0002-9873-7507",GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),This study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline.,,43,8,10,2,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Models used data from a 'real world' representative sample of patients (2012 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) that matched the characteristics of US patients enrolled in the randomized controlled trial 'AUTONOMY' cohort. The base-case time horizon was 10 years. Results The modeling results from TTM demonstrated that total costs in the base-case were reduced by $1732, with savings predicted to occur as early as year 1. Results from the three models were consistent, showing a reduction in total costs for all sensitivity analyses. Limitations Data from short-term clinical trials were used to develop long-term projections. The nature of such extrapolation leads to increased uncertainty. Conclusion The results from all three models indicate that the AUTONOMY Q1D algorithm has the potential to abate total costs as early as the first year.","[Curtis, Bradley H.; Curtis, Sarah; Murray, James; Numapau, Nana; Bonner, Jeffrey S.; Liu, Rong; Johnson, Jennal; Glass, Leonard C.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Murphy, Daniel R.; Gahn, James C.; Perk, Sinem; Smolen, Harry J.] Med Decis Modeling Inc, Indianapolis, IN USA",Eli Lilly; Medical Decision Modeling Inc.

The model incorporated equal efficacy, adverse events (AE), resource use, and costs from literature. Costs of once- and twice-daily outpatient infusions to achieve a 14-day treatment were analyzed. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Costs were adjusted to 2015 US$.Results:Total non-drug medical cost for treatment of ABSSSI entirely in the outpatient setting to avoid hospital admission was the lowest among all scenarios and ranged from $4039-$4924. Total non-drug cost for ABSSSI treated in the inpatient setting ranged from $9813 (3 days LOS) to $18,014 (7 days LOS). Inpatient vs outpatient cost breakdown was: 3 days inpatient ($6657)/11 days outpatient ($3156-$3877); 7 days inpatient ($15,017)/7 days outpatient ($2495-$2997). Sensitivity analyses revealed a key outpatient cost driver to be peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) costs (average per patient cost of $873 for placement and $205 for complications).Limitations:Drug and indirect costs were excluded and resource use was not differentiated by ABSSSI type. It was assumed that successful ABSSSI treatment takes up to 14 days per the product labels, and that once-daily and twice-daily antibiotics have equal efficacy.Conclusion:Shifting ABSSSI care to outpatient settings may result in medical cost savings greater than 53%. Typical outpatient scenarios represent 14-37% of total medical cost, with PICC accounting for 28-43% of the outpatient burden. The value of new ABSSSI therapies will be driven by eliminating the need for PICC line, reducing length of stay and the ability to completely avoid a hospital stay.","[Ektare, V.; Khachatryan, A.; Xue, M.; Stephens, J.] Pharmerit Int, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Dunne, M.; Johnson, K.] Durata Therapeut, Chicago, IL USA",Pharmerit North America LLC,"Stephens, J (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway,Suite 430, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",jstephens@pharmerit.com,"Dunne, Michael W/AAD-7418-2020","Dunne, Michael W/0000-0001-6186-5196","Durata Therapeutics, in Chicago, IL","Durata Therapeutics, in Chicago, IL","This study was sponsored by Durata Therapeutics, in Chicago, IL.",,29,46,47,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

All-cause and MDD-related healthcare resource use and costs (in 2012 USD) were compared between patients treated with vilazodone vs other SSRIs over a 6-month follow-up period using unadjusted and multivariable analyses.Results:The study cohort included 49 861 patients (mean age=44.0 years; 70% female). Compared with the vilazodone cohort (n=3527), patients in the citalopram (n=12 187), escitalopram (n=8275), fluoxetine (n=10 142), paroxetine (n=3146), and sertraline (n=12 584) cohorts had significantly more all-cause inpatient hospital visits, longer hospital stays and more frequent emergency department visits, following the index date, after adjusting for baseline characteristics. All-cause medical service costs (inpatient+outpatient+emergency department visits) were significantly higher across all other SSRI cohorts vs vilazodone by $758-$1165 (p<0.05). Similarly, all-cause total costs, were significantly or numerically (non-significantly) higher across all SSRI cohorts vs vilazodone by $351-$780.Limitations:The was no clinical measurement of disease severity, partial coverage of the Medicare-eligible population, and short follow-up.Conclusion:MDD treatment with vilazodone was associated with significantly lower rates of inpatient and emergency services, and with significantly lower all-cause medical service costs and numerically (non-significantly) lower total costs to payers than with the other SSRIs included in this study.","[Zhou, Zheng-Yi; Chopra, Pooja; Zhong, Yichen; Totev, Todor; Signorovitch, James] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Sun, Shawn] Forest Res Inst Inc, Jersey City, NJ USA",Analysis Group Inc.; Forest Research Institute Inc.,"Zhou, ZY (通讯作者)，10 Rockefeller Pl,15th Floor, New York, NY 10020 USA.",jenny.zhou@analysisgroup.com,"Totev, Todor/AAP-6782-2020; Zhong, Yichen/AAQ-5282-2020","Totev, Todor/0000-0003-0253-325X; Zhong, Yichen/0000-0002-1560-3643","Forest Research Institute, Inc.","Forest Research Institute, Inc.","This research was sponsored by Forest Research Institute, Inc., an affiliate of Actavis, Inc.",,73,4,4,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Similar to the recursive logit (RL) model proposed by Fosgerau et al. (2013), the choice of path is modeled as a sequence of link choices and the model does not require any sampling of choice sets. Furthermore, the model can be consistently estimated and efficiently used for prediction. A key challenge lies in the computation of the value functions, i.e. the expected maximum utility from any position in the network to a destination. The value functions are the solution to a system of non-linear equations. We propose an iterative method with dynamic accuracy that allows to efficiently solve these systems. We report estimation results and a cross-validation study for a real network. The results show that the NRL model yields sensible parameter estimates and the fit is significantly better than the RL model. Moreover, the NRL model outperforms the RL model in terms of prediction.

Predictors and sub-groups of negative post-fracture outcomes (high costs and extensive healthcare utilization) were identified in patients with and without muscle atrophy/weakness (MAW). Methods: Truven Health MarketScan data identified patients >= 50 years old with inpatient hospitalizations for hip fracture. Patients had >= 12 months of continuous healthcare insurance prior to and following index hospitalization and no hip fracture diagnoses between 7 days and 1 year prior to admission. Predictors and sub-groups of negative outcomes were identified via multiple logistic regression analyses and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses, respectively. Results: Post-fracture 1-year all-cause healthcare costs (USD$31,430) were higher than costs for the prior year ($18,091; p<0.0001). Patients with MAW had greater post-fracture healthcare utilization and costs than those without MAW (p<0.05). Greater post-fracture costs were associated with a higher number of prior hospitalizations and emergency room visits, length of index hospitalization, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), and discharge status; diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, or osteoporosis; and prior use of antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, opioids, and oral corticosteroids (all p<0.009). High-cost patient sub-groups included those with MAW and high CCI scores.

This paper tackles the berthing congestion problem by introducing a proactive management strategy from the terminal's perspective that adjusts the calling schedule of feeder vessels in such a way that the quay-side workload distribution in the temporal dimension can be balanced. Such a schedule template design problem is considered simultaneously with another two tactical level decision problems, berth template design (i.e., determining preferred berthing positions for vessels) and yard template design (i.e., allocating storage yard space to transshipment flows). This highly integrated problem is formulated as a set covering model. Heuristic methods based on column generation are developed to obtain near-optimal solutions in an efficient way. Computational experiments on real-world sized test instances demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The most recently introduced PI, simeprevir (SMV), offers high levels of viral eradication combined with a reduced overall duration of therapy. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of SMV+PR vs PR alone or in combination with telaprevir (TVR) or boceprevir (BOC) in patients infected with genotype 1 HCV Method: A cost-utility model was constructed, incorporating two phases, capturing the efficacy of therapy in an initial treatment phase, followed by a long-term post-treatment Markov phase, capturing lifetime outcomes according to whether a sustained viral response (SVR) had been achieved on treatment. Dosage regimens were based on the EMA approved label for each treatment. SVR estimates and adverse event rates were derived from a mixed treatment comparison. Baseline characteristics were drawn from an analysis of a UK HCV data-set and clinician opinion. Health state transition probabilities, utilities, and health state costs were drawn from previously published economic analyses. The model considered direct health costs only, and the perspective was that of the UK National Health Service. Results: The model yielded an ICER for SMVPR vs PR alone of 9725 pound/QALY for treatment-naive and 7819 pound/QALY for treatment-experienced. Benefit was driven by increased likelihood of achieving SVR, with consequent long-term utility gains. SMV+PR dominated TVR+PR and BOC+PR in both patient groups. This principally reflected the QALY benefit of an increased likelihood of SVR with SMV, combined with lower overall drug costs, due to reduced mean treatment duration. Conclusion: Compared to other currently licensed treatment options, SMV+PR represents a cost effective treatment option for patients with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection.","[Westerhout, Kirsten; Treur, Maarten] Pharmerit, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Mehnert, Angelika] Janssen EMEA, Beerse, Belgium; [Pascoe, Katie; Ladha, Imran] Janssen, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Belsey, Jonathan] JB Med, Sudbury, ON, Canada",Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals; Johnson & Johnson,"Belsey, J (通讯作者)，JB Med Ltd, Chapel Lane, Little Cornard CO10 5JU, Sudbury, England.",jbelsey@jbmedical.com,,"Pascoe, Katie/0000-0001-5742-4654",Janssen EMEA,Janssen EMEA,The study was funded by Janssen EMEA.,,41,10,12,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

As a consequence of the evolution of urban form, cities have undergone a process of dispersion of their activities that has caused a change in mobility needs in the last few decades. Mobility networks and services should progressively adapt to the new demand patterns, especially the bus transit network, which has more flexibility to absorb the changes. We compare four base transit network structures: a radial scheme, a direct trip-based network, and a transfer-based system by means of either a complete grid or a hybrid structure. An analytical model is used to estimate the behavior of these structures for idealized monocentric mobility patterns with several degrees of concentration. The purpose is to determine the right range of situations for the applicability of each bus transit structure, and to determine guidelines about the transit network planning process. It turns out that the best structure is not always the same, and depends on the mobility spatial pattern. A radial network is the best alternative in very concentrated cities; however, a direct trip-based system is more suitable for intermediate degrees of dispersion. A transfer-based structure is the best option when the activities are more decentralized. Nevertheless, the decentralization degree that justifies a specific transit structure is not constant. This degree depends on the characteristics of the city, transport technology and users. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results extend the existing market design theory so that money flow is allowed in the matching mechanisms. We consider two cases of money flow: (i) one agent who fails to exchange his parking slot can join the leasing mechanism as a lessor; and (ii) one agent who fails in parking slot exchange can always transfer (rent) his parking slots to the platform. Each agent is self-interested. We propose the (price-compatible) top trading cycles and deals (TTCD) mechanism for case (i) and the price-compatible top trading cycles and chains (PC-TTCC) mechanism for case (ii). Both mechanisms are effective in terms of the compatibility with money flow, agents' welfare, and strategy-proofness. Our experimental results further show that the proposed mechanisms would result in remarkable social welfare, and (ex post) budget balance for the platform in a big city with large population. In some realistic settings, our proposed mechanisms can almost realize cost saving of 60% and make more than 50% of agents strictly better off. There is no private parking slot sharing in the benchmark case. Overall, this paper opens the door to the solutions of a host of price-compatible matching problems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) is formulated as a Variational Inequality problem defined on temporal profiles of arc conditional probabilities that express a sequence of deterministic route choices taken at nodes by road users directed toward each destination. Congestion is represented through a macroscopic traffic model capable to reproduce a range of phenomena having increasing complexity, from links with bottleneck to intersections with spillback. Different time discretizations, from few seconds to few minutes, are also possible, which allows a range of applications from planning to operation. This assignment model, which is fully link based, is proved to be equivalent to a path based formulation. It also allows for the computation of a handy gap function for analyzing convergence to equilibrium. Numerical experiments on test networks are presented, showing that the proposed GP algorithms converge to dynamic equilibrium in a reasonable number of iterations, outperforming the Method of Successive Averages (VISA).

However, port cost functions specify port cost as functions of physical products, e.g., port cargo throughput long-run cost is a function of port resource prices and cargo throughput (a physical product). In comparison, port cargo service long-run cost is a function of port resource prices, cargo service and shipper cargo received. The shipper provides cargo that is serviced by the port. A service cannot be touched and its user is involved in its provision. This paper derives port cost functions for which port outputs are service outputs, e.g., cargo, vessel and vehicle services.

As opposed to PR, bounded rationality (BR) has recently regained researchers' attention since it Was first introduced into transportation science in the 1980s due to its power in more realistic travel behavior modeling and prediction. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on the models of BR route choice behavior, aiming to identify current research gaps and provide directions for future research. Despite a small but growing body of studies on employing bounded rationality principle, BR route chbice behavior remains understudied due to the following reasons: (a) The existence of BR thresholds leads to mathematically intractable properties of equilibria; (b) BR parameters are usually latent and difficult to identify and estimate; and (c) BR is associated with human being's cognitive process and is challenging to model. Accordingly, we will review how existing literature addresses the aforementioned challenges in substantive and procedural bounded rationality models. Substantive bounded rationality models focus on choice outcomes while procedural bounded rationality models focus on the empirical studies of choice processes. Bounded rationality models in each category can be further divided based on whether time dimension is included. Accordingly, static and dynamic traffic assignment are introduced in substantive bounded rationality while two-stage cognitive models and day-to-day learning models in procedural bounded rationality are discussed. The methodologies employed in substantive bounded rationality include game theory and interactive congestion game, while those in procedural bounded rationality mainly adopt random utility and non- or semi-compensatory models. A comparison of all existing methodologies are given and bounded rationality models' scope and boundaries in terms of predictability, transferability, tractability, and scalability are discussed. Finally existing research gaps are presented and several promising future research directions are given. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A passenger reassignment solution is demonstrated to be optimal in each iteration for a special case. The effectiveness of the heuristic is illustrated through experiments based on synthetic and real-world datasets. It is shown that the integrated recovery of flights and passengers can decrease both the recovery cost and the number of disrupted passengers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a matter of fact, the excessive amount of participants taking part in all the phases of the supply chain has created the basis for an increase of environmental impacts due to many factors: the implementation of farming methods, which are getting more and more intensive, put pressure on the environment, on the sustainability of the agricultural industrial production process and increase the number of kilometres the goods have to travel in order to be distributed. Moreover, the extension of the supply chain has produced a decrease of its share of value-added to the benefit of the farmers and, as a consequence, has excluded many small producers from the market and caused a negative impact on rural areas (unemployment, depopulation due to migration). From the customers' point of view, the increase of intermediaries has created an informative asymmetry due to the impossibility to track their shipment as well as to a lowering of their quality standards, caused by an increasingly standardized production process. During the last years, the interest of policy-makers in short supply chain has grown. It appears to be a tool able to incentivize a sustainable agricultural productions and to provide environmental, economic and social benefits. In fact, the short supply chain other than reducing costs, which are cut down by decreasing the number of intermediaries that take the product from the producer to the consumer, creates a positive environmental externalities and, above all, promotes the local areas. This work highlights the central role taken on by the implementation of new forms of marketing in the short supply chain and its importance in influencing the concept of sustainable development in the agricultural supply chain. Moreover, this work aims to find evidence-based guidelines for policy-makers seeking to support the development of these new forms of marketing, whose potential lies in the customers' attention to ethical and environmental issues and their need for natural and healthy food.

This study estimates the annual economic burden on patients and caregivers of clinic visits for prophylactic G-CSF injections in the US.Methods:Annual clinic visits for prophylactic G-CSF injections (all cancers) were estimated from national cancer incidence, chemotherapy treatment and G-CSF utilization data, and G-CSF sales and pricing information. Patient travel times, plus time spent in the clinic, were estimated from patient survey responses collected during a large prospective cohort study (the Prospective Study of the Relationship between Chemotherapy Dose Intensity and Mortality in Early-Stage (I-III) Breast Cancer Patients). Economic models were created to estimate travel costs, patient co-pays and the economic value of time spent by patients and caregivers in G-CSF clinic visits.Results:Estimated total clinic visits for prophylactic G-CSF injections in the US were 1.713 million for 2015. Mean (SD) travel time per visit was 62 (50) min; mean (SD) time in the clinic was 41 (68) min. Total annual time for travel to and from the clinic, plus time at the clinic, is estimated at 4.9 million hours, with patient and caregiver time valued at $91.8 million ($228 per patient). The estimated cumulative annual travel distance for G-CSF visits is 60.2 million miles, with a total transportation cost of $28.9 million ($72 per patient). Estimated patient co-pays were $61.1 million, approximate to$36 per visit, $152 per patient. The total yearly economic impact on patients and caregivers is $182 million, approximate to$450 per patient.Limitations:Data to support model parameters were limited. Study estimates are sensitive to the assumptions used.Conclusions:The burden of clinic visits for G-CSF therapy is a significant addition to the total economic burden borne by cancer patients and their families.","[Stephens, J.

Under heavy congestion, queues are difficult to estimate from either fixed-location sensors (such as loop detectors) or mobile sensors since they may exceed the region of detection, which is defined as long queue in the literature. While the long queue problem has been successfully addressed in the past using fixed-location sensors, whether this can be done using mobile traffic sensors remains unclear. In this paper, a queue length estimation method is proposed to solve this long queue problem using short vehicle trajectories obtained from mobile sensors. The method contains vehicle trajectory reconstruction models to estimate the missing deceleration or acceleration process of a vehicle. Long queue estimation models are then developed using the reconstructed vehicle trajectories. The proposed method can provide estimates of the queue profile and the maximum queue length of a cycle. The method is tested in a field experiment with reasonable results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on an investigation of traffic flow involving diverse traffic situations, a driver's tendency to take a significant headway after passing stop-and-go waves was identified as one of the influencing factors for discharge rate reduction. Conversely, the pattern of lane changers caused a transient increase in the discharge rate until the situation was relaxed after completing the lane-changing event. Although we observed a high flow from the incoming lane changers, the events ultimately caused adverse impacts on the traffic such that the disturbances generated stop-and-go waves. Based on this observation, we regard upstream lane changes and stop-and-go waves as the responsible factors for the decreased capacity at downstream of active bottlenecks. This empirical investigation also supports the resignation effect, the regressive effect, and the asymmetric behavioral models in differentiating acceleration and deceleration behaviors.

We show that the introduction of HSR may have a net negative effect on the environment, since it may result in additional demand, i.e., there is a trade-off between the substitution effect and the traffic generation effect. Furthermore, if environmental externalities are taken into account when assessing social welfare, the surplus measure may be higher when only air transport Serves the market than when the two modes compete. When the airline and the HSR operator decide frequencies, the airline reduces the aircraft size in order to keep load factors high while offering lower frequency and carrying fewer passengers. In these circumstances, the introduction of HSR may be beneficial to the environment on a per seat basis only if the market size is large enough. When the HSR operator decides speed, it has incentive to keep it at the maximum level in order to reduce travel time. When the increase in the emissions of HSR due to the increase in the speed of the train is sufficiently high, the overall level of emissions grows after the introduction of HSR. Therefore, there can be a trade-off between the attractiveness of the service due to reduced travel time and the effects on the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The local supplier is used reactively as an emergency source following the realization of random demand. A multiplicative demand model is employed. We show that dual sourcing flexibility may decrease optimal price when emergency supply cost is sufficiently low. We also find that optimizing price for a given stocking factor yields a price which is always higher than the price in the case where both price and stocking factor are selected to be jointly optimal.

These patients often experience pain and reduced quality-of-life. This analysis evaluated the time and costs associated with short-term disability use among solid tumor patients with bone metastases (BM) and skeletal-related events (SREs). Methods: Data from patients 18-64 years old with solid tumors and BM, eligible for short-term disability benefits between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2010, were extracted from MarketScan Research Databases. Short-term disability hours and costs associated with BM and SREs were evaluated. Results: Overall, 1098 patients met the criteria. For all patients with BM, the monthly mean short-term disability hours were 17.7 h pre-BM diagnosis and increased to 60.2 h post-BM diagnosis (p<0.001). The corresponding mean monthly short-term disability costs were $277 and $963 in the pre- and post-BM diagnosis periods, respectively (p<0.001). Monthly mean short-term disability hours were higher for the cohort of patients with SREs (21.2 h pre-SRE diagnosis and 67.4 h post-SRE diagnosis) than for those without an SRE (8.6 h pre-SRE diagnosis and 14.4 h post-SRE diagnosis) (p<0.001). Similarly, the corresponding monthly mean short-term disability costs were higher for patients with SREs ($625 and $1259 pre- and post-SRE diagnosis, respectively) than for patients without an SRE ($452 and $612 pre- and post-SRE diagnosis, respectively) (p<0.001). Results of a multivariate analysis indicated that SREs were associated with an additional 39.4 short-term disability hours and $613 in short-term disability costs per month (p<0.001).

From the evacuation management authority's point of view, the desirable goal is to minimize the total evacuation time by computing a system optimum (SO). However, evacuees may not be willing to take long routes enforced on them by a SO solution; but they may consent to taking routes with lengths not longer than the shortest path to the nearest shelter site by more than a tolerable factor. We develop a model that optimally locates shelters and assigns evacuees to the nearest shelter sites by assigning them to shortest paths, shortest and nearest with a given degree of tolerance, so that the total evacuation time is minimized. As the travel time on a road segment is often modeled as a nonlinear function of the flow on the segment, the resulting model is a nonlinear mixed integer programming model. We develop a solution method that can handle practical size problems using second order cone programming techniques. Using our model, we investigate the importance of the number and locations of shelter sites and the trade-off between efficiency and fairness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Data from two phase III clinical studies were used to populate a simple and transparent short-term model. The costs and effects of treatment with IDeg vs IGlar were calculated over a 12-month period. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. The main outcome measure, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option vs IGlar in patients with T1DM on a basal-bolus regimen. The base case ICER was estimated at 16,895 pound/QALY, which is below commonly accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in the UK. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was stable to variations in the majority of input parameters. The parameters that exerted the most influence on the ICER were hypoglycemia event rates, daily insulin dose, and disutility associated with non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemic events. However, even under extreme assumptions in the majority of analyses the ICERs remained below the commonly accepted threshold of 20,000- pound 30,000 pound per QALY gained. Conclusions: This short-term modeling approach accommodates the treat-to-target trial design required by regulatory bodies, and focuses on the impact of important aspects of insulin therapy such as hypoglycemia and dosing. For patients with T1DM who are treated with a basal-bolus insulin regimen, IDeg is a cost-effective treatment option compared with IGlar. IDeg may be particularly cost-effective for sub-groups of patients, such as those suffering from recurrent nocturnal hypoglycemia and those with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.","[Evans, M.] Univ Hosp Llandough, Cardiff CF64 2XX, S Glam, Wales; [Wolden, M.; Gundgaard, J.; Christensen, T.] Novo Nordisk AS, Soborg, Denmark; [Chubb, B.] Novo Nordisk Ltd, Gatwick, W Sussex, England",Novo Nordisk; Novo Nordisk,"Evans, M (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Llandough, Cardiff CF64 2XX, S Glam, Wales.",marcevans4@sky.com,,,Novo Nordisk+,Novo Nordisk+,"This study was funded by Novo Nordisk+ MW, JG, BC, and TC are employees of Novo Nordisk.

Since these often present alongside other manifestations, renal TSC is likely to incur significant costs. This study aims to quantify healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs for renal TSC patients in the UK. Methods: TSC patients in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics were identified from January 1987-June 2013. Clinical data were extracted over the entire history and costs were reported over the most recent 3-year period. HCRU was compared with a matched comparator cohort. Incremental costs were reported and the key cost drivers by primary manifestation category were identified by regression modeling. Results: A total of 79 renal TSC patients were identified with manifestations including chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 (with prevalence increasing with age) and renal angiomyolipoma. Renal TSC patients consistently reported greater HCRU than the comparator. Inpatient hospitalizations were more frequent for renal TSC patients (3.2 vs 1.6), but length of stay was comparable; however, 70.9% of renal TSC patients recorded no kidney-related procedures ever and averaged <1 test per year in the 3-year period. Average costs for renal TSC patients were nearly 3-fold greater than the comparator (15,162 pound vs 5672) pound. Costs increased with additional manifestation categories (3600 pound: only renal; 27,531 pound: renal with >= 4 additional manifestation categories [25% of patients]). Additional nervous system and dermatology/psychiatric manifestations significantly (p<0.028) affected costs. Conclusions: Renal TSC patients have greater HCRU than the general CPRD population, likely to result from progression of renal disease and additional manifestations; however, surveillance for disease progression appears to be deficient. Inadequate monitoring may contribute to a lack of co-ordinated care and increased healthcare-associated costs. Efforts should be made to follow the TSC guidelines to effectively monitor and treat patients.","[Kingswood, John C.] Royal Sussex Cty Hosp, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Nasuti, Paola; Patel, Keyur; Myland, Melissa] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Siva, Vathani; Gray, Elizabeth] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, Frimley, England",University of Brighton; Novartis,"Kingswood, JC (通讯作者)，Royal Sussex Cty Hosp, Renal Unit, Barry Bldg,Eastern Rd, Brighton BN2 5BE, E Sussex, England.",chriskingswood@me.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals,Novartis Pharmaceuticals(Novartis),This research was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals.,,41,11,11,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

We propose a generic agent-based ESODTA model and a simplified queueing model (SQM) that is able to clearly distinguish vehicles' speed in free-flow and congested conditions for multi-scale emission analysis, and facilitates analyzing the relationship between link emission and delay. Based on the SQM, an expanded space-time network is constructed to formulate the ESODTA with constant bottleneck discharge capacities. The resulting integer linear model of the ESODTA is solved by a Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm. For the simulation-based ESODTA, we present the column-generation-based heuristic, which requires link and path marginal emissions in the embedded time-dependent least-cost path algorithm and the gradient-projection based descent direction method. We derive a formula of marginal emission which encompasses the marginal travel time as a special case, and develop an algorithm for evaluating path marginal emissions in a congested network. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to effectively obtain coordinated route flows that minimize the system-wide vehicular emission for large-scale networks.

Some delay originating from an upstream flight spreads to downstream flights. This phenomenon is defined as delay propagation. To understand the delay propagation patterns and associated mitigation measures, this study proposes a novel analytical-econometric approach. Considering that airlines deliberately insert buffer into flight schedules and ground turnaround operations, an analytical model is developed to quantify propagated and newly formed delays that occur to each sequence of flights that an aircraft flies in a day, from three perspectives on the ways that delays are absorbed by the buffer. With delays computed from the analytical model, we further develop a joint discrete-continuous econometric model and use the Heckman's two-step procedure to reveal the effects of various influencing factors on the initiation and progression of propagated delays. Results from the econometric analysis provide estimates on how much propagated delay will be generated out of each minute of newly formed delay, for the US domestic aviation system as well as for individual major airports and airlines. The impacts of various factors on the initiation and progression of propagated delay are quantified. These results may help aviation system planners gain additional insights into flight delay propagation patterns and consequently prioritize resource allocation while improving system overall performance. Airlines can also be better informed to assign buffer to their flight schedules to mitigate delay propagation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper focuses on discussing a particular topological structure named paired alternative segment (PAS), which consists of two path segments sharing the same starting and ending nodes but no other common nodes. We first present two alternative conditions that establish an equivalency relationship between user equilibrium (UE) flows and PAS structures. Starting from the traffic assignment method by paired alternative segments (TAPAS), we then examine the utilization of PASs for TAP and explore some algorithmic and implementation issues, which leads to the birth of an improved TAPAS procedure (termed iTAPAS in this paper). Compared to the original TAPAS, iTAPAS enhances the algorithmic efficiency in two aspects: (1) a more effective PAS identification method is used; (2) each PAS is set as being associated with only one origin in the UE-finding process. Some analytical results based on the new PAS identification method are presented to justify the convergence and efficiency of iTAPAS. A simplified post-process procedure is also presented to achieve the proportionality for iTAPAS. Numerical results obtained from applying the new and original algorithms for several large networks reveal that iTAPAS is nearly two times faster than TAPAS in achieving highly precise link flow solutions while it is practically identical to TAPAS in finding stable path flow solutions that meet consistency and proportionality.

Methods: AEs associated with chemotherapy (dacarbazine, paclitaxel, fotemustine), immunotherapy (ipilimumab), and targeted therapy (vemurafenib) were identified by literature review. Medical resource use data associated with managing AEs were collected through two blinded Delphi panel cycles in each of the five countries. Published costs were used to estimate per-event costs and combined with AEs incidence, treatment usage, and MM prevalence to estimate the economic burden for each country. Results: The costliest AEs were grade 3/4 events due to immunotherapy (Australia/France: colitis; UK: diarrhea) and chemotherapy (Germany/Italy: neutropenia/leukopenia). Treatment of AEs specific to chemotherapy (Australia/Germany/Italy/France: neutropenia/leukopenia) and targeted therapy (UK: squamous cell carcinoma) contributed heavily to country-specific economic burden. Limitations: Economic burden was estimated assuming that each patient experienced an AE only once. In addition, the context of settings was heterogeneous and the number of Delphi panel experts was limited. Conclusions: Management costs for MM treatment-associated AEs can be substantial. Results could be incorporated in economic models that support reimbursement dossiers. With the availability of newer treatments, establishment of a baseline measure of the economic burden of AEs will be crucial for assessing their impact on patients and regional healthcare systems.","[Vouk, Katja; Benter, Ursula] INC Res GmbH, Stefan George Ring 6, D-81929 Munich, Germany; [Amonkar, Mayur M.] Novartis Pharmaceut, Wayne, PA USA; [Marocco, Alessia] Laser Analyt, Milan, Italy; [Stapelkamp, Ceilidh] Novartis Pharmaceut, London, England; [Pfersch, Sylvie] Novartis Pharma SAS, Rueil Malmaison, France; [Benjamin, Laure] GlaxoSmithKline, Marly Le Roi, France",Novartis; Novartis; Novartis; GlaxoSmithKline,"Vouk, K (通讯作者)，INC Res GmbH, Stefan George Ring 6, D-81929 Munich, Germany.",katja.vouk@incresearch.com,,"DUPONT-BENJAMIN, Laure/0000-0001-7748-0768; Stapelkamp, Ceilidh/0000-0002-2707-3790",GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.,,90,26,26,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Due to the uncertain and dynamic characteristics of passenger demands, the commonly used method to recover from disturbances in practice is to change the timetable and rolling stock manually based on the experiences and professional judgements. In this paper, we develop a stochastic programming model for metro train rescheduling problem in order to jointly reduce the time delay of affected passengers, their total traveling time and operational costs of trains. To capture the complexity of passenger traveling characteristics, the arriving ratio of passengers at each station is modeled as a non-homogeneous Poisson distribution, in which the intensity function is treated as time-varying origin-to-destination passenger demand matrices. By considering the number of on-board passengers, the total energy usage is modeled as the difference between the tractive energy consumption and the regenerative energy. Then, we design an approximate dynamic programming based algorithm to solve the proposed model, which can obtain a high-quality solution in a short time. Finally, numerical examples with real-world data sets are implemented to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a microeconomic model of WPC and use the approach to shed light on the incentives and barriers employees and employers face when deciding on demand for and supply of WPC. It is shown that under market conditions there is no WPC contract an employer is willing to offer and at the same time the majority of employees is willing to accept. To overcome the lack of demand or underprovision of WPC we discuss various 'remedies', involving subsidies to charging facility costs and adjustments in electricity tariffs or loading technologies. We find that direct subsidies to WPC facilities or subsidies combined with specific energy price policies could be a way to foster WPC provision. In contrast measures on the employee side that may help to stimulate the demand for WPC turn out to be less feasible. Hence, our results suggest that in order to promote WPC it is more promising to support employers in offering WPC contracts than to provide employees an incentive to accept WPC contracts. The study therefore gives a rationale for public initiatives being undertaken to boost WPC provision, as e.g. in the case of the US. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The notion of rationality entails the exploration of the marginal decision rule from economic theory, which states that a rational individual evaluates his/her marginal utility, defined as the difference between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost, of each incremental decision. Seeking to analyze the marginal decision rule in the modeling of deterministic day-to-day traffic evolution, this paper proposes a modeling framework which introduces a term to capture the marginal cost to the driver induced by route switching. The proposed framework enables to capture both benefit and cost associated with route changes. The marginal cost is then formulated upon the assumption that drivers are able to predict other drivers' responses to the current traffic conditions, which is adopted based on the notion of strategic thinking of rational players developed in behavior game theory. The marginal cost based on 1-step strategic thinking also describes the shadow price of shifting routes, which helps to explain the behavioral tendency of the driver perceiving the cost-sensitivity to link/route flows. After developing a formulation of the marginal utility day-to-day model, its theoretical properties are analyzed, including the invariance property, asymptotic stability, and relationship with the rational behavioral adjustment process.

Nivolumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were previously treated. The cost-effectiveness of nivolumab has not been assessed in Canada. A contentious component of projecting long-term cost and outcomes in cancer relates to the modeling approach adopted, with the two most common approaches being partitioned survival (PS) and Markov models. The objectives of this analysis were to estimate the cost-utility of nivolumab and to compare the results using these alternative modeling approaches. Methods Both PS and Markov models were developed using docetaxel and erlotinib as comparators. A three-health state model was used consisting of progression-free, progressed disease, and death. Disease progression and time to progression were estimated by identifying best-fitting survival curves from the clinical trial data for PFS and OS. Expected costs and health outcomes were calculated by combining health-state occupancy with medical resource use and quality-of-life assigned to each of the three health states. The health outcomes included in the model were survival and quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs). Results Nivolumab was found to have the highest expected per-patient cost, but also improved per-patient life years (LYs) and QALYs. Nivolumab cost an additional $151,560 and $140,601 per QALY gained compared to docetaxel and erlotinib, respectively, using a PS model approach. The cost-utility estimates using a Markov model were very similar ($152,229 and $141,838, respectively, per QALY gained). Conclusions Nivolumab was found to involve a trade-off between improved patient survival and QALYs, and increased cost. It was found that the use of a PS or Markov model produced very similar estimates of expected cost, outcomes, and incremental cost-utility.","[Goeree, Ron; Goeree, Jeff] Goeree Consulting Ltd, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Goeree, Ron] McMaster Univ, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Villeneuve, Julie; Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] Bristol Myers Squibb Canada, St Laurent, PQ, Canada; [Penrod, John R.; Orsini, Lucinda] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA; [Monfared, Amir Abbas Tahami] McGill Univ, Dept Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McMaster University; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb; McGill University,"Goeree, R (通讯作者)，10 Sundown Dr, Hamilton, ON L9B 1W3, Canada.",goereer@sympatico.ca,"Araújo, António/B-5047-2008; Monfared, Ali Shabestani/I-2441-2016","Araújo, António/0000-0002-7267-3584; Tahami Monfared, Amir Abbas/0000-0003-4003-3192",Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada,Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This manuscript received funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb Canada.,,41,56,56,1,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Sustainability, in its widest meaning of well-being sustainability, can be analyzed considering four visions: environmental, economic, social and generational. In this paper, starting from a literature review, we will proceed to a theoretical analysis of the impact of the food system on the environment and of actions that, over time, have attempted to reduce it. In a second phase we will focus on the olive oil sector, which although, to date, does not include environmental externalities regarded as most critical, it is good to start to reconsider it in a new perspective. This will ensure that olive oil production can gain the competitive advantage of sustainability either to win the global competition for fielding competitive strategies, or contribute to territorial well-being sustainability. It will be used as a theoretical reference model Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) which will set a complete picture of the interactions with the environment of the olive oil sector. The LCA considers externalities of each phase of olive oil production towards human health, ecosystem quality and resource depletion and also economic and social impacts. Finally, we will apply the LCA model to same Italian case studies in order to evaluate their environmental performance.

This paper models and connects the two kinds of congestion in one joint model. This is done by adopting a deterministic bottleneck model for the terminal to describe passengers' behavior, and a simpler static congestion model for the runway. We find that different from the results obtained in the literature, uniform air-fare does not yield the first-best outcome when terminal congestion is explicitly taken into account. In particular, business passengers are at first-best charged a higher fare than leisure passengers if and only if their relative schedule-delay cost is higher. We further identify circumstances under which passengers are, given a uniform airport charge scheme, under- or over-charged with respect to the terminal charge. Furthermore, when concession surplus is added to the analysis, the airport may raise (rather than reduce) the airport charge in order to induce more business passengers who in turn will lengthen leisure passengers' dwell time and hence increase their chance of purchasing concession goods. Finally, the impacts of terminal capacity expansion and time-varying terminal fine toll are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, the overall differences in medical costs were estimated for NVAF and venous thromboembolism (VTE) patient populations combined. Methods: Medical cost differences associated with NOAC use vs warfarin or placebo among NVAF and VTE patients were estimated based on clinical event rates obtained from the published trial data. The clinical event rates were calculated as the percentage of patients with each of the clinical events during the trial periods. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted for the medical-cost differences determined for NVAF patients. A hypothetical health plan population of 1 million members was used to estimate and compare the combined medical-cost differences of the NVAF and VTE populations and were projected in the years 2015-2018. Results: In a year, the medical-cost differences associated with NOAC use instead of warfarin were estimated at -$204, -$140, -$495, and -$340 per patient for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, respectively. In 2014, among the hypothetical population, the medical-cost differences were -$3.7, -$4.2, -$11.5, and -$6.6 million for NVAF and acute VTE patients treated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban, respectively. In 2014, for the combined NVAF, acute VTE, and extended VTE patient populations, medical-cost differences were -$10.0, -$10.9, -$21.0, and -$21.0 million for dabigatran, rivaroxaban, 2.5 mg apixaban, and 5mg apixaban, respectively. Medical-cost differences associated with use of NOACs were projected to steadily increase from 2014 to 2018. Conclusions: Medical costs are reduced when NOACs are used instead of warfarin/placebo for the treatment of NVAF or VTE, with apixaban being associated with the greatest reduction in medical costs.","[Amin, Alpesh] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Bruno, Amanda] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Trocio, Jeffrey] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Lin, Jay; Lingohr-Smith, Melissa] Novosys Hlth, Green Brook, NJ USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,"Amin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, UCIMC, Sch Med, Hosp Program,Dept Med, 101 City Dr South,Bldg 58,Room 110,ZC-4076H, Irvine, CA 92868 USA.",anamin@uci.edu,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb); Pfizer(Pfizer),Sponsorship for this study was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer.,,0,24,24,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Current treatment options have limitations due to side effects, interferon intolerability and ineligibility, long treatment durations and low sustained virological response (SVR) rates, especially for the most severe patients). Sofosbuvir is the first nucleotide polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity. Sofosbuvir, administered with ribavirin (RBV) and with or without pegylated interferon (PEG-INF), resulted in >90% SVR across treatment-naive (TN) genotype (GT) 1-6 patients. It is also the first treatment option for patients that are unsuitable for interferon (UI). This analysis evaluates the cost - effectiveness of sofosbuvir for GTs 1-6 in Italy. Research design and methods: A Markov model followed a cohort of 10,000 patients until they reached 80 years old. Approximately 20% of naive and 30% of experienced patients initiated treatment at the cirrhosis stage. Comparators included PEG-INF + RBV for all GTs and plus telaprevir or boceprevir for GT1, or no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and the cost perspective was that of the National Health Service in Italy. Results: Sofosbuvir was cost-effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below (sic)40,000/QALY in all patient populations, particularly in cirrhotic patients. The exception was for a mixed cohort of GT2 TN patients where the ICER was (sic)68,500/QALY and for a cirrhotic cohort of GT4/5/6 where the ICER was (sic)68,434/QALY. Nevertheless, the prevalence of HCV in this patient population is expected to be low. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: Sofosbuvir-based regimens are cost-effective in Italy, particular for the most severe patients. The interferon-free regimens are a real treatment option for UI patients. The high cure rates of this breakthrough treatment are expected to substantially reduce the burden of HCV in Italy.","[Cure, Sandrine; Guerra, Ines] Mapi, Uxbridge UB8 1QG, Middx, England; [Camma, Calogero; Craxi, Antonio] Univ Palermo, Dipartimento Biomed Med Interna & Specialist, Palermo, Italy; [Camma, Calogero; Craxi, Antonio] Univ Palermo, UOC Gastroenterol & Epatol, DiBiMIS, Palermo, Italy; [Carosi, Giampiero] Univ Brescia, Inst Infect Dis, I-25121 Brescia, Italy",University of Palermo; University of Palermo; University of Brescia,"Guerra, I (通讯作者)，Mapi, 3rd Floor,Beaufort House,Cricket Field Rd, Uxbridge UB8 1QG, Middx, England.",ines.guerra@optum.com,"; Craxi, Antonio/K-9529-2016","CAMMA', CALOGERO/0000-0002-9224-1914; Craxi, Antonio/0000-0002-4480-9544",,,,,0,15,17,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This paper shows that the solution to these problems depends on whether sampling is based on time (e.g., one report every minute) or space (e.g., one every 500 m). For the special case of segments with uniform space-mean speeds, explicit formulae are derived under both sampling principles for the likelihood of the measurements and the allocation of travel time. It is shown that time-based sampling is biased towards measurements where a disproportionally long time is spent on the last segment. Numerical experiments show that an incorrect likelihood formulation can lead to significantly biased parameter estimates depending on the shapes of the travel time distributions. The analysis reveals that the sampling protocol needs to be considered in travel time estimation using probe vehicle data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Reductions in the numbers of non-fatal MI and non-fatal IS events and in related per-member-per-month (PMPM) and 5-year costs (excluding test costs) due to biomarker testing were modeled for a US health plan with one million beneficiaries. Inputs for the model included literature-based MI and IS incidence rates, healthcare costs associated with MI and IS, laboratory results of biomarker testing, MI and IS hazard ratios related to biomarker levels, patient monitoring and intervention costs and use/costs of preventative pharmacotherapy. Preventative pharmacotherapy inputs were based on an analysis of pharmacy claims data. Costs savings (2013 USD) were assessed for patients undergoing biomarker testing compared to the standard of care. Data from MDVIP and Cleveland Heart Lab supported two critical inputs: (1) treatment success rates and (2) the population distribution of biomarker testing. Incidence rates, hazard ratios, and other healthcare costs were obtained from the literature. Results: For a health plan with one million members, an estimated 21,104 MI and 22,589 IS events occurred in a 5-year period. Routine biomarker testing among a sub-group of beneficiaries >= 35 years old reduced nonfatal MI and IS events by 2039 and 1869, respectively, yielding cost savings of over $187 million over 5 years ($3.13 PMPM), excluding test costs. Results were sensitive to changes in treatment response rates. Nonetheless, cost savings were observed for all input values. Conclusions: This study suggests that health plans can realize substantial cost savings by preventing non-fatal MI and IS events after implementation of routine biomarker testing. Five-year cost savings before test costs could exceed $3.13 PMPM.","[Penn, M. S.; Purvis, S.; Beidelschies, M.] Cleveland HeartLab Inc, Cleveland, OH USA; [Penn, M.

Methods: A probabilistic Markov model was developed. This included an 8-week induction period, and 22 subsequent 2-week cycles (up to 1 year). The model included three disease states: remission, response, and relapse. Costs were from a Canadian public payer perspective. Estimates for the additional cost per 1 year of sustained remission and sustained response were obtained. Results: Golimumab 100 mg provided the lowest cost per additional remission ($935) and cost per additional response ($701) compared with conventional therapy. Golimumab 50 mg yielded slightly higher costs than golimumab 100 mg. Infliximab was associated with the largest additional number of estimated remissions and responses, but also higher cost at $1975 per remission and $1311 per response. Adalimumab was associated with the largest cost per remission ($7430) and cost per response ($2361).

An operating agency seeks to minimize operating costs while maintaining the quality of service while users experience costs associated with scheduling, waiting, and traveling within the system. In this paper, an analytical model is employed to approximate the agency's operating cost for running a DRT system with dynamic demand and the total generalized cost that users experience as a result of the operating decisions. The approach makes use of Vickrey's (1969) congestion theory to model the dynamics of the DRT system in the equilibrium condition and approximate the generalized cost for users when the operating capacity is inadequate to serve the time-dependent demand over the peak period without excess delay. The efficiency of the DRT system can be improved by optimizing one of three parameters that define the agency's operating decision: (1) the operating capacity of the system, (2) the number of passengers that have requested a pick-up and are awaiting service, and (3) the distribution of requested times for service from the DRT system. A schedule management strategy and dynamic pricing strategies are presented that can be implemented to manage demand and reduce the total cost of the DRT system by keeping the number of waiting requests optimized over the peak period. In the end, proposed optimization strategies are compared using a numerical example. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent research has shown the existence of well-defined Macroscopic Fundamental Diagrams (MFDs) relating average flow and density in homogeneous networks. The concept of MFD allows to design real-time traffic control schemes specifically hierarchical perimeter control approaches to alleviate or postpone congestion. Considering the fact that congestion is spatially correlated in adjacent roads and it propagates spatiotemporaly with finite speed, describing the main pockets of congestion in a heterogeneous city with small number of clusters is conceivable. In this paper, we propose a three-step clustering algorithm to partition heterogeneous networks into connected homogeneous regions, which makes the application of perimeter control feasible. The advantages of the proposed method compared to the existing ones are the ability of finding directional congestion within a cluster, robustness with respect to parameters calibration, and its good performance for networks with low connectivity and missing data. Firstly, we start to find a connected homogeneous area around each road of the network in an iterative way (i.e. it forms a sequence of roads). Each sequence of roads, defined as 'snake', is built by starting from a single road and iteratively adding one adjacent road based on its similarity to join previously added roads in that sequence. Secondly, based on the obtained sequences from the first step, a similarity measure is defined between each pair of the roads in the network. The similarities are computed in a way that put more weight on neighboring roads and facilitate connectivity of the clusters. Finally, Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF) framework is utilized to assign roads to proper clusters with high intra-similarity and low inter-similarity. SNMF partitions the data by providing a lower rank approximation of the similarity matrix. The proposed clustering framework is applied in medium and large-size networks based on micro-simulation and empirical data from probe vehicles. In addition, the extension of the algorithm is proposed to deal with the networks with sparse measurements where information of some links is missing. The results show the effectiveness and robustness of the extended algorithm applied to simulated network under different penetration rates (percentage of links with data). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most previous studies often ignore the spatial and temporal uncertainties of train mass, and the variabilities of tractive force, braking force and basic running resistance on energy consumption in order to simplify the model formulation and solution algorithm. In this paper, we develop an integrated metro timetable and speed profile optimization model to minimize the total tractive energy consumption, where these real-world operating conditions are explicitly considered in the model formulation and solution algorithm. Firstly, we formulate a two-phase stochastic programming model to determine the timetable and speed profile. Given the speed profile, the first phase determines the timetable by scheduling the arrival and departure times for each station, and the second phase determines the speed profile for each inter-station with the scheduled arrival and departure times. Secondly, we design a simulation-based genetic algorithm procedure incorporated with the optimal train control algorithm to find the optimal solution. Finally, we present a simple example and a real-world example based on the operation data from the Beijing Metro Yizhuang Line in Beijing, China. The results of the real-world example show that, during peak hours, off-peak hours and night hours, the total tractive energy consumptions can be reduced by: (1) 10.66%, 9.94% and 9.13% in comparison with the current timetable and speed profile; and (2) 335%, 3.12% and 3.04% in comparison with the deterministic model.

Patients often experience a range of chronic comorbidities including hypertension, cardiac dysfunction, diabetes, osteoarthropathy, and obstructive sleep apnea. Untreated or inadequately controlled patients incur substantial healthcare costs, while normalization of GH levels may reduce morbidity and mortality rates to be comparable to the general population. Objective: To assess the 3-year budget impact of pasireotide LAR on a US managed care health plan following pasireotide LAR availability. Methods: Two separate economic models were developed: one from the perspective of an entire health plan and another from the perspective of a pharmacy budget. The total budget impact model includes costs of drug therapies and other costs for treatment, monitoring, management of adverse events, and comorbidities. The pharmacy cost calculator only considers drug costs. Results: The total estimated budget impact associated with the introduction of pasireotide LAR is 0.31 cents ($0.0031) per member per month (PMPM) in the first year, 0.78 cents ($0.0078) in the second year, and 1.42 cents ($0.0142) in the third year following FDA approval. Costs were similar or lower from a pharmacy budget impact perspective. For each patient achieving disease control, cost savings from reduced comorbidities amounted to $10,240 per year. Limitations: Published data on comorbidities for acromegaly are limited. In the absence of data on acromegaly-related costs for some comorbidities, comorbidity costs for the general population were used (may be under-estimates). Conclusions: The budget impact of pasireotide LAR is expected to be modest, with an expected increase of 1.42 cents PMPM on the total health plan budget in the third year after FDA approval. The efficacy of pasireotide LAR in acromegaly, as demonstrated in head-to-head trials compared with currently available treatment options, is expected to be associated with a reduction of the prevalence of comorbidities.","[Zhang, J.

Therefore, an efficient recovery solution that simultaneously decreases an airline's recovery cost while simultaneously mitigating passenger dissatisfaction is of great importance to the airline industry. In this paper, we study the integrated airline service recovery problem in which the aircraft and passenger schedule recovery problems are simultaneously addressed, with the objective of minimizing aircraft recovery and operating costs, passenger itinerary delay cost, and passenger itinerary cancellation cost. Recognizing the inherent difficulty in modeling the integrated airline service recovery problem within a single formulation (due to its huge solution space and quick response requirement), we propose a three-stage sequential math-heuristic framework to efficiently solve this problem, wherein the flight schedules and aircraft rotations are recovered in the first stage, Then, a flight rescheduling problem and passenger schedule recovery problems are iteratively solved in the next two stages. Time-space network flow representations, along with mixed-integer programming formulations, and algorithms that take advantages of the underlying problem structures, are proposed for each of three stages. This algorithm was tested on realistic data provided by the ROADEF 2009 challenge and the computational results reveal that our algorithm generated the best solution in nearly 72% of the test instances, and a near optimal solution was achieved in the remaining instances within an acceptable timeframe. Furthermore, we also ran additional computational runs to explore the underlying characteristics of the proposed algorithm, and the recorded insights can serve as a useful guide during practical implementations of this algorithm.

Queuing dynamics is formulated in continuous-time, subject to variations of demands and bottleneck capacities. Our analysis develops new techniques built on the closed-form solution to a generalized queuing model for a single bottleneck. Taking advantage of its variational structure, we derive the upper and lower bounds for the total queue length in a tandem bottleneck system and discuss its implication for the kinematic wave counterpart.

The network is modeled as a space-phase-time (SPT) hyper-network to explicitly represent the traffic signal control phases and time-dependent vehicle paths. A Lagrangian-relaxation-based optimization framework is proposed to decouple the RGTSO problem into two subproblems: the Route Guidance (RG) problem for multiple vehicles with given origins and destinations and the Traffic Signal Optimization (TSO) problem. In the RG sub-problem, the route of each vehicle is provided subject to time-dependent link capacities imposed by the solution of the TSO problem, while the traffic signal timings are optimized according to the respective link travel demands aggregated from the vehicle trajectories. The dual prices of the RG subproblem indicate search directions for optimization of the traffic signal phase sequences and durations in the TSO subproblem. Both RG and TSO subproblems can be solved using a computationally efficient finite-horizon dynamic programming framework, enhanced by parallel computing techniques. Two numerical experiments demonstrated that the system optimum of the RGTSO problem can be quickly reached with relatively small duality gap for medium-size urban networks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Transit Network Frequency Setting Problem formulation developed in this study effectively captures the coupling between the routes and their prevailing patterns, which may have different subsets of stops visited at different times of the day. The number of riders is elastic to the prevailing number of bus trips at a given stop, which is the combination of different pattern dispatch frequencies. As a result, the study bridges the gap between the operator's perspective where the decision unit is the pattern schedule, and the user's perspective, which perceives frequencies at the route level. Two main formulations are introduced. The first one maximizes the number of riders and the total waiting time savings under budget, fleet, policy headway and bus loading constraints; the second minimizes the net cost under fleet, policy headway, bus loading, minimum ridership and minimum waiting time savings constraints. In both formulations, pattern headways are the decision variables. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ridership elasticity with respect to headway is captured. The formulations are applied to a large-scale test network for the Chicago area. The results show that a win-win solution is possible where both ridership and waiting time savings are increased, while the net cost is decreased. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of port competition, there has been an increasing cooperation between firms involved in the intermodal transport chain including seaport services. This paper examines the economic incentives and welfare implications to the integration of port activities with inland transport services under inter-ports competition. Although ports find it advantageous to engage in such integration process it may be detrimental to welfare, since shippers' aggregate surplus decreases - noting that farther away users benefit at the expense of those closer to the ports. Several scenarios not leading to such welfare decrease are identified: asymmetries in port capacities, government regulation and efficiency gains. These latter results provide support to policies that favor integration processes of transport services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These strategies have only been studied for the case of a single bus line in a corridor. However, in many real cases this assumption does not hold. Indeed, there are many transit corridors with multiple bus lines interacting, and this interaction affects the efficiency of the implemented control mechanism. This work develops an optimization model capable of executing a control scheme based on holding strategy for a corridor with multiple bus lines. We analyzed the benefits in the level of service of the public transport system when considering a central operator who wants to maximize the level of service for users of all the bus lines, versus scenarios where each bus line operates independently. A simulation was carried out considering two medium frequency bus lines that serve a set of stops and where these two bus lines coexist in a given subset of stops. In the simulation we compared the existence of a central operator, using the optimization model we developed, against the independent operation of each line. In the simulations the central operator showed a greater reduction in the overall waiting time of the passengers of 55% compared to a no control scenario. It also provided a balanced load of the buses along the corridor, and a lower variability of the bus headways in the subset of stops where the lines coexist, thus obtaining better reliability for all types of passengers present in the public transport system.

More precisely, we consider the problem of defining the number and itinerary of bus routes and their frequencies, for a public transportation system. In this problem, the routes should be defined in terms of a given infrastructure of streets and stops and should cover a given origin-destination demand. The solution (routes and frequencies) should be convenient for the users and the operators. We review existing mathematical programming formulations and propose a new one, paying attention to the following aspects of public transportation systems, that are identified as key elements in order to have a realistic model: (a) the interest of the users, (b) the interest of the operators, (c) the behavior of the users, and (d) constraints regarding transfer, infrastructure and bus capacity. First, we discuss the formulations existing on the literature, in terms of the aspects mentioned above. Second, we propose a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, that incorporates the waiting time and the existence of multiple lines in the behavior of the users. We validate the proposed formulation using several cases, including a real one. Also, we compare the obtained results against results from the existing literature. In order to include transfer, infrastructure and bus capacity constraints, we propose an extension to the formulation and we discuss its impact in the structure of the model, based on concepts of bi-level mathematical programming. The mathematical formulations developed contribute towards a more realistic modeling effort, taking into account important aspects of the real system which were not included in previous proposals in the literature.

Major operators may have several dedicated hub facilities that are leased for a time horizon rather than being owned or constructed. For a given discrete planning horizon, service providers must decide on the location of the hub ports (i.e. terminals), the period when the lease contract starts, the period when the existing contracts must be terminated and the flow routing over the entire planning horizon so as to minimize the total operational cost. Thus, we propose a mathematical model for a Multi-period Uncapacitated Multiple Allocation Hub Location Problem with Budget Constraint. The proposed model incorporates several features of practice, particularly from maritime and land transport practices. We also propose a meta-heuristic solution algorithm that produces high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time.

Coordination of last trains in feeding lines and connecting lines at transfer stations is especially important because it is the last chance for many travellers to transfer. In this paper, a mathematical method is used to reveal the relationships between passenger transfer connection time (PTCT) and passenger transfer waiting time (PTWT). A last-train network transfer model (LNTM) is established to maximize passenger transfer connection headways (PTCH), which reflect last-train connections and transfer waiting time. Additionally, a genetic algorithm (GA) is developed based upon this LNTM model and used to test a numerical example to verify its effectiveness. Finally, the Beijing subway network is taken as a case study. The results of the numerical example show that the model improves five connections and reduces to zero the number of cases when a feeder train arrives within one headway's time after the connecting train departed.

Analysis included co-morbidities, patterns of drug use, and clinical course, as well as the magnitude of these differences attributable to AD. Methods: This evaluation is based on retrospective analyses of anonymized claims data from 2005-2008 provided by a large German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI). Cross-sectional analyses were performed with the following data: demographics, number of hospitalizations, number of in-patient days, number of ambulatory physician visits, number of drugs used, total number of defined daily doses (DDD) of prescribed drugs, and costs. A propensity score model was used to assess costs attributable to AD. Results: Patients with AD caused substantially higher costs from the perspective of a SHI. The differences in long-term care costs explained 70-75% of the total cost difference, with being responsible for about half of the total costs in AD patients. Comparing matched AD patients with controls resulted in 2.2-2.4-fold higher costs in the cross-sectional analysis, (sic)7413-E9207 for AD patients vs (sic)3378-(sic)3850 for controls. The propensity score model resulted in a difference of (sic)3771 attributable to AD. These costs are mainly caused by differences in hospitalization and long-term care costs. Conclusion: This analysis is one of the largest health economic studies of AD in Germany. The limitations of this study include the fact that reported diagnosis couldn't be validated and disease severity was not taken into account. Despite these methodological constraints, it can be concluded that AD is a substantial cost driver from the SHI payer perspective in Germany.","[Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Boston Healthcare Associates Int GmbH, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Brueggenjuergen, Bernd] Boston Healthcare Associates Int GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Andersohn, Frank] Frank Andersohn Consulting & Res Serv, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Ezzat, Nadja] Boston Healthcare Associates Int GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Lacey, Loretto] Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy, Dublin, Ireland; [Willich, Stefan] Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany",,"Brüggenjürgen, B (通讯作者)，Charite, Inst Sozialmed Epidemiol & Gesundheitsokonom, Luisenstr 57, D-10098 Berlin, Germany.",bernd.brueggenjuergen@charite.de,,,"Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC; Pfizer Inc.","Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC; Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was sponsored by Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research & Development, LLC, and Pfizer Inc.",,0,19,19,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Objective: To summarize original research articles that measured or utilized preference-based utilities or disutilities according to disease severity. Methods: Medline and Embase were searched from inception until the end of November 2014. Two reviewers independently searched the literature with differences settled through discussion. Data extracted included utility scores as determined in original research categorized according to disease severity as well as disutilities associated with exacerbations or comorbidities. Data were tabulated and analyzed descriptively. Results: In total, 862 articles were identified, 790 were rejected, and 69 analyzed. There were 44 dealing with COPD and 25 with asthma. Average utilities determined by research were 0.828 +/- 0.062, 0.765 +/- 0.090, 0.711 +/- 0.120, and 0.607 +/- 0.120 for mild, moderate, severe, and very severe COPD, respectively. Utilities used in economic analyses were 0.866 +/- 0.038, 0.770 +/- 0.024, 0.739 +/- 0.045, and 0.596 +/- 0.075, respectively. Disutilities (annual) ranged from 0.002-0.378; major and minor exacerbations had respective disutilities of 0.287 and 0.108. For asthma patients, utilities were for 0.86 +/- 0.32, 0.83 +/- 0.065, and 0.74 +/- 0.029, for mild, moderate, and severe disease, respectively. Conclusions: Utilities have been summarized according to severity category of asthma and COPD. These values should be useful for researchers undertaking economic analyses of these diseases.","[Einarson, Thomas R.; Bereza, Basil G.] Univ Toronto, Leslie Dan Fac Pharm, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Nielsen, T.

Analytical expressions for the assignment, revenue and total delay in each alternative are derived as a function of the pricing strategy. It is found that minimum total system delay can be achieved with many different pricing strategies. This gives flexibility to operators to allocate congestion to either alternative according to their specific objective while maintaining the same minimum total system delay. Given a specific objective, the optimal pricing strategy can be determined by finding a single parameter value in the case of HOT lanes. Maximum revenue is achieved by keeping the toll facility at capacity with no queues for as long as possible. Guidelines for implementation are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

OnabotulinumtoxinA has a well-established efficacy and safety profile as a treatment for OAB; however, the economic impact of using onabotulinumtoxinA has not been well described. Methods: An economic model was developed to assess the budget impact associated with OAB treatment in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK, using onabotulinumtoxinA alongside best supportive care (BSC)comprising incontinence pads and/or anticholinergic use and/or clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC)vs BSC alone. The model time horizon spanned 5 years, and included direct costs associated with treatment, BSC, and adverse events. Results: Per 100,000 patients in each country, the use of onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in estimated cost savings of (sic)97,200 (Italy), (sic)71,580 (Spain), and (sic)19,710 (UK), and cost increases of (sic)23,840 in France and (sic)284,760 in Germany, largely due to day-case and inpatient administration, respectively. Projecting these results to the population of individuals aged 18 years and above gave national budget saving estimates of (sic)9,924,790, (sic)27,458,290, and (sic)48,270,760, for the UK, Spain, and Italy, respectively, compared to cost increases of (sic)12,160,020 and (sic)196,086,530 for France and Germany, respectively. Anticholinergic treatment and incontinence pads were the largest contributors to overall spending on OAB management when onabotulinumtoxinA use was not increased, and remained so in four of five scenarios where onabotulinumtoxinA use was increased. This decreased resource use was equivalent to cost offsets ranging from (sic)106,110 to (sic)176,600 per 100,000 population. Conclusions: In three of five countries investigated, the use of onabotulinumtoxinA, in addition to BSC, was shown to result in healthcare budget cost savings over 5 years.

We first build an integer linear programming model with many 0-1 binary and non-negative integer decision variables, after then reformulate it as a train path-choice model for providing an easier train-based Lagrangian relaxation decomposition mechanism based on the construction of space-time discretized network extending from node-cell-based rail network. Moreover, through reformulating safety usage interval restrictions with a smaller number of constraints in this reformulated model, the train-based decomposition needs fewer Lagrangian multipliers to relax these constraints. On the basis of this decomposition, a solving framework including a heuristic algorithm is proposed to simultaneously optimize both the dual and feasible solutions. A set of numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed Lagrangian relaxation decomposition approach has better performances in terms of minimizing both train travel time and computational times.

Two cohorts were defined based on a proxy measure for EOL 1 month prior to the end of last recorded follow-up within the study period: patients who were assumed dead at end of claims follow-up (EOL cohort) and patients who were alive (no-end-of-life [NEOL] cohort). Proxy measures for EOL were obtained from published literature and clinical expert opinion. Cost and resource utilization were evaluated for the 6 months prior to end of claims follow-up. Baseline variables, resource utilization, and costs were compared between cohorts with univariate statistical tests. Adjusted relative risks were calculated for resource utilization measures. A covariate-adjusted generalized linear model evaluated 6-month total healthcare costs.Results: Of the 3,878 females included, 18.5% (n=718) met the criteria for EOL. Mean observational time (MBC onset to end of claims follow-up) was shorter for the EOL cohort (EOL, 32 months vs NEOL, 35 months; p<0.001). In adjusted analyses, the EOL cohort had 4.15 times higher 6-month total healthcare costs (EOL, $72,112 vs NEOL, $17,137; p<0.001). NEOL month-to-month mean total healthcare costs fluctuated between $2336-$3145, while EOL costs increased steadily from $8,956 in the sixth month prior to death to $19,326 in the last month of life. The adjusted relative risk of inpatient, hospice and emergency department utilization was >2 times higher in the EOL cohort (p<0.001).Conclusions: Potential EOL presented a greater economic burden in the 6 months prior to death. EOL month-to-month costs increased precipitously in the last 2 months of life and were driven by acute inpatient care.","[Bramley, Thomas; Lunacsek, Orsolya; Hennenfent, Kristin] Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Ste 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA; [Antao, Vincent; Masaquel, Anthony] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA","AmerisourceBergen Corporation; Xcenda, LLC; Roche Holding; Genentech","Bramley, T (通讯作者)，Xcenda LLC, 4114 Woodlands Pkwy,Ste 500, Palm Harbor, FL 34685 USA.",thomas.bramley@xcenda.com,,,"Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","This research was funded by Genentech, Inc.",,23,24,26,0,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The stochastic user equilibrium (SUE) model which relaxes the perfect information assumption of the deterministic user equilibrium is one such model. The aim of this paper is to develop a new user equilibrium model, namely the MDM-SUE model, that uses the marginal distribution model (MDM) as the underlying route choice model. In this choice model, the marginal distributions of the path utilities are specified but the joint distribution is not. By focusing on the joint distribution that maximizes expected utility, we show that MDM-SUE exists and is unique under mild assumptions on the marginal distributions. We develop a convex optimization formulation for the MDM-SUE. For specific choices of marginal distributions, the MDM-SUE model recreates the optimization formulation of logit SUE and weibit SUE. Moreover, the model is flexible since it can capture perception variance scaling at the route level and allows for modeling different user preferences by allowing for skewed distributions and heavy tailed distributions. The model can also be generalized to incorporate bounded support distributions and discrete distributions which allows to distinguish between used and unused routes within the SUE framework. We adapt the method of successive averages to develop an efficient approach to compute MDM-SUE traffic flows. In our numerical experiments, we test the ability of MDM-SUE to relax the assumption that the error terms are independently and identically distributed random variables as in the logit models and study the additional modeling flexibility that MDM-SUE provides on small-sized networks as well as on the large network of the city of Winnipeg. The results indicate that the model provides both modeling flexibility and computational tractability in traffic equilibrium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider two optimal control problems: the DTA problem, where turning ratios are part of the control inputs, and the Freeway Network Control (FNC), where turning ratios are instead assigned exogenous parameters. It is known that relaxation of the supply and demand constraints in the cell-based formulations of the DTA problem results in a linear program. However, solutions to the relaxed problem can be infeasible with respect to traffic dynamics. Previous work has shown that such solutions can be made feasible by proper choice of ramp metering and variable speed limit control for specific traffic networks. We extend this procedure to arbitrary networks and provide insight into the structure and robustness of the proposed optimal controllers. For a network consisting only of ordinary, merge, and diverge junctions, where the cells have linear demand functions and affine supply functions with identical slopes, and the cost is the total traffic volume, we show, using the Pontryagin maximum principle, that variable speed limits are not needed in order to achieve optimality in the FNC problem, and ramp metering is sufficient. We also prove bounds on perturbation of the controlled system trajectory in terms of perturbations in initial traffic volume and exogenous inflows. These bounds, which leverage monotonicity properties of the controlled trajectory, are shown to be in close agreement with numerical simulation results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, a HDM sublingually administered allergy immunotherapy tablet (SQ SLIT-tablet; ACARIZAX) has been developed for at-home treatment. The purpose of this analysis is to compare the costs related to treatment and administration of SQ SLIT-tablet and SQ SCIT.Methods Assuming equal efficacy between ther SQ SLIT-tablet and SQ SCIT, the cost-minimization analysis was the most appropriate for the comparison. According to guidelines and Summary of Product Characteristics, the treatment duration of SQ SLIT-tablet is 3 years and 3-5 years for SQ SCIT. The courses of treatment vary among patients and, therefore, the costs of treatment have been calculated for an average patient with HDM respiratory allergic disease (RAD) receiving either SQ SLIT-tablet or SQ SCIT. All costs associated with allergy immunotherapy were collected, i.e., cost of medication, administration and treatment setting, and discounted according to Danish guidelines. Comprehensive univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out.Results The treatment costs for an average patient with HDM RAD are Euro3094 for SQ SLIT-tablet and Euro3799 for SQ SCIT; however, when adding indirect costs to the calculations the total costs of the treatments are Euro3697 and Euro6717 for SQ SLIT-tablet and SQ SCIT, respectively. Therefore, if 2500 patients with HDM RAD were treated with SQ SLIT-tablet instead of SQ SCIT, it would elicit a saving to the healthcare system of approximate to Euro1.8 million. The conclusion was robust to any changes in the sensitivity analysis.Conclusion With regards to the cost of treating Danish patients with HDM RAD, it is clearly cost-saving to treat patients with SQ SLIT-tablet compared to SQ SCIT.","[Ronborg, Steen] Allergi & Lungeklinikken, Valby, Denmark; [Johnsen, Claus R.] Copenhagen Univ Hosp, Dept Dermatoallergol, Gentofte, Denmark; [Theilgaard, Sune] ENT, Esbjerg, Denmark; [Winther, Anders] GP, Birkerod, Denmark; [Hahn-Pedersen, Julie; Andreasen, Jakob Norgaard] ALK, Horsholm, Denmark; [Olsen, Jens] Incentive, Hlth Econ Dept, Holte, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Hahn-Pedersen, J (通讯作者)，Alk Abello AS, ALK, DK-2970 Horsholm, Denmark.",julie.hahn-pedersen@alk.net,"Olsen, Jørn/F-8801-2015","Olsen, Jens/0000-0002-6847-1736; Hahn-Pedersen, Julie/0000-0001-8187-7047",ALK,ALK,This study was supported by ALK.,,22,9,9,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

If disruption occurs, a firm (distribution center) can exert efforts to resume its transportation, although its unit transportation cost during the recovery process is uncertain. This paper studies how ex ante BI insurance can affect the ex post transportation recovery, and compares BI insurance with the ex post action backup transportation. We investigate four strategies: basic strategy, BI insurance strategy, backup transportation strategy, and mixed strategy (integration of the last two). The distribution center that seeks the least profit loss prefers the mixed strategy to other three strategies. However, the mixed strategy might in turn require longer transportation recovery time than the BI insurance strategy. The BI insurance and transportation recovery are complementary, but the BI insurance and backup transportation are substitutable, the backup transportation and the transportation recovery are also substitutable. We also find that the choice of BI insurance strategy and the backup transportation strategy depends on transportation market, insurance market and distribution center's operational environments.

Our approach is based on a mesoscopic viewpoint of the traffic system in terms of the dynamics of vehicle speed transitions. A key feature of the present approach lies in its stochastic nature which makes it possible to study not only the flow-concentration relation, namely, the fundamental diagram, but also its uncertainty, namely, the variance of the fundamental diagram an important characteristic in the observed traffic flow data. It is shown that in the simplified versions of the model consisting of only a few speed states, analytic solutions for both quantities can be obtained, which facilitate the discussion of the corresponding physical content. We also show that the effect of vehicle size can be included into the model by introducing the maximal congestion density kmax. By making use of this parameter, the free flow region and congested flow region are naturally divided, and the transition is characterized by the capacity drop at the maximum of the flow-concentration relation. The model parameters are then adjusted to the observed traffic flow on the 1-80 Freeway Dataset in the San Francisco area from the NGSIM program, where both the fundamental diagram and its variance are reasonably reproduced. Despite its simplicity, we argue that the current model provides an alternative description for the fundamental diagram and its uncertainty in the study of traffic flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to compare persistence (time to treatment discontinuation/modification), adherence, and healthcare costs among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) initiating ATV/r or DRV/r. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used commercial and Medicaid administrative insurance claims data. Patients initiating ATV/r or DRV/r from 2006-2013 with continuous enrollment for >= 6 months before and >= 3 months after initiation were included. Patients were followed from initiation until discontinuation/modification (>= 30 day gap in ATV or DRV or initiation of a new antiretroviral medication), during which time adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC], with PDC >= 80% or 95% considered adherent) and per-patient per-month (PPPM) total healthcare costs were measured. DRV/r patients were propensity score matched to ATV/r patients at a 1:1 ratio to achieve balance on potentially confounding demographic and clinical factors. Commercial and Medicaid samples were analyzed separately, as were antiretroviral (ART)-naive and experienced patients. Results: The final samples comprised 2988 commercially-insured and 1158 Medicaid-insured patients. There were no significant differences in hazards of discontinuation/modification between the ATV/r or DRV/r cohorts. With respect to odds of being adherent, the only marginally significant result was comparing odds of achieving PDC >= 80% among ART-naive Medicaid patients, which favored ATV/r. All other adherence comparisons were not significant. Although ATV/r cohorts tended to have lower PPPM costs, the majority of these differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions: Patients with HIV treated with either ATV/r or DRV/r had similar time to treatment discontinuation/modification, adherence, and monthly healthcare costs. Results were similar across the pre-specified sub-groups. These findings are useful not only as an insight into clinical practice, but also as a resource for healthcare providers and payers evaluating treatment options for HIV+ individuals.","[Farr, Amanda M.; Brouillette, Matthew] Truven Hlth Analyt, Life Sci, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA; [Johnston, Stephen S.] Truven Hlth Analyt, Life Sci, Bethesda, MD USA; [Ritchings, Corey] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, US Med HIV, Princeton, NJ USA; [Rosenblatt, Lisa] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, US Med, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Farr, AM (通讯作者)，Truven Hlth Analyt, 150 Cambridgepk Dr, Cambridge, MA 02140 USA.",amanda.farr@truvenhealth.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Truven Health Analytics was provided funding by Bristol-Myers Squibb to conduct this research.,,33,4,4,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The standard analysis of the D-T paradox is based on several stringent assumptions: fixed total travel demand, perfect substitutability between automobile and transit trips, and no transit crowding. This paper re-examines the paradox when these assumptions are relaxed while retaining the usual assumption that there is no congestion interaction between the modes. It also broadens consideration to alternative transit administration regimes. In the standard treatment the transit operator is obliged to cover its costs. In this paper we also study two other regimes: transit profit maximization, and system-wide welfare maximization with no financing constraint. We examine how the transit system operator responds to highway capacity expansion in each regime, and how this affects welfare for drivers and transit users. We show that in all regimes the full price of transit declines only if the full price of driving falls as well. Thus, drivers are more likely to benefit from highway expansion than transit riders. The D-T paradox cannot occur in the profit maximization or unconstrained welfare maximization regimes. In the traditional self-financing regime transit service deteriorates, but the D-T paradox is not inevitable. Numerical analysis suggests that it can occur only when automobile and transit trips are nearly perfect substitutes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: A partitioned survival model was developed to estimate expected life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), direct costs and incremental costs per QALY and LY gained associated with use of Rd vs VMP over a patient's lifetime. Information on the efficacy and safety of Rd and VMP was based on data from multinational phase III clinical trials and a network meta-analysis. Pre-progression direct costs included the costs of Rd and VMP, treatment of adverse events (including prophylaxis) and routine care and monitoring associated with MM. Post-progression direct costs included costs of subsequent treatment(s) and routine care and monitoring for progressive disease, all obtained from published literature and estimated from a US payer perspective. Utilities were obtained from the aforementioned trials. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Results: Relative to VMP, use of Rd was expected to result in an additional 2.22 LYs and 1.47 QALYs (discounted). Patients initiated with Rd were expected to incur an additional $78,977 in mean lifetime direct costs (discounted) vs those initiated with VMP. The incremental costs per QALY and per LY gained with Rd vs VMP were $53,826 and $35,552, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, results were found to be most sensitive to differences in survival associated with Rd vs VMP, the cost of lenalidomide and the discount rate applied to effectiveness outcomes. Conclusions: Rd was expected to result in greater LYs and QALYs compared with VMP, with similar overall costs per LY for each regimen. Results of this analysis indicated that Rd may be a cost-effective alternative to VMP as initial treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with MM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well within the levels for recent advancements in oncology.","[Usmani, S.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two novel all-oral, interferon-free regimens for the treatment of patients with HCV genotype 3: daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir (DCV + SOF) and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF + RBV), from a Canadian health-system perspective. Methods: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to compare the effect of various treatment strategies on the natural history of the disease and their associated costs in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Patients were initially distributed across fibrosis stages F0-F4, and may incur disease progression through fibrosis stages and on to end-stage liver disease complications and death; or may achieve SVR. Clinical efficacy, health-related quality-of-life, costs, and transition probabilities were based on published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess parameter uncertainty associated with the analysis. Results: In treatment-naive patients, the expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for interferon-free regimens were higher for DCV + SOF (12.37) and SOF + RBV (12.48) compared to that of pINF + RBV (11.71) over a lifetime horizon, applying their clinical trial treatment durations. The expected costs were higher for DCV + SOF ($170,371) and SOF + RBV ($194,776) vs pINF + RBV regimen ($90,905). Compared to pINF + RBV, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were $120,671 and $135,398 per QALYs for DCV + SOF and SOF + RBV, respectively. In treatment-experienced patients, DCV + SOF regimen dominated the SOF + RBV regimen. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 100% probability that a DCV + SOF regimen was cost saving in treatment-experienced patients. Conclusion: Daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir is a safe and effective option for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 3 patients. This regimen could be considered a cost-effective option following a first-line treatment of peg-interferon/ribavirin treatment experienced patients with HCV genotype-3 infection.","[Moshyk, A.; Martel, M. -J.; Monfared, A.

Droxidopa is approved by the US FDA to treat symptomatic nOH. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of droxidopa vs standard of care from a US payer perspective.Methods:A Markov model was used to predict numbers of falls and treatment responses using data from a randomized, double-blind trial of patients with Parkinson's disease and nOH who received optimized droxidopa therapy or placebo for 8 weeks. The severity of falls, utility values, and injury-related costs were derived from published studies. Model outcomes included number of falls, number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Outcomes were extrapolated over 12 months.Results:Patients receiving droxidopa had fewer falls compared with those receiving standard of care and gained 0.33 QALYs/patient. Estimated droxidopa costs were $30,112, with estimated cost savings resulting from fall avoidance of $14,574 over 12 months. Droxidopa was cost-effective vs standard of care, with ICERs of $47,001/QALY gained, $24,866 per avoided fall with moderate/major injury, and $1559 per avoided fall with no/minor injury. The main drivers were fall probabilities and fear of fall-related inputs.Limitations:A limitation of the current study is the reliance on falls data from a randomized controlled trial where the placebo group served as the proxy for standard of care. Data from a larger patient population, reflecting real-life' patient use and/or comparison with other agents used to treat nOH, would have been a useful complement, but these data were not available.Conclusion:Using Markov modeling, droxidopa appears to be a cost-effective option compared with standard of care in US clinical practice for the treatment of nOH.","[Francois, Clement; Hewitt, L.

However, the traditional brick production causes several environmental and human health impacts, so there is a clear need of searching and replacing for more efficient and durable alternatives far beyond the limitations of the conventional brick production. The production and use of alternative materials, such as geopolymers, represents a great opportunity to ensure greater sustainability in the construction sector especially for the use of industrial wastes such as fly ash or blast furnace slag, as precursors solid. Study results have revealed that the Geopolymeric brick making process consumes less energy and involves low cost in terms of raw materials. The production of the former is compared to conventional bricks and their development which is an important step to reach better performance and environmental friendly materials. The purpose of this article is to evaluate impacts during the life cycle and describes the basic operations of the geopolymeric brick manufacturing. The analysis is performed using a life cycle approach to identify and quantify the environmental performance of the process. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J,"Belsey, J",,,,"Belsey, Jonathan",,,Predictive validation of modeled health technology assessment claims: lessons from NICE,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"The use of cost-effectiveness modeling to prioritize healthcare spending has become a key foundation of UK government policy. Although the preferred method of evaluationcost-utility analysisis not without its critics, it represents a standard approach that can arguably be used to assess relative value for money across a range of disease types and interventions. A key limitation of economic modeling, however, is that its conclusions hinge on the input assumptions, many of which are derived from randomized controlled trials or meta-analyses that cannot be reliably linked to real-world performance of treatments in a broader clinical context. This means that spending decisions are frequently based on artificial constructs that may project costs and benefits that are significantly at odds with those that are achievable in reality. There is a clear agenda to carry out some form of predictive validation for the model claims, in order to assess not only whether the spending decisions made can be justified post hoc, but also to ensure that budgetary expenditure continues to be allocated in the most rational way. To date, however, no timely, effective system to carry out this testing has been implemented, with the consequence that there is little objective evidence as to whether the prioritization decisions made are actually living up to expectations. This article reviews two unfulfilled initiatives that have been carried out in the UK over the past 20 years, each of which had the potential to address this objective, and considers why they failed to deliver the expected outcomes.","[Belsey, Jonathan] JB Med Ltd, Little Cornard, Sudbury CO10 0PB, Canada",,"Belsey, J (通讯作者)，JB Med Ltd, Chapel Lane, Little Cornard, Sudbury CO10 0PB, Canada.",jbelsey@jbmedical.com,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this paper we extend our previous analysis of these experiments, and report new experimental findings. In particular, we reveal that the platoon length (hence the average spacing within a platoon) might be significantly different even if the average velocity of the platoon is essentially the same. The findings further demonstrate that the traffic states span a 2D region in the speed-spacing (or density) plane. The common practice of using a single speed-spacing curve to model vehicular traffic ignores the variability and imprecision of human driving and is therefore inadequate. We have proposed a car-following model based on a mechanism that in certain ranges of speed and spacing, drivers are insensitive to the changes in spacing when the velocity differences between cars are small. It was shown that the model can reproduce the experimental results well. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The specification allows adapting traditional path-based stochastic user equilibrium flow allocation methods (originally designed for pre-specified choice sets) to the generic solution algorithm. We also propose a cost transformation function and show that by using this we can, for certain Logit-type choice models, modify existing path-based Deterministic User Equilibrium solution methods to compute RSUE solutions. The transformation function also leads to a two-part relative gap measure for consistently monitoring convergence to a RSUE solution. Numerical tests are reported on two real-life cases, in which we explore convergence patterns and choice set composition and size, for alternative specifications of the RSUE model and solution algorithm.

It is unclear how this difference in short-term efficacy impacts long-term cost-effectiveness of these regimens. This study sought to evaluate long-term cost-effectiveness of DTG+ABC/3TC vs EFV/TDF/FTC from a US payer perspective. Methods: This study is an individual discrete-event simulation which tracked the disease status and treatment pathway of HIV-1 patients. The model simulated treatment over a lifetime horizon by tracking change in patients' CD4 count, clinical events occurrence (opportunistic infections, cancer, and cardiovascular events), treatment switch, and death. The model included up to four lines of treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, efficacy, and safety of DTG + ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC were informed by data from the SINGLE trial. The efficacy of subsequent treatment lines, clinical event risks, mortality, cost, and utility inputs were based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were lifetime discounted medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC increased lifetime costs by $19,153 and per person survival by 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $158,890/QALY. ICERs comparing DTG + ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC remained above the traditional, US willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained in all scenarios, and above $ 100,000 or $ 150,000/QALY gained in most scenarios. Limitations: Due to data limitations, the treatment patterns, CD4 count during viral rebound and treatment switch, viral rebound after trial end, and long-term adverse event-related treatment discontinuation were based on assumptions, presented to and approved by clinical experts. Conclusions: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG + ABC/3TC resulted in higher cost and only slightly increased QALYs over a lifetime, with an ICER that exceeded the standard cost-effectiveness threshold. This indicates that the incremental benefit in effectiveness associated with DTG + ABC/3TC may not be worth the incremental increase in costs.","[Peng, Siyang; Tafazzoli, Ali; Dorman, Emily; Sorensen, Sonja] Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Rosenblatt, Lisa; Villasis-Keever, Angelina] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Evidera; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Sorensen, S (通讯作者)，Evidera, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",sonja.sorensen@evidera.com,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Funding for this study was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,,37,13,14,1,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In order to verify this relationship, empirical data are analyzed with the following findings: (1) linear relationship between the actual space gap and speed can be identified when the speed difference between vehicles approximates zero; (2) vehicles accelerate or decelerate around the desired space gap most of the time. To explain these phenomena, we propose that, in congested traffic flow, the space gap between two vehicles will oscillate around the desired space gap in the deterministic limit. This assumption is formulated in terms of a cellular automaton. In contrast to FDA and KTPT, the new model does not have any congested steady-state solution. Simulations under periodic and open boundary conditions reproduce the empirical findings of KTPT. Calibrating and validating the model to detector data produces results that are better than that of previous studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This entails that choice probabilities, covariances and elasticities of this model are also a finite mixture of choice probabilities, covariances and elasticities of the mixing models. As a consequence, by mixing nested logit cdfs, a model is generated with closed-form expressions for choice probabilities, covariances and elasticities and with, potentially, a very flexible correlation pattern. Importantly, the closed-form covariance expression opens up interesting application possibilities in some special choice contexts, like route choice, where prior expectations in terms of the covariance matrix can be formulated.

This evidence breaks the regularity assumption, which is at the root of the classical Random Utility Maximization (RUM) model with utilities that ignore the choice context. This article assesses the suitability of various context-RUM choice models that could overcome this limitation. For this we use a diagrammatic analysis, as well as Stated Preference (SP) and Revealed Preference (RP) transportation choice evidence. We begin confirming that the reported decoy outcomes cannot be replicated with the classical RUM models and that such a goal could be achieved instead using a set of five context-RUM models. We then show, for the first time, that the Asymmetrically Dominated (AD) and Compromise (CP) decoy effects were present in an SP route choice setting. We also show that, for a subset of individuals, the relative strength of the different decoy types was coherent with a Data Generation Process (DGP) defined by the Random Regret Minimization (RRM) or by the Regret by Aspects (RBA) parsimonious models. Then, we use cross-validation analysis where we found that RRM and RBA were superior to a classical Logit for all decoy types. Nevertheless, the ad-hoc Emergent Value (EV) model was consistently superior to all models suggesting that, although the parsimonious models may in theory replicate all decoy types, they seem to still make an incomplete representation of the DGP behind the overall decoy effect. We finally consider an RP mode choice experiment with which we detect, for the first time, an AD decoy effect in this choice setting. We also use this experiment to illustrate how to handle the decoy phenomena in a real context with various alternatives and variables. The article concludes summarizing the main contributions of this research and suggesting future lines of investigation for it. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, a raising awareness of the need for environmentally friendly solutions increases the importance of transportation modes other than road. Intermodal transportation, in that regard, allows for the combination of different modes in order to exploit their individual advantages. Inter modal transportation networks offer flexible, robust and environmentally friendly alternatives to transport high volumes of goods over long distances. In order to reflect these advantages, it is the challenge to develop models which both represent multiple modes and their characteristics (e.g., fixed-time schedules and routes) as well as the transhipment between these transportation modes. In this paper, we introduce a Green Intermodal Service Network Design Problem with Travel Time Uncertainty (GISND-TTU) for combined offline intermodal routing decisions of multiple commodities. The proposed stochastic approach allows for the generation of robust transportation plans according to different objectives (i.e., cost, time and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions) by considering uncertainties in travel times as well as demands with the help of the sample average approximation method. The proposed methodology is applied to a real-world network, which shows the advantages of stochasticity in achieving robust transportation plans. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

As a tactical level decision-making tool in a port, a yard template determines the assignment of spaces (subblocks) in a yard for arriving vessels, which visit the port periodically. The objective of yard template planning is to minimize the transportation cost of moving containers around the yard. To handle yard template planning, a mixed integer programming model is proposed that also takes into account traffic congestion in the yard. A further complication is that the cycle time of the vessels' periodicities is not uniform and varies among them, perhaps being one week, ten days, or two weeks, etc. However, this multiple cycle time of the periodicities of vessel arrival patterns, which complicates the yard template decision, is also considered in the model. Moreover, a local branching based solution method and a Particle Swarm Optimization based solution method are developed for solving the model. Numerical experiments are also conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, which can save around 24% of the transportation costs of yard trucks when compared with the commonly used First-Come-First-Served decision rule. Moreover, the proposed solution methods can not only solve the proposed model within a reasonable time, but also obtain near-optimal results with about 0.1-2% relative gap. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Patients had to have 6 months of continuous enrollment before and >= 12 months of continuous enrollment after their index date (date of first PTCL diagnosis). PTCL patients were matched (1:5) by age, sex, region, plan type, payer type, and length of continuous enrollment, to a control group of randomly selected patients without PTCL. Patient-level healthcare resource utilization data and associated costs (in US dollars) were measured. Mean costs per patient per month were determined.Results: Of 2820 patients with PTCL, 1000 met all inclusion criteria (median age=57 years; 57.5% male) and were matched to the control group (n=5000). On an average monthly basis, PTCL patients were hospitalized more frequently (0.07 vs 0.01 admissions; p<0.0001) and had a longer length of hospital stay (6.4 vs 4.0 days; p<0.0001) compared with controls. PTCL patients also had higher monthly utilization of pharmacy services (2.85 vs 0.97 prescriptions; p<0.0001), office visits (1.35 vs 0.34 visits; p<0.0001), ER visits (0.07 vs 0.02 visits; p<0.0001), hospice stays (0.05 vs 0.01 stays; p<0.0001) and other patient services/procedures. Overall, PTCL patients incurred higher average monthly costs per patient compared with control patients ($6327.84 vs $388.39; p<0.0001), driven mainly by hospitalizations (32.2% of overall costs) and pharmacy services (19.6%).Conclusions: This is the first real-world study to quantify healthcare resource utilization, costly treatment, and overall medical expenditure in commercially insured PTCL patients. Better tolerated and more effective treatments may improve disease management and reduce the clinical and economic burden of PTCL.","[Burudpakdee, Chakkarin; Seetasith, Arpamas] IMS Hlth, Fairfax, VA USA; [Burudpakdee, Chakkarin] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Lin, Huamao Mark; Zhu, Yanyan; Bonthapally, Vijayveer] Millennium Pharmaceut Inc, Cambridge, MA USA; [Wang, Weiying] NucleusX Market Access, Warren, NJ USA; [Carson, Kenneth R.] Washington Univ, Sch Med, St Louis, MO USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd; Millennium Pharmaceuticals; Washington University (WUSTL),"Burudpakdee, C (通讯作者)，8280 Willow Oaks Corp Dr,Suite 775, Fairfax, VA 22031 USA.",cburudpakdee@us.imshealth.com,"Burudpakdee, Chakkarin/AAE-7316-2019",,"Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd)","The authors would like to acknowledge Emma Landers of FireKite, an Ashfield company, part of UDG Healthcare plc, for writing support during the development of this manuscript, which was funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",,18,10,10,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Comparators were chosen based on reported utilization from a retrospective Canadian chart study; comparators were pemetrexed, best supportive care (BSC), and historical control (HC). HC comprised of all treatment alternatives reported. Progression-free survival and overall survival for ceritinib were estimated using data reported from single-arm clinical trials (ASCEND-1 [NCT01283516] and ASCEND-2 [NCT01685060]). Survival data for comparators were obtained from published clinical trials in a NSCLC population and from a Canadian retrospective chart study. Parametric models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the trial period. Drug acquisition, administration, resource use, and adverse event (AE) costs were obtained from databases. Utilities for health states and disutilities for AEs based on EQ-5D were derived from literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were estimated. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.Results: Over 4 years, ceritinib was associated with 0.86 QALYs and total direct costs of $89,740 for the post-ALK population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $149,117 comparing ceritinib vs BSC, $80,100 vs pemetrexed, and $104,436 vs HC. Additional scenarios included comparison to docetaxel with an ICER of $149,780 and using utility scores reported from PROFILE 1007, with a reported ICER ranging from $67,311 vs pemetrexed to $119,926 vs BSC. Due to limitations in clinical efficacy input, extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out whereby results remained consistent with the base-case findings.Conclusion: Based on the willingness-to-pay threshold for end-of-life cancer drugs, ceritinib may be considered as a cost-effective option compared with other alternatives in patients who have progressed or are intolerant to crizotinib in Canada.","[Hurry, Manjusha] Novartis Pharmaceut Canada Inc, Hlth Policy & Patient Access, 385 Bouchard Blvd, Dorval, PQ H9S 1A9, Canada; [Zhou, Zheng-Yi; Xie, Jipan] Anal Grp, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, New York, NY USA; [Zhang, Jie] Novartis Pharmaceut, Global Oncol Market Access & Policy, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Zhang, Chenxue; Fan, Liangyi] Analy Grp, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Boston, MA USA; [Rebeira, Mayvis] Univ Toronto, Canadian Ctr Hlth Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada",Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; University of Toronto,"Hurry, M (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut Canada Inc, Hlth Policy & Patient Access, 385 Bouchard Blvd, Dorval, PQ H9S 1A9, Canada.",manjusha.hurry@novartis.com,,,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),This analysis was sponsored by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.,,34,10,12,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Some types of bikes that are in short supply at a station can be substituted by other types, whereas some types of bikes can occupy the spaces of other types in the vehicle during repositioning. These activities provide two new strategies, substitution and occupancy, which are examined in this paper. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming problem to minimize the total cost, which consists of the route travel cost, penalties due to unmet demand, and penalties associated with the substitution and occupancy strategies. A combined hybrid genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This solution algorithm consists of (i) a modified version of a hybrid genetic search with adaptive diversity control to determine routing decisions and (ii) a proposed greedy heuristic to determine the loading and unloading instructions at each visited station and the substitution and occupancy strategies. The results show that the proposed method can provide high-quality solutions with short computing times. Using small examples, this paper also reveals problem properties and repositioning strategies in bike sharing systems with multiple types of bikes. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, due to the impracticability of collecting data from an entire population, methods of data inference such as the linear data projection are commonly adopted. A recent study has shown that systematic bias may be embedded in the parameters calibrated due to linearly projected data that do not account for scaling factor variability. Adjustment factors for reducing such biases in the calibrated parameters have been proposed for a generalized multivariate polynomial model. However, the effects of linear data projection on the dispersion of and confidence in the adjusted parameters have not been explored. Without appropriate statistics examining the statistical significance of the adjusted model, their validity in applications remains unknown and dubious. This study reveals that heteroscedasticity is inherently introduced by data projection with a varying scaling factor. Parameter standard errors that are estimated by linearly projected data without any appropriate treatments for non-homoscedasticity are definitely biased, and possibly above or below their true values. To ensure valid statistical tests of significance and prevent exposure to uninformed and unnecessary risk in applications, a generic analytical distribution-free (ADF) method and an equivalent scaling factor (ESF) method are proposed to adjust the parameter standard errors for a generalized multivariate polynomial model, based on the reported residual sum of squares. The ESF method transforms a transport model into a linear function of the scaling factor before calibration, which provides an alternative solution path for achieving unbiased parameter estimations. Simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the ESF method compared with the ADF method at high model nonlinearity. Case studies are conducted to illustrate the applicability of the ESF method for the parameter standard error estimations of six Macroscopic Bureau of Public Road functions, which are calibrated using real-world global positioning system data obtained from Hong Kong.

We find that in the immediate years following a merger, service quality generally deteriorates, and that the drop in service is due simultaneously to the merger and the increased concentration of the market. Thus, recent mergers in the US, including Delta and Northwest, United and Continental, Southwest and AirTran, have likely resulted in increased market concentration and decreased service levels. From a public policy perspective, our results point to the importance of regulators monitoring airline actions, such as mergers and acquisitions, that serve to increase the concentration of markets, and may also result in decreased service quality.

In contrast with much optimization work pertaining to spatially contiguous maintenance works, its principal economic emphasis and objective focus are centered on the optimal allocation of current maintenance and periodic renewal expenses, on their yearly distribution among large network partitions, and on infrastructure pricing. The model equations are based on very simple assumptions of infrastructure degradation laws and on a manager's objective function optimized through optimal control procedures. Equations are tested on national French rail track segment databases using Box Cox transformations and match rail regeneration and maintenance practices prevailing in France. More generally, the paper makes a broad contribution to capital theory, on the optimal maintenance and renewal of equipment, and defines a method applicable not only to other transport infrastructure but to a wide range of capital goods, including housing, cars and industrial machines.

Methods: A decision analytic cost model was developed to estimate the 52-week costs of a cohort of vulnerable elderly with OAB initiating treatment with fesoterodine or no OAB pharmacotherapy. Vulnerable elderly OAB patients were defined as those aged >= 65 years with self-reported urge urinary incontinence (UUI) symptoms for >= 3 months, 2-15 UUI episodes/day, and at risk of deteriorating health by a score of >= 3 on the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES)-13. Patients were evaluated for fesoterodine treatment response (defined as no UUI episodes) and persistence at weeks 12, 26, and 52. The model included a hypothetical health plan with 100,000 elderly members. A total of 7096 vulnerable elderly subjects were identified as the model target population based on the percentage of vulnerable elderly and annual prevalence of OAB among vulnerable elderly. OAB-related costs included fesoterodine drug acquisition costs, healthcare resource use (inpatient hospitalization, outpatient visits, and physician office visits), and OAB-related co-morbidities (falls/fractures, urinary tract infections, depression, and nursing home admissions). All costs were inflated to 2013 US$ using the medical care component of the consumer price index (CPI). Results: When 7096 vulnerable elderly OAB patients were treated with fesoterodine, US healthcare payers could save $11,463,981 per year, or $1616 per patient vs no OAB pharmacotherapy. Univariate one-way sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the findings and showed results were most sensitive to changes in fesoterodine efficacy followed by annual costs of inpatient hospitalization. Conclusions: From a US payer perspective, treating vulnerable elderly OAB patients with fesoterodine was cost-saving compared to no OAB pharmacotherapy.","[Qin, Lei; Snedecor, Sonya J.] Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway Suite 430, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Luo, Xuemei] Pfizer Inc, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Zou, Kelly H.] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA",Pharmerit North America LLC; Pfizer; Pfizer,"Snedecor, SJ (通讯作者)，Pharmerit Int, 4350 East West Highway Suite 430, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",ssnedecor@pharmerit.com,,,"Pfizer Inc, the manufacturer of fesoterodine","Pfizer Inc, the manufacturer of fesoterodine","This study was funded by Pfizer Inc, the manufacturer of fesoterodine.",,32,7,7,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

To quantify this burden, this study estimated years of life lost (YLL) per patient for adults with metastatic melanoma in 12 countries in 2014. Methods: General population growth and life expectancy were estimated from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development data and life tables for each country. Incidence of melanoma and mortality rates for the disease were based on GLOBOCAN and US registry data. The prevalence of metastatic melanoma was calculated using mortality rates and survival data from patients with melanoma. YLL per patient was estimated by the difference between the disease-free life expectancy and the life expectancy with metastatic melanoma. Results: YLL per patient were as follows: Australia, men = 19.9 years, women = 22.7 years; Brazil, 16.3, 19.8; Canada, 19.4, 22.3; France, 18.8, 23.1; Germany, 18.3, 20.8; Italy, 19.3, 22.7; Mexico, 17.2, 19.0; the Netherlands, 18.5, 21.5; Spain, 19.2, 23.1; Sweden 19.4, 22.0; the UK, 18.7, 21.2; and the US, 17.9, 20.6.

A network optimization model is solved for each service leg to evaluate a number of what-if scenarios. The solutions of these optimization problems are then used in a predictive model to identify the critical disruption factors and accordingly design a suitable mitigation strategy. A mitigation strategy, such as adding flexible or redundant capacity in the network, is an action that is deliberately taken by management in order to hedge against the cost and impact of disruption if it occurs. It is important that managers consider the trade-offs between the cost of mitigation strategy and the expected cost of disruption. The proposed methodology is applied to a case study built using the realistic infrastructure of a railroad network in the mid-west United States. The resulting analysis underscores the importance of accepting a slight increase in pre-disruption transportation costs, which in turn will enhance network resiliency by building dis-similar paths for train services, and by installing alternative links around critical service legs.

Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) do not require routine monitoring and dose adjustment, thus potentially provide an alternative treatment option.Methods and results:Because of the lack of head-to-head clinical studies, an indirect comparison was conducted of dabigatran etexilate and rivaroxaban based on the respective phase III clinical trial. The derived relative safety and efficacy estimates were used to evaluate the cost-utility of dabigatran compared with rivaroxaban in the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE. The results of the indirect comparison showed no significant difference between dabigatran and rivaroxaban in avoiding recurrent VTE following index PE, index DVT, or DVT/PE combined, in treatment and extended anticoagulation. Dabigatran has significantly less major or clinically relevant bleeds (MCRBE) compared to rivaroxaban in treatment after index DVT and treatment after DVT or PE combined, but was not significantly different from rivaroxaban after index PE or in extended anticoagulation. In cost-utility deterministic analyses, dabigatran was projected dominant in all analyzed settings, given its marginally lower total cost and marginally higher QALYs gained compared to rivaroxaban. Probabilistic analyses results showed a high likelihood of dabigatran being considered good value for money in the UK, in treatment and in secondary prevention of VTE.Conclusion:The cost-effectiveness evaluations showed that dabigatran can be considered the dominant treatment strategy compared to rivaroxaban in the patients' sub-groups considered, given the projected marginally higher clinical benefits and lower treatment costs.","[Jugrin, Anamaria Vera; De Francesco, Maria; Lamotte, Mark] IMS HEOR, Vilvoorde, Belgium; [Hoesel, Volker] StatSciConsult, Munich, Germany; [Ustyugova, Anastasia] Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH & Co KG, Ingelheim, Germany; [Sunderland, Tom] Boehringer Ingelheim Ltd, Bracknell, Berks, England",Boehringer Ingelheim; Boehringer Ingelheim,"Lamotte, M (通讯作者)，Medialaan 38, B-1800 Vilvoorde, Belgium.",mlamotte@be.imshealth.com,"Sunderland, Terence/AAS-5080-2021","Sunderland, Terence/0000-0002-1985-9849; Olivieri, Anamaria Vera/0000-0002-0947-3002",Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH,Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH(Boehringer Ingelheim),This study was funded by Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH.,,18,4,4,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

A number of text analysis techniques were combined for the investigation of scientific papers. The results stress how discourse analysis of sustainability in the pre-Rio period is mostly associated with agriculture and with a vision where the ecological and environmental aspects are dominant. In the post-Rio phase, the discussion about sustainability, though still strongly linked to environmental issues, enters a holistic dimension that includes social elements. The themes of energy and the sustainability of urban areas become central, and the scientific debate stresses the importance of indicators within an assessment approach linked to the relevance of planning and intervention aspects. The focus on the role of food within the debate on sustainability highlights a food security oriented approach in the pre-Rio phase, with a particular attention towards agriculture and third world Countries.

While surgery can greatly reduce these risks, some patients are not eligible, resulting in medication being their only therapeutic alternative. The MitraClip (Abbot Vascular) is a medical device that is percutaneously implanted and designed to eliminate leaking of the mitral valve. Methods The efficacy of the MitraClip strategy vs medical management was assessed using a 4-state Markov model based on the mitral regurgitation grade (mitral regurgitation grade 0, I/II, and III/IV, and death). At each 1-month cycle, patients were or were not hospitalized. The model analyzed a fictional population of 1000 patients over a 5-year period from a national Health Insurance perspective. The primary end-point was the number of deaths avoided. Data from the EVEREST II High Risk Study patients were used along with a literature review. Results At 5 years, among the 1000 patients, 276 deaths were found to be avoidable with the MitraClip strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was (sic)93,363 per death avoided. The annual ICER was calculated to take into consideration excess costs resulting from the MitraClip over the first year ((sic)29,984 vs (sic)8557 for the reference strategy) and the reduction of costs in following years ((sic)3122 for MitraClip vs (sic)8557 for reference strategy). Thus, the mean ICER was calculated to be (sic)20,720 per death avoided. Conclusion The MitraClip is a novel alternative therapy for mitral insufficiency in patients ineligible for surgery that may offer a medico-economic advantage.","[Guerin, Patrice] CHU Nantes, Cardiovasc, Nantes, France; [Bourguignon, Sandrine; Jamet, Nicolas] Strateg Sante, Hlth Econ, Evry, France; [Marque, Sebastien] Capionis, Epidemiol & Biostat, Bordeaux, France",Nantes Universite; CHU de Nantes,"Bourguignon, S (通讯作者)，Strateg Sante, 52 Blvd Yerres, F-91000 Evry, France.",s.bourguignon@s-sante.fr,"Bourguignon, Saulo Cabral/X-2380-2019","Bourguignon, Saulo Cabral/0000-0003-2098-8880",Abbott Vascular,Abbott Vascular(Abbott Laboratories),This manuscript was funded by Abbott Vascular.,,21,13,15,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Patients with DM/PM have a reduced quality-of-life and are at an increased risk for several comorbidities. Studies have assessed the incidence and prevalence of DM/PM; however, no study has estimated the burden of the diseases in terms of both healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and work loss incurred by patients. Objective To provide a comprehensive, current estimate of the annual HCRU and work loss in DM/PM patients in the US. Methods All patients (aged 18-64 years) with a first diagnosis of DM/PM between January 1, 1998 and March 31, 2014 ('index date') were selected from a de-identified privately-insured administrative claims database. DM/PM patients were required to have continuous health-plan enrollment 12 months prior to and following their index date. Propensity-score (1: 1) matching of DM/PM patients with non-DM/PM controls was carried out based on a logistic regression of demographic characteristics, comorbidities, costs, and HCRU to control for these confounding factors. Burden of HCRU and work loss (disability days and medically-related absenteeism) were compared between the matched DM/PM and the nonDM/PM cohorts over the 12-month period after the index date ('outcome period'). Results Of the 2617 DM/PM patients that met sample selection criteria, 2587 (98.9%) were matched with a non-DM/PM control. During the outcome period, DM/PM patients had significantly increased HCRU across places of service, including 44% more inpatient admissions (3.6 vs 2.5, p< 0.001), increased visits with specialists such as rheumatologists, neurologists and physical therapists, and filled 4.7 more prescriptions (32.2 vs 27.5, p< 0.001) than matched control patients. The increased HCRU led to significantly more medically-related work loss among DM/PM patients than matched controls (p< 0.001). Conclusions DM/PM imposes a substantial increase in healthcare resource use and is associated with statistically significantly greater work loss in the first year following diagnosis.","[Rice, J.

Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF; also known as gastro-resistant DMF) is a new oral treatment for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) approved in the US, Australia, Canada, and Europe. Objectives: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare the health economic impact of DMF against other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) as first-line RRMS treatment from a Canadian Ministry of Health perspective. Methods: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate patients' progression through health states based on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) over a life-time horizon. Patients entered the model based on a distribution of baseline EDSS scores, from which they could progress to higher or regress to lower EDSS state, or remain in the same state. Relapses could occur at any EDSS score. Results from a mixed-treatment comparison were used to inform model inputs for disease progression and relapse rates per treatment. Costs included direct medical costs stratified by EDSS score. Utilities were accrued based on time spent in each EDSS state. Results: Compared with glatiramer acetate, DMF yielded 0.528 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $23 338 Canadian dollars (CAD), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD $44 118/QALY. The ICER for DMF compared with Rebif 44 mcg was CAD $10 672. Results were consistent across a wide range of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Based on traditional cost-effectiveness thresholds in Canada (CAD $50 000-60 000), DMF can be considered a cost-effective option compared to other first-line DMTs.","[Su, Wenqing; Kansal, Anuraag] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Vicente, Colin] PIVINA Consulting Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Deniz, Baris; Sarda, Sujata] Biogen, Cambridge, MA USA",Evidera; Biogen,"Su, WQ (通讯作者)，1150 Connecticut Ave NW,Suite 401, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",waynesu@outlook.com,,"Kansal, Anuraag/0000-0001-5609-1464",Biogen,Biogen(Biogen),Funding for this study was provided by Biogen.,,62,14,14,0,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study sought to model the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod compared to dimethyl fumarate (DMF), for which relevant HA RRMS sub-group data were available, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England.Methods:A cohort Markov model based on Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, similar to previous model designs, was constructed. Published post hoc clinical data in the HA RRMS sub-groups were taken from the pivotal trials for fingolimod and DMF vs placebo. Utility data for each health state and for relapses were used in line with previous similar models. Published costs were inflated to NHS cost year 2013-2014 and UK list prices used for both drugs. Possible Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount scenarios were investigated.Results:In the base case, using list prices for each DMT, the average probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for fingolimod vs DMF was found to be 14,076, with a 73% chance of fingolimod being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pound. Scenario and sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty in disability progression efficacy was a key model driver. The model was robust to other changes and the majority of PAS permutations do not contradict the base case finding of cost-effectiveness of fingolimod.Conclusions:In conclusion, fingolimod remains cost-effective in HA RRMS following the introduction of DMF to the UK market, and this paper supports the evidence that has led fingolimod to be the only oral DMT reimbursed for HA RRMS in England. This model supports the restriction imposed by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on DMF in HA RRMS and highlights the importance of considering different sub-groups of multiple sclerosis when performing health economic analyses.","[Maruszczak, Maciej J.; Montgomery, Stephen M.; Griffiths, Matthew J.

Using a spatial urban equilibrium model, we find that if the number of access nodes, i.e. stations, is limited, stations contribute to the degree of urbanization. The total effect on road congestion, however, is small. By contrast, if stations are omnipresent there is little effect on urban spatial structure, but a considerable decrease in congestion. This suggests there is a policy trade-off between congestion and urbanization which crucially depends on the type of railway network. We find similar results for a within-city metro network. The key methodological contribution is that, besides the dependence between mode choice and where to work/live, the model allows for differences in the degree of substitutability - local competition - between transport modes. We find that an increase in the substitutability between car travel and railway travel substantially decreases the congestion reduction benefits of a dense railway network. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that in no-toll equilibrium, the generalized travel cost increases with departure time as the ratio of value of schedule delay to value of time increases with these two values, and commuters with higher values would experience higher generalized costs. We then derive the first-best toll and analyses its efficiency and distributional impacts. We obtain the sufficient Pareto-improving condition for the first-best scheme without imposing specific functional forms on heterogeneity. It is a Pareto improvement when the gap between values of time and schedule delay early increases as the ratio of value of schedule delay early to value of time increases. The proposed approach is applied to deal with such user heterogeneity that both the values of time and schedule delay early follow uniform distributions. In this case, the Pareto-improving condition is not only sufficient but also necessary. The individual gain from tolling is strictly monotonically increasing with respect to values of time and schedule delay early. Outside this condition, the first-best toll scheme makes users with relatively higher values of time and schedule delay early better off and those with relatively lower values worse off.

We further measure the perceived values of empty container at different ports. The perceived values of empty container at the surplus (deficit) ports are described by the profits (empty container exchange costs paid) for delivering empty containers. To solve our problems, we propose a two-stage optimization method. In stage I, liner carriers are guided to pursue a centralized optimization solution of empty container allocation for all related liner carriers. In stage II, the inverse optimization technique is used to determine the empty container exchange costs, which are paid to liner carriers for exchanging empty containers and following the centralized optimization solution. The profits at the surplus ports are calculated with respect to the empty container exchange costs at the deficit ports.

The Manski model that assumes a two-stage representation of decision making has served as the standard workhorse model for discrete choice modeling with latent choice sets. However, estimation of the Manski model is not always feasible because evaluation of the likelihood function in the Manski model requires enumeration of all possible choice sets leading to explosion for moderate and large choice sets. In this study, we propose a new group of implicit choice set generation models that can approximate the Manski model while retaining linear complexity with respect to the choice set size. We examined the performance of the models proposed in this study using synthetic data. The simulation results indicate that the approximations proposed in this study perform considerably well in terms of replicating the Manski model parameters. We subsequently used these implicit choice set models to understand latent choice set considerations in household auto ownership decisions of resident population in the Southern California region. The empirical results confirm our hypothesis that certain segments of households may only consider a subset of auto ownership levels while making decisions regarding the number of cars to own. The results not only underscore the importance of using latent choice models for modeling household auto ownership decisions but also demonstrate the applicability of the approximations proposed in this study to estimate these latent choice set models.

In doing so, we accommodate the fact that housing choices involve both characteristics of the dwelling unit and its location, while also mimicking the search process that underlies housing decisions. In particular, we model a complete range of dwelling unit choices that include tenure type (rent or own), housing type (single family detached, single family attached, or apartment complex), number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of storeys (one or multiple), square footage of the house, lot size, housing costs, density of residential neighborhood, and commute distance. Bhat's (2015) generalized heterogeneous data model (GHDM) system is used to accommodate the different types of dependent outcomes associated with housing choices, while capturing jointness caused by unobserved factors. The proposed analytic framework is applied to study housing choices using data derived from the 2009 American Housing Survey (AHS), sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The results confirm the jointness in housing choices, and indicate the superiority of a choice set formation model relative to a model that assumes the availability of all dwelling unit alternatives in the choice set.

In such an auction, the shipper faces a well-known winner determination problem (WDP): the shipper, as the auctioneer, is given bids submitted by a group of carriers. In most literature, WDP is modeled as a deterministic mixed-integer program (MIP) and is solved by standard MIP algorithms. However, in practice, the exact shipping demand is unavailable until after the auction. This shipment volume uncertainty has a significant impact on the solution to WDP. Therefore, a deterministic winner determination model with an estimate of shipment volume may not provide solutions that attain low procurement costs. This paper proposes a new tractable two-stage robust optimization (RO) approach to solve WDP for TL service procurement under shipment volume uncertainty. Assuming that only historical data is available, we propose a data-driven approach based on the central limit theorem (CLT) to construct polyhedral uncertainty sets. In particular, we consider two random cases: independent shipment volume and correlated shipment volume. A two-stage RO model with integer first-stage decision variables and continuous recourse variables is then formulated. We develop a reformulation solution method and use numerical tests to demonstrate that it is much more computationally efficient than the widely adopted Benders' type constraint generation algorithm. We demonstrate by numerical tests that real-world sized instances of TL service procurement problems can be solved by our proposed robust method. Moreover, we compare our robust approach with benchmark and show that it is more tractable and robust to uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike passenger flows, freight flows over the course of a year are not uniform and can vary significantly as the result of trade-offs between inventory and transportation cost management. We introduce the first temporal assignment model that explicitly considers these trade-offs for aggregate freight forecasting. A two-stage model is proposed that first decomposes aggregate annual zonal flows to firm group annual flows using a supply chain network model, which are then temporally assigned by simulating purchase order transactions throughout supply chains. Lot sizes are estimated with an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model and calibrated with monthly inventory data. The result is an aggregate-disaggregate-aggregate model that fits into aggregate freight forecasting models but makes use of more disaggregate logistical data. The model is illustrated with a simple replicable example, followed by a case study conducted with California statewide data to break out the distributed zonal flows into average daily volumes for network assignment. Calibration results using 2007 IMPLAN data showed a median percentage difference of simulated annual flows from FAF3 data of 2.38%, and a median percentage difference of simulated inventories from IMPLAN data of 4.85%, which suggests an excellent fit. Empirical validation results showed the model outperforms fixed factor approaches in mean value accuracy by 15-31%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Companies located in the same geographical area can benefit from a coalition to share the storage cost of such spare units, which may be stored as one unit at only one company's location. In our model, we combine the storage cost, replacement costs and downtime cost into a unified cost function, giving the expected cost per company per unit time as our objective function. We use two decision variables: the number of companies in the coalition: and the threshold to determine whether to place an emergency order or not, compared with the remaining ordinary order's arrival time.

Two indirect comparisons performed to evaluate progression-free survival in patients treated with everolimus vs axitinib suggested similar efficacy between the two treatments. Therefore, this analysis compares the lifetime costs of these two therapies among sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients from a US payer perspective. Research design and methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients and estimate the cost of treating patients with everolimus vs axitinib. The following health states were included: stable disease without adverse events (AEs), stable disease with AEs, disease progression (PD), and death. The model included the following resources: active treatments, post-progression treatments, adverse events, physician and nurse visits, scans and tests, and palliative care. Resource utilization inputs were derived from a US claims database analysis. Additionally, a 3% annual discount rate was applied to costs, and the robustness of the model results was tested by conducting sensitivity analyses, including those on dosing scheme and post-progression treatment costs. Results: Base case results demonstrated that patients treated with everolimus cost an average of $12,985 (11%) less over their lifetimes than patients treated with axitinib. The primary difference in costs was related to active treatment, which was largely driven by axitinib's higher dose intensity. Results remained consistent across sensitivity analyses for AE and PD treatment costs, as well as dose intensity and discount rates. Conclusion: The results suggest that everolimus likely leads to lower lifetime costs than axitinib for sunitinib-refractory advanced RCC patients in the US.","[Perrin, Allison; Sherman, Steven; Chua, Andrew; Gorritz, Magdaliz; Casciano, Roman] LASER Analyt, New York, NY 10022 USA; [Pal, Sumanta] City Hope Comprehens Canc Ctr, Duarte, CA USA; [Liu, Zhimei; Wang, Xufang; Culver, Kenneth] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Garrison, Louis P.] Univ Washington, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",City of Hope; Novartis; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Perrin, A (通讯作者)，LASER Analyt, Global Outcomes Res & Pricing, 875 Third Ave,Suite 6A 6th Floor, New York, NY 10022 USA.",allison.perrin@la-ser.com,,"Casciano, Roman/0000-0002-7083-9536",Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation,Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation(Novartis),"Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation provided funding for this study.

Given its high prevalence and poor survival rates, it is important to understand costs associated with NSCLC treatment. Objectives: To carry out an incidence-based study in three European countries: France, Germany, and the UK, to estimate the cost of NSCLC treatment. Methods: Three similar administrative databases were accessed; Hospital Episode Statistics (England), Gesundheitsforen Leipzig (Germany), French Hospital Discharge system (France), using ICD-9/10 codes and treatment/surgery algorithms to identify NSCLC patients. An incidence population of NSCLC patients was obtained using an index year (ranging from 2007-2008), ensuring the absence of prior lung cancer (12-months). Data were extracted on treatment information, patient characteristics, and disease staging. Average NSCLC treatment costs were estimated by age and severity. For England, 20,081 patients were identified, for France, 15,061, and for Germany, 1038. Results: In-patient length of stay was 8.9, 8.7, and 10.1 days for France, England, and Germany, respectively, for the first year. Average total costs for the 2-year follow-up period for France, England, and Germany were (sic)25,063, (sic)17,777, and (sic)32,500, respectively. Sub-group analyses showed higher costs for younger patients and those with metastatic disease. Conclusion: Considerable differences in average treatment costs were observed. In-patient costs dominate in the first year of treatment in all countries. The study highlights the costly nature of NSCLC.","[McGuire, A.] LSE, London, England; [McGuire, A.; Martin, M.] Mapi, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Lenz, C.] Pfizer, Berlin, Germany; [Sollano, J.

This study aimed to capture UK societal utility values for health states associated with T2DM and treatment-related adverse events (AEs) to assess the burden of the disease and common AEs. Methods: Nine health state descriptions were developed (from a literature review and patient and clinician qualitative input) depicting the burden associated with T2DM and treatment-related AEs. These were mild/moderate urinary tract infection (UTI); severe UTI; mycotic infection; moderate hypoglycemic events; severe hypoglycemic events; fear of hypoglycemia; gastrointestinal symptoms; and hypovolemic events. Members of the UK general public (n = 100) valued these states using the time trade-off (TTO) methodology to elicit utility values (between 0 = dead, 1 = full health). Regression analysis was conducted to understand the influence of age and gender. Results: All treatment-related AEs were found to have a significant effect on utility. From the T2DM baseline state (0.92), the experience of AEs was associated with the following disutility: T2DM with hypovolemic events (0.08); T2DM with mild/moderate UTIs (0.09); T2DM with moderate hypoglycemic events (0.11); T2DM with severe hypoglycemic events (0.15); T2DM with fear of hypoglycemia (0.15); T2DM with severe UTIs (0.19); T2DM with GI symptoms (0.24); and T2DM with mycotic infection (0.25); Males consistently scored the states with significantly lower utility values, but no significant age effects emerged. Conclusions: Findings suggest that adverse events in T2DM can be a burden for some individuals. The study indicates the potential importance of including information regarding AEs in economic evaluations. Although some states were rated severely in terms of utility; in reality, many of these only last a few days, therefore having a minimal quality-adjusted life year (QALY) impact.","[Shingler, S.; Fordham, B.; Lloyd, A.

Given a train operator's fixed timetable and a fleet of train units of different types, the TUSP aims at determining an assignment plan such that each train trip in the timetable is appropriately covered by a single or coupled train units. The TUSP is challenging due to its complex nature. Our branch-and-price approach includes a branching system with multiple branching rules for satisfying real-world requirements that are difficult to realize by linear constraints, such as unit type coupling compatibility relations and locations banned for coupling/decoupling. The approach also benefits from an adaptive node selection method, a column inheritance strategy and a feature of estimated upper bounds with node reservation functions. The branch-and-price solver designed for TUSP is capable of handling instances of up to about 500 train trips. Computational experiments were conducted based on real-world problem instances from First ScotRail. The results are satisfied by rail practitioners and are generally competitive or better than the manual ones. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Lin, Zhiyuan; Kwan, Raymond S.

Methods: The influence of increasing biologics use for treatment of RA during 2012-2022 and for treatment of CD during 2013-2023 was modeled from a societal perspective. The economic model incorporated current and projected medical, indirect, and drug costs and epidemiologic and economic factors. Costs associated with expanded biologics use for RA were compared with non-expanded use in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. A similar analysis was conducted for CD in Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico. Results: Accounting for additional costs of biologics and medical and indirect cost offsets, the model predicts that expanded use of biologics for patients with RA from 2012 to 2022 will result in cumulative net cost savings of ARS$2.351 billion in Argentina, R$9.004 billion in Brazil, COP$728.577 billion in Colombia, and MXN$18.02 billion in Mexico; expanded use of biologics for patients with CD from 2013 to 2023 will result in cumulative net cost savings for patients with CD of R$0.082 billion in Brazil, COP$502.74 billion in Colombia, and MXN$1.80 billion in Mexico. Indirect cost offsets associated with expanded biologics use were a key driver in reducing annual per-patient net costs for RA and CD. Limitations: Future economic projections are limited by the potential variance between projected and actual future values of biologic prices, wages, medical costs, and gross national product for each country. Conclusions: Increasing biologics use to treat RA and CD may limit cost growth over time by reducing medical and indirect costs. These findings may inform policy decisions regarding biologics use in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.","[Tundia, Namita; Skup, Martha; Chaves, Leonardo; Chao, Jingdong; Bao, Yanjun] AbbVie Inc, N Chicago, IL USA; [Kotze, Paulo Gustavo] Catholic Univ Parana, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil; [Serrano, Jorge Rojas] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [de Abreu, Mirhelen Mendes] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Macaulay, Dendy; Signorovitch, James] Anal Grp, New York, NY USA",AbbVie; Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro; Analysis Group Inc.,"Tundia, N (通讯作者)，AbbVie Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, 1 N Waukegan Rd,D-GMH1,AP31-1 NE, N Chicago, IL 60064 USA.",namita.tundia@abbvie.com,"Kotze, Paulo/AAC-9376-2019; Serrano, Jorge/GVT-0742-2022","Kotze, Paulo/0000-0002-9632-6691;","AbbVie, Inc.","AbbVie, Inc.(Abbott LaboratoriesAbbVie)","This study and all data analyses were funded by AbbVie, Inc.

The studied two objectives are: (i) the minimization of the violation of the vessels' expected turnaround time windows with the purpose of meeting the timetables published by shipping liners, and (ii) the minimization of the total yard transportation distance with the aim to lower terminal operational cost. We propose a bi-objective integer program which can comprehensively address the import, export and transshipment tasks in port daily practice. Traditionally, a container transshipment task is performed as a couple of import and export tasks, called indirect-transshipment mode, in which the transit container are needed to be temporally stored in the yard. As the way of transferring containers directly from the incoming vessel to the outgoing vessel, called direct-transshipment mode, has potential to save yard storage resources, the proposed model also incorporates both indirect- and direct-transshipment modes. To produce Pareto solutions efficiently, we devise heuristic approaches. Numerical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper assesses the total annual, direct, and indirect cost of severe hypoglycemia events (SHEs) in nine European countries: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia/the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (MK), Poland, Slovenia, and Spain.Methods: Data was collected on epidemiology, treatment structure, SHE-driven resource consumption, and unit costs. Two systematic reviewson the SHE rates and the resources used for treatmentand data on the days-of-work lost due to SHE along with salaries and employment rates were used. The total SHE cost in each country was calculated and how the differences are driven by individual parameters was analysed.Results: The annual costs of SHEs varied in absolute terms from Euro379,951.25 in MK up to Euro58,429,684.40 in Spain, orwhen expressed per one drug-treated DM patientfrom Euro5.47 in Bulgaria up to Euro17.74 in Spain. Indirect cost constituted between 6.01% (MK) and 26.49% (Hungary) of the total cost. The differences between countries are driven mostly by the cost of treating a single event, and this is related to general differences in prices.Limitations: The main limitation is the lack of good quality data in some parts, and the necessity to use mean-value imputations, experts' opinions, etc. Additionally, we only considered DM treatment as the SHE driver, while other elements, e.g. style of living, may contribute substantially.Conclusions: A common framework can be applied to estimate the economic burden of SHE in various countries, allowing one to identify the drivers of differences in cost. Treating DM is complex, and so no resolute conclusions ought to be drawn as to whether SHE management is better in one country than another.","[Jakubczyk, Michal] Warsaw Sch Econ, Decis Anal & Support Unit, Warsaw, Poland; [Lipka, Izabela; Paweska, Justyna; Rdzanek, Elzbieta] HealthQuest Spolka & Org Odpowiedzialnoscia SpK, Warsaw, Poland; [Niewada, Maciej] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Expt & Clin Pharmacol, Warsaw, Poland; [Zaletel, Jelka] Univ Med Ctr, Dept Endocrinol Diabet & Metab Dis, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Ramirez de Arellano, Antonio] Novo Nordisk Pharma, Madrid, Spain; [Dolezal, Tomas] Inst Hlth Econ & Technol Assessment, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dolezal, Tomas] 2nd Fac Med, Dept Pharmacol, Prague, Czech Republic; [Mitreva, Biljana Chekorova] Novo Nordisk Pharma, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Nagy, Bence] Healthware Consulting Ltd, Budapest, Hungary; [Petrova, Guenka] Med Univ Sofia, Dept Social Pharm & Pharmacoecon, Fac Pharm, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Saric, Tereza] Promeritus Savjetovanje Ltd, Zagreb, Croatia; [Yfantopoulos, John] Univ Athens, Sch Econ & Polit Sci, GR-10679 Athens, Greece; [Czech, Marcin] Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Pharmacoecon, Zwirki & Wigury 81, PL-02091 Warsaw, Poland; [Czech, Marcin] Warsaw Univ Technol, Business Sch, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics; Medical University of Warsaw; University Medical Centre Ljubljana; Novo Nordisk; Charles University Prague; Medical University Sofia; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Medical University of Warsaw; Warsaw University of Technology,"Czech, M (通讯作者)，Med Univ Warsaw, Dept Pharmacoecon, Zwirki & Wigury 81, PL-02091 Warsaw, Poland.",marcin.czech@wum.edu.pl,"Doležal, Tomáš/H-8967-2017; Jakubczyk, Michal/F-8435-2013; Petrova, Guenka/I-6863-2019; Yfantopoulos, John/ABA-7730-2020; Czech, Marcin/V-5849-2019","Jakubczyk, Michal/0000-0002-0006-6769; Petrova, Guenka/0000-0001-8116-5138; Czech, Marcin/0000-0001-7292-1712; NIEWADA, MACIEJ/0000-0002-3730-1996",Novo Nordisk,Novo Nordisk(Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk Foundation),"The authors would like to acknowledge the following people: Thanos Chantzaras, Katalin Ersek, Roberta Montagnoli, Karel Rychna, Irina Ryzhenkova, Sanda Sandalj, Zsofia Tarjanyi and Vasil Valov for their helpful comments.

In addition, a part of the transportation plan can be carried out on limited-capacity scheduled public transportation line services. This paper proposes a scenario-based sample average approximation approach for the PDPTW-SLSD. An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic embedded into sample average approximation method is used to generate good-quality solutions. Computational results on instances with up to 40 requests (i.e., 80 locations) reveal that the integrated transportation networks can lead to operational cost savings of up to 16% compared with classical pickup and delivery systems.

Electric vehicles (EVs) have the potential to reduce the greenhouse effect and facilitate more efficient use of energy resources. In this paper, we study several EV route planning problems that take into consideration possible battery charging or swapping operations. Given a road network, the objective is to determine the shortest (travel time) route that a vehicle with a given battery capacity can take to travel between a pair of vertices or to visit a set of vertices with several stops, if necessary, at battery switch stations. We present polynomial time algorithms for the EV shortest travel time path problem and the fixed tour EV touring problem, where the fixed tour problem requires visiting a set of vertices in a given order. Based on the result, we also propose constant factor approximation algorithms for the EV touring problem, which is a generalization of the traveling salesman problem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Descriptive and multivariate analyses were performed.Results:A total of 274 nebulized arformoterol users and 143 nebulized formoterol users were identified with comparable demographic characteristics. However, significant differences were observed between the two groups in some clinical characteristics at index including comorbidities and use of antibiotics. At 1 year post-index, a lower proportion of nebulized arformoterol users had 1 exacerbation compared to nebulized formoterol users (70.4% vs 80.4%; p=0.028). Among patients with 1 hospital admission, COPD-related costs per inpatient stay were significantly lower for nebulized arformoterol users than nebulized formoterol users (median=$9542 vs $14,025; p=0.009). After controlling for confounders, nebulized arformoterol users had 19% marginally lower risk of exacerbations than nebulized formoterol users (hazard ratio=0.81, 95% confidence interval=0.64-1.03; p<0.084) and 14.4% marginally lower COPD-related total costs at 1 year post-index (p=0.062), primarily related to fewer hospital readmissions (7.6% vs 12.2%) and lower average costs per readmission stay (median=$7392 vs $18 081; p=0.006).Conclusions:This study suggests that the choice of nebulized LABA may influence COPD-related exacerbation occurrence and costs.

Additionally, we need to sustain our natural resources to be replenished and continue support our human population growth that is continued to increase in alarming rate rather than development, which is in a slow rate that does not meet the demands. This paper is to discuss the importance of global agro-ecosystems, to support humans' needs for feeding and continue their lives in a healthy and sustainable life and to function within the society. In addition, the paper will show the availability of the agriculture natural resources in terms of global ecological biological capacities in hectares and the trends in using these resources in terms of an ecological footprint in hectares. Additionally, we study the term of ecological human imprint in relation to the agro-ecosystem as suggested by Shakir Hanna et al; 2014. Further the paper will address the impacts of agro-ecosystem on global economy and, further discuss the impacts of human technological advances on agro-ecosystems ecologically, economically, and social importance. Our results show that the global population will be 10.50 billion people in 2050 (i.e. 1.1% the current population growth). The available global cropped land is 2.36 billion global hectares in 2008.

A retrospective claims-based analysis,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hidradenitis suppurativa; Non-curative surgery; Healthcare resource utilization; Healthcare costs; Economic burden,RECURRENCE; OUTCOMES,"Objective Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is often treated by surgery. The risk of recurrence after surgery is common and the consequences are substantial, but neither has been quantified using a claims database. This study aimed to estimate the burden associated with non-curative surgery in HS patients. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of health insurance claims data from Q1 1999 to Q2 2011 in a US claims database. The analysis included 2668 adults with >= 1 diagnosis of HS and >= 1 claim for skin surgery within 6 months after diagnosis. Healthcare resource utilization and medical costs were compared using multivariate regressions. Results Overall, 46% of HS patients had >= 1 indicator of non-curative surgery. The incidences of inpatient, emergency department, and outpatient visits were 88%, 40%, and 30% higher, respectively, for patients with non-curative surgery vs patients without indicator of non-curative surgery (all p < 0.001). Average medical costs were $11,858 and $6427 for patients with and without indicators of non-curative surgery, respectively. The difference of $4185 (p < 0.001) was mainly driven by inpatient costs (difference = $2685; p < 0.001). Limitations Indicators of non-curative HS surgery were defined based on an empirical algorithm. Conclusions Non-curative HS surgery occurred in almost half of all cases and represents a significant burden on patients and payers in terms of resource utilization and costs.","[Jemec, Gregor B.

Past research on real-time control has focused on developing and evaluating the effectiveness of different control strategies, largely relying on running times and demand which are assumed to be static. We formulate a mathematical model for holding control optimization that reflects dynamic running times and demand. The model can be used to produce a plan of holding times that accounts not only for the current state of the system, but also for expected changes in running times and demand. We evaluate the effectiveness of the model within a simulation environment. The results show that control based on dynamic inputs outperforms its static equivalent in high demand cases where passengers can be left behind at stops, and to a lesser extent in low to moderate demand cases with time-varying running times.

Patients were classified into three baseline CVD risk groups (highest, medium, and lowest) and followed from July 1, 2010 until 1 year or censoring (follow-up) to measure per-patient per-month (PPPM) all-cause healthcare costs. Multivariable regression compared costs between patients with/without MACE during follow-up. Patients with MACE were further followed for up to 1 year after initial event to quantify longitudinal event costs.Results:Sample comprised 1,415,598 T2DM patients. Over average follow-up ranging from 301-343 days across CVD risk groups, 10,399 patients experienced MACE. Expected multivariable-adjusted mean PPPM costs of MACE per 100 covered patients within each CVD risk group varied by payer and generally increased with CVD risk (range=$1555 in lowest-risk commercially insured patients to $18,727 in highest-risk Medicaid-insured patients). Longitudinal costs of MACE were lowest among Medicare Supplemental-insured patients with stroke ($22,657 initial event, $2488 PPPM up-to 1-year follow-up care) and highest among Medicaid-insured patients with MI ($41,505 initial event, $4799 PPPM up to 1-year follow-up care).Conclusions:These results illustrate the potential clinical and economic importance of considering patients' CVD risk and medications' cardiovascular safety profile when treating T2DM patients.","[Johnston, Stephen S.; Kalsekar, Iftekhar] Truven Hlth Analyt, Bethesda, MD USA; [Sheehan, John J.; Kalsekar, Iftekhar] AstraZeneca, Ft Washington, PA USA; [Shah, Manan] Bristol Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Cappell, Katherine; Princic, Nicole; Smith, David] Truven Hlth Analyt, Ann Arbor, MI USA",AstraZeneca; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Johnston, SS (通讯作者)，7700 Old Georgetown Rd,Ste 650, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",stephen.johnston@truvenhealth.com,,", Tushar/0000-0002-8527-8719; , Gaurav/0000-0001-9787-7914","AstraZeneca, Fort Washington, PA; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ","AstraZeneca, Fort Washington, PA; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ(Bristol-Myers Squibb)","This study was sponsored by AstraZeneca, Fort Washington, PA, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ.

Rapid transit services operate on fixed routes and dedicated lanes, and with fixed schedules, whereas dial-a-ride services can make use of the existing road network, hence are much more economical to implement. It is obvious that the urban development densities to financially sustain these two service types are different. This study integrates these two service networks into one multi-modal network and then determines the optimal combination of these two service types under user equilibrium (UE) flows for a given urban density. Then we investigate the minimum or critical urban density required to financially sustain the rapid transit line(s). The approach of robust optimization is used to address the stochastic demands as captured in a polyhedral uncertainty set, which is then reformulated by its dual problem and incorporated accordingly. The UE principle is represented by a set of variational inequality (VI) constraints. Eventually, the whole problem is linearized and formulated as a mixed-integer linear program. A cutting constraint algorithm is adopted to address the computational difficulty arising from the VI constraints. The paper studies the implications of three different population distribution patterns, two CBD locations, and produces the resultant sequences of adding more rapid transit services as the population density increases.

While much has been published about how to design cost-utility models for RA to conduct these evaluations, less has been written about the sources of data populating those models. The goal is to review the literature and to provide recommendations for future data collection efforts. Methods: This study reviewed RA cost-utility models published between January 2006 and February 2014 focusing on five key sources of data (health-related quality-of-life and utility, clinical outcomes, disease progression, course of treatment, and healthcare resource use and costs). It provided recommendations for collecting the appropriate data during clinical and other studies to support modeling of biologic treatments for RA. Results: Twenty-four publications met the selection criteria. Almost all used two steps to convert clinical outcomes data to utilities rather than more direct methods; most did not use clinical outcomes measures that captured absolute levels of disease activity and physical functioning; one-third of them, in contrast with clinical reality, assumed zero disease progression for biologic-treated patients; little more than half evaluated courses of treatment reflecting guideline-based or actual clinical care; and healthcare resource use and cost data were often incomplete. Conclusions: Based on these findings, it is recommended that future studies collect clinical outcomes and health-related quality-of-life data using appropriate instruments that can convert directly to utilities; collect data on actual disease progression; be designed to capture real-world courses of treatment; and collect detailed data on a wide range of healthcare resources and costs.","[Ganz, Michael L.] Evidera, Lexington, MA 02420 USA; [Hansen, Brian Bekker; Strandberg-Larsen, Martin] Novo Nordisk AS, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; [Valencia, Xavier] Bristol Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ USA",Evidera; Novo Nordisk; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Ganz, ML (通讯作者)，Evidera, 430 Bedford St,Suite 300, Lexington, MA 02420 USA.",michael.ganz@evidera.com,"Hansen, Brian Bekker/P-7054-2019","Ganz, Michael/0000-0002-9702-2999",Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk),This study was funded by Novo Nordisk A/S.,,0,2,2,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

By partial online information, we mean that the arrival time of the incoming transit vehicles is available for a subset of the lines serving a stop. To cope with the partial information assumption, a new routing strategy is proposed and closed form formulae for computing expected waiting times and line boarding probabilities are derived. The proposed strategy unifies existing hyperpath-based transit route choice models that assume either no information or full information. Like many existing models, it ensures optimality when all information is available or the headway is exponentially distributed. The problem of determining the attractive set is discussed for each of the three information cases. In particular, a new heuristic algorithm is developed to generate the attractive set in the partial information case, which will always yield a solution no worse than that obtained without any information. The paper also reveals that, when information is available, an optimal hyperpath may contain cycles. Accordingly, the cause of such cycles is analyzed, and a sufficient condition that excludes cycles from optimal hyperpaths is proposed. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the impact of information availability on expected travel times and transit line load distributions. Among other findings, the results suggest that it is more useful to have information on faster lines than on slower lines. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent retrospective studies demonstrated that treatment with the sublingual film formulation is associated with improved treatment retention and lower healthcare costs. In March 2013, generic buprenorphine/naloxone tablets were approved in the US. A budget impact model was built to compare healthcare expenditures for different market shares of sublingual film and tablet. Methods: A Markov model was developed to track a cohort of opioid dependent patients treated with sublingual film or tablet through the following treatment phases: initiation, maintenance, discontinuation, off-treatment and reinitiation. Transition probabilities and costs for each phase were estimated from the MarketScan Medicaid database for the period between 1 March 2010 and 30 June 2012. The total expenditure for the plan and expenditure per plan member per month were predicted over 5 years. Two market share scenarios were considered: 1) sublingual film is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current situation) and 2) the sublingual film holds a market share of 100%. Results: Predicted total costs over 5 years were $6400 million when the sublingual film holds a market share of 100% (as per Scenario 2) which is lower than when sublingual film is progressively replaced by generic tablet (current situation as per Scenario 1) by $64 million. These savings were mostly driven by inpatient care ($56 million saved over 5 years), followed by emergency room care ($27 million) and pharmaceutical costs ($24 million). Costs of outpatient care attenuated the difference as they were predicted to be higher by $44 million in Scenario 2. The reduction in total cost per member per month reached $0.027 in the fifth year. Results were most sensitive to price rebates and to the probability of non-psychiatric hospitalization. Conclusions: While using the sublingual film formulation for more patients treated with buprenorphine/naloxone is predicted to increase outpatient care costs, it would generate savings in emergency care and hospitalizations. In the treatment of opioid dependence, total direct medical costs for Medicaid would be lower for sublingual film treated patients, at current drug prices.","[Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med Peoria, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Pharm, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Clay, Emilie; Aballea, Samuel] Creat Ceut, Paris, France; [Kharitonova, Elizaveta] Creat Ceut, Chicago, IL USA; [Zah, Vladimir] ZRx Outcomes Res Inc, Mississauga, ON, Canada; [Ruby, Jane] Reckitt Benckiser Pharmaceut Inc, Richmond, VA USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; Reckitt Benckiser,"Asche, CV (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Med Peoria, Med, 1 Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA.",cva@uic.edu,"Zah, Vlad/AAI-9140-2020","Zah, Vlad/0000-0003-1368-4491; Asche, Carl V/0000-0002-3193-6800",,,,,0,8,8,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

J,"Cawley, J",,,,"Cawley, John",,,A selective review of the first 20 years of instrumental variables models in health-services research and medicine,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Instrumental variables; Econometrics; Methods; Health,,"Background: The method of instrumental variables (IV) is useful for estimating causal effects. Intuitively, it exploits exogenous variation in the treatment, sometimes called natural experiments or instruments. This study reviews the literature in health-services research and medical research that applies the method of instrumental variables, documents trends in its use, and offers examples of various types of instruments. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed and EconLit research databases for English-language journal articles published after 1990 yielded a total of 522 original research articles. Citations counts for each article were derived from the Web of Science. A selective review was conducted, with articles prioritized based on number of citations, validity and power of the instrument, and type of instrument. Results: The average annual number of papers in health services research and medical research that apply the method of instrumental variables rose from 1.2 in 1991-1995 to 41.8 in 2006-2010. Commonly-used instruments (natural experiments) in health and medicine are relative distance to a medical care provider offering the treatment and the medical care provider's historic tendency to administer the treatment. Less common but still noteworthy instruments include randomization of treatment for reasons other than research, randomized encouragement to undertake the treatment, day of week of admission as an instrument for waiting time for surgery, and genes as an instrument for whether the respondent has a heritable condition. Conclusion: The use of the method of IV has increased dramatically in the past 20 years, and a wide range of instruments have been used. Applications of the method of IV have in several cases upended conventional wisdom that was based on correlations and led to important insights about health and healthcare. Future research should pursue new applications of existing instruments and search for new instruments that are powerful and valid.","[Cawley, John] Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Cawley, John] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",Cornell University; University of Sydney,"Cawley, J (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Management, 2312 MVR Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",JHC38@cornell.edu,"Cawley, John/E-6734-2010","Cawley, John/0000-0002-4805-9883",,,,,0,13,13,1,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the intravenous iron preparation ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) for the treatment of iron deficiency in CHF from a Swedish healthcare perspective. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis with a time horizon of 24 weeks was performed to compare FCM treatment with placebo. Data on health outcomes and medical resource use were mainly taken from the FAIR-HF trial and combined with Swedish cost data. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as well as the change in per-patient costs for primary care and hospital care. Results: In the FCM group compared with placebo, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are higher (difference = 0.037 QALYs), but so are per-patient costs [(difference = SEK 2789 ((sic)303)]. Primary care and hospital care equally share the additional costs, but within hospitals there is a major shift of costs from inpatient care to outpatient care. The ICER is SEK 75,389 ((sic)8194) per QALY. The robustness of the result is supported by sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Treatment of iron deficiency in CHF with FCM compared with placebo is estimated to be cost-effective. The ICER in the base case scenario is twice as high as previously thought, but noticeably below SEK 500,000 ((sic)54,300) per QALY, an informal average reference value used by the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency.

Methods: Patients were included in the study if they were English-speaking, ages>18 years, had type 1 or 2 diabetes, and had a recent transition of care experience (inpatient hospital stay or emergency department/urgent care/paramedic or other acute care visit). The study had a non-randomized design where intervention patients, enrolled July 1, 2012-September 30, 2013, were administered MTM at four visits over 6 months and were compared to historical control patients with available electronic medical records from August 8, 2008 to March 15, 2012. The primary study end-point was the rate of 30-day hospital readmissions, as related to the reason for the index admission. Secondary end-points included the cumulative rate of all-cause hospitalizations, emergency department, paramedic and urgent care visits at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days post-discharge as well as imputed total costs, including prescription medication costs, at 180 days. Propensity score weights were constructed to balance covariate characteristics between the intervention and control groups. Weighted multivariate negative binomial and generalized linear regressions were used to model cumulative utilization rates and log-transformed costs, respectively. Results: The intervention (n = 28) and control (n = 73) groups had 0% hospital readmissions at 30 days post-discharge. In propensity score weighted multivariate analyses, cumulative utilization rate was not different between the two groups (IRR = 1.61, p = 0.72 at 180 days) while costs in the intervention group were lower but not statistically different (cost ratio = 0.65, p = 0.13 at 180 days). Conclusions: Further studies should investigate whether the integration of pharmacists in transition of care models could reduce readmission and healthcare utilization rates post-discharge.","[Shaya, Fadia T.; Chirikov, Viktor V.; Rochester, Charmaine; Zaghab, Roxanne W.] Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Shaya, Fadia T.] Univ Maryland, Sch Med, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA; [Kucharski, Kathrin C.] Sanofi US Inc, Bridgewater, NJ USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland Baltimore; Sanofi-Aventis,"Shaya, FT (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Sch Pharm, Pharmaceut Hlth Serv Res, 220 Arch St,12th Floor, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.",fshaya@rx.umaryland.edu,,,"Sanofi US, Inc.

A common approach to solve the PRP exactly is through speed discretization, i.e., assuming that speed over each arc is chosen from a prescribed set of values. In this paper, we keep speed as a continuous decision variable within an interval and propose new formulations for the PRP. In particular, we build two mixed-integer convex optimization models for the PRP, by employing tools from disjunctive convex programming. These are the first arc-based formulations for the PRP with continuous speed. We also derive several families of valid inequalities to further strengthen both models. We test the proposed formulations on benchmark instances. Some instances are solved to optimality for the first time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast to other existing models, which are NP-hard, our model is computationally the most tractable one being a linear program. We apply our optimization model to different instances of service PES2-SFM2 of line 8 of Shanghai Metro network spanning a full service period of one day (18 h) with thousands of active trains. For every instance, our model finds an optimal timetable very quickly (largest runtime being less than 13 s) with significant reduction in effective energy consumption (the worst case being 19.27%).

Within a time-discretized space-time network, the time dependent transit services are characterized by traveling arcs and waiting arcs with constant travel times. Instead of using traditional flow-based formulations, an agent-based integer linear formulation is proposed to represent boundedly rational decisions under strictly imposed capacity constraints, due to vehicle carrying capacity and station storage capacity. Focusing on a viable and limited sets of space-time path alternatives, the proposed single-level optimization model can be effectively decomposed to a time-dependent routing sub-problem for individual agents and a knapsack sub-problem for service arc selections through the Lagrangian decomposition. In addition, several practically important modeling issues are discussed, such as dynamic and personalized transit pricing, passenger inflow control as part of network restraint strategies, and penalty for early/late arrival. Finally, numerical experiments are performed to demonstrate the methodology and computational efficiency of our proposed model and algorithm. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Model inputs were derived from published incidence rates of hypoglycemic events and direct medical costs. Assumed intervention efficacy was based on published studies of an emerging technology which yielded 72.2% (LGS Trial; ACTRN12610000024044) and 31.8% (ASPIRE Trial; NCT01497938) reductions in severe and non-severe hypoglycemic events, respectively. Model outcomesincluding the number of severe (requiring medical assistance) and non-severe events, and direct/indirect medical costs (excluding intervention costs)were evaluated over a 1-year period for a hypothetical health plan and employer perspectives.Results: In a health plan with 10 million enrollees, patients without the intervention would have experienced 0.09 and 14.60 severe and non-severe hypoglycemic events per patient per year (PPPY), respectively (vs 0.02 severe and 9.96 non-severe events with the intervention). This translated into total direct medical cost savings of $45 million ($177 PPPY) for the health plan. For an employer with 100,000 employees, the intervention would have yielded additional savings of $492 PPPY in indirect costs.Conclusion: Insulin-treated patients experience hypoglycemic events, which are associated with substantial direct and indirect medical costs. The cost savings of reducing hypoglycemic events need to be weighed against the costs of using diabetes device interventions.","[Sussman, Matthew; Friedman, Mark; Menzin, Joseph] Boston Hlth Econ Inc, 20 Fox Rd, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Sierra, Joseph A.; Gill, Max; Kaufman, Francine; Vigersky, Robert] Medtron Diabet, Northridge, CA USA; [Garg, Satish] Univ Colorado Denver, Barbara Davis Ctr Childhood Diabet, Aurora, CO USA; [Bode, Bruce] Atlanta Diabet Associates, Atlanta, GA USA","Boston Health Economics, Inc.; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; Children's Hospital Colorado","Menzin, J (通讯作者)，Boston Hlth Econ Inc, 20 Fox Rd, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",jmenzin@bhei.com,,,Medtronic Diabetes,Medtronic Diabetes,This study was sponsored by Medtronic Diabetes.,,32,7,7,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The purpose of this study was to assess hospitalization incidence, patient characteristics, and medical cost and burden of cancer cachexia in the US. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) for 2009. Five cancers reported to have the highest cachexia incidence were assessed. The hospitalization incidence related to cachexia was estimated by cancer type, cost and length of stay were compared, and descriptive statistics were reported for each cancer type, as well as differences being compared between patients with and without cachexia. Results: Risk of inpatient death was higher for patients with cachexia in lung cancer (OR=1.32; CI=1.20-1.46) and in all cancers combined (OR=1.76; CI=1.67-1.85). The presence of cachexia increased length of stay in lung (IRR=1.05; CI=1.03-1.08), Kaposi's sarcoma (IRR=1.47; CI=1.14-1.89) and all cancers combined (IRR=1.09; CI=1.08-1.10). Additionally, cachectic patients in the composite category had a longer hospitalization stay compared to non-cachectic patients (3-9 days for those with cachexia and 2-7 days for those without cachexia). The cost of inpatient stay was significantly higher in cachexic than non-cachexic lung cancer patients ($13,560 vs $13 190; p<0.0001), as well as cachexic vs non-cachexic cancer patients in general (14 751 vs 13 928; p<0.0001). Conclusions: Cachexia increases hospitalization costs and length of stay in several cancer types. Identifying the medical burden associated with cancer cachexia will assist in developing an international consensus for recognition and coding by the medical community and ultimately an effective treatment plans for cancer cachexia.","[Arthur, Susan T.; Van Doren, Bryce A.; Roy, Debosree; Noone, Joshua M.; Zacherle, Emily; Blanchette, Christopher M.] Univ N Carolina, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Arthur, ST (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, 9201 Univ City Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",sarthur8@uncc.edu,,"Van Doren, Bryce/0000-0002-1272-7608","Helsinn Group, a cancer care company","Helsinn Group, a cancer care company","This work was supported by the Helsinn Group, a cancer care company.",,21,43,45,1,15,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, not all on-demand transport services are equal: not-for-profit dial-a-ride services with coordinated drivers significantly differ from profit-motivated taxi services with uncoordinated drivers. In fact, there are two key threads of work on efficient scheduling, routing, and pricing for passengers: dial-a-ride services; and taxi services. Unfortunately, there has been only limited development of algorithms for joint optimization of scheduling, routing, and pricing; largely due to the widespread assumption of fixed pricing. In this paper, we introduce another thread: profit motivated on-demand transport services with coordinated drivers. To maximize provider profits and the efficiency of the service, we propose a new market mechanism for this new thread of on-demand transport services, where passengers negotiate with the service provider. In contrast to previous work, our mechanism jointly optimizes scheduling, routing, and pricing. Ultimately, we demonstrate that our approach can lead to higher profits and reduced passenger prices, compared with standard fixed price approaches, while also improving efficiency.

West Coast shipments often have lower transit times but higher freight charges. To investigate factors affecting this routing decision, a coast choice model is estimated. Results are then used to project shifts in demand with the coming completion of the Panama Canal expansion. Our simulations show that if the Panama Canal expansion generates significant transit time savings on shipments from Asia, as projected, that there will be major shifts in traffic from West to East Coast ports, raising important policy implications for port operators on both coasts.

Methods: Patients with HR+/HER2- mBC who discontinued a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor and began a new line of treatment with everolimus-based therapy or chemotherapy (index therapy/index date) between July 20, 2012 and April 30, 2014 were identified from two large claims databases. All-cause, BC-related, and adverse event (AE)-related medical costs (in 2014 USD) and all-cause HRU per patient per month (PPPM) were analyzed for both treatment groups across patients' first four lines of therapies for mBC. Adjusted differences in costs and HRU between the everolimus and chemotherapy treatment group were estimated pooling all lines and using multivariable generalized linear models, accounting for difference in patient characteristics. Results: A total of 3298 patients were included: 902 everolimus-treated patients and 2636 chemotherapy-treated patients. Compared to chemotherapy, everolimus was associated with significantly lower all-cause (adjusted mean difference = $3455, p < 0.01) and BC-related ($2510, p < 0.01) total medical costs, with inpatient ($1344, p < 0.01) and outpatient costs ($1048, p < 0.01) as the main drivers for cost differences. Everolimus was also associated with significantly lower AE-related medical costs ($1730, p < 0.01), as well as significantly lower HRU (emergency room incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.83; inpatient IRR = 0.74; inpatient days IRR = 0.65; outpatient IRR = 0.71; BC-related outpatient IRR = 0.57; all p < 0.01). Conclusions: This retrospective claims database analysis of commercially-insured patients with HR+/HER2- mBC in the US showed that everolimus was associated with substantial all-cause, BC-related, and AE-related medical cost savings and less utilization of healthcare resources relative to chemotherapy.","[Li, Nanxin; Koo, Valerie; Fang, Anna; Peeples, Miranda; Kageleiry, Andrew; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Hao, Yanni] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Guerin, Annie] Anal Grp Inc, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Analysis Group Inc.; Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.,"Li, NX (通讯作者)，Anal Grp, 111 Huntington Ave,10th Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",nick.li@analysisgroup.com,"Li, Nanxin/D-9755-2011",,Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),Funding for this research was provided by Novartis.,,26,2,2,0,0,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

The DEFENSE study aimed to estimate the costs and HRQoL of patients with MS (PwMS) in Finland and explore how these variables are influenced by disease severity and relapses.Methods:Overall, 553 PwMS registered with the Finnish Neuro Society, a national patient association in Finland, completed a self-administered questionnaire capturing information on demographics, disease characteristics and severity (Expanded Disease Severity Scale [EDSS]), relapses, resource consumption and HRQoL.Results:The PwMS had a mean EDSS score of 4.0. Overall, 44.1% had relapsing-remitting form of the disease (RRMS). The mean age was 53.8 years and 55.7% had retired prematurely due to MS. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) were used by 42.7% of the study population, and 21.5% across all disease types and severities had experienced relapses during the previous year. The mean total annual cost of MS was Euro46,994, which increased with advancing disease from Euro10,835 (EDSS score=0) to Euro109,901 (EDSS score=8-9). The mean utility was 0.644. HRQoL decreased with increasing disease severity. Relapses imposed an additional utility decrement among the PwMS with RRMS and EDSS 5 and had a trend-like effect on total costs.Limitations:The cross-sectional setting did not allow assessment of the significance of relapses in early MS or the use of DMTs on the prognosis of the disease.Conclusion:The study confirms previous findings from other countries regarding a significant disease burden associated with MS and provides, for the first time, published numerical estimates from Finland. Treatments that slow disease progression and help PwMS retain employment for a longer duration have the highest potential to reduce the disease burden associated with MS.","[Ruutiainen, Juhani] Finnish Neuro Soc, FI-21251 Masku, Finland; [Ruutiainen, Juhani] Univ Turku, Turku, Finland; [Viita, Anna-Mari; Nissinen, Helena] Novartis Finland Oy, Espoo, Finland; [Hahl, Jarmo] AT Med Affairs Consulting Oy, Espoo, Finland; [Sundell, Jesse] StatFinn Oy, Turku, Finland",University of Turku,"Ruutiainen, J (通讯作者)，Finnish Neuro Soc, POB 15, FI-21251 Masku, Finland.",juhani.ruutiainen@neuroliitto.fi,,,Novartis Finland Oy; Finnish Neuro Society,Novartis Finland Oy; Finnish Neuro Society,The DEFENSE study was supported by Novartis Finland Oy and the Finnish Neuro Society.,,24,31,31,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

In this context, the mountain viticulture stands out from the others for various reasons, such as the lack of mechanisation, the low yield per hectare and its strong links with the surrounding territory, of which it has also become a landscape-heritage protection tool. The Peligna Valley is an inland zone of the Abruzzo region that houses a number of typical agricultural products, out of which winemaking stands out. Within the framework of a project financed by the Abruzzo Region with funding from the 2007-2013 RDP, the methodology of Carbon Footprint (OIV 2013. ISO 2013) was applied to the production of Montepulciano wine and the OIV (International Organisation of Vine and Wine) guidelines on sustainable and durable viticulture (CST 1-2004 and 1-2008 CST) were verified and applied. Therefore, the agricultural and oenological phases excluding the packaging, transport and consumption phases of two consecutive years were analysed. In this period, measures to reduce environmental impacts have been implemented. A deep analysis of the data revealed that the most impactful phase is farming, instead of the winemaking phase that represents an item much smaller in terms of GHG emissions. It was also seen that, thanks to the adoption of actions to reduce emissions, an improvement of the environmental performance was identified ranging from 7% and 15% of the total.

In this paper, we set up a theoretic model to analyze interactions between a firm's distribution strategy and traffic congestion. In an unregulated economy, we first characterize the private firm's optimal strategy concerning e-commerce under the influence of traffic congestion. We then examine a centralized economy where the firm is publicly owned and derive the distribution strategy that maximizes social welfare. Comparing the two cases, we show that the private firm's incentives may deviate from the socially optimal decisions, which leads to inefficiency. We identify two effects, i.e., monopoly effect and congestion externality effect, which drive the private firm to deviate from the social optimum. Based on our analysis, we propose a differentiated tolls/rebates policy to achieve maximum social welfare. Under such a policy, the firm will not only adopt the socially optimal distribution strategy but offer the socially optimal quantities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Five health states were included, chronic phase 2nd-line TKI, chronic phase 3rd-line TKI, chronic phase post-TKI, advanced phases, and death. Efficacy (response achievement, loss of response, transformation, death) and safety (adverse events incidence, discontinuation) data are based on clinical trials. Resource utilization, costs, and utilities were based on product labels and publically available data. Uncertainty analyses were conducted for key inputs.Results:In patients failing imatinib, dasatinib-initiating treatment sequences provide the most survival (LYs=0.2-2.0), QALYs (QALYs=0.2-1.9), and accrue highest CML-related costs (Costs=$64,000-$222,000). The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs imatinib-initiating sequences is $100,000 for an imatinib-resistant population. The average ICER per QALY for dasatinib- vs nilotinib-initiating sequences is $170,000 for an imatinib-resistant population, and $160,000 for an imatinib-intolerant population.Conclusions:This analysis suggests that dasatinib is associated with increased survival and quality of life compared to high dose imatinib and to a smaller extent with nilotinib, among patients resistant or intolerant to 1st-line imatinib, primarily based on higher cytogenetic response rates observed in clinical studies of dasatinib. Head-to-head studies of sequential use of dasatinib and nilotinib are needed to validate the model findings of improved survival (LYs) with better quality-of-life (QALYs) for patients initiating dasatinib in 2nd-line. However, the model findings (in light of higher cytogenetic response rates with dasatinib) are supported by other studies showing improved quality-of-life for responders, and improved survival for patients achieving cytogenetic response.","[Whalen, John; Ambavane, Apoorva] Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England; [Stillman, Ipek] Evidera, Lexington, MA USA; [Felber, Eugene; Makenbaeva, Dinara; Bolinder, Bjorn] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Evidera; Evidera; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Whalen, J (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London W6 8DL, England.",john.whalen@evidera.com,"Ambavane, Apoorva/AAW-4834-2020",,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),Funding for this study and development of this manuscript was provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,36,10,10,0,9,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods Data from the 2011 Japan National Health and Wellness Survey (NHWS; n = 30 000), an internet health survey fielded to a nationally representative sample of the Japanese population were used. Only women between the ages of 50-90 years were included in the analyses (n = 6950). Results Compared with matched controls (n = 404), patients with osteoporosis (n = 404) had lower MCS scores (48.94 vs 51.63), PCS scores (45.57 vs 49.12) (all p < 0.05). The presence of osteoporosis was associated with worse patient outcomes among those with hypertension, high cholesterol, and insomnia, among other conditions. Conclusions The results suggest a significant quality-of-life and economic burden for patients with osteoporosis in Japan. Moreover, in a complex co-morbid environment, the presence of osteoporosis contributes more to patient outcomes than other chronic conditions.","[Yamamoto, Luis A.; Kawaguchi, Isao] Pfizer Japan Inc, Med Affairs, Tokyo, Japan; [DiBonaventura, Marco] Kantar Hlth, Hlth Outcomes Practice, 11 Madison Ave,12th Floor, New York, NY 10010 USA",Pfizer,"DiBonaventura, M (通讯作者)，Kantar Hlth, Hlth Outcomes Practice, 11 Madison Ave,12th Floor, New York, NY 10010 USA.",marco.dibonaventura@kantarhealth.com,,,"Pfizer Japan, Inc.","Pfizer Japan, Inc.(Pfizer)","This study was funded by Pfizer Japan, Inc.",,36,4,4,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

It presents a meta-heuristic algorithm for solving the problem. The aim is to design routes for a fleet of homogeneous vehicles that will serve all customers, whose demands are formed by a set of three-dimensional, rectangular, weighted items. Unlike the well-studied capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3D loading constraints (3L-CVRP), the objective of the 3L-FCVRP is to minimize total fuel consumption rather than travel distance. The fuel consumption rate is assumed to be proportionate to the total weight of the vehicle. A route is feasible only if a feasible loading plan to load the demanded items into the vehicle exists and the loading plan must satisfy a set of practical constraints. To solve this problem, the evolutionary local search (ELS) framework incorporating the recombination method is used to explore the solution space, and a new heuristic based on open space is used to examine the feasibility of the solutions. In addition, two special data structures, Trie and Fibonacci heap, are adopted to speed up the procedure. To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we first test the ELS on the 3L-CVRP, which can be seen as a special case of the 3L-FCVRP. The results demonstrate that on average ELS outperforms all of the existing approaches and improves the best-known solutions for most instances. Then, we generate data for 3L-FCVRP and report the detailed results of the ELS for future comparisons. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The proposed model allows general network topologies and reflects uncertainty related to parking availability, including the possibility of cycling behavior as drivers search for parking. The equilibrium framework represents the mutual dependence between the probabilities of finding parking at different locations and the search processes employed by drivers to minimize total expected journey time (or cost). In this framework, network loading is represented by a system of nonlinear flow conservation networks, and feasibility and uniqueness issues are discussed. The equilibrium problem is formulated as a variational inequality and a convex combinations heuristic is proposed. Numerical results show that neglecting parking search can substantially underestimate network flows, and quantitatively demonstrate the relationship between parking duration effects and the cost of time spent walking relative to driving, and the expected driving and walking times.

The first part consists of estimation of regression and ARIMA-GARCH models to explain, predict, and control for common-cause variation in the data, i.e., changes that can be attributed to usual operating conditions, including traffic loads, environmental effects, and damage when present throughout the data. The second part of the framework consists of using multivariate control charts to simultaneously analyze the standardized innovations of the aforementioned models in order to detect possible special-cause or extraordinary events, such as unique/infrequent traffic, weather, or the onset of damage. The proposed approach revolves around construction of T-2 control charts as a framework to jointly monitor the evolution and contemporaneous correlation of a set of measurements. The approach provides significant practical/computational advantages over individual analysis of multiple structural properties, and addresses technical problems stemming from ignoring the relationships among them. To illustrate the framework, we analyze strain and displacement data from the monitoring system on the Hurley Bridge (Wisconsin Structure B-26-7). Data were collected from 1 April 2010 to 28 June 2012. Analysis of 7 measurement sequences collected over the 27 month planning horizon revealed 6 possible special-cause events. In terms of outlier interpretation, we use Mason-Young-Tracy Decomposition to establish the contribution of (subsets of) the measurements. Also, we link the most significant special-cause events, in terms of magnitude and duration, to unusual changes in weather and traffic. To conclude, we compare the proposed approach and benchmark the empirical results with Principal Component Analysis, perhaps, the most common alternative appearing in the literature.

To date, several queuing models been developed, but analytical insights on their global properties are hard to obtain. This is because in most cases, queuing dynamics are formulated as differential or difference equations, with possible discontinuities in their solutions, making most conventional analytical tools inadequate. As a result, simulations are often used to study these models, and if not properly treated, negative flows could arise from the simulation near certain discontinuities. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time queuing model that captures generalized queuing dynamics, where bottleneck discharging capacity and demand can vary simultaneously. We provide insights on the global properties of this model, upon deriving its closed-form variational solutions. Rather than resorting to the usual Hamilton-Jacobi theory, our derivations are built on an intrinsic periodicity property of the general queuing dynamics combined with measure-theoretic analysis. This treatment allows us to obtain results with more complex boundary conditions and make further extensions. We demonstrate its applications and show its solution properties in queuing simulation and performance bounding. In particular, we provide graphical, iterative and linearized solution schemes, which are all devoid of the well-known negative flow issue associated with numerical solutions to the point queue model.

Damage caused by disasters can be prevented or alleviated if sufficient investments are made in a timely manner. However, despite a wide range of investment options and well-developed engineering expertise, port investment on disaster prevention remains a challenging task involving great complexities. This paper develops an integrated economic model for the analysis of disaster-prevention investments at a landlord port. It simultaneously considers the uncertainty of disaster occurrence and associated return of prevention investments, the information accumulation and related investment timing, and the benefit spillovers of investment among stakeholders. Our analysis shows that the timing of port investments depends on the probability of disasters. Immediate investment is optimal for disasters with very high probability, while investment should be postponed if such a probability is very low. Optimal timing for cases of intermediate probability cannot be determined analytically, as it is influenced by other factors such as discount rate, information accumulation and efficiency of investments. Positive spillovers between a port and its tenants lead to under-investment, which can be corrected by coordination between stakeholders. However, since there are risks of overinvestment (the marginal benefits of investments are zero ex post if there is no disaster), regulatory intervention is not always optimal when the regulator does not have a good understanding of disaster probability distribution. Therefore, scientific research would bring significant economic and strategic value to policy, planning and investment decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although hub-and-spoke paradigm demonstrates significant advantages in improving network connectivity with less number of routes and saving operating cost, the failure of hubs and reactive disruption management could lead to substantial recovery cost to the operators. Thus, we propose a set of reliable huband-spoke network design models, where the selection of backup hubs and alternative routes are taken into consideration to proactively handle hub disruptions. To solve these nonlinear mixed integer formulations for reliable network design problems, Lagrangian relaxation and Branch-and-Bound methods are developed to efficiently obtain optimal solutions. Numerical experiments are conducted with respect to real data to demonstrate algorithm performance and to show that the resulting hub-and-spoke networks are more resilient to hub unavailability.

There are several reasons that motivate the integration of latent attributes, including better-informed modeling of random consumer heterogeneity and treatment of endogeneity. However, current work still is at an early stage and multiple simplifying assumptions are usually imposed. For instance, most previous applications assume all of the following: independence of taste shocks and of latent attributes, exclusion restrictions, linearity of the effect of the latent attributes on the utility function, continuous manifest variables, and an a priori bound for the number of latent constructs. We derive and apply a structural choice model with a multinomial probit kernel and discrete effect indicators to analyze continuous latent segments of travel behavior, including inference on the energy paradox. Our estimator allows for interaction and simultaneity among the latent attributes, residual correlation, nonlinear effects on the utility function, flexible substitution patterns, and temporal correlation within responses of the same individual. Statistical properties of the Bayes estimator that we propose are exact and are not affected by the number of latent attributes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These features make the SQS computationally expensive (almost intractable for large scale) but at the same time more suitable for real-life problems with high reliability expectations. Emergency response and on-demand transportation systems are two similar systems that can be modeled with the SQS. In this research, we aim to solve facility location problems as SQS with stochastic demand and service time. The stochasticity concerned here is temporal and spatial, that emerges from the uncertainty in the demand and service time. In order to tackle this problem Larson (1974)'s 2(n) hypercube queueing model (HQM) is extended to 3(n) HQM. In this model, there are two different possible service types for each server: (i) service for locations in the proximity of a server (area of responsibility) and (ii) service for other locations where the first responsible server is busy during this event. In addition, to decrease the dimension of the problem, which is intractable due to their size, a new 3(m) aggregate hypercube queueing model (AHQM) is developed that treats group of servers (bins) in a similar manner by considering interactions among bins. An efficient graph partitioning algorithm is proposed to cluster servers in groups with an objective to minimize the interactions among groups. Both exact and approximate approaches are integrated inside two optimization methods (i.e. variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing) to find server locations that improve system performance. Computational experiments showed that both models are applicable to use inside optimization algorithms to find good server locations and to improve system performance measures of SQS.

Methods: A Markov state-transition model was developed to estimate the numbers of schizophrenia patients recently-released from incarceration who would experience psychiatric relapse and/or arrest and re-incarceration over a period of 3 years, along with corresponding costs. The model includes three health states: (1) in community, on therapy, (2) in community, off therapy, and (3) incarcerated. It is assumed that a patient's probability of psychiatric hospitalization increases with treatment discontinuation, and the probability of arrest increases with the occurrence of a prior psychiatric hospitalization. Data from the US Census and Bureau of Justice Statistics were used to estimate the model population. Published literature was used to estimate the risks of psychiatric relapse, arrest, and all cost inputs. State-specific incarceration rates and sentence length data (from the state of Florida) were applied. The impact on outcomes and costs was evaluated by varying the rates of anti-psychotic treatment following release from incarceration and the annual risk of medication discontinuation. Results: Among 34,500 persons released from incarceration in the state of Florida annually, 5307 were estimated to have schizophrenia. The cumulative 3-year costs to the state government were $21,146,000 and $25,616,000 for criminal justice and psychiatric hospitalization costs, respectively ($3984 per patient criminal justice; $4827 per patient hospitalization costs). A relative 20% increase in the proportion of patients receiving antipsychotic treatment following release from incarceration decreased total cumulative costs over 3 years by $1,871,100 ($353 per patient). Conclusions: The economic impact of psychiatric relapse and recidivism among patients with schizophrenia is substantial from the state government perspective. This general model can be made state-specific by utilizing local criminal justice data sources.","[Lin, Iris; Munsell, Michael; Menzin, Joseph] Boston Hlth Econ Inc, Waltham, MA USA; [Muser, Erik; Benson, Carmela] Janssen Sci Affairs LLC, Titusville, NJ USA","Boston Health Economics, Inc.; Johnson & Johnson; Janssen Pharmaceuticals","Menzin, J (通讯作者)，Boston Hlth Econ, 20 Fox Rd, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",jmenzin@bhei.com,,,"Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC","This study was sponsored by Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC.",,0,10,10,0,7,INFORMA HEALTHCARE,LONDON,"TELEPHONE HOUSE, 69-77 PAUL STREET, LONDON EC2A 4LQ, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods: A cost-effectiveness decision tree model was constructed comparing OM-85 with the best supportive care/placebo therapy for managing the acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis in the Chinese population. Clinical efficacy and adverse events (AE) data were included in the model based on a thorough literature review. All localized direct treatment costs, including drug cost, AE costs, and medical treatment costs for underlining diseases were included from a Chinese third party payer perspective. A Key Opinion Leaders (KOL) survey was conducted with 20 senior physicians specialized in respiratory, ENT, allergy, and immunology fields from tertiary hospitals in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Shenyang, and Wuhan to validate the local treatment costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on the above efficacy and cost information. Results: OM-85 is a cost-effective therapy when compared with placebo (standard care). OM-85 can treat/prevent one additional full episode exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and one additional full episode exacerbation of rhinosinusitis with only additional costs of RMB 653 and RMB 1182.84, respectively. In comparison, each acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis will cost RMB 4510.10, and each acute exacerbation of rhinosinuisitis will cost RMB 1807.21 in a Chinese clinical management setting. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed and the ICER result was demonstrated to be consistent. Conclusions: OM 85 reduces acute exacerbations among patients with chronic bronchitis and chronic rhinosinusitis when compared with Placebo (standard care).

The primary study aim was assessment of direct costs of cancer medical care for patients suffering from cancer with assigned radiotherapy-based treatment protocols. Identification of key cost drivers and trends during 2010-2013 comparing brachytherapy and teleradiotherapy was a secondary objective of the study. Methods: Retrospective, bottom-up database analysis was conducted on electronic discharge invoices. Payer's perspective has been adopted with a 1-year long time horizon. Total sample size was 2544 patients during a 4-years long observation period (2010-2013). The sample consisted of all patients with confirmed malignancy disorder receiving inpatient radiation therapy in a large university hospital. Results: Diagnostics and treatment cost of cancer in the largest Western Balkans market of Serbia were heavily dominated by radiation therapy related direct medical costs. Total costs of care as well as mean cost per patient were steadily decreasing due to budget cuts caused by global recession. The paradox is that at the same time the budget share of radiotherapy increased for almost 15% and in value-based terms for (sic)109 per patient (in total (sic)109,330). Second ranked cost drivers were nursing care and imaging diagnostics. Costs of high-tech visualizing examinations were heavily dominated by nuclear medicine tests. Conclusion: The budget impact of radiation oncology to the large tertiary care university clinics of the Balkans is likely to remain significant in the future. Brachytherapy exhibited a slow growth pattern, while teleradiotherapy remained stable in terms of value-based turnover of medical services. Upcoming heavy investment into the national network of radiotherapy facilities will emphasize the unsatisfied needs. Huge contemporary budget share of radiotherapy coupled with rising cancer prevalence brings this issue into the hot spot of the ongoing cost containment efforts by local governments.","[Jakovljevic, Mihajlo] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol & Toxicol, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia; [Zugic, Ana] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Med Sci, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia; [Rankovic, Ana] Clin Ctr Kragujevac, Radiol Diagnost Serv, Kragujevac, Serbia; [Dagovic, Aleksandar] Clin Ctr Kragujevac, Oncol & Radiotherapy Ctr, Kragujevac, Serbia",University of Kragujevac; University of Kragujevac,"Jakovljevic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Med Sci, Grad Hlth Econ & Pharmacoecon Curricula, Svetozara Markovica 69, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",sidartagothama@gmail.com,"Jakovljevic, Mihajlo/B-3002-2014","Jakovljevic, Mihajlo/0000-0002-9160-6846; Dagovic, Aleksandar/0000-0002-4280-9831",Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [OI 175014],"Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)",The Ministry of Education Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia has funded this study through Grant OI 175014.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe 10 mg (EZ10) to atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg (A10/20) vs switching to rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg (R10/20) in Portuguese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or diabetes who are currently above the LDL-C goal. Methods: A Markov model was used to describe CHD disease progression and the lifetime costs and utilities associated with each disease state were used to estimate the gains in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), of the two treatment regimens. Model inputs, such as age, gender, and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors of the dyslipidemic Portuguese patients were obtained from the Portuguese cohort of the Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS). The efficacy of each treatment regimen, the cost of drugs and of treating CHD events, and the utilities for each disease state were derived from published sources. Results: The estimated lifetime discounted number of QALYs gained by patients treated with A10/20 was 8.70, while in those switching to R10/20 it was 8.81 and in those adding EZ10 it was 8.93. Discounted total health costs were estimated to be (sic)11,131 for A10/20, but (sic)14,511 and (sic)16,571 for R10/20 and A10/20 + EZ10, respectively. The ICER of adding ezetimibe vs switching to rosuvastatin was (sic)16,465/QALY. Based on the Portuguese cost-effectiveness willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic)30,000/QALY, adding ezetimibe vs switching to rosuvastatin would be a cost-effective use of resources in Portugal. Sensitivity analyses in patients with differing clinical histories (CHD or diabetes or both) yielded similar values, with no ICER over E30,000/QALY. Conclusions: From the perspective of the National Health Service, prescribing ezetimibe to high cardiovascular risk patients being treated with atorvastatin vs switching them to rosuvastatin is projected to be a cost-effective use of resources in Portugal.","[Laires, Pedro A.] Merck Sharp & Dohme Ltd, Oeiras, Portugal; [Ejzykowicz, Flavia; Hsu, Tun-Ying; Ambegaonkar, Baishali; Davies, Glenn] Merck & Co Inc, Whitehouse Stn, NJ USA",Merck & Company,"Laires, PA (通讯作者)，Quinta da Fonte, MSD Portugal, Ed Vasco da Gama 19, P-2770192 Paco De Arcos, Portugal.",pedro.laires@merck.com,"Laires, Pedro A/AAA-7663-2021","Laires, Pedro/0000-0002-1930-7913",,,,,0,9,9,1,1,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

For the specific case of a three-alternative nested logit (NL) model, we synthesise these conditions in the form of a simple two-part test, and reconcile this test with the conventional zero-one bounds on the structural ('log sum') parameter within this model, i.e. 0 < theta <= 1, where theta denotes the structural parameter. We show that, whilst regularity supports the lower bound of zero, moderate and strong stochastic transitivity may, for some preference orderings, give rise to a lower bound greater than zero, i.e. impose a constraint l <= theta, where l > 0. On the other hand, we show that neither regularity nor stochastic transitivity constrain the upper bound at one. Therefore, if the conventional zero-one bounds are imposed in model estimation, preferences which violate regularity and/or stochastic transitivity may either go undetected (if the 'true' structural parameter is less than zero) and/or be unknowingly admitted (if the 'true' lower bound is greater than zero), and preferences which comply with regularity and stochastic transitivity may be excluded (if the 'true' upper bound is greater than one). Against this background, we show that imposition of the zero-one bounds may compromise model fit, inferences of willingness-to-pay, and forecasts of choice behaviour. Finally, we show that where the 'true' structural parameter is negative (thereby violating RUM - at least when choosing the 'best' alternative), positive starting values for the structural parameter in estimation may prevent the exposure of regularity and stochastic transitivity failures.

Given a certain demand matrix, the model determines the most appropriate frequency and train capacity for each line taking into account infrastructure capacity constraints, allocating lines to tracks while assigning passengers to lines. The service provider and the user points of view are simultaneously taken into account. The first one is considered by selecting the most convenient set of frequencies and capacities and routing passengers from their origins to their destinations while minimizing the average trip time. The second one by minimizing operation, maintenance and fleet acquisition costs. Due to the huge number of variables and constraints appearing in real size instances, a preprocessing phase determining the best k-paths linking origin and destination stations is followed. Then, the best paths are used to define sparse index sets in order to drastically reduce the size of the problem. As illustration, the model is applied to a simplified version of the Madrid Metropolitan Railway network. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Usage frequency is used as a proxy for experience and two Separate mode choice models are estimated - one with experience conditioning choice and one without. Key model outputs are compared and we find that differences in the value of travel time savings and model elasticities are very marked. This suggests that ignoring experience that one has with each alternative in their choice set may be a candidate source of error in travel demand forecasts. We develop a method to obtain the level of experience for use in application of choice models to increase their prediction power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The role played by information in traffic networks is discussed, with particular reference to the day-to-day dynamics of the traffic network and to system stability at equilibrium. The perspective adopted is that of transportation planning under recurrent network conditions. The network is considered to be in equilibrium, viewed as a fixed-point state of a day-to-day deterministic process, here modelled as a time-discrete non-linear Markovian dynamic system. In discussing the effects generated by the introduction of ATIS, the paper examines: changes in the fixed point(s) with respect to the absence of ATIS, how the theoretical conditions for fixed-point existence and uniqueness are affected, and the impact on the stability properties and the stability region at equilibrium. Most of the analyses are carried out with explicit theoretical considerations. Moreover, a toy network is also employed to explore numerically the effects of removing some assumptions concerning the accuracy of ATIS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated the economic burden of ICT non-adherence in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) or thalassemia. Methods: Patients with SCD or thalassemia were identified from six state Medicaid programs (1997-2013). Adherence was estimated using the medication possession ratio (MPR) of >= 0.80. All-cause and disease-specific resource utilization per-patient-per-month (PPPM) was assessed and compared between adherent and non-adherent patients using adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR). All-cause and disease-specific healthcare costs were computed using mean cost PPPM. Regression models adjusting for baseline characteristics were used to compare adherent and non-adherent patients. Results: A total of 728 eligible patients treated with ICT in the SCD cohort, 461 (63%) adherent, and 218 in the thalassemia cohort, 137 (63%) adherent, were included in this study. In SCD patients, the adjusted rate of all-cause outpatient visits PPPM was higher in adherent patients vs non-adherent patients (aIRR [95% CI]: 1.05 [1.01-1.08], p < 0.0001). Conversely, adherent patients incurred fewer all-cause inpatients visits (0.87 [0.81-0.94], p < 0.001) and ER visits (0.86 [0.78-0.93], p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed in SCD-related resource utilization rates and in thalassemia patients. Total all-cause costs were similar between adherent and non-adherent patients, but inpatient costs (adjusted cost difference = -$1530 PPPM, p = 0.0360) were lower in adherent patients. Conclusion: Patients adherent to ICT had less acute care need and lower inpatient costs than non-adherent patients, although they had more outpatient visits. Improved adherence may be linked to better disease monitoring and has the potential to avoid important downstream costs associated with acute care visits and reduce the financial burden on health programs and managed care plans treating SCD and thalassemia patients.","[Vekeman, Francis; Ramanakumar, Agnihotram V.; Fortier, Jonathan] Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Gauchetiere West 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada; [Sasane, Medha; Qiu, Ying; Paley, Carole] Novartis Pharmaceut, E Hanover, NJ USA; [Cheng, Wendy Y.; Duh, Mei Sheng] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Adams-Graves, Patricia] Univ Tennessee, Dept Med, Hlth Sci Ctr, Memphis, TN 38104 USA",Novartis; Analysis Group Inc.; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center,"Vekeman, F (通讯作者)，Grp Anal Ltee, 1000 Gauchetiere West 1200, Montreal, PQ H3B 4W5, Canada.",francis.vekeman@analysisgroup.com,,,Novartis,Novartis(Novartis),Funding for this study was provided by Novartis.,,34,21,23,1,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

This study aims to develop a global economic model that could be used as a benchmark for the economic evaluation of new therapies for MBC. Methods The Global Pharmacoeconomics of Metastatic Breast Cancer (GPMBC) model is a Markov model that was constructed to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of new treatments for MBC from a Canadian healthcare system perspective over a lifetime horizon. Specific parameters included in the model are cost of drug treatment, survival outcomes, and incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs). Global parameters are patient characteristics, health states utilities, disutilities, and costs associated with treatment-related AEs, as well as costs associated with drug administration, medical follow-up, and end-of-life care. The GPMBC model was tested and validated in a specific context, by assessing the cost-effectiveness of lapatinib plus letrozole compared with other widely used first-line therapies for post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) MBC. Results When tested, the GPMBC model led to incremental cost-utility ratios of CA$131 811 per QALY, CA$56 211 per QALY, and CA$102 477 per QALY for the comparison of lapatinib plus letrozole vs letrozole alone, trastuzumab plus anastrozole, and anastrozole alone, respectively. Results of the model testing were quite similar to those obtained by Delea et al., who also assessed the cost-effectiveness of lapatinib in combination with letrozole in HR+/HER2+MBC in Canada, thus suggesting that the GPMBC model can replicate results of well-conducted economic evaluations. Conclusions The GPMBC model can be very valuable as it allows a quick and valid assessment of the cost-effectiveness of any new treatments for MBC in a Canadian context.","[Beauchemin, C.; Letarte, N.; Mathurin, K.; Lachaine, J.] Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, POB 6128,Stn Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Letarte, N.] Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Hop Notre Dame, Dept Pharm, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Yelle, L.] Ctr Hosp Univ Montreal, Hop Notre Dame, Dept Med, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Beauchemin, C (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Fac Pharm, POB 6128,Stn Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",catherine.beauchemin@umontreal.ca,,,Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR),Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (CIHR), and it was conducted independently of the sponsor as part of a doctoral research project.

The Synoptic reading of the tracks offers the possibility of a deep reflection on what are the concepts of creation such as universe and of creation such as making and the role of the man in the creation with its functions of guardian and manager. It also provides the opportunity to assess the character and the meaning of human action, which is always characterized by ethical reference. It turns out the idea that man's relation to the world is a constitutive element of human identity, the result of a relationship that began as a deep relationship between Creator and creature. This ratio, deeply troubled allowed in modern era to record a growing ability to transformative intervention of man. The aspect of the conquest and exploitation of resources became predominant and invasive, and came to threaten today 's hospitable environment; the environment as a resource risks threatening the environment as home. This showed that the balance between man and the environment reached a critical point (John Paul II, 1997). This fracture is followed by a dynamic and anthropocentric vision, which can help strengthen the concept and practice of sustainability, which must constantly seek to achieve and accomplish the common good, which set of social conditions which allow both individual members to the community, to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily (Gaudium et Spes, 26, 1966). Then, the social doctrine is looking to pursue three objectives: to found the motivation, to direct through the social living standards and to guide the consciences in to the creation of new life styles (Centesimus Annus, 53, 1991). This is to denounce and to announce: to denounce to defend the balance between man and the world and to announce a global vision of man and of humanity (Populorum Progressio, 13, 1967). Starting point and hermeneutical method is the training that is not so much passive assimilation of facts and cultural traditions, but to accustom the mind to become active, competent and responsible critical of the complexity of the world (Nussbaum M., 2013, p. 35).

A green roof is usually a more or less complex aggregation of different layer addressing each one to a specific characteristic and performance. Results of previous LCA researches, based on a cold climate scenario, have demonstrated the highest influence that some specific layers have on the overall impact of the green roofs and to what extent the global impact changes when insulation and the substrate layers vary in density and quality. Starting from results of these similar EU researches, this study aims to evaluate the variation of the overall impact in hot climates where insulation is less strategic than heat capacity. LCA has been applied to assess and compare the environmental impacts of four different green roof solutions compared to a standard clay pitched roof, based on the functional unit of 1m(2) with the same reference service life, where layers have been selected according to local practice and market. Despite a general equivalence in environmental impacts of all the roofing elements, results have highlighted a general lack in specific life cycle inventory information that leads to a potential inaccuracy of the assessment especially when recycled material are used in the growing medium or when disposal scenario includes recycle processes.

Median LOS was statistically significantly shorter in patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment treated with isavuconazole (9.0 days) vs voriconazole (19.0 days; hazard ratio [HR]: 3.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-7.83). Median LOS was shorter, but not significantly, in patients with a BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) (isavuconazole 13.5 days vs voriconazole 22 days; HR = 1.57; 95% CI = 0.70-3.52) or aged >65 years (isavuconazole 15.0 days vs voriconazole 20.0 days; HR = 1.37; 95% CI = 0.87-2.16). Limitations: As the patient subgroups analyzed were small, sub-group findings should be interpreted with caution in light of the lack of statistical significance for each sub-group-by-treatment interaction. Conclusions: Isavuconazole may reduce hospital LOS in certain subgroups of patients with IMD, especially those with moderate-to-severe renal impairment.","[Horn, David] David Horn LLC, Doylestown, PA USA; [Goff, Debra] Ohio State Univ, Wexner Med Ctr, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Khandelwal, Nikhil; Spalding, James; Azie, Nkechi; Shi, Fei; Franks, Billy] Astellas Pharma Global Dev Inc, Northbrook, IL USA; [Shorr, Andrew F.] Washington Hosp Ctr, Washington, DC 20010 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Astellas Pharmaceuticals; MedStar Washington Hospital Center,"Horn, D (通讯作者)，3805 Old Easton Rd, Doylestown, PA 18902 USA.",b42181@aol.com,,,"Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.","This analysis was funded by Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.",,24,13,13,0,2,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in RA patients using the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) database with the study time period of January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2012. The index date was defined as the date of the first bDMARD prescription. Patients had to have continuous membership eligibility with drug benefit and no prior history of bDMARD during the 24 months prior to the index date. bDMARD switching was defined as a different bDMARD claim during post-index. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to evaluate factors associated with switchers vs non-switchers. Chart notes were reviewed to evaluate reasons for switching from index bDMARD. RA-related HCRU use and costs were evaluated using a generalized linear model (GLM) with gamma distribution and log link function. Results Two hundred and fifty-one patients (12%) switched from their index bDMARD to a different bDMARD during the post-index period. bDMARD switchers were more likely to be female, of Asian/Pacific race, younger than <= 65 years of age, overweight, CCI score <= 2, initiating etanercept or adalimumab, and have a commercial insurance plan compared to non-switchers. Reasons for switching were related mostly to lack or loss of efficacy (similar to 51%); bDMARD switchers had overall mean adjusted RA related total costs that were 25% higher (p = 0.04) compared to non-switchers. Conclusion It is important for RA patients to receive appropriate therapy and consider bDMARD with different mechanisms of action to decrease subsequent switching, and decrease overall RA related costs as shown in this study.","[Rashid, Nazia; Lin, Kathy J.; Guerrero, Valerie N.] Kaiser Permanente, Southern Calif Reg, Drug Informat Serv, 12254 Bellflower Blvd, Downey, CA 90242 USA; [Lin, Antony T.] Kaiser Permanente Southern Calif, Southern Calif Permanente Med Grp, Fontana, CA USA; [Aranda, Gustavus, Jr.; Patel, Chad] US Med Hlth Serv Field, Bristol Myers Squibb, San Francisco, CA USA; [Nadkarni, Anagha] US Med, Bristol Myers Squibb, Plainsboro, NJ USA",Kaiser Permanente; Kaiser Permanente; Permanente Medical Groups; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Bristol-Myers Squibb,"Rashid, N (通讯作者)，Kaiser Permanente, Southern Calif Reg, Drug Informat Serv, 12254 Bellflower Blvd, Downey, CA 90242 USA.",nazia.x.rashid@kp.org,,,Bristol-Myers Squibb,Bristol-Myers Squibb(Bristol-Myers Squibb),This study was supported by a research grant provided by Bristol-Myers Squibb.,,24,13,13,0,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

All the components contribute to sustain the key functions of agroecosystems. It is commonly acknowledged that biodiversity is jeopardized by erosion, whereas there is less awareness about agrobiodiversity loss, although this has very negative short and long-term consequences for producers and consumers. In particular, important for conserving agrobiodiversity is the protection of landraces (LRs). The disappearance of LRs, also called by the farmers local or primitive varieties, means both genetic and cultural erosion. For this reason, in-situ LRs conservation is essential, as well as the ex situ one. The main objective of the present work is the evaluation of agrobiodiversity and of its role for the local community, by means of the Contingent Valuation. The attention is focused on the tomatoes landrace Pomodoro di Mercatello, a variety once widely cultivated in some areas within the province of Perugia and now kept alive by a farmer who still grows and sells it.

Utility values relating to health states are an essential component for cost-utility analysis (CUA).Methods:MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and EconLit databases were reviewed for relevant studies using a pre-defined search strategy. Studies eligible for inclusion reported health state utility values (HSUVs) using direct (standard gamble [SG] and time-trade-off [TTO]) and indirect (such as EuroQol 5D [EQ-5D], short-form 6D [SF-6D], and the 15-dimensional instrument [15D]) methods for patients with advanced GC, OC, or GEJ cancer.Results:A total of 539 unique publications were identified, of which eight met the inclusion criteria (GC, n=2; mixed population [gastrointestinal cancers], n=4; OC, n=2). The most commonly used instrument to estimate HSUVs was the EQ-5D (n=7). Utilities were also estimated using the SF-6D and the 15D in the same study (n=1). Direct elicitation methods included the TTO (n=2) and SG (n=1). Across the eight identified publications, health states and study populations were heterogeneous and sample sizes were limited.Limitations:This review, as with all summaries of this nature, is only as robust as the data derived from the identified studies. The systematic review process does not resolve any design issues or biases associated with the original studies.Conclusions:Limited data estimate HSUVs in patients with advanced GC, OC, or GEJ cancer. Utilities for advanced GC alone and advanced OC alone were reported in only two publications for each cancer type. No publications considered advanced GEJ utilities alone, and four publications considered utilities for a mixed population of gastrointestinal cancer types. Comparisons are confounded by heterogeneity across the identified publications. Further research into HSUVs associated with advanced GC and OC is required to improve the evidence available for use in CUAs.","[Carter, Gebra Cuyun; Hess, Lisa M.; Rajan, Narayan; Liepa, Astra M.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [King, Denise T.; Mitchell, Stephen A.] Abacus Int, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England; [Taipale, Kaisa-Leena; Kiiskinen, Urpo] Eli Lilly & Co, Helsinki, Finland; [Novick, Diego] Eli Lilly & Co, Windlesham, Surrey, England",Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly; Eli Lilly,"King, DT (通讯作者)，Abacus Int, 6 Talisman Business Ctr,Talisman Rd, Bicester OX26 6HR, Oxon, England.",dking@dresourcesgroup.com,,,"Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis","Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis(Eli Lilly)","Funding for this research was provided by Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis.",,47,10,10,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

Ridesharing is an efficient way to utilize the unused capacity and help with congestion reduction, and it has recently become more and more popular due to new communication technologies. Understanding the complex relations between ridesharing and traffic congestion is a critical step in the evaluation of a ridesharing enterprise or of the effectiveness of regulatory policies or incentives to promote ridesharing. The objective of this paper is to introduce a mathematical framework for the study of the ridesharing impacts on traffic congestion and to pave the way for the analysis of how people can be motivated to participate in ridesharing, and conversely, how congestion influences ridesharing activities. We accomplish this objective by developing a new traffic equilibrium model with ridesharing, and formulating the model as a mixed complementarity problem (MiCP). We provide conditions on the model parameters under which there exists one and only one solution to this model. The computational results show that when the congestion cost decreases or the ridesharing inconvenience cost increases, more travelers would become solo drivers and thus less people would participate in ridesharing. On the other hand, when the ridesharing price increases, more travelers would become ridesharing drivers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It was demonstrated that the model can be applied to solve real-life, medium sized instances of the container transport problem at a large international port. A lower bound of the problem is also obtained by relaxing the time window constraints to the nearest shifts and transforming the problem into a service network design problem.

These products are indicated as adjuncts to hemostasis when control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques (such as suture, ligature or cautery) is ineffective or impractical. This study analyzed the effect of surgery time and the choice of product on cost to the hospital and patient outcomes. Methods: The data source was the Premier Hospital database from January 1, 2010-June 30, 2012. Eligible patients were >= 18 years of age with a spinal fusion or refusion surgery with either SURGIFLO (TM) (Ethicon Inc.) or FLOSEAL (R) (Baxter International Inc.). The hospital Charge Master was used to identify the amount of flowable product, whether it included Thrombin, and the cost. Multivariable models were performed on overall cost and likelihood of surgical complications. All models were adjusted for patient demographics and severity as well as hospital, and surgical characteristics. Results: A total of 24,882 patient records from 121 hospitals were analysed, which included 15,088 FLOSEAL (R) records and 9794 SURGIFLO (TM) records, with 1498 SURGIFLO (TM) with Thrombin patients. Little or no differences in surgical complications were found between surgeries with SURGIFLO (TM) vs surgery with FLOSEAL (R). Regression models showed a reduction in cost of $65 associated with use of SURGIFLO (TM) with Thrombin and an additional $21 reduction in hospital cost for each additional hour of surgery. Modeling which accounts for hospital fixed effects suggest that, in addition to a gap of similar to$300 favoring SURGIFLO (TM) with Thrombin, every additional hour of surgery was associated with an additional reduction in hospital costs of similar to$26. Conclusions: While the choice of flowable product had no effect on clinical outcomes, use of SURGIFLO (TM) was associated with hospital cost savings for flowable product. These savings increased with the length of surgery, even when controlling for the amount of flowable product (mL) used.","[David, Guy] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Lim, Sangtaeck; Roy, Sanjoy] Ethicon Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA; [Gunnarsson, Candace] CTI Clin Trial & Consulting Serv Inc, Cincinnati, OH USA; [Kocharian, Richard] Ethicon Inc, Med Affairs, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA",University of Pennsylvania; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Lim, S (通讯作者)，Ethicon Inc, Global Hlth Econ & Market Access, Somerville, NJ 08876 USA.",slim19@its.jnj.com,,"Roy, Dr. Sanjoy/0000-0002-9327-6350",,,,,0,17,17,0,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1369-6998,1941-837X,,J MED ECON,J.

However, there are no Dutch-specific analyses. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of RDN from the perspective of the healthcare payer in The Netherlands. Methods: A previously constructed Markov state-transition model was adapted and updated with costs and utilities relevant to the Dutch setting. The cost-effectiveness of RDN was compared with standard of care (SoC) for patients with resistant hypertension. The efficacy of RDN treatment was modeled as a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events associated with a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP). Results: Treatment with RDN compared to SoC gave an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.89 at an additional cost of (sic)1315 over a patient's lifetime, resulting in a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of (sic)1474. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) showed that treatment with RDN therapy was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds ((sic)10,000-80,000/QALY).

First, most ACE models are not endogenously multi-level, which makes near decomposability be not much relevant to ACE. Second, while the modularity approach has already been employed by Simon in his artificial intelligence research and can help shape a notion of autonomous agents, this approach is also not well followed by the ACE community. Instead, most artificial agents used in ACE have been put in rather identically repeated environment not much different what the movie Groundhog Day depicts [23].

Today Business Process Management is a discipline that provides a systematic approach to the development of more efficient and effective organizations, enabling quick adaptation to the changes of the business environment. For this reason modeling languages such as BPMN (Business Process Modeling and Notation, [ 1]) have a wide adoption in modern organizations. Such modeling languages are used for the design and reengineering of business processes and have the advantage of having a representation that is not only easy to understand by all the stakeholders but also machine processable, with tasks assigned to software or human agents based on the workflow and rules defined using BPMN. It is desirable to have tools that give to the designer of the process the possibility of discovering potential problems in processes, ranging from the correctness of the model to the verification of properties of the model, such as conformance to business rules. This paper presents a logic framework that enables the possibility of studying the properties of data-aware business processes, and gives directions for open research challenges.","[Dell'Aversana, Raffaele] Univ G dAnnunzio, Sch Adv Studies G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Dell'Aversana, R (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Sch Adv Studies G DAnnunzio, Chieti, Italy.",r.dellaversana@gmail.com,,"Dell'Aversana, Raffaele/0000-0001-9815-4320",,,,,23,0,0,2,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",2194-5357,2194-5365,978-3-319-40111-9; 978-3-319-40110-2,ADV INTELL SYST,,,2016,475.0,,,,,,75,82,,10.1007/978-3-319-40111-9_10,0.0,,,8,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5SN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389726600010,0

If we consider the same pace of technological progress of trading infrastructure and computational tools along with software in the coming years, the traders who are able to adapt to this technological changes will get more profitable trading solutions than those who will require more time to adjust. Described situation displays market inefficiencies that challenge the idea of the efficient market theory, but are in line with adaptive market hypothesis. To support our suggestion about technological bias we compare the performance of deep learning methods, shallow neural network with ARIMA method and random walk model using daily closing between three currency pairs: Euro and US Dollar (EUR/USD), British Pound and US Dollar (GBP/USD), and US Dollar and Japanese Yen (USD/JPY). The results reveal the convincing accuracy of deep neural networks comparing to the other methods demonstrating the capacity of new computational methods based on evolving software.

Up to now, this work has focused exclusively on the relative advantages of each group of creditors to monitor the activities of bankers. We argue that systemic risk is another dimension that this discussion must include. The main message of our work is that when bank failures are contagious then when regulators assign priority rights need also to take into account how the bankruptcy resolution of one institution might affect the survival of other institutions that have acted as its creditors. When the network structure is fixed the solution is straightforward. Other banks should have priority to minimize the risk of their downfall. However, if the choice of policy can affect the structure of the network, policy design becomes more complex.

On the other hand, Dynamical Systems Theory is a powerful tool for the study of evolution processes in real situations. The concept of global attractor is the central one in this theory. In the last decades there has been an intensive research in the geometrical characterization of global attractors. However, there still exists a weak connection between the asymptotic dynamics of a complex network and the structure of associated global attractors. In this paper we show that, in order to analyze the long-time behavior of the dynamics on a complex network, it is the topological and geometrical structure of the attractor the subject to take into account. In fact, given a complex network, a global attractor can be understood as the new attracting complex network which is really describing and determining the forwards dynamics of the phenomena. We illustrate our discussion with models of differential equations related to mutualistic complex networks in Economy and Ecology.","[Guerrero, G.] Univ Cent Ecuador, Ave Amer S-N, Quito, Ecuador; [Langa, J.

Within this framework, we distinguish between the case of unbiased-degree networks and biased-degree networks. We focus on the characterization of the diffusion threshold; that is, a condition on the primitives of the model that guarantees the spreading of the product to a significant fraction of the population, and its persistence.

Such networks are common in many areas of application. The nodes ('cells') of the network represent system variables, and directed edges ('arrows') represent how variables influence each other. Cells and arrows are assigned types, which determine the form of admissible differential equations-those compatible with the network structure. By analogy with the modern theory of dynamical systems, emphasis is placed on phenomena that are typical of entire classes of model equations with a given network structure, rather than on specific models. Such phenomena include symmetry and synchrony relations among cells, leading to a clustering effect embodied in a quotient network described by a balanced colouring. Rigid patterns of synchrony (those preserved by admissible perturbations) for equilibria and periodic states are classified by the balanced colourings. Bifurcations in which network structure can cause anomalous power-law growth rates are briefly mentioned. The formal concepts are motivated and explained in terms of typical examples.","[Stewart, Ian] Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Stewart, I (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Inst Math, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",I.N.Stewart@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",0075-8442,,978-3-319-40803-3; 978-3-319-40801-9,LECT NOTES ECON MATH,,,2016,683.0,,,,,,239,266,,10.1007/978-3-319-40803-3_10,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics, Applied; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG8BX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392194600011,0
