We explore the health system-related challenges faced during the scale-up of ambulatory (outpatient) treatment for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Karakalpakstan in Uzbekistan. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with key informants of the TB services, the ministries of health and finance, and their TB control partners. Structural challenges and resource needs were both discussed as obstacles to the expansion of ambulatory TB treatment. Respondents stated need for revising the financing mechanisms of the TB services to incentivize referral to ambulatory TB treatment. An increased workload and need for transportation in ambulatory TB care were also pointed out by respondents, given the quickly rising outpatient numbers but per capita financing of outpatient care. Policy makers showed strong interest in good practice examples for financing ambulatory-based management of TB in comparable contexts and in guidance for revising the financing of the TB services in a way that strengthens ambulatory TB treatment. To facilitate changing the model of care, TB control strategies emphasizing ambulatory care in hospital-oriented health systems should anticipate health system support and strengthening needs, and provide a plan of action to resolve both. Addressing both types of needs may require not only involving TB control and health financing actors, but also increasing knowledge about viable and tested financing mechanisms that incentivize the adoption of new models of care for TB.","[Kohler, Stefan] Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany; [Kohler, Stefan; Tinnemann, Peter] Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany; [Kohler, Stefan; Bruender, Andreas; Healy, Sean; Sergeeva, Natalia] Med Sans Frontieres, Nukus, Uzbekistan; [Kohler, Stefan; Bruender, Andreas; Healy, Sean; Sergeeva, Natalia] Med Sans Frontieres, Tashkent, Uzbekistan; [Asadov, Damin Abdurakhimovich] Tashkent Inst Postgrad Med Educ, Dept Hlth Management, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Tashkent, Uzbekistan; [Khamraev, Atadjan Karimovich] Tashkent Pediat Med Inst, Nukus Branch, Nukus, Uzbekistan",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; Doctors Without Borders; Tashkent Pediatric Medical Institute,"Kohler, S (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Heidelberg, Germany.;Kohler, S (通讯作者)，Charite, Inst Social Med Epidemiol & Hlth Econ, Berlin, Germany.;Kohler, S (通讯作者)，Med Sans Frontieres, Nukus, Uzbekistan.;Kohler, S (通讯作者)，Med Sans Frontieres, Tashkent, Uzbekistan.",stefan.kohler@uni-heidelberg.de,"Kohler, Stefan/GPT-0877-2022","Kohler, Stefan/0000-0003-1365-7506; Tinnemann, Peter/0000-0003-3071-9772; Asadov, Damin/0000-0003-2192-1418",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg,The Article Processing Charges for this paper were funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft and Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg.,,52,8,8,2,10,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The post-1997 Asian crisis and democratic Indonesia mimic the global trend of disconnection between wages and productivity: labour productivity continues to rise while real wage-earning stagnates or declines. This disconnection has three consequences. First, it affects income or earning distribution as confirmed by rising overall earnings inequality. Second, while it explains the conventional wisdom of an economy-wide negative relationship between real wages and employment, it is of concern that these two variables do not move in the same direction as the productivity improvements that have occurred in large and medium establishments in the manufacturing sector. Third, the disconnection between productivity and earnings growth opens a new discussion on the broader issue of quality of growth, as the data show that robust economic growth in the post-crisis Indonesia has not been accompanied by parallel improvements in the quality of employment.","[Tadjoeddin, Mohammad Zulfan] Univ Western Sydney, Dev Studies, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Tadjoeddin, MZ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Humanitarian & Dev Studies Grp, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",z.tadjoeddin@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Tadjoeddin, Mohammad Zulfan/0000-0002-4400-464X","International Labour Organization (ILO), Jakarta","International Labour Organization (ILO), Jakarta","This study was funded by the International Labour Organization (ILO), Jakarta.",,38,9,11,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This paper explores the relationship between economic development and women's labor supply using state-level data spanning the period 1983-4 to 2011-2. While several studies suggest a U-shaped relationship between development and women's labor force participation, our results suggest that at the state level, there is no systematic U-shaped relationship between level of domestic product and women's LFPR. On examining the relationship between the structure of the economy and women's economic activity, we find that it is not economic growth but rather the composition of growth that is relevant for women. Further, our results suggest that aggregate changes in the proportion of women in the workforce can be mostly attributed to the movement of the workforce across sectors rather than changes in the proportion of women workers within a sector.","[Lahoti, Rahul] Univ Gottingen, Oec 2-107 Klasen,Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Swaminathan, Hema] Indian Inst Management, Ctr Publ Policy, Fac Block,B 102 Bannerghatta Rd, Bangalore 560076, Karnataka, India",University of Gottingen; Indian Institute of Management (IIM System); Indian Institute of Management Bangalore,"Lahoti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Oec 2-107 Klasen,Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.;Swaminathan, H (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Management, Ctr Publ Policy, Fac Block,B 102 Bannerghatta Rd, Bangalore 560076, Karnataka, India.",rahul.lahoti@gmail.com; hema.swaminathan@iimb.ernet.in,,"Lahoti, Rahul/0000-0001-6148-0835",,,,,32,61,64,1,32,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

The latter two represent the intensive margins of human capital acquisition and utilization. These choices are substitutes for the creation of new skilled workers, yet they are complementary with each other, magnifying inequality.

We apply the difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) method to a unique dataset on industry level activities in counties along 24 major rivers in China from 1998 through 2008. We find that the most downstream county of a province has up to 20 percent more water polluting activities than otherwise identical counties since 2001. Moreover, we find that the enforcement of pollution fee collection is more lenient in the most downstream county of a province, and that private firms contribute more to the downstream effect than state-owned enterprises and foreign firms. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the provincial governments respond to the pollution reduction mandates by shifting their enforcement efforts away from the most downstream county.

However, very few data are available on the associated cost. The objective of this study is to identify the available information on the epidemiology of the disease and estimate the average annual cost incurred by the National Health Service and Society for the Treatment of Diabetes in Italy. Methods A probabilistic prevalence cost of illness model was developed to calculate an aggregate measure of the economic burden associated with the disease, in terms of direct medical costs (drugs, hospitalizations, monitoring and adverse events) and indirect costs (absenteeism and early retirement). A systematic review of the literature was conducted to determine both the epidemiological and economic data. Furthermore, a one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 5,000 Monte Carlo simulations was performed to test the robustness of the results and define a 95 % CI. Results The model estimated a prevalence of 2.6 million patients under drug therapies in Italy. The total economic burden of diabetic patients in Italy amounted to epsilon 20.3 billion/year (95 % CI epsilon 18.61 to epsilon 22.29 billion), 54 % of which are associated with indirect costs (95 % CI epsilon 10.10 to epsilon 11.62 billion) and 46 % with direct costs only (95 % CI epsilon 8.11 to epsilon 11.06 billion). Conclusions This is the first study conducted in Italy aimed at estimating the direct and indirect cost of diabetes with a probabilistic prevalence approach. As might be expected, the lack of information means that the real burden of diabetes is partly underestimated, especially with regard to indirect costs. However, this is a useful approach for policy makers to understand the economic implications of diabetes treatment in Italy.","[Marcellusi, A.; Viti, R.; Mennini, F.

However, scholars have highlighted equity concerns related to choice policies. The case of post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans provides an opportunity to examine student mobility patterns in a choice-based district. This paper analyzes student mobility between and within the various sectors and school types using a multinomial framework. We find rates of student mobility in post-Katrina New Orleans to be similar to other traditional urban school districts. Overall, our results indicate that high-achieving students switch to high-quality schools whereas low-achieving students transfer to low-quality schools. It is clear some students are taking advantage of the ability to choose a high-quality educational option, although many students are still not.

This study points to the necessity of disaggregating female headship to trace the contours of household vulnerability of widow-headed households, a subset of female-headed households. The inadequacy of surveys in explaining the interplay between economic vulnerability and social norms is ameliorated through the use of ethnographic data and the narratives of widow heads collected through fieldwork in 2008-9 and 2011. The study traces key coping strategies of widow-headed households in Nepal to provide insight into the processes by which widow heads mediate social institutions and patriarchal norms in their everyday struggles for survival, and the spaces of agency that emerge herein. The study concludes with implications for prevailing understandings of household headship and agency that development practitioners must be attentive to in devising policies to support widow heads.","[Ramnarain, Smita] Siena Coll Econ, Sch Business, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA",,"Ramnarain, S (通讯作者)，Siena Coll Econ, Sch Business, Siena Hall 301,515 Loudon Rd, Loudonville, NY 12211 USA.",sramnarain@siena.edu,,"Ramnarain, Smita/0000-0003-1487-8415",,,,,45,14,16,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Then multi-objective optimization algorithm Hyper-volume Estimation Algorithm (HypE) is used to obtain the signal timing described as Pareto set, and an improved method for uncertain multi-attribute decision problem in which attribute weights are set as interval numbers is proposed to select the satisfactory solution from the Pareto set. Simulation results show that compared with entropy weight method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, the proposed method not only can balance the tradeoff between preference demand of decision-makers and objective evaluation information, but also improve comprehensive traffic efficiencies effectively. Moreover, in comparison with the classical Australian Road Research Board (ARRB) and Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) method, the proposed multi-objective optimization and decision making method proposed brings better control effects.","[Chen, Juan; Geng, Jun-jie; Jia, Ming-xing] Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China",Shanghai University,"Geng, JJ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ, SHU UTS SILC Business Sch, Shanghai 200041, Peoples R China.",chenjuan82@shu.edu.cn; gengjunjie_1989@sina.com; jimmy219@foxmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-368-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,420,426,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BF8YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385266400076,0

On one hand, the growth rate of the Russian economy began to slow down from the beginning of 2012, and on the other - the import of foodstuff from a number of countries has been banned in 2014 in response to sanctions imposed on Russia, which led to a significant reduction in import of agricultural products on the Russian market and has become a powerful impetus for the development of domestic agriculture.

Using the Enquete Integrale sur les Conditions de Vie des menages de Rwanda (EICV2) for 2005-6, the study finds evidence that members of female-headed households are less likely than those of male-headed households to be enrolled in the CBI program.

J,"Gottschling, P",,,,"Gottschling, Paul",,,Making architecture compete: open-ended accumulation meets objectification and singularisation in the UK construction industry,JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Competition; objectification; singularisation; architecture; construction,VISUALIZATIONS; CONVENTIONS; MARKETS,"Sociologists over the last two decades have taken inspiration from actor-network theory to suggest that competition, like 'the market', takes place through a dynamic of detaching objects from one set of relations and reattaching them within another: objectification and singularisation. Yet there has been little theorisation of how competition differs between situations. To approach this question, we can ask how competition, as a process of objectification and singularisation, interacts with other patterns of movement. Ethnographers have described one such pattern in the everyday work of architects. Here a building emerges from an ever-increasing number of 'versions', images and models, in an open-ended accumulation. This study considers the interaction between, first, the objectification and singularisation of competition and, second, the open-ended accumulation of architectural work. To do so, I examine architectural competitions in the UK. I draw from document analysis of one competition for a school in northern England, as well as interviews with architects about their work on competitions. This study concludes that architectural competitions repeat the multiplicity of architectural work but in a more delimited form. Multiplicity is not 'cut-off' so much as winnowed down through an explicit process of selecting images and blocks of text.","[Gottschling, Paul] Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Architecture Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Gottschling, P (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Environm Educ & Dev, Manchester Architecture Res Ctr, Manchester, Lancs, England.",paul.gottschling@gmail.com,,,,,,,42,2,2,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Pension schemes may be attributed to specific investment services. With the changes caused by the financial and economic crisis of 2008, considerable changes took place also in financial markets and uncertainly increased in the business and investment environment. The changes in the global financial markets were caused by bankruptcies of banks and other financial institutions as well as the implementation of bank rescue plans in many world countries, including Latvia. Recovery trends are increasingly observed in the global economy, and Latvia's economy returned to growth in 2011; yet, there is still significant uncertainty over economic prospects, mostly in the world's developed economies. After the financial crisis, Latvian pension funds have reduced investment in risky assets, such as equities, and increased investments in fixed income and alternative assets. The distribution of investments by the private pension funds has changed fundamentally.

They are important sources of micronutrients including Vitamins, Minerals, Proteins and anti-oxidants that are adequate for normal growth and health. We find that the production of IVs in most parts of Kenya follows the sustainable agricultural production approach. This is because most producers use organic fertilizers and local seeds which maximize natural biological processes and promotes local biodiversity both of which help improve soil fertility and environmental sustainability. Given that contribution of IVs to food security is undisputed and that their production follows sustainable practices, efforts to promote and scale-up these nutritious and sustainable commodities need to be strengthened.","[Kebede, S.

In addition the approach to the definition of the stability of the enterprise was explained by authors from the perspective of goal-setting in the economic system.

Overextraction and overcapacity represent two of the main fisheries management challenges, and we aim to model and analyze the two jointly. In a stylized resource model, quota violating and complying firms invest in capital, buy quotas, and choose their harvest. We show that in the short run, more capacity increases illegal extraction, while a well-functioning quota market partially alleviates this effect. We also show how tougher enforcement yields a double benefit by directly improving compliance and indirectly reducing incentives to invest in capacity, which improves future compliance.

Technological innovations contribute to scientific and technological progress and economic efficiency of the national economy and also can be used as a tool for overcoming the crisis. Social innovations are aimed at human capital development, elimination of problems of formation of civil society. Environmental innovations are related to environmental management, renewable energy, introduction of restrictions relating to the need to preserve the human environment and society as a whole. It is shown that formation of innovative economy is connected with formation of a new segment of modern economy of the national innovation system (NIS) which generates a stream of innovations that meet rapidly changing human needs in accordance with acceleration of scientific and technological development. The effectiveness of the NIS is determined by two factors: innovation potential and innovation transfer. The first one includes totality of resources, capabilities and opportunities of socio-economic system in implementation of innovation activity. The second is the process of overflowing resources within the innovation activity needed for creation and dissemination of economic, environmental and social innovations, helping to improve socio-economic efficiency and to form sustainable development of society.","[Mityakov, S.

The organic market is estimated at less than 1% of the retail market compared to the average of the EU countries which is around 5-6%, meaning that Romania has a lot of growth potential. Therefore, an analysis of the certified organic operators (defined according to EU regulations) will reveal more about the structure and the dynamic of the Romanian market. The aim of this paper is to provide details regarding the types of legal entities that chose to certify according to the organic standard, to reveal the migration patterns of the operators from one certification and inspection body to the next and to detect the permanence of operators in the organic system in the context of their geographical distribution. To the best knowledge of the author, this research is unique for Romania as it is the sole analyses of this sort in the time frame of 2011-2014, and even previous years. One of the main results of the analysis is the identification of the regions with most organic operators, meaning the top five counties whit the highest density of organic operators are: Alba, Bistrita Nasaud, Suceava, Iasi and Caras Severin. Moreover, the migration of operators between certification and inspection bodies is a common phenomenon, as almost 1200 operators decided to switch their certification and inspection body during the 2012-2014 time frame. In addition, the most common type of legal entity that chose to certify according to the organic regulation in Romania are: natural persons, authorized natural persons and companies. However, judging by the numbers of operators exiting the organic system, the natural persons and authorized natural persons present clear tendencies of leaving the system sooner than five years.","[Munteanu, Adina-Roxana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Munteanu, AR (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Munteanu, Adina Roxana/J-7151-2015","Munteanu, Adina Roxana/0000-0002-3045-2505",,,,,5,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,781,787,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100102,0

As well as organizations in other industries, also tourism service providers have already recognized SM as an important channel for reaching out the tourists. However, there are still challenges in SM usage and many organizations still do not fully exploit potentials of SM usage. As tourism is one of the key priorities in Slovenian economy and is placed as one of the key industries in Slovenian development strategy until 2020, the goal of this research was to investigate the adoption level and role of SM in tourism organizations in one of the most attractive regions in Slovenia Gorenjska region. For that purpose we developed the questionnaire and invited for cooperation 160 tourism service providers in the region. We received 55 responses. Results have shown that majority of tourism service providers already use SM, however not on strategic level which enables to fully exploit all the SM potentials. Tourism service providers are present on more SM. Mostly they use SM for the purpose of promotion and booking of their sevices, and also brand promotion (image building). Less likely they use SM on more strategic level as for example for customer engagement or customer targeted advertising, which are main potentials of SM usage. Tourism service providers reported that SM is still not positioned in their existing business or marketing strategies. In addition most of them still do not have a department or personnel appointed to digital marketing activities. Despite non-strategic use of SM tourism service providers estimate that approximately 50% of all tourists are gained over SM. Among new tourists, 51% are gained over SM.","[Pucihar, Andreja; Praprotinik, Majda; Marolt, Marjeta; Lenart, Gregor; Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kidriceva Cesta 55a, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Pucihar, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Kidriceva Cesta 55a, Maribor, Slovenia.",andreja.pucihar@fov.uni-mb.si; majda.praprotnik@outlook.com; marjeta.marolt@fov.uni-mb.si; gregor.lenart@fov.uni-mb.si; mirjana.kljajic@fov.uni-mb.si,"Borstnar, Mirjana Kljajic/R-6630-2019; Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/AAB-3150-2020","Borštnar, Mirjana Kljajić/0000-0003-4608-9090",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-303-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,104,112,,,,,,9,"Economics; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Telecommunications,BH9XJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404420200011,0

The discussion presents recent work on capitalism as an evolving historical formation by Wolfgang Streeck and Craig Calhoun, together with contributions by British journalist Polly Toynbee and SASE founder Amitai Etzioni. Streeck opens with a reflection on major trends of capitalism that now pose ungovernable contradictions and thus point to an end of capitalism as a viable historical formation. Despite these contradictions, Calhoun sees capitalism as unlikely to undergo a rapid breakdown, but likely to generat continued challenges related to financial risks, limited international cooperation, negative externalities and growth of illicit forms of capitalism. Toynbee focuses on how these themes relate to the contemporary situation in the UK, outlining the growth in social inequalities and the weakness of social solidarity needed to generate political constraints on these trends. Finally, Etzioni reflects on the prospects for a post-capitalism, where work and consumption are no longer the central social identity around which social institutions are constructed. Together, the panelists present a bleak picture of the future for capitalism, which is likely to be a period of lasting disorder, where new moral foundations of a post-capitalism remain as elusive as they are necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,0,18,20,3,48,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The respecified model is capable of describing both optimal forest rotation and continuous cover forestry (uneven-aged management). Continuous cover forestry is shown to be optimal if the preset value of continuous sustainable harvesting income over an infinite horizon is higher than the clearcut revenue and the highest possible value of bare land. Negative bare land value implies optimality of continuous cover forestry but only if clearcut stumpage prices are not higher than thinning stumpage prices.

Both carry potential trade advantages for state parties, but both also carry the potential to create unintended trade consequences for state parties if combined with a broad application of the most-favoured nation principle. The WTO Appellate Body has touched on a number of the relevant legal issues in a series of reports culminating in the May 2014 EC-Seals decision, but many questions remain.

The data's multilevel structure allows us to describe changes in between-institution inequality, within-institution inequality, and their interaction. To examine the role of finances, we compare public and private institutions and employ difference and fixed-effects models to study the effect of state appropriations. Our results indicate that financially stressed publics almost matched the salary increases of their competitors between 1999 and 2006, but reductions in the number of professors-especially full professors-accompanied this salary growth.

High carbon concentrations call for full CCS, meaning zero net emissions. We identify conditions under which partial or no CCS is optimal. In the absence of CCS the CO2 stock might be inverted U-shaped. With CCS more complicated behavior may arise. It can be optimal to have full capture initially, yielding a decreasing stock, then partial capture while keeping the CO2 stock constant, and a final phase without capture but with an inverted U-shaped CO2 stock. We also introduce the option of adaptation and provide a unified theory regarding the optimal use of CCS and adaptation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Increasing demand for timber has driven a shift toward commercialization of smallholder forestry. However, smallholders face huge challenges when they seek for commercial markets in the form of complex regulatory frameworks applied to smallholder plantations. This paper discusses the case of smallholder plantations in Gunungkidul District (Indonesia), considered one of the most commercialized timber marketing hubs for local, national and international markets. It analyzes how opportunities and challenges, resulted from different regulatory frameworks, affect the competitiveness of smallholder forestry practices. In this paper, regulatory frameworks are defined as not only regulations issued by public administrators at the domestic (local and national) level, but also cover the emerging market-based regulatory frameworks, i.e. voluntary certification of sustainable forestry and mandatory timber legality verification.

Geoengineering to reduce incoming solar radiation has been suggested as a way to mediate the warming effects of contemporary climate change, but a geoengineering program for thousands of years could also be used to enlarge the size of the polar ice caps and create a permanently cooler climate. Such a large ice cap state would make Earth less susceptible to climate threats and could allow human civilization to survive further into the future than otherwise possible. Intentionally extending Earth's glacial coverage will require uninterrupted commitment to this program for millenia but would ultimately reach a cooler equilibrium state where geoengineering is no longer needed.

We find robust evidence that higher quality-adjusted farmland per capita has a significant negative effect on growth, even after controlling for land quality and population density. Therefore, quality-adjusted agricultural land abundance confers a type of resource curse, which elucidates an important causal determinant of the contemporary substantial differences in the standard of living across Chinese provinces.","[He, Qichun] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Econ & Management Acad, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics,"He, Q (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",qichunhe@gmail.com,,", Qichun/0000-0001-7643-3150",,,,,33,3,3,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Using pooled data from three waves of the National Family Health Surveys (1992-3; 1998-9; 2005-6) in a panel analysis, it compares female infant mortality rates in Bihar to those in thirteen major Indian states. These comparisons suggest that females in Bihar experience a statistically significant excess infant mortality when compared to female infants in less gender-biased states in eastern, western, and southern regions, but not when compared to more gender-biased states in northern and central regions. An estimated 23 percent of female infant deaths in Bihar are excess. Examination of infant care demonstrates that a gender gap in Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination is the single most important driver of excess female infant mortality, followed by gaps in vaccination for polio; diphtheria, pertussis, tuberculosis (DPT); and measles.","Univ Wisconsin, Econ, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA",University of Wisconsin System,"Chaudhuri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Econ, 468 Schneider Social Sci Hall, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA.",chaudhs@uwec.edu,,,,,,,47,2,2,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Replacing LVSSF for snakehead aquaculture with pelleted feed would reduce the pressure on stocks of LVSSF. This study addresses the economics of this replacement strategy for snakehead culture in Vietnam. Economic engineering methods were used to assess the effects of pelleted feed for low, medium and high-productivity scenarios. The study compared net present values (NPV), internal rates of return (IRR) and differences in NPV between farms using pelleted feed and those using LVSSF. It also included sensitivity analyses that related NPV and IRR to increased snakehead prices. Results demonstrated strong economic incentives for high-productivity farms to use pelleted feed. However, pelleted feed was too expensive for medium- and low-productivity farms. NPVs were more sensitive to reductions in the cost of pelleted feed than to increases in the cost of LVSSF or the cost of capital.","[Grimm-Greenblatt, Justin] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Aquaculture & Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR USA; [Grimm-Greenblatt, Justin; Bravo-Ureta, Boris] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Pomeroy, Robert] Univ Connecticut, AquaFish CRSP, Groton, CT USA; [Bravo-Ureta, Boris] Univ Talca, Dept Agr Econ, Talca, Maule Region, Chile; [Le Xuan Sinh; Huynh Van Hien] Can Tho Univ, Coll Aquaculture & Fisheries, Dept Fisheries Management & Econ, Can Tho City, Vietnam; [Getchis, Tessa] Univ Connecticut, Connecticut Sea Grant Program, Groton, CT USA",University of Arkansas System; University Arkansas Pine Bluff; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut; Universidad de Talca; Can Tho University; University of Connecticut,"Grimm-Greenblatt, J (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1376 Storrs Rd,WB Young Bldg, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",jgrimmgr@alumni.uconn.edu,,,AquaFISH Collaborative Research Support Program; National Needs Fellowship; Dorothy Goodwin International Experience Fund,AquaFISH Collaborative Research Support Program; National Needs Fellowship; Dorothy Goodwin International Experience Fund,"The AquaFISH Collaborative Research Support Program, National Needs Fellowship, and the Dorothy Goodwin International Experience Fund provided financial support for this research.

Our findings indicate that severe and moderate obesity imposes a substantial burden on the Spanish healthcare system. Specifically, being severely obese is associated with increases in medical costs of 26 % (instrumental variables (IV) estimate, 34 %) compared to a normal-weight individual. The effects of moderate obesity and overweight are more modest, raising medical costs by 16 % (IV estimate, 29 %) and 8.5 % (IV estimate, 23 %), respectively. These changes in costs are slightly higher for those patients below the median age and for the women.

This paper however shows that even climate skeptics have an incentive to reduce emissions: such a directional change generates information on the causes of global warming. Since the optimal policy depends upon these causes, they are valuable to know. Although increasing emissions would also generate information, that option is inferior due its irreversibility. We show that optimality can even imply that climate skeptics should actually argue for lower emissions than believers. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Our aim in the present study is to explore the potential of renewable energy communities in the Netherlands, as social niches, to contribute to transitions in the energy system. To do so, we propose three proxies for measuring the transition potential of social niches, based on proxies for technological innovations derived from the literature. In addition, we reinterpret the notion of niches and the way transition occurs by arguing that niches are complex systems in which both technological and social innovations develop simultaneously and that during a transition entire niches link up with the regime. Furthermore, we make a distinction between internally and externally oriented niches based on their orientation and application focus. We use a comparative case study analysis complemented by a systematic literature and documentary review to show that these communities are already changing the Dutch energy system, by connecting to regime actors. Their further advancement depends on strengthening their links to established actors, but also on providing a favorable regulatory framework. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The main benefit of the proposed e-learning method for the Romanian health care system is a tailored training system adapted to the needs of the professionals working in different areas of the management in a high degree hospital. This will be achieved by implementation of a modern e-learning technologies and specific ontologies. The proposed model particularity consists in implementation of domain specific ontologies using Protege environment using a personal methodology according to the student's knowledge profile. The settling of the students' profile is based on processing their entry data to allow the training process personalization, automatically generated by the intelligent system. The student's profile is identified by integrating a static and a dynamic model.

If Student Syndrome phenomenon is completely expressed by means of a mathematical model, it would be possible to improve prediction of its impact on work effort in project activities. Successful duration of project activities is measured by the Earned value management (EVM) tools, where the BCWS is a key parameter. The BCWS is created by work effort in a project activity. Therefore, work effort has a hidden influence on EVM. Consequently, in the real world of human resources, the BCWS is not usually linear. This paper proposes new formulas for computing the BCWS in the project for Earned value management purposes. This proposal can be used for a more precise description of the real distribution of the work effort.","[Bartoska, Jan; Kucera, Petr; Subrt, Tomas] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Bartoska, J (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Kamycka 129, Prague 6, Czech Republic.",bartoska@pef.czu.cz; kucera@pef.czu.cz; subrt@pef.czu.cz,"Kučera, Petr/F-8318-2017; Bartoška, Jan/C-8992-2017; Subrt, Tomas/H-8542-2018","Bartoška, Jan/0000-0003-0935-5978; Subrt, Tomas/0000-0002-4437-1431",,,,,10,5,5,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,19,24,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900004,0

For our analysis, we used a dynamic random effects bivariate panel probit model with initial conditions (Wooldridge-type estimator) and dependent variables were the participation of breast and cervical cancer screening in the recent year. The balanced panel sample consisted of 844 women from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) from the time period 1992 to 2008. Our analysis showed the high relevance of past screening behaviour and the importance of state dependency for the same and the other type of cancer screening examinations even after controlling for covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. The uptake for breast and cervical cancer screening was higher when the same screening examination was done one or three years earlier. This result is in accordance with the medical screening programmes in Great Britain. With regard to breast and cervical cancer screening positive spillover effects existed between screening examinations in the third order lags. Women with a previous visit to a general practitioner and individuals in the recommended age groups had a higher uptake for breast and cervical cancer screening. Other socioeconomic and health related variables had non-uniform results in both screening examinations. Promoting the uptake of one female prevention activity could also enhance the uptake of the other prevention activity.","[Labeit, Alexander] Univ Sheffield, Regent Court, Sch Hlth & Related Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Peinemann, Frank] FOM Univ Appl Sci Econ & Management, D-45141 Essen, Germany",University of Sheffield,"Labeit, A (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Regent Court, Sch Hlth & Related Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",alabeit.publications@gmail.com,"Labeit, Alexander/AAB-2707-2019; Peinemann, Frank/H-2800-2019","Peinemann, Frank/0000-0002-4727-1313",,,,,64,14,14,1,10,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Previous summaries and surveys have failed to address in a comprehensive manner the effects of alcohol prices on binge drinking by gender or age group. Methods: A qualitative systematic review is performed for effects of alcohol prices (or tax surrogates) on binge drinking for three age groups: youth, young adults, and adults. Outcomes examined include binge participation, intensity and frequency. Criteria for data collection and potential sources of bias are discussed, including adequacy of price data. Price-binge relationships are judged using a 95% confidence interval (p <= 0.05) for statistical significance. Results: Fifty-six relevant econometric studies were found, with studies and results distributed equally among three age groups. Also found were five natural experiments for tax reductions and six field studies. Null results or mixed results are found in more than half of the studies. The body of evidence indicates that binge drinkers are not highly-responsive to increased prices. Non-responsiveness holds generally for younger and older drinkers and for male and female binge drinkers alike. A limitation of the current literature is that results are only available for higher-income countries. Conclusions: Increased alcohol taxes or prices are unlikely to be effective as a means to reduce binge drinking, regardless of gender or age group.",,,"Nelson, JP (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",jpn@psu.edu,,,,,,,109,29,32,1,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Regional competitiveness in general is related to various spheres of regional activities. One of the most important factors, influencing especially rural regions, is agriculture. This is important not only for the food security at regional and national level, but also for development of regional environment and overall attractivity of region. On the other side the primary role of the agriculture is to ensure sufficient food supply with adequate quality. Path to developed agriculture is effective and efficient use of production factors. The main objective of presented paper is to compare European regions with regard to efficiency of their agriculture production. Analysis was based on the data provided by Farm Accountancy Data Network database (FADN). From the methodological point of view was used stochastic frontier analysis to estimate efficiency of each FADN region. For this purpose was used Cobb-Douglas and translog production function to estimate efficient production frontier. Quality of both functions was evaluated using Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Schwarz criterion (SBC). For the final analysis was used function with lower value of both criterions. Total output (SE131) was used as dependent variable. Explanatory variables used in the final model (inputs) were capital (SE 510) and labour (SE010) in logarithm form. Agricultural area was also taken into account, but this input was insignificant in all estimated models. This could be caused by different orientation of investigated farms. Some of them are oriented primary to crop production, and some to stockbreeding. Especially the second group's efficiency is not influenced by agricultural area, which could cause this result. The least efficient regions were Malta, Asturias (Spain), Pohjois-Suomi (Finland), Lann i norra (Sweden), Slovenia, Canarias (Spain), Sisa-suomi (Finland), Limousin (France), Galicia (Spain), Etela-Suomi (Finland) with technical efficiency less than 0.69. The most efficient regions were: Calabria (Italy), Champagne-Ardenne (France), Ile de France (France), Liguria (Italy), Severoiztochen (Bulgaria), Alsace (France) with technical efficiency higher than 0.95. The average value of technical efficiency was 0.85. From the number of 135 FADN regions, 82 have performance over average and 53 under this value. In general, we can conclude that most efficient agriculture is in Italy, United Kingdom and France, least efficient were regions in North Europe, which is primarily caused by local weather conditions. Major part of inefficient regions were less favoured areas (e.g. regions of Finland), on the other side there were some areas where should be expected more efficient agriculture regard to its climate (Spain).","[Palkovic, Jozef; Ulicna, Martina; Sojkova, Zlata] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Palkovic, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",jozef.palkovic@uniag.sk; martina.ulicna@uniag.sk; zlata.sojkova@uniag.sk,"Palkovič, Jozef/IUO-3489-2023",,,,,,15,1,1,2,6,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,793,802,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800075,0

Today the situation is difficult and the future of the dairy industry in our country is unclear. Therefore the managements of dairy farms extend to streamline business processes in organizations through cost reductions especially in the field of IT. Cloud computing is a new term in information technology used both in information systems, as well as in information and communication technology services through the Internet. In the modern times it represents an important developing tendency in this field. It is a model of supplying the ICT services that are accessible via the Internet. In a metaphoric sense the cloud computing and its wide range of services becomes partly mobile corporate office, when we are able without significant obstacles immediately answer to the progress in the company and manage most processes only through a computer or mobile phone with an internet connection. Nowadays it is essential for the management of the company to follow the development of modern information technology in order to avoid unnecessary financial losses caused by the obsolescence of the hardware components that are increasingly difficult to operate, especially maintenance, while their performance is decreasing and are losing value. Over time, penetrate new trends in virtualization solutions to streamline and improve the quality of work with a wide scope of IT users in small, medium, but especially in large enterprises. A lot of managers in companies solve problems relating to issues of transition from the prior IT infrastructure solutions to cloud computing, either the entire IT infrastructure, or only parts of it. The article deals with the transition from classical IT infrastructure in a dairy enterprise to a virtual platform - cloud computing. The main aim is to identify the necessary issues related to gradual transition to a virtual solution. For this reason, was developed a practical proposal of transition from an existing IT infrastructure to a virtual platform which has proved to be more cost-effective and more economical version in the enterprise using the means of information technology nowadays. When preparing the transition in the enterprise from the previous equipment of IT for smarter, financially less costly and more effective resolution we used a personal interview with personnel responsible for the management and operation of IT in a medium-sized company with 63 employees. After comparing the current state of IT equipment in the company with a new proposal were elaborated practical proposals for the progressive implementation of cloud computing solution for the enterprise. Finally, there is shown a model example how it could work with a new cloud platform in the enterprise which is engaged in processing milk. This proposal just represents only a proposal for improving the IT resources. Therefore, the management of the company could choose a modern and efficient way.","[Popelka, Vladimir; Neomani, Juraj] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Popelka, V (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat, Trieda Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",vladimir.popelka@uniag.sk; juraj.neomani@uniag.sk,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,868,877,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800083,0

One way of saving imported primary energetic sources, is the use of combustion agricultural and forestry biomass in cogeneration resources. The decision to invest in such structures is the question of well-prepared projects and economic and financial valuation of the project with using a computational model and software for evaluating of investments. Evaluation investment of electricity generation and heat with exploitation biomass is realized through multi periodic balance model of investment. Model covers a period of 17 years include cost structure estimation, the estimation of production, depreciation, the financing of investment project (equity and loans), repayment scheduling and projected annual income statement, cash flow and the balance sheet. The deterministic assessment of the efficiency of investment project is based on the evaluation of the criteria of Net Present Value - NPV of all the financial flows incurred during the lifetime of the investment project. Investment project is oriented on preparation new energy source combined heating plant (CHP) 60 MWe electric power and heat output of 30 MWt with the combustion of solid fuel - wood biomass. Investment costs of energy source are based on expert estimate of completed construction and preparation of feasibility studies in Slovakia or abroad. Financial expenses are based on actual current market price of technological equipment, building construction and installation works. In abstract we mention only relevant economic date. In evaluating the economic and financial analysis are assumes 2 years of construction and 15 years of operation work. The life energy source is considered 30 years. Discount rate - we used 8.15% nominal discount rate as opportunity cost and we used this discount rate for present value analysis. Investments costs - total investment costs: 89 000 000 EUR here of: design and engineering work: 8 900 000 EUR technology section: 49 900 000 EUR architectural section: 23 200 000 EUR reserve: 7 000 000 EUR the financing conditions are specified jointly as 20% financing with own resources and 80% with credits from banks. Credits - first year: 26.4 mil EUR and the second year: 44.8 mil EUR, interest rate 4.7% Prices - of proposed technological equipment and prices of buildings are designed according to current price lists and offers of manufacturers and educated guess, prices of products for the next year were specified as follows: price electricity 66.40 EUR/MWhr (average price including the surcharge for electricity produced together with the sold heat), price of heat 16.60 EUR/MWhr Operating costs - fuel and energy costs, services, staff (labour costs), other operating expenses, depreciation, financial cost, costs of other activities, costs of biomass 40.00 EUR/t. The valuation is made upon the conditions of investor with respecting of taxes, way of financing, share of borrowed capital and its price. For the purposes of the investor, there is also made the sensitivity analysis. The calculations were elaborated according to valid legislation. The actual calculations are performed by software EFINA. On the basis of indicator NPV we can state, that the scenario of the investment plan is not acceptable, the NPV is negative. Presented model comes out from certain assumptions, which are represented by deterministic parameters based on the best estimates. It is useful and necessary to examine by sensitivity analysis, how changes of individual parameters affect the resulting criteria. A significant change of criteria exposes how the project is sensitive to changes of specific parameters in the other constant values. The program allows you to realize one or two parametric sensitivity analysis. The possible risk of threat cash flows (CF) was eliminated in case of discounting of real prices about 8.15% (about lost profits). We can see the possible fall of discount coefficient on DCF in range from 0 to 15% influence of discount rate on NPV. Concerning the used realistic (conservative) scenario and discounting of CF in amount of 8.15% is the failure risk of expected results of calculations very low. The increasing of economically eligible costs always copies by adequate percentage also the heat and electricity prices. The risk, that from this reason, i.e. increasing of the prices of economically eligible costs in single years of evaluated period, would not be reached the assumed profit, we think for irrelevant. The results of the economic and financial analysis showed, that the return could be successful with financial support, for example non-repayable loan or subsidies on the price of fuel for energy production from renewable sources. It is a serious problem and a decision on the level of government and parliament and grants approval for manufacturer's electricity and heat from renewable sources will be disadvantaged purchasers of solid wood to processing of wood products and enterprises to processing wood pulp and paper, which would be reflected in increased prices for these products. The demand for solid wood and its price would increase. Combustion wood biomass we recommend exploit, too on the basis of economic and financial analysis, for small sources with an installed capacity to 10 MWt for producing and supply only heat for smaller districts and used for burning waste from timber production, wood waste from wood processing plants and harvest fast-growing trees.","[Repisky, Jozef; Letko, Anton] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Repisky, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",jozef.repisky@uniag.sk,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,9,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,909,918,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800087,0

However, there is little empirical evidence on the mechanisms by which revenues are distributed to labor and capital, and how these distributions affect economic performance. Under an agency problem framework, we estimate a dose-response function to study the formation of contracts and identify the marginal effects of changes in crew profit shares on fishing returns in Chilean artisanal fisheries. The results support share contract choices based on bargaining power, monitoring costs, technology, state of fishing resources, and outside options. We find significant effects of increasing crew profit shares on vessel owner returns in the interval (0.25, 0.65). The results vary across fisheries, however. While the effects are not significant in the fish group, they are larger and robust for molluscs and crustaceans. The latter finding is expected given differences in the observability of effort across fisheries.","[Salazar Espinoza, Cesar] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Salazar Espinoza, Cesar] Univ Bio Bio, Dept Econ & Finance, Concepcion, Chile",University of Copenhagen; Universidad del Bio-Bio,"Espinoza, CS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oster Farimagsgade 5,Bldg 26, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",cesar.salazar@econ.ku.dk,,"SALAZAR, CESAR/0000-0002-0199-7688",,,,,47,5,5,0,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The objective of this study was to systematically review decision models evaluating the cost-effectiveness of CRT-D for patients with DHF, compare the structure and inputs of these models and identify the main factors influencing the ICERs for CRT-D. Methods A comprehensive search strategy of Medline (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and EconLit identified eight cost-effectiveness models evaluating CRT-D against optimal pharmacological therapy (OPT) and/or CRT-P. Results The selected economic studies differed in terms of model structure, treatment path, time horizons, and sources of efficacy data. CRT-D was found cost-effective when compared to OPT but its cost-effectiveness became questionable when compared to CRT-P. Conclusions Cost-effectiveness of CRT-D may increase depending on improvement of all-cause mortality rates and HF mortality rates in patients who receive CRT-D, costs of the device, and battery life. In particular, future studies need to investigate longer-term mortality rates and identify CRT-P patients that will gain the most, in terms of life expectancy, from being treated with a CRT-D.","[Tomini, F.] Maastricht Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Med Technol Assessment, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Tomini, F.; Prinzen, F.] Cardiovasc Res Inst Maastricht CARIM, Dept Physiol, Maastricht, Netherlands; [van Asselt, A.

In two phases, UK general population participants rated three osteoarthritis health states in TTO and SG procedures with two time horizons: (1) 10-year and (2) a time horizon derived from self-reported additional life expectancy (ALE). The two time horizons were compared in terms of mean utilities and discrimination among health states. In Phase 1, the 10-year tasks were completed by 80 participants, 35 of whom also completed utility assessment with the ALE. In Phase 2, all 101 participants completed procedures with both time horizons. Utility scores tended to be lower with the ALE than the 10-year, a difference that was statistically significant for two health states with SG in Phase 1 (P < 0.05), two health states with TTO in Phase 2 (P < 0.01), and one health state with SG in Phase 2 (P < 0.001). In Phase 1, rates of discrimination between mild and moderate osteoarthritis health states were significantly higher with the ALE than the 10-year (TTO: P = 0.03; SG: P = 0.001). This pattern of discrimination was similar in Phase 2. Results suggest that the time horizon could influence utility scores and discrimination among health states. When designing utility evaluations, researchers should carefully consider the time horizon so that the value of health states is accurately represented in cost-utility models.","[Matza, Louis S.; Stewart, Katie D.; McDaniel, Kelly; Jordan, Jessica] Evidera, Outcomes Res, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA; [Boye, Kristina S.; Bowman, Lee; Johnston, Joseph A.] Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Feeny, David H.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, Hamilton, ON, Canada",Evidera; Eli Lilly; McMaster University,"Matza, LS (通讯作者)，Evidera, Outcomes Res, 7101 Wisconsin Ave,Suite 1400, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",louis.matza@evidera.com,,"Johnston, Joseph/0000-0003-3913-9256",Eli Lilly and Company,Eli Lilly and Company(Eli Lilly),This study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company.,,52,15,15,1,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Regional patterns of production and consumption have direct and indirect effects on sustainability of its natural capital. Traditional gross domestic product (GDP) estimates fail to explicitly and fully account for natural capital in system of national accounts (SNA). To address this gap, this study builds on United Nation's System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) and provides a methodological framework to integrate natural capital into system of national accounts, in input-output table. It further illustrates how natural capital integrated system of national accounts in input-output table can be used as an effective tool for natural resource management and policy analysis in computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling framework. Results indicate that, without natural capital accounting and integration into system of national accounts, GDP estimates may give misleading signals as a measure of a region's economic performance, where economic growth could be at the expense of natural capital depletion.

The edited volume CM 2.0 (lnayatullah & Milojevic, 2015) shows that in addition to metaphors, many futures researchers have found the general language-based approach of semiotics. The paper deals with three issues: first the theory of metaphors as such, much discussed in the semiotic literature; then what semiotics says about the future; and finally, what kind of semiotics we are considering here.

We argue that the rise of financialized management has in fact a long history that goes back to the conglomerate movement in 1960s America. As we show, the conglomerates pioneered the use of financial markets as a baseline for strategy, and the emphasis on financial transactions as an engine for growth. They developed key techniques-high leverage, share-price maximization and accounting manipulation-that later came to be associated with managerial strategies of the shareholder value era. This legacy has important implications for how we think about patient capital. It challenges the idea that patient capital consists foremost in shielding non-financial companies from capital markets and highlights the central role of management too often neglected in these debates.","[Knafo, Samuel; Dutta, Sahil Jai] Univ Sussex, Global Studies, Arts C Bldg,Arts Rd, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Knafo, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Global Studies, Arts C Bldg,Arts Rd, Brighton BN1 9SJ, E Sussex, England.",s.knafo@sussex.ac.uk,,"Dutta, Sahil/0000-0002-6465-4279",Sussex Doctoral Studentship at the University of Sussex,Sussex Doctoral Studentship at the University of Sussex,Sahil Jai Dutta thanks the Sussex Doctoral Studentship Scheme at the University of Sussex for their generous support.,,61,21,23,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

A demand model is estimated in first differences; the availability of households in the sample that replaced their car during the period of observation combined with information on their driving behaviour before and after the car switch allows us to identify the rebound effect Endogeneity is taken into account by using appropriate instruments. Results include the following. First, we reject the 'conventional' formulation in which only fuel cost per kilometre matters. Second, the selection equation confirms that higher fuel prices induce households to switch car. Third, the results suggest the presence of a rebound effect that is on the lower end of the estimates available in the literature. Specifically, our best estimate of the rebound effect is some 7.5-10%. Fourth, the fuel price sensitivity of the demand for kilometres appears to be declining with household income, but we do not find a significant impact of income on the rebound effect Finally, simulation results indicate that the small rebound effect and changes in car characteristics in response to higher fuel prices imply that - compared to the reference scenario-higher fuel prices lead to a substantial reduction in both the demand for kilometres and in demand for fuel.

These funds, created to stimulate a recovery in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and to stabilise financial markets, ended up mostly as emerging markets' corporate bonds and loans (often after being leveraged into many multiples of their original value). Not for the first time, emerging markets became the financial markets of last resort. These funds were then either mainly invested (Asia) or used (as in Latin America and South Africa) for almost anything except for creating additional productive capacities. Enquiries into these issues, especially how corporations financed their investment, were subjects that fascinated economist Ajit Singh. He was the first to find out that corporations in emerging markets relied much more on external finance than those in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (where retained profits played a major role). The implication was that they were likely to be more susceptible to the vicissitudes of financial markets, and these have become even more weird since quantitative easing, as Northern investors', in search for elusive yields, have been happy to take on ever higher risks, leverage and illiquidity in the South. This is a key difference between current global financial fragilities and those at the onset of the current global financial crisis in 2007. The stakes for emerging economies and international financial markets could scarcely be higher, but unfortunately these huge new challenges occur at the worst possible time, as our social imagination has seldom been so barren.","[Gabriel Palma, Jose] Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England; [Gabriel Palma, Jose] Univ Santiago Chile USACH, Santiago, Chile",University of Cambridge; Universidad de Santiago de Chile,"Palma, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Fac Econ, Cambridge, England.",jgp5@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,37,1,1,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In the buffer zone of the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador, we analyzed the spatial and institutional configuration of Common Property Management Regimes (CPMRs) of two indigenous groups (Shuar, Kichwa) and a group of Colonist cooperatives in their historical development. We used the Ostrom (1990) principles to assess land configuration and institutional arrangements for decision-making in the use of shared resources and analyzed the implications for REDD + implementation. We found that CPMRs of the two studied indigenous groups are becoming increasingly similar to those of the Colonists as a result of agrarian reforms and legal frameworks for communal organization. The informal continuation of traditional forms of organization under (modern) formal structures and the overlap of de jure and de facto rights hinder efficient and transparent forest governance and REDD + implementation. Spatial and institutional homogenization of CPMRs of various ethnic groups and privatization of farms inside CPMRs causes further forest fragmentation and impedes conservation goals.

A discrete time duration model with a difference-in-difference specification and time-varying coefficients is estimated to assess variations in policy effects over length of stay. Among patients whose costs are fully reimbursed by the mixed scheme, the model demonstrates a significant effect of marginal revenue on length of stay. No significant policy effects are found among patients for whom only health insurance rates are delivered as mixed tariffs and government contributions are made retrospectively. The results indicate that marginal revenue can affect length of stay in inpatient psychiatry facilities, but that the reduction in marginal revenue must be sufficiently large.","[Pletscher, Mark] Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Rue AL Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland; [Pletscher, Mark] Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur Inst Hlth Econ, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland",University of Neuchatel; Zurich University of Applied Sciences,"Pletscher, M (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Inst Econ Res, Rue AL Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.;Pletscher, M (通讯作者)，Zurich Univ Appl Sci, Winterthur Inst Hlth Econ, Gertrudstr 15, CH-8400 Winterthur, Switzerland.",markpletscher@gmx.ch,,"Pletscher, Mark/0000-0003-2134-4542",,,,,23,3,3,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

As a result of the model, hospitals with high prevalence rates benefit from the information asymmetry only when the standard treatment is inefficient when applied to the patients eligible to receive the new treatment.

He focuses then, in the 'methodological discussion', on how networks, are being perceived in various ways, by different schools, and on the limitations and risks appearing in the development and application of network approaches. The paper provides guidance on how to deal with these limitations and how to apply (analytical) network approaches. Finally conclusions are drawn on how analytical (network) approaches could be further developed or improved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To examine the effects of socio-demographics on health insurance subscription among women in Ghana. Methods: The study draws on the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Bivariate descriptive analysis and binary logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results: Wealth status, age, religion, birth parity, marriage and ecological zone were found to have significantly predicted health insurance subscription among women in reproductive age in Ghana. Urban dwellers, women who are nulliparous, those with no or low levels of education, African traditionalists and the poor were those who largely did not subscribe to the scheme.

We find that, holding constant own age, having older classmates on average improves educational outcomes, increasing test scores up to eight years after kindergarten, and raising the probability of taking a college-entry exam.

I study an educational reform in Sweden which prolonged the vocational programs in upper secondary school and gave them a considerably larger general content. The research design exploits variation across regions and over time in the implementation of a large-scale pilot which preceded the reform. I examine the students' labor market experiences during the 2008-2010 recession, at which time they had reached their late 30 s. I find no evidence that having attended a longer and more general program reduced the risk of experiencing unemployment. Among students with low GPAs from compulsory school, attending a pilot program seems instead to have led to an increased risk of unemployment. This pattern is strongest among male students and the effect is likely to be explained by the increased dropout rate which resulted from the change of the programs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Anti-circumvention rules (AC) allow the application of trade remedies to products that would fall outside the scope of the trade remedy regulation. The rationale is that some practices allow circumvention of the extra duties and so lessen the effective application of remedies. In this article, we argue that, in order to avoid protectionist abuses, these AC rules should only extend trade measures to those goods that both effectively circumvent and undermine those remedies, meaning the tests included in AC investigations must lead to the proportional application of AC measures. More specifically, we use a law and economics approach to analyse the proportionality of AC rules in the context of the lengest AC user, the EU, who, according to our estimations, have extended its existing anti-dumping coverage by an additional annual import value of USD 2 billion via new AC measures imposed in 1995-2013.","[Puccio, Laura] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Erbahar, Aksel] Grad Inst Geneva, Econ, Geneva, Switzerland",Universite Libre de Bruxelles,,,,"Erbahar, Aksel/0000-0001-7532-1456",project 'Dispute Settlement in Trade:Training in Law and Economics' (DISSETTLE); Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (ITN) under the EU [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN_264633],project 'Dispute Settlement in Trade:Training in Law and Economics' (DISSETTLE); Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (ITN) under the EU,"The research of this paper was funded as part of the project 'Dispute Settlement in Trade:Training in Law and Economics' (DISSETTLE), a Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (ITN) Funded under the EU's Seventh Framework Programme, Grant Agreement No FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN_264633.

Using detailed ED level data from three different EDs, one for each level of the Portuguese ED care, we rely on a difference-in-differences strategy, under the assumption that both civil servants and National Health Service (NHS) users were targeted by the public co-payment increase, but just the former have a low-cost alternative in the private sector that they can use when prices increase in the NHS. We found that the existence of a low-price alternative in the private sector caused ED demand to decrease among ADSE beneficiaries following a policy that increased co-payments in public NHS hospitals. Specifically, we show that this decrease was only significant for conditions which have arguably the closest substitutes in the private sector - the low and intermediate-severity conditions - and to patients who lived closer to the ED and to whom the co-payment was the largest share of the ED visit cost. These findings cast some concerns over the equity of the Portuguese Health System, since civil servants increasingly opt out from public health services but must co-fund both the ADSE and the NHS.","[Vaz, Sofia; Ramos, Pedro] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal; [Vaz, Sofia] Adm Reg Saude Norte, Oporto, Portugal; [Ramos, Pedro] Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Hosp Clin, Av Dr Eneas Carvalho Aguiar 255, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade do Porto; Universidade de Sao Paulo,"Ramos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Oporto, Portugal.;Ramos, P (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Fac Med, Hosp Clin, Av Dr Eneas Carvalho Aguiar 255, BR-05403000 Sao Paulo, Brazil.",pedrosaldanharamos@live.com.pt,,"Ramos, Pedro/0000-0002-6825-6577",,,,,29,0,0,0,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Can WTO members impose trade restrictions based on moral or ethical concerns? Under what conditions can these concerns trump existing trade liberalization commitments? The dispute was filed in 2009 by Canada and Norway against the EU, which in the same year had banned seal products from being imported and placed on its market. According to the EU, the policy was introduced in response to European moral outrage at the inhumane killing of seals. The EU seal regime included a series of exceptions. In particular, it allowed imports of seal products hunted by Inuit or other indigenous communities, as well as imports of seal products processed and re-exported by EU producers. This article discusses the Appellate Body's ruling in EC-Seal Products and some of the key legal and economic issues raised by this dispute.","[Conconi, Paola] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Conconi, Paola] CEPR, London, England; [Voon, Tania] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Melbourne,"Conconi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.;Conconi, P (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Voon, T (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",pconconi@ulb.ac.be; tania.voon@unimelb.edu.au,,"Voon, Tania/0000-0001-7925-9389",,,,,17,15,15,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2016,15,2.0,,,,,211,234,,10.1017/S1474745615000725,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GM,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372461000003,0

A state funded General Medical Services (GMS) scheme in Ireland experienced an increase in prescription expenditure of 414 % between 1998 and 2012. This paper seeks to explore the rationale for this growth by investigating the composition (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Group level 1 & 5) and drivers of GMS drug expenditure in Ireland in 2012. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out on the Health Service Executive-Primary Care Reimbursement Service (HSE-PCRS) population prescribing database (n = 1,630,775). Three models were applied to test the association between annual expenditure per claimant whilst controlling for age, sex, region, and the pharmacology of the drugs as represented by the main ATC groups. Results: The mean annual cost per claimant was (sic)751 (median = (sic)211; SD = (sic)1323.10; range = (sic)3.27-(sic)298,670). Age, sex, and regions were all significant contributory factors of expenditure, with gender having the greatest impact (beta = 0.107). Those aged over 75 (beta = 1.195) were the greatest contributors to annual GMS prescribing costs. As regards regions, the South has the greatest cost increasing impact. When the ATC groups were included the impact of gender is diluted by the pharmacology of the products, with cardiovascular prescribing (ATC ' C') most influential (beta = 1.229) and the explanatory power of the model increased from 40 % to 60 %. Conclusion: Whilst policies aimed at cost containment (co-payment charges; generic substitution; reference pricing; adjustments to GMS eligibility) can be used to curtail expenditure, health promotional programs and educational interventions should be given equal emphasis. Also policies intended to affect physicians' prescribing behaviour include guidelines, information (about price and less expensive alternatives) and feedback, and the use of budgetary restrictions could yield savings in Ireland and can be easily translated to the international context.","[ConwayLenihan, A.] Cork Inst Technol, Dept Management & Enterprise, Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland; [Ahern, S.; Moore, S.; Cronin, J.; Woods, N.] Univ Coll Cork, Ctr Policy Studies, 6 Bloomfield Terrace,Western Rd, Cork, Ireland",Munster Technological University (MTU); University College Cork,"ConwayLenihan, A (通讯作者)，Cork Inst Technol, Dept Management & Enterprise, Rossa Ave, Bishopstown, Cork, Ireland.",aisling.conway@cit.ie,,"Woods, Noel/0000-0003-2795-3576; ConwayLenihan, Aisling/0000-0002-3888-9146; Moore, Stephen/0000-0003-2591-3714; Cronin, Jodi/0000-0001-7791-663X; Ahern, Susan/0000-0001-6534-0506",,,,,37,6,6,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Current austerity measures have coincided with the renewal of collective agreements, thus allowing the study of how unions link bargaining stances to wider issues of service quality and accessibility. Union responses are the result of at least three influences: the institutional framework for public sector collective bargaining and worker representation, the previous orientation of members and their organisations towards social and work relations, and ongoing innovations for renewal and member engagement. We posit that union responses can contribute to renewal if they are guided by concerns to redefine union purpose, union organisation and building capacities. Under these conditions, unions are able to engage members and push forward an alternative agenda to that of the government. In doing so, they may be able to forge temporary alliances with outside stakeholders, namely parents. Analysis of union responses should consider the dialectic between union renewal effort and the opportunities and constraints of the institutional framework for public sector collective bargaining. The challenge for these two labour federations is in sustaining member engagement and activism beyond the current context of collective bargaining.","[Grenier, Jean-Noel] Univ Laval, Ind Relat, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Jalette, Patrice] Univ Montreal, Ind Relat, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada",Laval University; Universite de Montreal,"Grenier, JN (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Pavillon JA DeSeve,1025,Av Sci Humaine,Local 3170, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",Jean-Noel.Grenier@rlt.ulaval.ca,,,,,,,43,5,5,1,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

First, technical efficiency scores of joint stock and city commercial banks surpassed those of state-owned commercial banks under the optimal risk preference, and technical efficiency generally improved over time. Second, the preference for risk balance was optimal for achieving technical efficiency. Third, a larger proportion of state-owned and joint stock commercial banks fall into the preference for risk neutral category than city commercial banks.","[Zhu, Ning; Wang, Bing; Wu, Yanrui] Jinan Univ, Sch Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhiqian] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Econ & Stat, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Wu, Yanrui] Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Perth, WA 6009, Australia",Jinan University; Guangzhou University; University of Western Australia,"Wang, B (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, 601 West Huangpu Ave, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",twangb@jnu.edu.cn,"Wu, Yanrui/C-2458-2013","Wu, Yanrui/0000-0002-8966-1459",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [12JNYH002]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-110856]; Guangdong Province Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities-IRESD [2012JDXM_0009]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473105]; Program for China Scholarship Council (CSC),Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Guangdong Province Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities-IRESD; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for China Scholarship Council (CSC),"We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (12JNYH002), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-110856), the Guangdong Province Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Universities-IRESD (2012JDXM_0009), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473105).

Enhancing food security having complex dimensions of food availability, food accessibility, food stability and food utilisation, requires an integrated approach that transcends disciplinary boundaries and aims at solving real world problems not solely at contributing scientific knowledge. Horticulture, in particular, African Indigenous Vegetables (AIVs) provide a comparatively advantageous entry point as they offer largely untapped potentials in terms of workplaces and income opportunities, the delivery of vital micronutrients for combatting malnutrition and, not least, a raised diversity of agricultural production systems. However, top-down research approaches generating only knowledge from selected disciplines have reportedly failed to provide smallholder farmers with affordable, practical and readily available solutions to their problems; adoption rates of scientific inventions are low. Interdisciplinary knowledge generation must be embedded in an effective innovation system extending to all stakeholders to bring about change. This paper will present a research frameworka that holistically analyses the food system and AIV value chains of Kenya and bordering regions of Tanzania and Ethiopia using an integrative, inter- and disciplinary framework adapted from natural, social and communication science, ecology, gender studies and development economics, developed by more than one hundred young and senior researchers from Kenya and Germany within a major international research project. As case study, novel empirical results will be presented using the innovation system approach (one of fourteen elements of the research approach) focussing on the systemic determinants of all innovative processes and activities possibly taking place in the Kenyan AIVs sector. Through a focused analysis of factors affecting innovation in the case of AIVs' seed supply and the actors working together, the problem-focused innovation system provides a promising solution(s).","[Bokelmann, W.; Ferenczi, Z.; Gevorgyan, E.] Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Bokelmann, W (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Albrecht Daniel Thaer Inst Agr & Hort Sci, Fac Life Sci, Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,17,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,89,96,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.12,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400012,0

Thereby, social capital is defined as a multidimensional construct composed of social trust, participation and civism. The results obtained by using the stepwise regression method indicate that the perception of civism, i.e., the perceived absence of opportunistic, predatory behavior by fellow citizens, represents a strong direct predictor of relative per capita household electricity consumption across social capital dimension variables. Other particular social capital dimensions and subdimensions play a statistically insignificant role in the regression effect. The obtained results are briefly discussed in the context of social study findings aimed at encouraging energy efficiency and sustainable behavior of households.","[Borozan, Djula; Starcevic, Dubravka Pekanov] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia; [Funaric, Mirjana Radman] Polytech Pozega, Pozega, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Borozan, D (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Osijek, Croatia.",borozan@efos.hr; radmanfunaric@vup.hr; dpekanov@efos.hr,"Borozan, Đula/AAA-3997-2021","Borozan, Đula/0000-0003-0607-1574",,,,,44,0,0,0,2,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,34,48,,,,,,15,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100004,0

In order to capture the evolution of market concentration and performance, we used data provided by BSCEE. We found that there is a strong and direct link between the indicator of the degree of banking market concentration - concentration ratio (CR3) and performance indicator the rate of return on equity (ROE) for eight countries (Albania, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Montenegro, Romania, Slovenia and Ukraine). A direct but weak link between the two indicators CR3 and ROE we find in banking markets such as Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Poland. On the the other hand, the values of the Pearson correlation coefficient show there is a strong inverse relation for four countries (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Russia and Slovakia).

Researches have been carried out in Recas viticultural area in the west of Romania, and were applied different floor management and pruning systems. The experimental variants were: V-1 - midrow bare soil and weeds cleared between the vines in the rows with a hand hoe; pruning works and grapes harvested by hand; V-2 - midrow bare soil with rotary hoe and herbicides under vines rows; pruning works and grapes harvested by hand; V-3 - midrow bare soil with rotary hoe and herbicides under vines rows; mechanical pruning and harvesting; V-4- perennial grass strip between the grape rows and rotary tillers under vines rows; pruning works and grapes harvested by hand; V-5 - perennial grass strip between the grape rows and rotary tillers under vines rows; mechanical pruning and harvesting. This work is aimed at analyzing the effects of the experimental variants on grapes yield, and for each variant were calculated several economic indicators: cost per ha, production values, realized profit, cost per kg of grapes, rate of profit, production increased due to mechanization and inter - relationship between technological sequences. The results were very different; variants with a high degree of mechanization had the highest economic efficiency, while they did not also have the largest increase production. Version control with the lowest percentage of mechanization had the highest production, but in the same time recorded the highest cost of production and the lowest rate of profit.

The exchange rate and its changes, as one of the macroeconomic variables and the price of foreign currency in the domestic currency, have a significant effect on other macroeconomic variables such as inflation, production, exports, imports, balance of payments and so on. Vast changes in exchange rates can affect the country's macroeconomic variables by affecting the supply and demand of the economy. Thus, according to the proposed issues, this study intends to use the 18-year experience of inflation targeting framework adopted by industrial and developing countries so as to investigate the relationship between monetary shocks on the real exchange rate and the trade balance in some of these countries. The results of the extended torque models' estimates for developed countries indicate that the real exchange rate stabilization policy and trade expansion and trade balance improvement in the studied developed countries have been studied and is a function of the stabile and long-term macro-economic policies and has been properly implemented. The results also showed a positive relationship between gross domestic production and the real exchange rate and existence of a liquidity shock and inflation increases the real exchange rate in the countries studied in the research. Results in developing countries also show that liquidity and rising prices and inflation do not move in a same direction. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The presentations highlight the increased importance of aquaculture, as production and trade are expected to continue to increase. That implies that there are economic decisions to be made at all stages in the supply chain from input providers, in production, in the supply chain, and in addressing consumer preferences. This is largely reflected by the variety of topics addressed in this special issue. Although five articles in this special issue can never represent the full extent of topics and species that were covered in all presentations, they provide a fair indication of the variation when it comes to topics, but less so when it comes to species. It is worthwhile noting that, although there is an increasing focus on markets and demand, the special issue does not quite do justice to the many interesting contributions on the production side.

A transition matrix takes other factors into account which may influence on the changes in demand. The proposed algorithm is applied to the original populations of students enrolled on 2005/2006 to 2007/2008 courses. Then, a new algorithm, whose elements are corrected to adjust the forecasts, is applied to obtain the forecast of the demand composition on the 2009/2010 course. This methodological proposal is shown to be able to provide the type of forecast which is very useful in policy making decisions in the recent process of building the European Higher Education Area.","[Hernandez-Lopez, Montserrat; Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan] Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Aplicada & Metodos Cuantitat, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain",Universidad de la Laguna,"Cáceres-Hernández, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ La Laguna, Dept Econ Aplicada & Metodos Cuantitat, E-38207 San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain.",jcaceres@ull.es,"Hernández-López, Montserrat/AAC-2907-2020; Cáceres-Hernández, José Juan/C-1436-2009; Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan/ABH-1360-2020","Hernández-López, Montserrat/0000-0002-6743-7202; Caceres-Hernandez, Jose Juan/0000-0003-0092-8864",,,,,31,1,1,2,10,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Nitra as a city of national importance is rich in cultural, historical and religious attractions. We identify the key factors of the destination identity in order to build the image of city as a modern tourist destination. An electronic and printed research was conducted from June to September 2015 and completed by 858 respondents. The data were interpreted by semantic differential and descriptive statistics. As the key associations with the Nitra city we identified Nitra Castle and Zobor Hill, whereas the perception of Nitra was more positive among current than future visitors. According to perception of Nitra as a cultural and historical city situated in the pleasant natural surroundings, we propose recommendation for building the image of Nitra on domestic tourism market. Findings provide valuable insight for city decision makers and adds specific focus on differences between future and current visitors.

We chose RQA because it is suitable for economic time series that are characterized by noise and short data sets. Through RQA we can obtain useful information on the quality and complexity of the hidden structure of the dynamics in an economy. Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems. At first we estimated the time delay and the embedding dimension, which is needed for the Lyapunov exponent estimation, the phase space reconstruction and for RQA. Finally we used RQA itself. We used recurrence plots (RP) as a powerful tool for visualization and analysis. Generally RP is an advanced technique of nonlinear data analysis. RP is a graphical method designed to locate hidden recurring patterns, nonstationarity and structural changes. We apply RQA in order to provide a classification based on topological aspects of their dynamics. Our considerations on the basis of these analyzes confirm that it could be chaotic behavior in certain macroeconomic time series.","[Kriz, Radko; Lesakova, Petra] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kríz, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,,,University of Pardubice [SGS_2016_],University of Pardubice,Supported by the specific science grant SGS_2016_ of the University of Pardubice.,,15,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,507,514,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200066,0

Due to the complex urban research the strategy of a Krasnoyarsk transport infrastructure development has been created, in anticipation of the 29th Winter Universiade in 2019 [2], which may lay the foundation of the amplification of a city tourist attraction after the Universiade.

Global bifurcations often occur when larger invariant sets of the system collide with each other or with other fixed points/cycles.

The paper analyzes aggregated data at macro level concerning foreign direct investments flows and tries to predict the possible trends in the behavior of multinational companies at strategic individual level. In order to identify these effects the number and value of green field projects and mergers and acquisitions are analyzed for a sample of European Union member countries using a panel model to estimate the relation between different types of foreign direct investments.

They found both methods increased cognitive measures of knowledge and noncognitive measures of self-efficacy, motivation to learn, and willingness to take financial risks.

Theory suggests that uncertainty may play a major role in framing biodiversity and its preservation. This paper examines written statements on biodiversity preservation published by two major Swedish organizations, i.e., the Swedish Forest Industries Federation and the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, with different interests in forest use. Frame analysis suggests that when the actors pursue a certain policy course, both biodiversity-related uncertainty and lack of regulatory clarity are important factors contributing to dissimilar framings. This case study supports the general understanding that biodiversity-related uncertainty can have important implications for biodiversity preservation, in this case, via forest policy and legislation. Scientific uncertainty may allow actors with dissimilar interests in an issue to justify their standpoints. To successfully manage forest biodiversity in the future, legal frameworks must increasingly find ways to accommodate scientific uncertainty, and models must be developed in which stakeholders' diverging interests and values address uncertainties via dialogue.

Interest in production of seaweeds in temperate waters is rising, in particular in combination with offshore wind energy generation. This article reports an investigation of the economic feasibility of seaweed production in the North Sea using economic modelling. Often, an overly positive picture of the costs and benefits of seaweed production is sketched. Based on current available information, offshore seaweed production in the North Sea is not economically feasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that revenues would have to increase by roughly 300%, all other things equal, to make a profit. A number of opportunities to improve the economic feasibility of a North Sea seaweed value chain are identified. Technical innovation and the design of systems that enable multiple harvests per year can reduce production costs. Successful marketing of seaweed as human food, and the development of biorefinery concepts can increase the value of the produced seaweed.","[van den Burg, Sander W.

We show that in the first step, employers attach most value to CV attributes which signal a high stock of occupation-specific human capital indicating low training costs and short adjustment periods; attributes such as relevant work experience and a good match between the field of study and the job tasks. In line with the preferences in the first step, employers' actual hiring decision is mostly influenced by graduates' level of professional expertise and interpersonal skills. Other types of skills also play a role in the hiring decision but are less important, and can therefore not easily compensate for a lack of occupation-specific human capital and interpersonal skills.

Using a regression-discontinuity design with data from a large urban community college system, we make three contributions. First, we articulate three alternative hypotheses regarding the potential impacts of remediation. Second, in addition to credits and degree completion we examine several underexplored outcomes, including initial enrollment, grades in subsequent courses, and post-treatment proficiency test scores. Finally, we exploit rich high school background data to examine impact heterogeneity by predicted dropout risk. We find that remedial assignment does little to develop students' skills. But we also find little evidence that it discourages initial enrollment or persistence, except for a subgroup we identify as potentially misassigned to remediation. Instead, the primary effect of remediation appears to be diversionary: students simply take remedial courses instead of college-level courses. These diversionary effects are largest for the lowest-risk students.","[Scott-Clayton, Judith] Columbia Univ Teachers Coll, Community Coll Res Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Rodriguez, Olga] Columbia Univ Teachers Coll, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University Teachers College; Columbia University Teachers College,"Scott-Clayton, J (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ Teachers Coll, Community Coll Res Ctr, New York, NY 10027 USA.",scott-clayton@tc.columbia.edu; orodriguez@tc.columbia.edu,,,,,,,33,75,166,0,91,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

This study compared the preference values for EQ-5D-5L health states between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese. The preference values for ten EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from general population samples of mainland Chinese and Singaporeans. In computer-assisted self-interviews, each participant completed five time trade-off (TTO) tasks to value five different EQ-5D-5L health states. The difference in TTO values between mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese was examined using random-effects linear regression and logistic regression models. A total of 194 eligible mainland Chinese and 145 eligible Singaporean Chinese provided data for this study. All ten health states considered, the mean TTO value was 0.18 for Singaporean Chinese and 0.35 for mainland Chinese, with the unadjusted and adjusted difference [95 % confidence interval (CI)] being -0.17 (-0.28, -0.07) and -0.16 (-0.27, -0.05). Singaporean Chinese had substantially lower TTO values than mainland Chinese for states with severe or extreme problems, with the adjusted difference being -0.30 (95 % CI -0.42, -0.17). On the other hand, Singaporean Chinese and mainland Chinese had similar TTO values for states with mild or moderate problems, with the adjusted (95 % CI) difference being 0.04 (-0.07, 0.15). Logistic regression analysis showed that Singaporean Chinese were more likely to rate health states with severe or extreme problems as worse than death compared to mainland Chinese. Mainland Chinese and Singaporean Chinese have different preferences for EQ-5D-5L health states, supporting the development of local value sets for the EQ-5D-5L instrument for the two populations.","[Wang, P.; Luo, N.] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, Singapore 117597, Singapore; [Li, M.

While juniper is native to central Oregon, current land management practices have led to a significant increase in its density on much of the landscape. There could be potential benefits related to juniper removal for private landowners, as well as social benefits associated with water and habitat enhancement. At current densities, juniper on these private lands has negative impacts that diminish biodiversity, reduce forage grass and tie up water resources. The difference in the value of cattle productivity resulting from the presence of juniper as well as any forgone net returns from the sale of juniper to the biofuel industry reflects the opportunity cost to the rancher. This opportunity cost does not capture the complete opportunity cost associated with juniper removal since it does not incorporate the enhanced benefits of biodiversity and increased water availability, and thus reflects a lower bound. The supply curves for juniper as a source for biofuel shift in response to profitable harvesting coordination between landowners, the Oregon Biofuel Producer tax credit and increased positive externalities due to juniper removal. Because of restricted road networks the available source of juniper was limited by access - only 27% of the juniper area is on private rangelands, which is the focus of this report. This study identified supply costs under alternative business models and policy assumptions for an aggregate supply of 2.75 million tonnes and illustrated an analytic technique that could be replicated in other areas.

Previous scenario studies on privacy have focused on macro trends and on forecasting technological developments, and claims about causal influences have remained implicit. This article presents an alternative approach for constructing scenarios of privacy protection. The article focuses on privacy protection as a social institution and builds on the theory of gradual institutional change. The article presents a scenario framework which includes three stages: (1) outlining the dynamics of privacy protection, (2) tracing historical processes and constructing a causal narrative, and (3) creating event-based scenarios. The resulting scenarios are narratives of plausible chains of events which are based on the results of the previous stages. The key difference to typical scenario approaches is the focus on specific actors and types of event sequences in privacy protection. The argument is that by lowering the level of abstraction in this way, researchers and decision-makers can gain a more profound understanding of possible future challenges in privacy protection and of key leverage points in the institutional change process.

While this should indisputably be a central policy aim, the exclusive focus on quick re-employment neglects the importance of its quality and stability. Therefore, this paper analyses the effect of labour market policy on re-employment stability in Europe. Combining EU-SILC longitudinal survey data with macro-data on labour market policy, we conduct multi-level survival analysis. Empirical evidence suggests that countries with more generous unemployment insurance and higher active labour market policy (ALMP) spending achieve more sustainable reintegration of previously unemployed workers. These results point to a policy trade-off between the well-confirmed disincentive and locking-in effect of unemployment benefits and ALMP programmes on the one hand, and their positive effect on re-employment stability on the other hand.","[Wulfgramm, Melike] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense M, Denmark; [Wulfgramm, Melike; Fervers, Lukas] Univ Bremen, D-28359 Bremen, Germany; [Fervers, Lukas] IAW Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany",University of Southern Denmark; University of Bremen; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Wulfgramm, M (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Odense M, Denmark.",wulfgramm@sam.sdu.dk,"Fervers, Lukas/AAJ-7322-2020","Wulfgramm, Melike/0000-0001-9436-2771",,,,,46,22,24,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

There are, however, interesting points of contact which might highlight some potentially risky aspects of advanced computing technologies. While the original simulation argument of Nick Bostrom was formulated without reference to the enabling AI technologies and accompanying existential risks, I argue that there is an important generic link between the two, whose net effect under a range of plausible scenarios is to reduce the likelihood of our living in a simulation. This has several consequences for risk analysis and risk management, the most important being putting greater priority on confronting traditional existential risks, such as those following from the misuse of biotechnology, nuclear winter or supervolcanism. In addition, the present argument demonstrates how - rather counterintuitively - seemingly speculative ontological speculations could, in principle, influence practical decisions on risk mitigation policies.

In order to account for the endogeneity of education, variation across cohorts induced by the timing of the CSL and variation across provinces by the intensity of additional classrooms constructed in the mother's birth provinces is used as an instrumental variable. The results indicate that mother's primary school completion improves infant health, as measured by very low birth weight, and child health, as measured by height-for-age and weight-for-age z-scores, even after controlling for many potential confounding factors. This paper also demonstrates that maternal education leads to earlier preventive care initiation, reduces smoking, reduces fertility, and increases age at first birth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using patent applications in 366 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the USA from 1975 to 2002, we analyse the vulnerability and response of cities to technological crises, defined as periods of sustained negative growth in patenting activity. We find that the frequency, intensity and duration of technological crises vary considerably across American cities. Econometric analysis suggests that cities with knowledge bases that are diverse, flexible and proximate to technologies in which they do not currently possess comparative advantage tend to avoid technological crises, have limited downturns in patent production and recover faster from crisis events.","[Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; Boschma, Ron] Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands; [Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; Boschma, Ron] Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Rigby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Geog, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rigby, David] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Stat, Los Angeles, CA USA",Utrecht University; Lund University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Balland, PA (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Dept Econ Geog, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",p.balland@uu.nl; rigby@geog.ucla.edu; ron.boschma@circle.lu.se,,"Balland, Pierre-Alexandre/0000-0003-2787-4376",NWO (Netherlands); ANR (France); ESRC (UK); DFG (Germany),NWO (Netherlands)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)Netherlands Government); ANR (France)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ESRC (UK)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); DFG (Germany)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"This work is part of a project granted under the Open Research Area in Europe for the Social Sciences (ORA): 'Territories and technologies in an unstable knowledge economy: An evolutionary framework of regional resilience'.

We summarise the results of a discrete choice survey of the general public in New Zealand that elicits willingness to make tradeoffs among taxes and four socio-ecological attributes: biodiversity, maintenance of Maori customary practices, and restrictions on commercial and recreational fishing. We apply cluster analysis, which provides information about political market shares' of respondent preferences, and derive estimates of average public willingness to pay for various policy scenarios. Both analyses reveal broad-scale support for conservation of biodiversity and cultural practices, providing quantifiable input from the public in the process of marine space reallocation.","[Chhun, Sophal; Moller, Henrik] Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil CSAFE, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand; [Kahui, Viktoria; Thorsnes, Paul] Univ Otago, Dept Econ, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",University of Otago; University of Otago,"Chhun, S (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Ctr Sustainabil CSAFE, POB 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.",sophal.chhun@postgrad.otago.ac.nz; viktoria.kahui@otago.ac.nz; henrikmoller@otago.ac.nz; paul.thorsnes@otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,72,10,12,2,47,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The second dividend modifies growth. Accordingly, in general equilibrium, the second dividend and the demographic structure are interrelated. This paper aims at assessing empirically the second dividend in a dynamic, empirical and intertemporal setting that allows for measuring its impact on growth, its intergenerational redistributive effects, and its interaction with the demographic structure. The paper uses a general equilibrium model with overlapping generations, an energy module and a public finance module that distinguishes between non-ageing-related public spending and a pension regime. Policy scenarios compare the consequences of different scenarios of recycling a carbon tax through lower proportional income taxes rather than higher public lump-sum expenditures. They are computed for two countries with different demographics (France and Germany). Results suggest that the magnitude of the second dividend is significantly related with the demographic structure. The more concentrated the demographic structure on cohorts with higher income and saving rate, the stronger the effect on capital supply of the second dividend. The second dividend weighs on the welfare of relatively aged working cohorts. It fosters the wellbeing of young working cohorts and of future generations. The more concentrated the demographic structure on aged working cohorts, the higher the intergenerational redistributive effects of the second dividend. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Using panel data for 15 Tunisian sectors over the period 1983-2010, we compare estimated sectoral output-employment elasticities prior to and following the Free Trade Agreement process with the European Union. The results provide evidence that trade liberalisation in Tunisia has led to an increase in the intensity of employment in exporting manufacturing sectors like textiles, clothing and leather industries, and mechanical and electrical industries. However, their ability to generate jobs in response to value-added growth remains weak. Conversely, since the Free Trade Agreement process, the most labour-intensive service sectors, notably tourism and miscellaneous services, have shown a significant decrease in the employment intensity of their output growth. Our findings suggest that the Free Trade Agreement with the European Union has not really fostered the shift of the Tunisian Economy towards a more inclusive model and support the argument for a reorientation of investment policy in favour of sectors generating more job opportunities.","[Goaied, Mohamed; Sassi, Seifallah] Univ Carthage, LEFA, Tunis 2016, Tunisia",Universite de Carthage,"Goaied, M (通讯作者)，Univ Carthage, Lab Appl Econ & Finance, Tunis 2016, Tunisia.",mohamed_goaied@yahoo.fr,"Goaied, Mohamed/HTM-8709-2023","Goaied, Mohamed/0000-0002-0039-9280",,,,,29,3,3,0,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Although BMA-based models of exchange rates tend to outperform the random-walk model, we show that when accounting for model uncertainty over and above parameter uncertainty through the use of dynamic model averaging (DMA) and dynamic model selection (DMS), the gains relative to the random-walk model are even bigger. That is, DMA and DMS models outperform not only the random-walk model, but also the BMA model of exchange rates. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis reveals that in exchange-rate modeling, accounting for parameter uncertainty may even be more important than parameter uncertainty. Our results are based on fifteen potential predictors used to forecast two South African rand-based exchange rates. We also unveil variables, which tend to vary over time, that are good predictors of the rand-dollar and rand-pound exchange rates at different forecasting horizons.","[de Bruyn, Riane; Gupta, Rangan; van Eyden, Renee] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Van Eyden, Renee/AAO-3991-2021","Van Eyden, Renee/0000-0002-6238-6215",,,,,30,8,9,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We used the short form 6D, a preference-based generic instrument, applying the utility scores estimated for Spain. It was found that the annual mean loss of quality-adjusted life years associated with alcohol dependence was 0.144 and 0.083 for the alcoholics and their close family members, respectively. This impact becomes more notable after controlling for socio economic variables and was higher than that estimated in similar studies. Possible explanations for these differences are discussed.

In the model economy inspired by recent Chinese experience, pollution raises the likelihood of future, poor health prompting households to save more so as to self-insure against anticipated medical expenses. Increased household saving generates more capital while capital use by firms generates more pollution. Along the transition, such a pollution-growth nexus may be attractive from a capital-accumulation perspective; however, rising pollution, via the health channel, hurts welfare. Both insurance and environmental policies affect capital accumulation and can have additional dynamic benefits. The availability of private health insurance to top up pay-as-you-go coverage of medical bills along with a Pigouvian tax on emissions and a profit tax can replicate the first best.

We find small but significant positive effects when black and white students are assigned to race-congruent teachers in reading (.004-.005 standard deviations) and for black, white and Asian/Pacific Island students in math (.007-.041 standard deviations).

Cost-value analysis is a name for evaluations with such a broader aim. The most widely held concern for fairness is a concern for the worse off, i.e. the idea that severity of illness should count in determining priorities. In economic evaluations of improvements in health-related quality of life this concern may be taken into account by replacing conventional health state utilities with societal values for health states that are characterised by strong upper end compression and decreasing marginal value of utility gains. We review evidence on the strength of concerns for the worse off-measured at the cardinal level-in 15 articles published in peer-reviewed journals in the time period 1978-2010, with reports from altogether 20 individual studies in nine different countries. We report 116 individual observations of paired comparisons of utility improvements with different start levels. Concerns for severity show up quite strongly across countries, sample types and question framings. By means of regression analyses we fit a societal value function to the data that has the property of decreasing marginal value of utility gains. Using the central tendency in the data we present two plausible transformations of EQ-5D utilities into societal values that reflect concerns for the worse off.","[Nord, Erik; Johansen, Rune] Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, N-0403 Oslo, Norway",Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH),"Nord, E (通讯作者)，Norwegian Inst Publ Hlth, POB 4404, N-0403 Oslo, Norway.",erik.nord@fhi.no,,,,,,,47,7,7,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

It begins by outlining the institutional arrangements under which minimum wage rates are determined in PNG. It then critically examines the argument that wage levels in the country are unsustainably high - a claim that has perennially characterised Papua New Guinea (PNG) minimum wage fixing. The article argues that, on the contrary, wage levels are indeed low and not adequate to reasonably support a single worker, let alone a family in an urban setting. This counter-argument is discussed in the context of debates over minimum wage levels and their relationship to economic growth, employment creation, international competitiveness, and capacity to pay. Whilst focusing on the PNG wage fixing system, the article thus sheds light on the dilemmas and challenges facing wages policy generally in a developing country setting.","[Imbun, Benedict] Univ Western Sydney, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Imbun, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Employment Relat, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 2751, Australia.",b.imbun@uws.edu.au,,,University of Western Sydney School of Business,University of Western Sydney School of Business,The author would like to acknowledge a seed grant from the University of Western Sydney School of Business that facilitated a short fieldwork study in PNG in 2012.,,49,1,1,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Several statistical methods (factor analysis, importance performance analysis, and independent T-test) were employed. The empirical results show that Chinese hotel employees perceive CSR to be more important and well performed than do their counterparts in Korea.

Across all case studies, it was found that relative to other players in the value chain, small-scale fishers and fish farmers are receiving the smallest economic benefits for their products. Processors and retail markets were found to be receiving more of the distributional benefits of the value chain owing to their stronger bargaining power. With this finding, policy recommendations aim to safeguard the interests of small-scale fishers and fish farmers by improving their prices and margins while allowing the resource to achieve long-term sustainability from an economic, social and biological perspective.","[Bjorndal, Trond] Aalesund Univ, NHH, Coll & SNF Ctr Appl Res, Alesund, Norway; [Child, Anna; Lem, Audun] UN, Fisheries & Aquaculture Policy & Econ Div, FAO, Rome, Italy; [Dey, Madan M.] Univ Arkansas Pine Bluff, Aquaculture & Fisheries Ctr, Pine Bluff, AR USA",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Arkansas System; University Arkansas Pine Bluff,"Child, A (通讯作者)，414 Moonridge Rd, Chapel Hill, NC 27516 USA.",Anna.Child@fao.org,,"Dey, Madan/0000-0001-5273-2789",Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad); FAO; Norad,Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad)(CGIAR); FAO; Norad(CGIAR),"The main sponsors of the project were the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) and FAO.

Since hospital managers want to minimize the probability of not having enough capacity to satisfy demand, and since demand is uncertain, hospitals have to build excess capacity and incur the associated costs. Using panel data comprising information for 43 Portuguese public hospitals for the period 2007-2009, we estimate a translog cost function that relates total variable costs to the usual variables (outputs, the price of inputs, some of the hospitals' organizational characteristics) and an additional term measuring the excess capacity related to the uncertainty of demand. Demand uncertainty is measured as the difference between actual and projected demand for emergency services. Our results indicate that the cost function term associated with the uncertainty of demand is significant, which means that cost functions that do not include this type of term may be misspecified. For most of our sample, hospitals that face higher demand uncertainty have higher excess capacity and higher costs. Furthermore, we identify economies of scale in hospital costs, at least for smaller hospitals, suggesting that a policy of merging smaller hospitals would contribute to reducing hospital costs.","[Almeida, Alvaro Santos] Univ Porto, Ctr Econ & Finance UP, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Cima, Joana Ferreira] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Almeida, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Ctr Econ & Finance UP, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",almeida@fep.up.pt; 100411018@fep.up.pt,"Cima, Joana/AAD-5203-2022","Cima, Joana/0000-0002-2780-7467; Almeida, Alvaro/0000-0002-3604-0931",,,,,33,8,9,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The main features of the competitiveness on the European and world market since the early nineties of the twentieth century in the context of the framework and rules of the Common agricultural policy (CAP) application are evaluated there. The results of the research are discussed in relation to the differences in production of major agricultural commodities in the old and the new EU Member States mainly. Our findings have demonstrated that the differences in dynamics of the agrarian sectors of individual member states do exist and are based and influenced by wide variety of inner and outer factors. It raises the question of whether the CAP framework allows each country to apply its own strategy appropriate to the conditions of the current and future development of this sector. It concludes that the success of specific regional development strategy is subject to its ability to find and foster links between agriculture and other sectors often exceeding the size of the region concerned. In connection with the choice of priorities of the CAP 2020 points out need to promote effective links with relevant manufacturing industries and commodity distribution along the verticals, including infrastructure development, which should be the basis for real progress associated with the identification of forms and benefits of the agricultural sector as directly connected not only with the quality of the natural resources, but also with amenities and skilled human resources able to face new challenges of modern agribusiness directions adequately.","[Becvarova, Vera; Zdrahal, Ivo] Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Becvárová, V (通讯作者)，Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",becvar@mendelu.cz; ivo.zdrahal@mendelu.cz,"Zdrahal, Ivo/E-4335-2018; Bečvářová, Věra/E-4321-2018","Zdrahal, Ivo/0000-0002-6631-8228; Becvarova, Vera/0000-0003-2015-574X",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,25,30,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800003,0

An alternative approach when constructing an appropriate parametric distribution for the considered data file is to use the so-called order statistics. This paper deals with the use of order statistics as the methods of L-moments and TL-moments of parameter estimation. L-moments have some theoretical advantages over conventional moments. L-moments have been introduced as a robust alternative to classical moments of probability distributions. However, L-moments and their estimations lack some robust features that belong to the TL-moments. TL-moments represent an alternative robust version of L-moments, which are called trimmed L-moments. This paper deals with the use of L-moments and TL-moments in the construction of models of wage distribution. Three-parametric lognormal curves represent the basic theoretical distribution whose parameters were simultaneously estimated by three methods of point parameter estimation and accuracy of these methods was then evaluated. There are method of TL-moments, method of L-moments and maximum likelihood method in combination with Cohen's method. A total of 328 wage distribution has been the subject of research.","[Bilkova, Diana] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bílková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Sq W Churchill 1938-4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",bilkova@vse.cz,"Bilkova, Diana/G-3694-2017",,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,49,55,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900009,0

The non-preemptive failures do not interrupt the service process; we consider that it is possible to finish the service of the customer before we begin to repair the server. The catastrophes interrupt the service of the customer and all the customers found in the system are flushed out of the system. Moreover, the system rejects all the customers when the server is under repair after the catastrophe (that means the system is always empty during the repair of the catastrophic failure). We consider that the customers enter the system according to the Poisson process and they can wait in a queue that has a limited capacity equal to m-1. The customers are served by the single server according to the FCFS service discipline, service times are Erlang distributed. Times between the non-preemptive failures and the catastrophes and times to repair are exponentially distributed. The queueing system is modelled as a multi-dimensional Markov chain for which we present a linear equation system to obtain stationary probabilities of the individual states of the system; the equation system is solved numerically via software Matlab.

Methods: We use anthropometric weight-for-age nutrition status of children for an ordered logistic analysis. Our dataset gives us the advantage of segregating health knowledge into three indices: health-seeking practices index, child health precautions index and medical cost knowledge index, which are used as covariates to understand the role of health knowledge towards child health. Gender specific regressions are also run to understand male and female children nutritional function differences. Results: Per capita income significantly improves child health but household assets do not, casting doubt on the robustness of permanent income. After controlling for health knowledge and health-seeking behavior, the remaining impact of maternal education on child health is no longer significant. Health knowledge indices significantly improve child health albeit differentially. While male children are more sensitive to child health precautions and medical cost knowledge, female children are more sensitive to health-seeking practices. Conclusion: Role of health knowledge on child health carries a significant portion of the education effect. Policy makers looking to improve the nutritional status of female children vis-a-vis male children in study area, should promote programs focusing on health-seeking practices.","[Fakir, Adnan M.

Unfortunately, owing to modernization, most nursing mothers fail to adhere to such practices. This is believed to be a factor contributory to poor child health in Ghana. Thus, this study investigated the effect of timely initiation of breastfeeding on child health in Ghana. Methods: Cross sectional data using secondary data based on the positivism approach to research was employed. The Ordinary least squares and the Instrumental variables approach were used in estimating the effect of breastfeeding and other socio demographic indicators on the health of the child. Data for the study was sourced from the 2008 round of the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. Results: The results indicate that timely initiation of breastfeeding, both immediately and hours after birth are important factors that influence the child's health. Additionally, factors such as the wealth of the household, mother's education, age and size of the child at birth and age of the mother are important factors that also influence the health of the child in Ghana. Conclusion: The findings imply that efforts should be made on encouraging appropriate breastfeeding practices among nursing mothers to ensure proper child development and growth in Ghana.","[Fosu-Brefo, Rita] Univ Cape Coast, Dept Econ, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Arthur, Eric] Univ Benin, Dept Econ & Stat, Benin, Nigeria",University of Cape Coast; University of Benin,"Fosu-Brefo, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Coast, Dept Econ, Cape Coast, Ghana.",ritzrald4u@yahoo.com,,,,,,,23,13,14,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

This article puts forward a theory of cross-national policy differences, using indicators of unemployment benefit generosity and active labor market policy spending for the period from 1985 to 2005. Contesting recent research that downplays the impact of unions on policy outcomes, the author argues that variations in unionism are the central explanatory factor behind these differences in unemployment protection. Specifically, three aspects of different union movements are highlighted: union density, union centralization, and relative involvement in unemployment benefit administration. The article presents an index of 'inclusive unionism' that can explain the bulk of variation in unemployment protection generosity. This work builds on earlier power resource theory and challenges the explanations of labor market policy advanced by varieties of capitalism and insider-outsider theory.","Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Gordon, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",josh.gordon@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,50,33,34,1,41,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Before equation estimation each time series were individually tested for the existence of a unit root in order to avoid the so-called spurious regression problem.","[Jajkowicz, Ondrej] Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Jajkowicz, O (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Ekon Fak, Vysoka Skola Banska, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",ondrej.jajkowicz@vsb.cz,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,310,314,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900053,0

We use a panel data set of Canadian provinces, 2000 - 2008, and a set of recent panel econometric techniques in order to account for a variety of statistical specification issues. Results: We find that the social and economic determinants of suicide in Canadian provinces vary across total, male, and female counts (natural logarithms) and rates. We also find that the results vary depending on the econometric method employed. As such, separate analyses for males and females is necessary for a better understanding of the factors that impact suicide (consistent with previous research) and that the choice of statistical method impacts the results. Lastly, it is important to note the particular provinces are driving the results for particular socioeconomic variables. Conclusions: Such a result, if generalizable, has significant implications for suicide prevention policy.","[Jalles, Joao T.] Ctr Globalizat & Governance, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Andresen, Martin A.] Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Criminol, Burnaby, BC V5A IS6, Canada",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Simon Fraser University,"Andresen, MA (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Sch Criminol, Burnaby, BC V5A IS6, Canada.",andresen@sfu.ca,"Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019; Andresen, Martin A./ABD-3945-2020","Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076; Andresen, Martin/0000-0002-4767-7276",,,,,70,14,16,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The present research examined the opinions of a number of social groups (executive directors of municipalities, entrepreneurs and active members of society) concerning the understanding of innovative entrepreneurship, important support instruments for starting up innovative action and the readiness of the country's residents to accept the ongoing changes. An analysis of the information obtained shows that faster expansion of innovative action is hampered by insufficient information on the nature of smart specialisation and subsequently its role in promoting successful territorial development. Those who have started innovative action are interested in the existence of a support system for entrepreneurship, and the younger entrepreneurs are, the mote they are interested in receiving nonfinancial assistance, which highlights interconnection between scientific findings and entrepreneurship.

Creative errors and fraud in accounting have serious implications for the management of a company. It is shown that some managers and especially shareholders mistakenly and frequently cause unrealistic expectations of positive economic outcomes. It is necessary to investigate issues in terms of both accounting itself, as well as in terms of a complex context in concepts from various disciplines associated with management. This contribution is from the accounting point of view: a dual view; on the one hand the characteristics of trends in accounting (e.g. pentable, environmental accounting etc.) and then from the view of the evolution in the methods used to identify errors and fraud. As an illustration, the principle of the rapid test Q-DMFCA (Quick - Detection of Material Flow Cost Accounting or Quick- Detection Model of Fraud Creative Accounting) is given, which was created based on our own research [1; 2]. In addition, the contribution focuses on a comprehensive enumeration of those related scientific disciplines, which closely work together in implementing creative accounting in custody in the management of the enterprise. The result of the research confirms the hypothesis that it is necessary to simultaneously watch the development of accounting disciplines, which have their own life and can help monitor creative accounting (e.g. managerial, pental, behaviour and others) and of developing selected modern managerial disciplines or at least their selection. An overview of identification methods used in accounting fraud is made in this contribution. Methods of identifying fraud have been classified into groups according to the approach to resolving the issue. The Q-DMFCA model appears to be useful to the management of a company, for a simple orientation of controlling sales, materials and losses. Work is currently underway on a comprehensive connection between professional disciplines in relation to creative accounting. According to PRICEWATERHOUSE COOPERS [3] the majority of management (77 %) lose time and finances solving fraud.

The main thesis of the paper is that a higher level of dependence on oil exports for a country from the Gulf of Guinea region means a higher level of corruption and a lower level of political freedom in the society. The most important natural resource by far that is being exploited in the region is oil. So the pattern mentioned can be found in all of the states of the region that are dependent on oil exports. This is actually the real meaning of the term the curse of oil or the oil curse. A large proportion of the oil rents simply disappears through the corruptive behaviour of the political and military elites. Therefore, the overwhelming majority of the population in the countries of the Gulf of Guinea region spends their lives in poverty. Societies that exist in the Gulf of Guinea region states would be better off without the oil and that oil is the real curse of this region. The research of the human development index, the corruption perception index, and the degree of political freedoms and civil liberties, done on the countries from the Gulf of Guinea region, has shown that the main hypothesis is valid. Dependence on oil exports for a country from the Gulf of Guinea region means a propensity towards a higher level of corruption of the public sector and a lower level of political freedom and civil liberties in the society.","[Kurecic, Petar; Kozina, Goran] Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Lulic, Luksa] Zagreb Sch Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; luksa.lulic@vpsz.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,12,1,1,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,210,222,,,,,,13,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000021,0

Traditional findings show a negative impact of NR on growth due to social, economic and environmental factors. This adverse result can be neutralized if countries promote a better institutional quality, increase human capital and adopt an industrial structure more knowledge intensive. In this paper which seek to know the keys for growth in natural resource-driven countries under the lens of the knowledge economy perspective. We show new evidence that corroborate how a development path based on NR is plausible if it is integrated intangible factors into growth strategies. Cluster and data panel analyses allow us to identify the determinants of growth in specialized economies, along with a case study focused on Chile as a representative NRdriven country. This provides new clues extensible to other developing countries with an economic structure dominated by NR. The results confirm that there is a group of countries describing a successful growth trajectory based on primary industries while this path is grounded on innovation capabilities and institutional quality. The empirical study also reveals the essential role of openness and FDI as a channel to access foreign technologies and knowledge in these economies. The findings justify the design of a comprehensive framework for understanding the economic evolution of NR nations based on the strengths of intangibles without leaving their natural resource-intensive industries aside. The case of Chile also confirms the importance of intangibles for countries' growth and demonstrates that a weak innovation capability can block progress, despite the successful advance of openness, FDI, investments and NR exploitation.

Although they are associated with higher treatment costs, COX-2 inhibitors may simultaneously reduce costs associated with adverse events, hence, their overall economic benefit should be assessed. Objective: To evaluate the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of celecoxib versus ns-NSAIDs, with/without proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) co-therapy, for managing OA in Saudi Arabian subjects aged >= 65 years. Methods: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence health economic model from the UK, updated with relative risks of adverse events using CONDOR trial data, was adapted. Patients received celecoxib or ns-NSAIDs, with/without omeprazole. The effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient. The analysis was conducted from the patients perspective. Frequencies of resource use for adverse events were based on data collected in July 2012 from seven private hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to construct cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). Results: Over a 6-month treatment duration, QALYs gained per patient were higher with celecoxib (0.37) and celecoxib plus PPI (0.40) versus comparators. Ibuprofen plus PPI showed the lowest expected cost per patient (US$ 1,314.50 versus US$ 1,422.80 with celecoxib plus PPI and US$ 1,543.50 with celecoxib). Celecoxib plus PPI was the most cost-effective option with an ICER of US$ 1,805.00, followed by celecoxib (ICER, US$ 7,633.33) versus ibuprofen plus PPI. Over 2- and 5-year treatment durations, celecoxib plus PPI, and celecoxib, showed higher QALYs gained/patient and lower ICERs versus comparators. These ICERs are <1 gross domestic product/capita in Saudi Arabia in 2013 (US$ 25,961). CEACs over 6 months treatment showed a significantly higher likelihood that celecoxib plus PPI and celecoxib alone would be more cost effective versus comparators once the willingness to pay is over US$ 2,000.00. Conclusion: After considering new adverse event risks, celecoxib with/without PPI co-therapy was deemed very cost effective for medium- and long-term use in Saudi Arabian OA patients aged >= 65 years.","[Nasef, Sherif A.; Shaaban, A.

To inform policies aimed at increasing uptake of HIV testing, we identified characteristics associated with individuals' willingness-to-accept (WTA) an HIV test in a general population sample and among two high-risk populations in Moshi, Tanzania. Methods: In total, 721 individuals, including randomly selected community members (N = 402), female barworkers (N = 135), and male Kilimanjaro mountain porters (N = 184), were asked in a double-bounded contingent valuation format if they would test for HIV in exchange for 2000, 5000 or 10,000 Shillings (approximately $1.30, $3.20, and $6.40, respectively). The study was conducted between September 2012 and February 2013. Results: More than one quarter of participants (196; 27 %) stated they would be willing to test for Tanzania Shilling (TSH) 2000, whereas one in seven (98; 13.6 %) required more than TSH 10,000. The average WTA estimate was TSH 4564 (95 % Confidence Interval: TSH 4201 to 4927). Significant variation in WTA estimates by gender, HIV risk factors and other characteristics plausibly reflects variation in individuals' valuations of benefits of and barriers to testing. WTA estimates were higher among males than females. Among males, WTA was nearly one-third lower for those who reported symptoms of HIV than those who did not. Among females, WTA estimates varied with respondents' education, own and partners' HIV testing history, and lifetime reports of transactional sex. For both genders, the most significant association was observed with respondents' perception of the accuracy of the HIV test; those believing HIV tests to be completely accurate were willing to test for approximately one third less than their counterparts. The mean WTA estimates identified in this study suggest that within the study population, incentivized universal HIV testing could potentially identify undiagnosed HIV infections at an incentive cost of $ 150 per prevalent infection and $ 1400 per incident infection, with corresponding costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of $ 70 for prevalent and $ 620 for incident HIV infections. Conclusions: The results support the value of information about the accuracy of HIV testing, and suggest that relatively modest amounts of money may be sufficient to incentivize at-risk populations to test.","[Ostermann, Jan; Thielman, Nathan] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90392,310 Trent Dr, Durham, NC 27701 USA; [Ostermann, Jan; Brown, Derek S.; Muehlbacher, Axel] Duke Univ, Ctr Hlth Policy & Inequal Res, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Ostermann, Jan] Univ South Carolina, Arnold Sch Publ Hlth, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Brown, Derek S.] Washington Univ, Brown Sch, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Muehlbacher, Axel] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Inst Gesundheitsokonom & Med Management, Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Njau, Bernard] Kilimanjaro Christian Med Coll, Commun Hlth Dept, Moshi, Tanzania; [Thielman, Nathan] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Duke University; Duke University; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Washington University (WUSTL); Duke University,"Ostermann, J (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Box 90392,310 Trent Dr, Durham, NC 27701 USA.",jan.ostermann@duke.edu,"Thielman, Nathan/R-5142-2019; Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020; Ostermann, Jan/GQB-4743-2022; Brown, Derek S/J-3035-2013; Njau, Bernard/AAI-2152-2020","Thielman, Nathan/0000-0001-8152-2879; Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211; Brown, Derek S/0000-0001-9908-9882; Ostermann, Jan/0000-0002-8236-9500",National Institute of Mental Health [R21 MH096631]; Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR); NIH [5P30 AI064518]; NIAID NIH HHS [P30 AI064518] Funding Source: Medline; NIMH NIH HHS [R21 MH096631] Funding Source: Medline,National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR); NIH(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA); NIAID NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)); NIMH NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)),"This publication was made possible by Grant Number R21 MH096631 from the National Institute of Mental Health, and supported by the Duke University Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), an NIH funded program (5P30 AI064518).

This paper presents a decision-making process where the objective function is to maximize investor's expected utility over a finite time horizon, namely we consider a class of nonseparable multivariate utility functions. Features of utility functions already contain the information on investor's risk attitude thus basically no risk constraints are necessary. However, the solution cannot guarantee that the investor does not find herself in an undesirably risky position within the investment horizon. We therefore suggest a reformulation of the underlying problem by adding an extra constraint on an upper bound of risk premiums. The performance of the suggested model is demonstrated by optimizing the allocation of wealth at each time instance to two different assets one of which is assumed to be risk-free. The stochastic character of the problem is provided in the form of a scenario tree. Experiments are conducted to compare performance of the underlying formulation (considering no explicit constraints on the risk exposure) with the extended one (considering constraints on the risk exposure).","[Petrova, Barbora] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Petrová, B (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Prague, Czech Republic.",barbora.petrova@optipro.cz,,"Petrova, Barbora/0000-0002-1795-9037",,,,,11,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,635,640,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900109,0

This paper focuses mainly on the evaluation phase of the composite indicators construction. In the evaluation phase cyclical components of all the evaluated individual indicators are compared to the reference series. Their relationship can be described by several methods: the average lead (lag) time between the turning points, cross correlations and number of extra and missing cycles. The analyses therefore depends largely on the correct turning points tracking. This paper describes non-parametric (Bry-Boschan algorithm) and parametric (Markov switching model) approach to tracking the turning points. It applies these methods on several indicators of Czech business cycle and compares their performance. It shows that BryBoschan algorithm is more suitable for analyzing the short time series like those analyzed in this paper.","[Vrana, Lenka] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Vraná, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",lenka.vrana@vse.cz,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2099-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BF0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379396100027,0

Hence, it's interesting that how big private tutoring for AFAPS institute can manage and live for a long time until today with the increasing of competitors and various marketing campaign such as lower costs, and what are key elements that private tutoring for AFAPS institute had been provided to satisfy and attract customers. The objectives of the research were firstly to study business practices, problems and threats of private tutoring for AFAPS institute, secondly to study the satisfaction level of students taking service from private tutoring for AFAPS institutes, and lastly to propose appropriate business model of private tutoring for AFAPS. Interview and questionnaire survey were employed for data collection. Results of the research showed that the data from interview which could be separated into 3 aspects (Customer segment aspect, Key partnership aspect, Cost structure aspect.) There were some problems and threats that managers had recommended. In addintion, the data from questionnaire were satisfaction of customers in each aspect in 9 Building Blocks, depending on satisfaction to each level such as in channel aspect, customers gave importance to famous institute first because customers think that they can trust and ensure quality of institute. Direct experience from people who used to study in each institute was another channel to build new customers trustworthiness too. The institution was recommended to use marketing strategies that can easily attract customers such as internet and social network. The results from the research could be used in building business model, approach business management, shape efficient strategies, and the results can be beneficial to business owners and entrepreneurs who are interested in foreseeing overall private tutoring for AFAPS and establishing private tutoring for AFAPS institute.","[Wongvanakit, Ploy; Sookumarn, Suparerk; Apibunyopas, Preeyanuch] Kasetsart Univ, Witaya Patana Bldg 6th Fl,50 Phaholyothin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand",Kasetsart University,"Wongvanakit, P (通讯作者)，Kasetsart Univ, Witaya Patana Bldg 6th Fl,50 Phaholyothin Rd, Bangkok 10900, Thailand.",ppp_hudcha@hotmail.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1163,1178,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800113,0

While precarious employment generally increased after the crisis, this trend was driven more by poverty in the most deregulated labour markets and more by insecurity in the southern European countries.","[Gutierrez-Barbarrusa, Tomas] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Hist Inst, Madrid, Spain; [Gutierrez-Barbarrusa, Tomas] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Inst Econ, Madrid, Spain; [Gutierrez-Barbarrusa, Tomas] Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Moral Philosophy, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos,"Gutiérrez-Barbarrusa, T (通讯作者)，Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Hist Inst, Madrid, Spain.;Gutiérrez-Barbarrusa, T (通讯作者)，Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Inst Econ, Madrid, Spain.;Gutiérrez-Barbarrusa, T (通讯作者)，Rey Juan Carlos Univ, Moral Philosophy, Madrid, Spain.",tomas.gutierrez@urjc.es,"Gutierrez-Barbarrusa, Tomas/W-8639-2018","Gutierrez-Barbarrusa, Tomas/0000-0001-7537-8057",,,,,38,37,37,0,23,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

This paper applies the methods used to estimate price inflation to examine the causes of rising grades. We use rich data from a large public university to decompose the increase in average grades into those components explained by changes in student characteristics and course choices, and the unexplained component, which we refer to as inflation. About one-quarter of the increase in grades from 1982 to 2001 was driven by changes in the courses selected by students; enrollment shifted toward historically 'easier grading' departments over time, mechanically increasing average grades. An additional one-quarter of the increase is attributable to increases in the observable quality of students, such as average SAT scores. Less than half of the increase in average grades from 1982 to 2001 appears to arise from the unexplained factors, or inflation. These results add to the evidence suggesting that differences in relative grades across departments discourage students from studying in low-grading depai loients, like math, physics, or engineering.

I evaluate the effectiveness of this incentive scheme in improving student academic outcomes using a dataset covering over 460 California high schools over a 10-year period and their open/closed campus policies, while distinguishing between conditional and unconditional open campus policies. The results show an increase of roughly 0.1 of a standard deviation in student test scores when a conditional open campus policy is in place, in comparison to an unconditional open campus policy, thus suggesting that the incentive scheme intended by the conditional open campus policy is effective as a means for improving student test score outcomes. While the incentive scheme seems to improve test outcomes both for high and low-performing students, the magnitude of the effect is greater for lower-performing students, which is consistent with the fact that the academic thresholds under the conditional open campus policies are generally very minimal. The evidence also suggests that the incentive scheme is more effective for 9th and 10th grade students than it is for 11th grade students. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The area of anti-subsidy law is, however, largely exempt from scientific discussion. With respect to the use of alternative benchmark methodologies in the process of calculating the amount of subsidy, the relationship between general and China-specific legislation - Article 14 ASCM and Section 15 (b) CAP - is deemed satisfactorily provided for in China's Accession Protocol. But recent WTO Appellate Body jurisprudence allowing alternative benchmarking in general WTO anti-subsidy law has upset this relationship enormously - and then abandoned it. The expected surge of countervailing duties prompted by the 2016 expiry of alternative methodologies in Chinese WTO anti-dumping law will rather sooner than later confront WTO judiciary with the question: which is China's applicable anti-subsidy law on price comparability of today? This article contributes to answering this question by bringing together Section 15 (b) CAP and Article 14 ASCM and tracing the applicable legal framework. Comparing both provisions in their present shapes also touches upon another issue: is the reluctance to invoke Section 15 (b) CAP still justified?","[Mueller, Sophia] Univ Passau, Passau, Germany",University of Passau,"Mueller, S (通讯作者)，Univ Passau, Passau, Germany.",sophia.mueller@uni-passau.de,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,2,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

To minimize abusive uses of such measures, it is necessary to have a clear picture of applicable SPS requirements and regulations. From a policy-oriented perspective, the paper examines ASEAN's contributions to the promotion of transparency in agri-food trade under the World Trade Organization (WTO) regime and clarifies problems likely to cause regulatory protectionism. Considering the current trend of cooperation, it also reviews SPS-related transparency provisions in free trade agreements (FTAs), before suggesting that ASEAN's decision-makers have a closer look at the Japanese FTA model for inspiration, with a view to establishing provisions having non-discriminatory effects on third parties in their future agreements.","[Wongkaew, Thitirat] Minist Foreign Affairs, Dept ASEAN Affairs, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha, Thailand",,"Wongkaew, T (通讯作者)，Minist Foreign Affairs, Dept ASEAN Affairs, Khet Ratchathewi, Krung Thep Maha, Thailand.",thitirat.wongkaew@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This meant linking concepts from different disciplines, without transforming it in a new discipline. In order to support the proposition for the new method, a study case is presented, the framework for the biodiesel scenarios in Brazil, by 2030. An in-depth interview was used to test the proposition of having the sustainability dimensions as driving forces. The result was the identification of a critical uncertainty composed of various aspects related the response to climate change and environmental conservation. The scenario storylines that were developed based on the critical uncertainties showed that sustainable options for the future are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual. The results show that the scenarios storylines go through social, environmental and economic aspects, supported by other aspects like the territorial and political. Also it showed that sustainable options are possible if the mental maps are enlarged to see beyond the business as usual. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Empirical literature shows that even the most sophisticated risk equalization models-with advanced morbidity adjusters-substantially undercompensate insurers for selected groups of high-risk individuals. In the presence of premium regulation, these undercompensations confront consumers and insurers with incentives for risk selection. An important reason for the undercompensations is that not all information with predictive value regarding healthcare expenses is appropriate for use as a morbidity adjuster. To reduce incentives for selection regarding specific groups we propose overpaying morbidity adjusters that are already included in the risk equalization model. This paper illustrates the idea of overpaying by merging data on morbidity adjusters and healthcare expenses with health survey information, and derives three preconditions for meaningful application. Given these preconditions, we think overpaying may be particularly useful for pharmacy-based cost groups.","[van Kleef, R. C.; van Vliet, R. C. J. A.; van de Ven, W. P. M.

We first prove that the Nash bargaining game yields a unique equilibrium log supply contract, at which the negotiation takes only place on the prices. We then find that the expected profit-maximizing is achieved when the supplier's public interest and the manufacturer's bargaining power are strategic substitutes. The renegotiation reveals the presence of a memory effect over the quantities issued from bargaining.

Often, scenarios are utilized to quantify and contrast the potential impacts of anthropocentric or climatic drivers of change on ecosystem services. One freely available modeling suite, Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST), from the Natural Capital Project, aims to aid in decision making and planning processes by quantifying ecosystem services in spatially explicit context. Several of their modeling tools require land cover data layers, and the user can generate future land cover data layers through the scenario generator tool, released in 2014. The tool's associated literature emphasizes the integration of stakeholders into the scenario generating process to help create plausible and relevant scenarios, often through workshops. Our study reviews the tool and presents an alternative methodology for engaging expert stakeholders in the scenario generation process through a less time intensive format than the recommended workshops-a detailed questionnaire. We find that there is a need for systematic decision making analysis of stakeholder input before scenarios can be created, and we used cumulative percent frequency analysis of questionnaire responses to dictate scenario generation transition tables, when appropriate. We conclude that using a questionnaire to elicit input from expert stakeholders to develop land cover scenarios may be a time and cost effective alternative that still provides realistic and usable inputs when compared to workshops.

Using the zero-inflated negative binomial model, we found no significant effect from the abolition of user charges on doctor visits, suggesting either that user charges are ineffective in the Czech environment or that their value was set too low.

Yet the Appellate Body has formally rejected both elements, and in the surprising 2014 outcome of EC-Seal Products, under the key provision GATT Article III(4), the latter was simply denied. This obfuscation leads to implicit and explicit conflation of these elements. In some disputes, qualitative findings about the existence and nature of competitive relationships are presented using the language of quantitative market analysis. In others, compelling policy objectives shape the outcome of a supposedly market-based analysis. This article proposes an approach that synthesizes two strands of scholarship, advocating more rigorous use of market-based evidence and stronger analysis of policy rationale.

The 'consensus model' has its underpinning 'rules of the game'; without which collaborative outcomes may end up being conflictual and counter-productive. Adopting a critical stage review, this paper draws mainly from theoretical and recent empirical literature to unpack the factors that catalyse successful collaborative natural resource governance. We reflect on these to design an 'ABC framework' aimed at providing signpost to agencies, governments and conveners of collaboration on how to execute this socio-technical process to maximise value. The framework hinges on three broad pillars: Adopting and advancing human skills, Building integrity and legitimacy and Creating a sense of attachment to the resource in question. We discuss these with specific indicators synchronized from recent natural resources collaboration experiences in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Since prioritization implies distributional effects, decisions regarding respective rules should take citizens' preferences into account. In this study we concentrate on two distributive issues in the German health system: firstly, we analyze the acceptance of prioritizing decisions concerning the treatment of certain patient groups, in this case patients who all need a heart operation. We focus on the patient criteria smoking behavior, age and whether the patient has or does not have young children. Secondly, we investigate Germans' opinions towards income-dependent health services. The results reveal the strong effects of individuals' attitudes regarding general aspects of the health system on priorities, e.g. that individuals with an unhealthy lifestyle should not be prioritized. In addition, experience of limited access to health services is found to have a strong influence on citizens' attitudes, too. Finally, decisions on different prioritization criteria are found to be not independent.","[Ahlert, Marlies] Univ Halle Wittenberg, Dept Econ Microecon & Publ Finance, D-06108 Halle, Saale, Germany; [Pfarr, Christian] Univ Bayreuth, Inst Publ Finance, Dept Law & Econ, Bayreuth, Germany",Martin Luther University Halle Wittenberg; University of Bayreuth,"Pfarr, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bayreuth, Inst Publ Finance, Dept Law & Econ, Bayreuth, Germany.",marlies.ahlert@wiwi.uni-halle.de; christian.pfarr@uni-bayreuth.de,,,,,,,31,3,4,2,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In a randomized controlled trial conducted in Dutch hospital wards, cardiac patients who smoked prior to admission were allocated to usual care (n = 245), telephone counseling (n = 223) or face-to-face counseling (n = 157). The counseling interventions lasted for 3 months and were complemented by nicotine patches. Baseline histories were obtained, and interviews took place 6 months after hospitalization to assess self-reported smoking status and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quitter and cost-utility ratios per QALY were calculated and presented in acceptability curves. Uncertainty was accounted for by sensitivity analysis. Using continued abstinence as the outcome measure showed that telephone counseling had the highest probability of being cost-effective. Face-to-to-face counseling was also more cost-effective than usual care. No significant improvements and differences in QALYs between the three conditions were found. Varying costs and effect estimations revealed that the results of the primary analyses were robust. Assuming a willingness-to-pay of a,not sign20,000 per abstinent patient, telephone counseling would be a highly cost-effective smoking cessation intervention assisting cardiac patients to quit. However, the lack of consensus concerning the willingness-to-pay per quitter impedes drawing firm conclusions. Moreover, studies with extended follow-up periods are needed to capture late relapses and possible differences in QALYs.","[Berndt, Nadine; Bolman, Catherine; Lechner, Lilian; Mudde, Aart] Open Univ Netherlands, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, POB 2960, NL-6401 DL Heerlen, Netherlands; [Berndt, Nadine] Govt Grand Duche Luxembourg, Inspect Gen Secur Sociale, Cellule Expertise Med, POB 1308, L-1013 Luxembourg, Luxembourg; [Max, Wendy] Univ Calif San Francisco, Dept Social & Behav Sci, Inst Hlth & Aging, 3333 Calif St,Suite 340, San Francisco, CA 94118 USA; [de Vries, Hein] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Promot, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Evers, Silvia] Maastricht Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Primary Care CAPHRI, Dept Hlth Serv Res, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Evers, Silvia] Netherlands Inst Mental Hlth & Addict, Trimbos Inst, Dept Publ Mental Hlth, POB 725, NL-3500 AS Utrecht, Netherlands",Open University Netherlands; University of California System; University of California San Francisco; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Trimbos Institute,"Berndt, N (通讯作者)，Govt Grand Duche Luxembourg, Inspect Gen Secur Sociale, Cellule Expertise Med, POB 1308, L-1013 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",nadine.berndt@igss.etat.lu,"Evers, Silvia/ABG-2128-2020","Evers, Silvia/0000-0003-1026-570X; Lechner, Lilian/0000-0002-5160-7086","ZonMw, the Dutch Organisation for Health Research and Development [50-50110-96-524]","ZonMw, the Dutch Organisation for Health Research and Development","This project was financed by ZonMw, the Dutch Organisation for Health Research and Development (grant number: 50-50110-96-524).

In accord with its China-Raw Materials decision, the Appellate Body found that there is no textual basis for the application of the Article XX exception to China's export duty obligations. This interpretation exalted a narrow contextual approach over an approach to interpretation that would focus on broader context, object, and purpose. The Appellate Body also approved the Panel's overall approach to determining the availability of the Article XX(g) exception. This approach focused on the design and structure of China's quota measure, but left unresolved important issues, including the extent to which non-conservation purposes may prevent use of the exception and the role of empirical evidence of effects in these determinations. While the Appellate Body found that there is no 'even-handedness' requirement in Article XX(g) itself, we argue that the chapeau's requirement of nondiscrimination is an appropriate additional criterion for determining whether a policy with a target of reducing extraction of a natural resource satisfies the requirements of Article XX.","[Bond, Eric W.] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Trachtman, Joel] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Vanderbilt University; Tufts University,"Bond, EW (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Trachtman, J (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch Law & Diplomacy, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",eric.w.bond@vanderbilt.edu; joel.trachtman@tufts.edu,"Trachtman, Joel/AAN-8482-2020",,,,,,10,14,16,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2016,15,2.0,,,,,189,209,,10.1017/S1474745615000695,0.0,,,21,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GM,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372461000002,0

We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with haemophilia from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain Sweden and the UK. Data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilisation, informal care, loss of labour productivity and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The costs have been estimated from a societal perspective adopting a bottom-up approach. A total of 401 questionnaires were included in the study, of which 339 were collected from patients with haemophilia and 62 from caregivers. The lowest average annual cost per person was reported in Bulgaria (a,not sign6,660) and the highest in Germany (a,not sign194,490). Our results demonstrate both a large difference from country to country in the average annual cost per patient in 2012 and the driving role of drugs in costs. Drugs represent nearly 90 % of direct healthcare costs in a majority of the countries analysed (Hungary, Italy, Spain and Germany). In Bulgaria, France and Sweden, however, healthcare services (visits, tests and hospitalisations) prevail. Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. The mean EQ-5D index score for adult patients was 0.69 and mean EQ-5D VAS was 66.6. The mean EQ-5D index score for carers was 0.87 and mean EQ-5D VAS was 75.5. In the disability score, 60 % showed no disability and measuring caregiver burden with the Zarit Index produced an overall mean score of 25.3. We have shown that haemophilia is associated with a substantial economic burden and impaired HRQOL. Studies on cost of illness and HRQOL are important for haemophilia as the future of this disease is likely to change with the development of new innovative treatments. The introduction of these treatments will most likely impact future costs related to haemophilia.","[Cavazza, Marianna; Armeni, Patrizio; Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Kodra, Yllka; De Santis, Marta; Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist Superiore SanitA ISS, Rome, Italy; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Red Investigacin Servicios Sanitarios Enfermedade, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Fundacin Canaria Investigacin Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Palmas Gran Canaria, Madrid, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv, Canary Islands Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de La Palma, CA, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] SpainRDR CIBERER, Inst Rare Dis Res, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Aldo & Cele Dacc Clin Res Ctr Rare Dis, Ranica Bergamo, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Gulacsi, Laszlo] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Schulenburg, Johann Matthias Graf von der] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Hannover, NH, Germany; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy & LSE Hlth, London, England; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Paris, France; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Iskrov, Georgi] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, U1123, Paris, France",Bocconi University; Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS; Corvinus University Budapest; Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Medical University Plovdiv; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite,"Cavazza, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",marianna.cavazza@unibocconi.it,"Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015; DE SANTIS, MARTA/A-6650-2015","Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746; ARMENI, PATRIZIO/0000-0003-3150-3332; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252; CAVAZZA, MARIANNA/0000-0001-5609-6804; DE SANTIS, MARTA/0000-0002-9516-1901; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110",Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which received funding from the European Union within the framework of the Health Programme (grant A101205).

We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with SSc (involving both localised and systemic sclerosis) from Germany, Italy, Spain, France, the UK, Hungary and Sweden. Data on demographic characteristics, healthcare resource utilisation, informal care, labour productivity losses and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A total of 589 patients completed the questionnaire. The rate of patients with localised scleroderma, limited cutan and diffuse cutan SSc were 28, 68 and 4 %, respectively. Average annual costs varied from country to country and ranged from a,not sign 4607 to a,not sign 30,797 (reference year: 2012). Estimated direct healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 1413 to a,not sign 17,300; direct non-healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 1875 to a,not sign 4684 and labour productivity losses ranged from a,not sign 1701 to a,not sign 14,444. The mean EQ-5D index score for adult SSc patients varied from 0.49 to 0.75 and the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale score was between 58.72 and 65.86. The main strengths of this study lie in our bottom-up approach to costing and our evaluation of SSs patients from a broad societal perspective. This type of analysis is very unusual in the international literature on rare diseases in comparison with other illnesses. We concluded that SSc patients incur considerable societal costs and experience substantial deterioration in HRQOL.","[Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Red Investigacin Servicios Sanitarios Enfermedade, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Fundacin Canaria Investigacin Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv, Canary Islands Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de La Palma, CA, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] SpainRDR & CIBERER, Inst Investigacin Enfermedades Raras IIER, Madrid, Spain; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Hlth & Social Care Res Ctr, London, England; [Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist Superiore SanitA ISS, Rome, Italy; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Centro Ric Cliniche Malattie Rare Aldo Cele Dacc, Ist Ric Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Ranica Bergamo, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Iskrov, Georgi] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Pentek, Marta] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Delgado, Claudia] Federacin Espaola Enfermedades Raras FEDER, Madrid, Spain; [von der Schulenburg, Johann Mathias] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH Inst Risk & Insu, Hannover, Germany; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, F-U1123 Paris, France; [Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Milan, Italy",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto de Investigacion de Enfermedades Raras (IIER); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Medical University Plovdiv; Corvinus University Budapest; Leibniz University Hannover; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Bocconi University,"López-Bastida, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain.",julio.lopezbastida@uclm.es,"Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015","Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X",Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which received funding from the European Union within the framework of the Health Programme [grant A101205].

Along with addressing a number of legal issues concerning CVD investigations, the Appellate Body clarified restrictions on cross-cumulation of injury, essentially prohibiting the current US practice, and implicitly raising the burden of proof for parallel claims of dumping and subsidies. This decision is justified on economic grounds, where cumulation imposes a counterfactual scenario against which marginal damages of dumping and subsidies by each country cannot be properly evaluated. However, what the legal rulings by the Appellate Body did not recognize is the economic reality that many like products produced by the firms alleged to have received subsidies were selectively absent from the investigation, which more generally complicates the assessment of injury in dumping and subsidy cases.","[Spearot, Alan] Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA; [Ahn, Dukgeun] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea",University of California System; University of California Santa Cruz; Seoul National University (SNU),"Spearot, A (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA 95064 USA.;Ahn, D (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul 151, South Korea.",acspearot@gmail.com; dahn@snu.ac.kr,,"Spearot, Alan/0000-0001-7429-3780",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [NRF 2014S1A3A2043505]; Seoul National University Asia Center [SNUAC-2014-007],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant(National Research Foundation of Korea); Seoul National University Asia Center,"We are very grateful to excellent research assistance by Kyounghwa Kim and Ji Yeong Yoo at Seoul National University and the financial support from the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant (NRF 2014S1A3A2043505) as well as Seoul National University Asia Center (SNUAC-2014-007).

Methods and results A Markov model was constructed with a lifetime horizon to compare costs and health outcomes between IVUS-guided PCI and PCI guided solely by angiography from an Italian healthcare payer perspective. The population examined included CAD patients undergoing PCI with DES. From a healthcare payer perspective, the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year was negative in the base-case scenario (i.e., IVUS benefit assumed to persist beyond the first year). When IVUS benefit was assumed to be limited to the first year, the ICER increased to (sic)9,624. This conclusion remained consistent even when scenarios varied regarding the duration of the device's effect. Furthermore, benefits of using IVUS were greater for patients with acute coronary syndrome, renal insufficiency, and diabetes. Conclusions Using IVUS with angiography is a dominant strategy in Italy, and results demonstrate that it is desirable to target those at a greater risk of restenosis (i.e., patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and acute coronary syndrome), who tend to benefit more from accurate stent implantation. Further information is necessary regarding the long-term benefits of IVUS, however sensitivity analysis presented in this research demonstrates a strong argument supporting the cost-effectiveness of IVUS.","[Alberti, Alessandro] Ist Clin St Ambrogio, Milan, Italy; [Giudice, Pietro] San Giovanni Di Dio & Ruggi DAragona Univ Hosp, Salerno, Italy; [Gelera, Alessandra; Stefanini, Luca] Boston Sci, Milan, Italy; [Priest, Virginia] Boston Sci, Singapore, Singapore; [Simmonds, Michael] Boston Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Lee, Christa; Wasserman, Matthew] Double Helix Consulting, London, England",,"Wasserman, M (通讯作者)，Double Helix Consulting, London, England.",Matthew.wasserman@dhelix.com,,"Wasserman, Matthew/0000-0003-3300-2742",Boston Scientific,Boston Scientific(Boston Scientific),Dr. Alessandro Alberti received consulting fees from Boston Scientific.

This asymmetry is unlikely to have been driven by differences in recipients' characteristics. We marshal evidence suggesting that the framing of the scholarships might have led to different impacts.

By weighting the forest productivity with factors of future climate change effects, we compute the optimal tree species mixes, within reach of forest managers, in ninety French administrative departments. Considering three different productivity measures (wood production, carbon sequestration and economic valorization) and their respective variances, we find that: a) the empirical allocation lies between the optimizations of wood production and economic valorization; b) forest managers prefer low variance to high productivity, i.e. their revealed risk aversion is high; and c) unlike maximizing wood productivity or carbon sequestration, which leads to similar portfolios, maximizing the economic value of wood production decreases both the levels of wood production and carbon sequestration. Under high risk aversion, the economic valorization would lead to a high species specialization, which is very unlikely in reality. In all considered scenarios, the objectives set out in the Kyoto Protocol would be attained, which puts into question its relevance in terms of additionality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Annie's Project New Jersey is based on a nationally-acclaimed educational program dedicated to strengthening women's roles in the everevolving agricultural sector. While Annie's Project originated in the mid-west where agronomic crops are the primary agricultural crops, New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the US with higher land and labor costs and more regulations than other states. On the flip side, the state's comparative advantage over other states is that it has a higher percentage of high-income consumers and close proximity to them. Thus, successful farmers in New Jersey are often horticultural producers and many are direct marketers; they need to produce high value crops and products to succeed. With New Jersey farmers working in such a competitive environment, the project team decided to require every program participant to complete a business plan. Inspired by the early success of Annie's Project New Jersey, Rutgers University partnered with Akdeniz University in Antalya, Turkey, to develop Suzanne's Project in the Antalya province of Turkey. This project provides specialized training in business management, computer skills, and best management production practices to help Turkish women who operate small vegetable greenhouses and citrus orchards pursue opportunities to improve their farm businesses by creating a business plan throughout the course. Lessons learned from each program have been used to improve the other while adapting to local conditions.","[Brumfield, R. G.; Carleo, J.; Komar, S.

In today's era of technologies, information is the main driving force of business. It is necessary for every enterprise in every field of activity. Operators must be prepared to realise their own needs in order to be able to choose as exactly as possible what would be most optimal and rational for them within the great diversity of information. Tasks of the study were to explore the factors affecting the flow of internal information in Latvian organisations in order to raise internal awareness. The research was undertaken in the form of in-depth interview about the process of internal communication in Latvian companies (N=32). When studying the organisation's internal information flow, not only the level of employees' satisfaction with exchange of information should be identified. It is much more important to identify what content managers transfer to employees, in what way they do it, and what the employees' understanding of the critical issues for the company is like. Previous studies have identified that information flow is tightly linked with the people involved and the company culture. Each organisational activity is based on internal communication processes. It is very important to follow these processes and to evaluate not only their quality, but also their quantity, because it affects employees' awareness. As shown by the survey results, efficiency of the company's internal communication depends on a variety of factors. It is very essential how representatives of the senior management communicate with medium level managers, while medium level managers - with junior level managers. Internal awareness affects employees' job satisfaction and the organisation as a whole. However, the survey results revealed that an excessively large amount of information can interfere with the execution of tasks and divert from reaching the previously set target. The major contribution of this paper is an exposition on practices for raising the flow of information. Internal awareness is the basis of the company's internal cooperation and a determining factor under the circumstances of growing competition.","[Cekuls, Andrejs] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Cekuls, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Cekuls, Andrejs/V-2423-2018","Cekuls, Andrejs/0000-0003-3696-818X",,,,,9,0,0,2,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,467,473,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100061,0

This study analyses the role of business simulation in the development of these skills and competences in the teaching/learning process in the master's courses at the Faculty of Business and Management, Brno University of Technology. The authors propose a set of activities that can be overlaid on a business simulation to enhance the learning experience. They are analysing links between different variables in the process of evaluation a students' performance. The data are obtained from both simulation itself (comparison of 50 student's teams) and from students' feedback (195 questionnaires) covering the whole students' cohort from this academic year. The analyses characterize also the differences in performance of two different study programmes, identifying the influence of different study background of particular students' cohorts. Arithmetic mean method is used to identify which skills and competences are perceived by participants of the courses as crucial for their entrepreneurship education. Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated to investigate if there are statistically significant differences in performance between two study programmes. Mann-Whitney U method is used to test the hypotheses. Data sets were processed in the software IBM SPSS 22 Statistics. Obtained data suggest that the enhanced simulation-based teaching/learning approach provided a valuable platform for achieving the learning outcomes. The value for marketing educators consists of the fact, that the proposed teaching/learning approaches can be used in a wide spectrum of business simulation, thereby providing more guidance to students and instructors alike.","[Chalupsky, Vladimir; Schueller, David; Chlebovsky, Vit] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Chalupsky, V (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,183,188,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200024,0

Additionally, considering that only half of the newly created arteriovenous fistula are well-developed and even a smaller number is free of related complications, there is an increased interest in achieving a suitable vascular access. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to create a computational model to monitor hemodialysed patients and to predict arteriovenous fistula evolution. The research included 52 newly initiated hemodialysed patients on central venous catheter or arteriovenous fistula, followed along I year. The statistically analyzed data and also the described artificial neural models related to this particular category of individuals emphasized a correlation between various bioumoral factors, such as hemoglobin, creatinine, urea, uric acid, serum albumin, erythrocytes sedimentation rate, serum iron, and the future growth rate of the vein diameter, implicated in creating a patency fistula. Although the findings were promising, more complex researches are needed in the future designed to take into account several other aspects related to the underlying pathology or to the dialysis procedure itself and to study a larger number of hemodialysis patients to be followed for a longer period long.","[Checherita, Ionel Alexandru; Peride, Ileana; Niculae, Andrei] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm Bucharest, Clin Dept 3, Bucharest, Romania; [Checherita, Ionel Alexandru; Peride, Ileana; Niculae, Andrei; Balcangiu-Stroescu, Andra Elena] St John Emergency Clin Hosp Bucharest, Dept Nephrol & Dialysis, Bucharest, Romania; [Radoiu, Bogdan] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Mech Ind & Maritime Engn, Dept Naval Engn, Constanta, Romania; [Petcu, Lucian Cristsian] Ovidius Univ Constanta, Fac Med Dent, Dept Biostat & Biophys, Constanta, Romania; [Constantin, Alexandra Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Econ Cybernet & Stat Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania; [Sinescu, Ruxandra Diana] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm Bucharest, Clin Dept 11, Bucharest, Romania; [Sinescu, Ruxandra Diana] Elias Emergency Univ Hosp Bucharest, Dept Plast Surg & Reconstruct Microsurg, Bucharest, Romania",Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Ovidius University; Ovidius University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Peride, I (通讯作者)，Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm Bucharest, Clin Dept 3, Bucharest, Romania.;Peride, I (通讯作者)，St John Emergency Clin Hosp Bucharest, Dept Nephrol & Dialysis, Bucharest, Romania.",al.checherita@gmail.com; ileana_peride@yahoo.com; niculaeandrei@yahoo.com; stroescu_andra@yahoo.ro; rvbogdan@univ-ovidius.ro; petculucian@univ-ovidius.ro; alexandra_maria2388@yahoo.com; ruxandrasinescu@gmail.com,"Petcu, Lucian Cristian/AAE-4100-2022; Balcangiu-Stroescu, Andra Elena/AAL-8899-2020; Checherita, Ionel Alexandru/AAX-6544-2021; Sinescu, Ruxandra/ABD-2479-2020; peride, ileana/G-6503-2014","Checherita, Ionel Alexandru/0000-0002-9741-5530; Sinescu, Ruxandra Diana/0000-0002-7591-0987",Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) from the European Social Fund; Romanian Government [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137390],Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) from the European Social Fund; Romanian Government(Romanian Government),"This paper is supported by the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD), financed from the European Social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the contract number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137390.",,25,2,2,1,10,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We've built a simple experiment in which we asked participants - students of law (N = 15) to categorize 17 objects displayed on the photographs. The subjects were instructed to categorize objects for the purpose of tax law classification, resulting with the assessment of a proper tax rate. The results are presented from the perspective of the rule-based categorization theory. In our study we use an eye-tracker (SensoMotoric Instruments, model RED 250 Hz) to record the movements of eyeballs, and to check whether the eye-tracking parameters such as; the number of fixations, regressions from the picture of the object in determined areas of interest. The experiment revealed differences in eye movement patterns, reactions times when participants evaluated 'easy' and 'hard' objects. The purpose of this paper is thus relatively modest. The major research question is descriptive rather than normative. The study concentrates on the possibility and cognitive effectiveness of nudging in a very narrow field of legislative design rather than on the debate on the normative implications of this strategy. However we believe that this contribution on descriptive aspects of cognitive processes presupposes the debate on the legitimacy of nudging from the wider normative, legal and moral perspective.","[Golecki, Mariusz J.] Univ Lodz, Fac Law & Adm, Dept Legal Theory & Philosophy Law, PL-90232 Lodz, Poland; [Romanowicz, Marcin] Univ Warsaw, Fac Law & Adm, PL-00927 Warsaw, Poland; [Wojciechowski, Jerzy W.] Univ Warsaw, Fac Psychol, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland",University of Lodz; University of Warsaw; University of Warsaw,"Golecki, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Fac Law & Adm, Dept Legal Theory & Philosophy Law, PL-90232 Lodz, Poland.",mjgolecki76@gmail.com; m.romanowicz@wp.pl; j.w.wojciechowski@gmail.com,,,,,,,47,3,3,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,289,313,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_15,0.0,,,25,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500016,0

The optimal utilization of quotas is thus dependent on development of an efficient quota market, but markets in multispecies IFQ fisheries develop slowly and may fail to perform efficiently even after several years. In 2011 an IFQ system was implemented for the Pacific groundfish trawl fishery in the US. After four years, the quota market does not appear to be yielding efficient prices for many species or distributing quota efficiently. I explore the structure and performance of the QP market and discuss the impediments to market efficiency. Drawing from theory and experience in other multi species IFQ systems, I discuss other quota distribution and catch-balancing mechanisms that can supplement and perhaps improve inefficient markets and enable higher quota utilization rates.","[Holland, Daniel S.] NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Holland, DS (通讯作者)，NOAA, Conservat Biol Div, Northwest Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS, 2725 Montlake Blvd E, Seattle, WA 98112 USA.",dan.holland@noaa.gov,,,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),Funding for this work was provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.,,17,19,20,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

Given that most programme modules are delivered by lectures, there is general consensus that student learning is primarily passive. Similarly, module assessment tends to be summative. Thus, student-centred learning to foster an environment for active learning and encourage greater student class participation was introduced into a horticulture module (Nursery Production and Management, HORT 40090). Similarly, formative assessment methods were also introduced. To this end, a segment of the above module relating to vegetative plant propagation was selected. The students were asked to work in self-selected groups to thoroughly research the different aspects of the topic and to prepare a short PowerPoint slide presentation for delivery to the class. Additionally, they were required to peer assess each presentation and to agree a suitable grade with staff members in attendance. It is considered that the introduction of active learning and formative assessment to the module resulted in more meaningful learning for the students concerned and moved them higher up the student-centred learning curve towards more, responsibility and accountability. The concept is being gradually rolled out to other modules.","[Hunter, A.] Univ Coll Dublin, Agr & Food Sci Ctr, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland; [Elliott-Kingston, C.] Univ Coll Dublin, Sci Ctr West, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin; University College Dublin,"Hunter, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Agr & Food Sci Ctr, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Dublin 4, Ireland.",,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-36-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1126,,,,,,127,133,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1126.16,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BI1PC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406635200015,0

By changing personal food consumption patterns, it is possible for consumers to reduce their individual GHG-emissions. Common recommendations concerning climate-friendly food choices are e.g. to eat seasonal or local fruit and vegetables or to avoid waste. The aim of this research is to analyze how competent German consumers feel regarding these climate-friendly behavioral strategies and to investigate what measures could help consumers to make more climate-friendly food choices. We use data from a focus group workshop as well as from a quantitative study based on 413 computer-assisted personal interviews with supermarket consumers conducted in 2014 in Southern Germany. The predominantly female interviewees of this study state a high knowledge regarding waste reduction and the growing season of different produce. However, it is not as easy for them to recognize produce imported by plane or locally-produced fruits and vegetables. The results of a hierarchical cluster analysis (ward method) reveal three different consumer segments differing in their perceived competency regarding different climate-friendly strategies. We find differences in socio-demographic and behavioral variables between the three clusters. The focus group workshop and the quantitative study show that consumers evaluate a carbon label to be more suitable to support climate-friendly food choices than other instruments (e.g. QR-Codes, general guidelines). The preference for specific measures differs between socio-demographic groups, but not between the identified consumer segments. Our results show that a substantial part of consumers perceives a low to medium competency of specific climate-friendly food consumption instruments and thus needs some support regarding this issue. Some suitable supporting strategies are discussed at the end of the manuscript.","[Klein, A.; Menrad, K.] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Straubing Ctr Sci, Chair Mkt & Management Biogen Resources, Straubing, Germany",,"Klein, A (通讯作者)，Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Straubing Ctr Sci, Chair Mkt & Management Biogen Resources, Straubing, Germany.",,,"Emberg, Agnes/0000-0001-6620-5162; Menrad, Klaus/0000-0003-1079-1056",,,,,9,3,3,0,20,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,183,190,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.25,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400025,0

The share of organic production is only 2% of the vegetable cultivation area, and the typical organic vegetable cultivation area per farm is very small, at only 0.5 ha. Other organic agriculture sectors have started to grow, however, due to increasing appreciation of organic food and a general positive attitude towards organic production. The study focused on carrot and onion as the most important organic vegetables. The reasons for the underdeveloped organic vegetable sector were found to be problems with cultivation techniques, storage losses, low profitability, low state of upgrading, small production units, and problems with delivery. The most serious of these is the occasional high storage loss. In some years, as much as 50% of organic onion yield is spoiled during storage. Carrot is not subject to such severe storage losses, but is affected by a lack of proper weed control and high manpower hours per ha, factors that lead to low profitability. The majority of organic onion and carrot yield is sold as raw material, having been simply washed and packed. This makes it difficult for the catering sector to use organic products, even if they wanted to. The catering sector would require at the least a peeled product, which are not available. Small production units also lead to scale inefficiencies, due to the cost of machinery and buildings. Moreover, small production units can lead to delivery problems, with yields being too small to serve the retail sector. Consequently, small producers have to find other delivery channels, which can be challenging.","[Koivisto, A.; Mattila, T.; Kivijarvi, P.] Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland; [Iivonen, S.; Vaisanen, H. -M.] Univ Helsinki, Ruralia Inst, Lonnrotinkatu 7, FI-50100 Mikkeli, Finland",Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke); University of Helsinki,"Koivisto, A (通讯作者)，Nat Resources Inst Finland Luke, Latokartanonkaari 9, FI-00790 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Mattila, Tiina/0000-0001-5112-6824",,,,,11,2,2,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,147,153,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.20,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400020,0

More precisely, basket option prices are determined by replacing the distribution of the real basket with an appropriate approximation. For the approximate basket we determine the underlying characteristic function and hence we can derive the related basket option prices by using the Carr-Madan formula. We consider a three-moments-matching method. Numerical examples illustrate the accuracy of our approximations; several Levy models are calibrated to market data and basket option prices are determined. In the last part we show how our newly designed basket option pricing formula can be used to define implied Levy correlation by matching model and market prices for basket options. Our main finding is that the implied Levy correlation smile is flatter than its Gaussian counterpart. Furthermore, if (near) at-the-money option prices are used, the corresponding implied Gaussian correlation estimate is a good proxy for the implied Levy correlation.","[Linders, Daniel] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Schoutens, Wim] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Sci, Celestijnenlaan 200, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",KU Leuven; KU Leuven,"Linders, D (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Fac Business & Econ, Naamsestr 69, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",daniel.linders@kuleuven.be; Wim@Schoutens.be,"Linders, Daniel/M-3241-2014; Linders, Daniel/GRE-9792-2022","Linders, Daniel/0000-0003-4206-2149",Onderzoeksfonds KU Leuven [GOA/13/002]; AXA Research Fund (Measuring and managing herd behavior risk in stock markets),Onderzoeksfonds KU Leuven(KU Leuven); AXA Research Fund (Measuring and managing herd behavior risk in stock markets)(AXA Research Fund),"The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Onderzoeksfonds KU Leuven (GOA/13/002: Management of Financial and Actuarial Risks: Modeling, Regulation, Disclosure and Market Effects).

So it is important as well to analyze satisfaction of the customers. Article is based on the relationship between the customer's satisfaction and the financial performance of the food producing enterprise. It is assumed that there is relationship which can be identified and used by the managers in the future to promote financial results of the enterprise. Thus the purpose of the article is to identify and analyze relationship between the customer's satisfaction and the financial performance of the food producing enterprise. According to literature review there were made proposition about the analyzed relationship between the customer's satisfaction and the financial performance of the enterprise. There was questionnaire survey conducted to get the information about customer's satisfaction. Survey was realized during the year 2014 and 2015 and there were almost 18 000 responds about the products of more than 300 food producing enterprises. The information about the customer's satisfaction and the enterprise financial performance was analyzed through the analysis of correlation and linear regression model. The main goal was to identify if there are differences between the enterprises with the better financial performance and better results in customer satisfaction and the rest of enterprises. The research of the customers satisfaction connected with the financial performance of the food producing enterprises is one of the few. With regard to the volume of the gathered data through questionnaire survey it provides extensive insight to the customer-enterprise relationship. Results of the conducted analyses can be used by enterprise managers in business practice to focus on customer's satisfaction, on the specific elements, to promote the enterprise financial performance. The article thus stresses the idea that the knowledge of the customer's needs, customer's satisfaction, is and can be used to promote the financial performance of the enterprise.","[Marinic, Peter] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Marinic, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Marinič, Peter/AAW-5203-2020","Marinič, Peter/0000-0001-9232-8713",,,,,8,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,229,235,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100031,0

There follows a presentation of a classical economic perspective on contract law, which conceives of non-mandatory norms as means for reducing transaction costs and which upholds efficiency as the central standard (Sect. 8.2.2). Next, attention is turned on the behavioural economic analysis of non-mandatory contract law, and the fundamental possibility of using non-mandatory law as a nudging instrument to steer behaviour is introduced, making reference to two concrete examples of its application in labour law and in surety contract law.

The efficiency of domestic institutions is found to be better than that of their foreign counterpart, and there is no significant difference in TFP growth between domestic and foreign institutions.","[Okuda, Hidenobu] Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan; [Aiba, Daiju] Hitotsubashi Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University; Hitotsubashi University,"Okuda, H (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Dept Econ, 2-1 Naka, Tokyo 1868601, Japan.",hokuda@econ.hit-u.ac.jp,,,Ministry of Education and Science [25380283],"Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))","This study was financially supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education and Science (Scientific Research C, No. 25380283).",,37,7,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Several civil society movements and groups aim to address the issue of food waste in a direct manner. The study examines dumpster diving, which is one of the social movements more widely acknowledged and more broadly adopted in this context. The study explores the process of dumpster diving, the knowledge of dumpster divers regarding food waste, as well as their perception of its potential legal and social consequences. In 2014, fifteen in-depth interviews with regular dumpster divers were conducted. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed through qualitative content analysis. Results show that the knowledge of food waste differs profoundly among the dumpster divers interviewed. Few have comprehensive knowledge; others perpetuate stereotypes. The dumpster diving process itself can take different forms. There are individual, as well as group divers. The organization of the dive also varies with respect to actions at the dumpster, e.g., the use or nonuse of protective equipment and the location of sorting activities. All interviewees acknowledge at least a legal gray area regarding their activities. However, most of the divers interviewed ignore the resulting legal risks. For some dumpster divers, social consequences, such as exclusion and revulsion by family members, are of more concern. Therefore, some of the divers interviewed conceal these activities. Other divers report to experience tolerance or acceptance by their social environment.","[Rombach, M.; Bitsch, V.; Nellen, A.; Salomon, M.] Tech Univ Muenchen, Chair Grp Econ Hort & Landscaping, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Technical University of Munich,"Rombach, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Muenchen, Chair Grp Econ Hort & Landscaping, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany.",,"Rombach, Meike/AAA-7364-2019","Rombach, Meike/0000-0003-4014-6875",,,,,14,2,2,1,12,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,167,173,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.23,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400023,0

The data were obtained using questionnaires completed by N = 400 middle managers from 129 companies in Serbia. The statistical methodologies that were used in the data analysis are: descriptive statistics and correlation analysis. The main conclusions of the study are as follows. The correlations between the corporate credibility (CC), organizational commitment (OCM) of employees and financial performance (FP) of companies are statistically significant, strong and positive. Good expertise of a company has increasingly bigger effect on the financial performance while trustworthiness of a company increasingly affects the commitment of employees. The bigger the expertise of the company is, the better will be the financial performances, and the greater is the trustworthiness, the commitment of the employees grows.","[Terek, Edit; Nikolic, Milan; Vukonjanski, Jelena; Gligorovic, Bojana; Zoric, Katarina] Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin, Dept Management, Zrenjanin, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Terek, E (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Tech Fac Mihajlo Pupin, Dept Management, Zrenjanin, Serbia.",edit@tfzr.uns.ac.rs; milan.nikolic@tfzr.uns.ac.rs; jelena.vukonjanski@gmail.com; bojana_gl@yahoo.com; katarina.zoric@tfzr.rs,"Vukonjanski, Jelena/KCL-6368-2024",,,,,,25,0,0,0,5,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,338,346,,,,,,9,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100031,0

Methods We carry out a stylized model to analyze the decision health authorities face when they do not have perfect information about the best treatment for a population of patients with a given disease. The health authorities decide whether to use a test to match patients with treatments (personalized medicine) to maximize health outcomes. Our model characterizes the situations under which personalized medicine dominates the alternative option of business-as-usual (treatment without previous test). We apply the model to the KRAS test for colorectal cancer, the PCA3 test for prostate cancer and the PCR test for the X-fragile syndrome, to illustrate how the parameters and variables of the model interact. Results Implementation of personalized medicine requires, as a necessary condition, having some tests with high discriminatory power. This is not a sufficient condition and expected health outcomes must be taken into account to make a decision. When the specificity and the sensitivity of the test are low, the health authority prefers to apply a treatment to all patients without using the test. When both characteristic of the test are high, the health authorities prefer to personalize the treatments when expected health outcomes are better than those under the standard treatment. When we applied the model to the three aforementioned tests, the results illustrate how decisions are adopted in real world. Conclusions Although promising, the use of personalized medicine is still under scrutiny as there are important issues demanding a response. Personalized medicine may have an impact in the drug development processes, and contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of health care delivery. Nevertheless, more accurate statistical and economic information related to tests results and treatment costs as well as additional medical information on the efficacy of the treatments are needed to adopt decisions that incorporate economic rationality.","[Antonanzas, F.; Juarez-Castello, C.

Even less is known about Indigenous businesses. Supply Nation defines an Indigenous business as those where Indigenous stakeholders hold majority equity, but some researchers have argued that this definition could be relaxed to include businesses in which Indigenous people hold only half the equity in the enterprise. This article uses data from the Industry Capability Network Queensland, which has collected basic business information on a large number of businesses operating in Queensland. The findings reveal that Indigenous businesses have substantially better outcomes for Indigenous employment than non-Indigenous businesses - a result that holds even when the definition of Indigenous business is relaxed. The article also documents how Indigenous employment is concentrated in larger businesses, in particular industry sectors.

Women using the pill can decide when and whether to have children and whether to maintain their attachment to the labor force. This ability may increase women's autonomy, making divorce more feasible. The pill's effects are identified through a quasi-experiment exploiting differences in the language of the Comstock anti-obscenity statutes approved in the late 1800s and early 1900s in the United States. Empirical evidence from state-level data on US divorce rates 1950 to 1985 shows that sales bans of oral contraceptives have a negative impact on divorce. These findings are robust to alternative specifications and controls for observed (such as women's labor force participation) and unobserved state-specific factors, and time-varying factors at the state level. Results suggest that the impact of women's control of hormonal contraception on their autonomy is important in divorce decisions.","Univ Zaragoza, Zaragoza 50005, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Marcén, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, Gran Via 2, Zaragoza 50005, Spain.",mmarcen@unizar.es,"Pérez, Miriam Marcén/V-8124-2019","Pérez, Miriam Marcén/0000-0002-1944-4790",Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness [ECO2012-34828],Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),The author is grateful for the financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (Project ECO2012-34828).

Income data (n = 176) collected over one year quantified all subsistence and cash income generated by indigenous and non-indigenous residents in two locations within the Ampiyacu-Apayacu basin. Products harvested from unmanaged forests and agroforests contributed 42% of household income, while fishing contributed 14%, resulting in over 55% of household income derived from local resources. Poorer households are most reliant on forest products, particularly low value resources, while wealthier households benefit more from commercial harvest. Tobit regression analyses and general linearized models identified key determinants of (i) resource harvest engagement and (ii) absolute and relative incomes derived from natural resources. Basin location (East versus West), ethnic identification, distance to market/forest proximity, household wealth and access to non-farm/forest cash income sources were all significant. These determinants varied, however, depending on the specific resource harvested (e.g. palm heart versus timber). This relates to i) varying abundance of individual resources across the landscape, and ii) differences in harvest purpose (subsistence versus sale) and product type (low-value/low-return versus high-value/high return). Future policies and initiatives should promote the conservation and sustainable use of diverse environments which are critical to livelihoods (e.g., forests, palm swamps, agroforests, rivers and lakes).

We construct indices of bonding, bridging and linking social capital, information sharing, and trust and explore how these indicators of social capital have changed since the implementation of the sector program. We also evaluate the relationship between these social capital indicators and various measures of economic performance of sectors. The result suggests that the relationship between social capital and economic performance has strengthened over time.

However, due to high uncertainty in the climate policy of the United States, the economic potential of sustainably managing forests for offset credits is uncertain, discouraging landowners from participating in such practices. Also uncertain are the ecological consequences, especially in terms of forest carbon stocks. Here a conceptual framework was proposed which, with a regime-switching process, modeled the price of carbon credits as a proxy of the climate policy. Uncertainty in policy was translated into a limited number of scenarios regarding the timing and magnitude of policy regime switches. This model was then incorporated into a Markov decision process model of forest management, which accounted for multiple forms of risk and uncertainty affecting forest functioning and management. Using linear programming, this framework quantified the economic and ecological potentials of forest carbon management in various policy scenarios and determined optimal harvesting rules adaptive to policy shifts. A simple numerical example was provided to demonstrate the application of this framework. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on the environment entitlements and endowments framework, we analyzed the case of Ngare Ndare forest in North-Central Kenya through interviews, focus group discussions, map analyses, archival records and a semi-structured household survey covering 120 households across six villages. The findings illustrate how socio-economic differentiation is embedded in the historical political economy of allocation, alienation and dispossession of land and forest, which are key endowments that distinguish people in the study area. Rather than reducing it, CBFM increases vulnerability of disadvantaged groups, through two mechanisms: i) taxing access to livelihood-enhancing forest products by the state agency, and ii) elite capture of local level institutions which serve to mediate forest access. Vulnerability can be addressed:by reducing revenue extracted for forest activities such as firewood collection and grazing, ensuring democratic representation in local level forest institutions, and reducing structural inequalities in access to land and forest.

With the number of Working Holiday visa grants now topping 200,000 annually, Working Holiday Makers are significant participants in low-skilled work in Australia. The article argues that the programme is not adequately regulated to protect Working Holiday Makers in this work. In light of concerns around the exploitation of Working Holiday Makers, the article offers suggestions for reform to the programme. The article argues that the programme should be returned to its original conception of fostering a cultural experience for young migrants coming to Australia. It argues that work entitlements under the Working Holiday visa should be limited to work that is appropriate for young migrants on a brief cultural visit and that labour shortages should otherwise be filled using dedicated temporary labour migration visas which are properly designed to address labour shortages in the economy. Reform is necessary to protect the work conditions of local and migrant workers, to maintain Australia's reputation as a country with high employment standards and to maintain positive relations with countries in the Working Holiday programme.","[Reilly, Alexander] Univ Adelaide, Publ Law & Policy Res Unit, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia",University of Adelaide,"Reilly, A (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Fac Law, N Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",alexander.reilly@adelaide.edu.au,"Reilly, Alexander P/M-6425-2017",,Interdisciplinary Research Fund grant at the University of Adelaide,Interdisciplinary Research Fund grant at the University of Adelaide,Research for the article was supported by an Interdisciplinary Research Fund grant at the University of Adelaide.

In this research, we apply Scenario Analysis in order to identify the barriers affecting the decision to invest in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) sector in Morocco. Our results aim at facilitating the process of defining different paths in strategic political and policy actions. Using data from a survey on a panel of experts, the Cross Impact Analysis (CIA) and the Cross Impact Matrix System (SMIC) techniques are applied. The advantage of these techniques is that they allow including in the analysis the interlinkages between the events that will define the future scenarios. However, their limitation is that the number of events analyzed cannot be too high since the information collected from the experts increases exponentially according to the number of events introduced. We thus expand our analysis with a new methodological approach, combining the use of prospective and statistics techniques. This approach allows addressing the mentioned limitation and applying these techniques, initially restricted to 6 events in its common application, to a large number of events. The results show that uncertainty and informality would be key factors in promoting the arrival of companies in this sector.

In order to evaluate these effects, we examine the relationship between hospital efficiency and health care costs in Turkey, and address the impact of the PFP system on the efficiencies of public and private hospitals. In an effort to analyze the efficiencies of public and private hospitals, this study uses data envelopment analysis. The Malmquist Productivity Index is also used to analyze the patterns of efficiency change for the study years from 2001 to 2008. This study shows that health care costs and hospital efficiency are negatively correlated for private hospitals, while they are positively correlated for public hospitals. In other words, increased health care costs might reduce efficiency in private hospitals in contrast to public hospitals. Our findings also indicate that average efficiencies of public hospitals tend to increase, particularly during the implementation period of PFP system. The efficiency trend of private hospitals, conversely, decreased in the latter periods of the PFP system. Suggestions for improvement are provided to the health care policy makers regarding the impact of health care reforms on public and private hospitals.","[Gok, Mehmet Sahin] Gebze Inst Technol, Fac Business Adm, Operat & Management Dept, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey; [Altindag, Erkut] Beykent Univ, Dept Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Gebze Technical University; Beykent University,"Gok, MS (通讯作者)，Gebze Inst Technol, Fac Business Adm, Operat & Management Dept, TR-41400 Gebze, Kocaeli, Turkey.",sahingok@gyte.edu.tr; erkutaltindag@beykent.edu.tr,"Gök, Mehmet Şahin/ACU-7562-2022","Gök, Mehmet Şahin/0000-0003-4072-2641",,,,,36,23,26,0,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Conversely, turnover is found to have a negative effect on young students in schools outside of central city districts. These results are consistent with a model of classroom learning in which the educational returns to having a stronger social network depend on neighborhood context.

Specifically, if such models have a dynamic element, and if the estimator controls for unobserved traits by including district-level effects, then model validity does not allow for a district's academic performance, in turn, to impact future transfers. Yet it seems reasonable that families, having access to publicly available aggregated information on standardized test results, seek to move their children to better-performing districts. In this paper, we demonstrate that, not only is such feedback quantitatively and qualitatively important, but also that allowing for such feedback substantially alters the estimated relationship between transfers and district performance.","[Welsch, David M.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Coll Business & Econ, Whitewater, WI 53190 USA; [Zimmer, David M.] Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",University of Wisconsin System; Western Kentucky University,"Zimmer, DM (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",welschd@uww.edu; david.zimmer@wku.edu,,,University of Wisconsin-Whitewater College of Business and Economics; University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Fiscal and Economic Resource Center (FERC),University of Wisconsin-Whitewater College of Business and Economics; University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Fiscal and Economic Resource Center (FERC),The authors would like to thank the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater College of Business and Economics and the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater Fiscal and Economic Resource Center (FERC) for providing financial support to aid in the collection of these data.

In this framework, the formation of environmental preferences is the result of a cultural transmission process depending on the extent of private contributions. In the short run, we show that three equilibria may arise: a first one where all green agents contribute to the environment, a second one where nobody contributes to the environment and a third interior one. We show that the capital-accumulation process and the change in preferences that occur in this economy lead the interior equilibrium to be selected, in which some, but not all, green agents contribute to the environment. The model thus provides an economic rationale for the gap between the number of people who care about the environment and the number who adopt pro-environmental behaviours. We also show that the fraction of contributors rises with capital, so that we explain the negative relationship between this gap and country income. Last, we show that this gap is particularly detrimental for welfare, and analyse the impact of a number of public policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This allows us to compare the results of different fixed effect and instrumental variables estimators. We use the natural population variation in the residential catchment areas and school openings and closures to instrument for actual school size. We find a robust positive but numerically fairly small relationship between school size and alternative measures of long-term success in the educational system and the labor market.

In the 1970s, EF Schumacher proposed a form of Buddhist economics aimed at smallness, simplicity and non-violence. The major contribution of the present paper is to revise and update Schumacher's and others' work on Buddhist economics, first because of the changing spirit of capitalism from heavy to light capitalism and, second, because Schumacher's critical perspective of Buddhism has not been sustained to the present day. Rather, Buddhism has been received in the West as a way of coping and as a harmonious philosophy. In order to face the future, the paper proposes a critical development of a Buddhist economics based on the principles of The Four Noble Truths and The Eightfold Path. Apart from revising and updating Buddhist economics, the paper engages in a discussion with the organizational spirituality literature, which contributes to the analysis, and to which contributions are made, first by dividing the field into critical-negative and critical-constructive approaches; and second, by proposing a turn to principles for critical-constructive approaches.

The price analysis suggests that in all three value chains that include shrimp, tilapia and trout there are competitive aquaculture producers that participate in international value chains and that are able to respond to profitable opportunities when relative prices change. While some small scale producers are able to enter international chains through larger exporters, the majority seem to serve domestic markets and often markets close to the production sites.","Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Tveteraas, SL (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Norwegian Sch Hotel Management, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",sigbjorn.tveteras@uis.no,"Tveteraas, SIgbjorn/Y-2283-2019",,Food & Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),Food & Agricultural Organization of the United Nations; Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD),This project was funded by the Food & Agricultural Organization of the United Nations and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD).

In an economy that applies inflation-targeting policy where interest rates are determined in light of the Taylor rule, as the Central Bank tries to establish price stability and financial stability by determining policy interest rates, the Central Bank might fall into a position to do nothing but to assent inflation. In the empirical section, two new indices, the psychological dominance (pdi) and market dominance indices (mdi) are developed based on the difference between the policy rates. The band within which the indices follow random walk processes are determined with Band-TAR models. The CB policy is additionally modeled with a nonlinear Taylor rule with TVEC models. The most significant point of the process is its inflation-creating effect. By moving from the Turkey example, the main problem in the policies of Central Bank of Turkey is the difference between the borrowing and lending rates and its inflationary effect.","[Bildirici, Melike] Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Parasiz, Ilker] Cent Bank Turkey, Istanbul, Turkey; [Ersin, Ozgur Omer] Beykent Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey; [Aykac-Alp, Elcin] Istanbul Commerce Univ, Fac Commercial Sci, Istanbul, Turkey",Yildiz Technical University; Prime Ministry Turkey; Beykent University; Istanbul Ticaret University,"Bildirici, M (通讯作者)，Yildiz Tech Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Istanbul, Turkey.",melikebildirici@gmail.com; ozgurersin@beykent.edu.tr; ealp@ticaret.edu.tr,"Bildirici, Melike Elif/P-5576-2015; ALP, ELÇİN AYKAÇ/M-9150-2019; ERSİN, ÖZGÜR ÖMER/ABB-5626-2020","Bildirici, Melike Elif/0000-0003-3925-844X; ALP, ELÇİN AYKAÇ/0000-0001-9076-2102; ERSİN, ÖZGÜR ÖMER/0000-0002-9177-2780",,,,,26,1,1,0,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We use Constant Market Shares analysis, using both analytical and econometric approach. The analysis is executed on 25 member states of European Union. Time series consist of yearly observation on country-level imports from Czech Republic and European Union, from 1999 to 2014. We follow a model using Tornqvist index systems with symmetric weights. The results suggest that the Czech Republic's increasing portion in European Union's imports can be attributed mainly to improvements in its competitiveness and partially to geographical distribution of its exports. Commodity composition of the exports has generally negative effect. These outcomes are verified by econometric version of the analysis applying weighted OLS with fixed effects.","[Cekmeova, Petra] Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Cekmeová, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",441117@mail.muni.cz,"Chovancová, Petra/JGM-3243-2023",,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,86,91,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900015,0

This is especially true for tertiary education, i.e. universities, because students have a wide variety of choices and are mostly not geographically limited in their choice of studies, therefore the competition between institutions is increasingly relevant. Studies show that the use of Customer Relationship Management [CRM] is widespread in larger and progressive universities in areas of higher competition, e.g. in the USA. In the areas where competition between universities is just beginning to be a major factor, CRM use for student management is a relatively new concept. The paper aims to present some starting points and considerations when implementing CRM in tertiary education. On the base of a literature review, a survey was made among students of a Slovenian mid-sized faculty that currently does not have any advanced CRM support. The results of this survey, which were analysed using basic statistical analysis, point to a variety of factors and services that influence student satisfaction and positive attitude towards the university, while on the other side giving the university crucial information about each student and their life cycle at the university through consolidated and centralised information in the CRM environment. The paper's added value is to analyse how universities can apply CRM use to increase their competitive advantage in comparison to other universities and provide students (as well as potential students and alumni) with superior services.","[Cvahte, Tina; Topolsek, Darja] Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Cvahte, T (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Maribor, Slovenia.",tina.cvahte@um.si; darja.topolsek@um.si,"Ojsteršek, Tina Cvahte/J-3870-2015",,,,,,11,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,394,400,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000035,0

We use a dataset compiled by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement that reflects a BMI screening program for public school children in the state of Arkansas. We combine propensity score matching with difference-in-differences methods to deal with time-invariant as well time-varying unobserved factors. We find no evidence that the presence of dollar stores within a reasonably close proximity of the child's residence increases BMI. In fact, we see an increase in BMI when dollar stores leave a child's neighborhood. Given the proliferation of dollar stores in rural and low-income urban areas, the question of whether dollar stores are contributing to high rates of childhood obesity is policy relevant. However, our results provide some evidence that exposure to dollar stores is not a causal factor.","[Drichoutis, Andreas C.] Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.; Thomsen, Michael R.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Div Agr, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Norwegian Inst Bioecon Res, Akershus, Norway; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Rouse, Heather L.] Iowa State Univ, Dept Human Dev & Family Studies, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA; [Rouse, Heather L.] Univ Arkansas Med Sci, Ctr Hlth Improvement, Little Rock, AR 72205 USA",Agricultural University of Athens; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; Norwegian Institute of Bioeconomy Research; Korea University; Iowa State University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Medical Sciences,"Drichoutis, AC (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Athens, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Iera Odos 75, GR-11855 Athens, Greece.",adrihout@aua.gr,"Drichoutis, Andreas/AAM-6580-2020","Drichoutis, Andreas/0000-0002-4082-4560",Agriculture and Food Research Initiative of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2011-68001-30014]; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2014S1A3A2044459],Agriculture and Food Research Initiative of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture; National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),"This research was funded by the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, grant number 2011-68001-30014.

More a more evidences are pointing to the fact that success of these programs depends in a good part of externalities, which are related to the changes in the form of networking and values among the stakeholders in the territory. These externalities are defined as the Social Capital. As externalities, they are not directly evaluated in the projects economic and social impact, but accepted to exist and the planners of the projects do acknowledge the importance of social networking, although never assessed. The spatial effect over the rural territories regulates the employment as much as other production factors for the industry. The population will journey to the areas where work is more available but that movement is limited by the local geography. Technology and geography are key factors in the employment evolution, and by that of economical growth. The objective of the research project described in this paper is to measure and assess the social capital of a given regional development project, and to compare the social capital results with those of the benefits according to the drafted project framework agreed upon the multilateral agencies and the region authorities. The regional program selected is the Programa de Desenvolvimiento da Zona da Mata (PROMATA) in the State of Pernambuco Brazil, under the sponsor of the Inter American Development Bank. The PROMATA project, ended in 2010, was big (over $ 100 M) and was designed to induce development in which community resources were to be mobilized, with the intention of getting the stakeholders involved as proponents and protagonists of social change in their territories. That social based bottom-up framework was a very interesting opportunity to observe the social capital component given the profile of the project. The research was carried out with the project just finished, so permanent changes in the social network and values could be observed. Some difficulties still present precluded the use of a large interview sampling, so intentional interviews had to be implemented with a reduced number of people in the region. In that case, a questionnaire capable of measuring the opinion, versus the traditional tally recording, was implemented using the Item Response Theory and the Guttman scale. The social capital was intended to be analyzed using scaled Woolcock matrix. Woolcock uses two strategy matrix (2x2), one for the Macro relations (state-society) and other for the Micro relations (society-community). Each scale in the matrix is normalized from cero to one. The results were obtained using Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Principal Components, producing the needed scales to measure the social capital according to Woolcock matrix. PROMATA, is considered a success case in Brazil, in part because of its social networking approach. However when the social capital was analyzed there were areas of state-society and society-community relations not in agreement with the results reflected by the economic-social benefits evaluation at the end of the project. Secondary research like expert interviews proved the social capital results not to be mistaken. This unforeseen externality is the social capital effect.","[Fortini, J.; Lopez, J.

In a share remuneration system, crew salaries can significantly increase when the economic performance of a vessel improves. This allows the crew to capture part of the fisheries rent.

Such requirement is the basis for long-term sustainable development of mining enterprises and maximize the value generated for the benefit of stakeholders. The authors proceed from the assumption that companies should generate value not only for shareholders, but also for other stakeholders, hence the need for calculating value added (VA). The aim of the article is to examine how and whether the deteriorating financial situation of mining companies in Poland affects the distribution of value added to stakeholders. The article presents the idea of value added generated by the mining companies for the benefit of stakeholders as a measure of the company's commitment to the idea of social responsibility. The structure of the value added statement is presented as well as information on how the value added is distributed to employees, the state budget, donors of capital and the company itself. An analysis of the value added indicators can be made by using ratios of vertical integration, productivity, distribution or business development.

To solve the problem we use robust linear programming. The problem takes into account the fact that demand in certain nodes could not be the same as predicted, but real demand could be greater due to unexpected events.

We formulate mathematical model of the problem and to test behavior of proposed approach we make a computational study using a universal IP-solver on the test data from selected region and we evaluate the influence of uncertain demand on system design.","[Kohani, Michal] Univ Zilina, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Koháni, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",michal.kohani@fri.uniza.sk,"Koháni, Michal/AAS-9406-2020",,,,,,9,1,1,0,2,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,371,376,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900064,0

Sometimes a farmer decides to make such alterations in farming that reflect developments in the whole Czech Republic, sometimes a farmer's decisions may be seen as opposing such developments since they are initiated by a specific situation or attitude of the farmer. Factors influencing farmers' decision making can vary greatly from universal, general ones, such as importance of the competitive market and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to the individual and interpersonal factors closely associated with the personality of each farmer. This paper therefore aims to assess the transformations observed in agriculture in the Czech Republic since 2000 with regard to the official data and to the perspective of farmers, and subsequently to identify factors influencing decision-making according to the perception of farmers. A research conducted among 77 farmers showed that farmers perceived as crucial similar changes that have indeed taken place at the level of the whole Czech Republic, such as the changes in the structure of sowing, heading towards more sustainable agriculture and enhancement of farm multifunctionality. On the other hand, the assessment of the progress towards multifunctionality is difficult to verify in the Czech Republic; the frequently mentioned trend towards higher intensification of farms directly contradicts the observed trend of extensification of the Czech agriculture or the farmers' perception of enforcement of sustainability of agriculture. A perception of strengthening of the multifunctionality of farms and moving towards sustainability can be connected with the impact of agricultural policy, which was identified as the second most important factor influencing any farmer's decision-making, following the factors connected with the market (pricing, consumer preference and customer-supplier relationships).","[Konecny, Ondrej] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Konecny, O (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Reg Dev & Publ Adm, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ondrej.konecny@mendelu.cz,"Konečný, Ondřej/F-6082-2010","Konečný, Ondřej/0000-0003-3098-7726",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,436,443,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800044,0

Unlike the equilibrium of the traditional version of this game and even recent extensions of it in a similar direction as ours, three novel results may emerge: (i) a negotiation breakdown, (ii) a perfectly equitable sharing solution, and (iii) a solution in which the responder gets a higher fraction of the pie under division than the proposer. It is shown that whereas the first result depends on the externality level suffered by both players, the two last, conditional on that an agreement exists, only depend on the responder's externality level. It is further argued that these results can be especially relevant in negotiations involving interpersonal interactions and resolution of highly polarized conflicts.","[Laengle, Sigifredo; Loyola, Gino] Univ Chile, Dept Management Control, Santiago, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Loyola, G (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Dept Management Control, Santiago, Chile.",slaengle@fen.uchile.cl; gloyola@fen.uchile.cl,"Laengle, Sigifredo/I-3743-2014","Laengle, Sigifredo/0000-0002-8396-4408",,,,,17,3,3,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The two primary causes of missing data that generate concern are unit non-response and item non-response. Unit non-response occurs when a potential respondent does not complete and return a survey, resulting in a missing respondent. Item non-response occurs in returned surveys when an individual question is unanswered. Both may lead to issues with extrapolating results to the population. We explain how to adjust data to estimate population parameters from surveys using two of the principal approaches available for addressing missing data, weighting and data imputation, and illustrate the effects they have on estimates of costs and earnings in the Alaska charter boat sector using data from a recent survey. The results suggest that ignoring missing data will lead to markedly different results than those estimated when controlling for the missing data.","[Lew, Daniel K.; Himes-Cornell, Amber] Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, Seattle, WA 98115 USA; [Lee, Jean] Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commiss, Seattle, WA USA",National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Lew, DK (通讯作者)，Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Resource Ecol & Fisheries Management Div, Alaska Fisheries Sci Ctr, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115 USA.",Dan.Lew@noaa.gov; Amber.Himes@noaa.gov; Jean.Lee@noaa.gov,"Lew, Daniel K./AAL-3013-2021","Himes-Cornell, Amber/0000-0003-3695-2241; Lew, Daniel/0000-0002-3394-138X",,,,,32,7,7,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The aim of this paper is to offer a measurement tool to analyse the extend of innovation. We have divided the complex phenomenon of innovation in seven types of innovation according to their influence in the company, for each type of innovation, we have proposed a set of measuring indicators. To widen the extent of analysis, this paper used two research methods, namely: the expert method - using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) that focuses on the requirements for innovation performance and on a different set of indicators to calculate the importance of each type of indicator; and the empirical method - using a questionnaire with questions, a representative sample of firms to check the current extent of innovation and to offer suggestions for improving innovation management.","[Maier, Dorin; Anastasiu, Livia] Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania; [Sarbu, Roxana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Eidenmuller, Thorsten] European Educ Grp AG, Eschen, Liechtenstein",Technical University of Cluj Napoca; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Maier, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania.",dorin.maier@gmail.com; livia.anastasiu@yahoo.com; sarburoxana@yahoo.com; eidenmueller@eu-edu.de; Werner.MAILINGER@atotech.com,"Anastasiu, Livia/K-6454-2019; Dorin, Maier/S-3377-2019; Maier, Dorin/C-1931-2015; Sarbu, Roxana/Q-9937-2017","Dorin, Maier/0000-0002-3888-2251; Maier, Dorin/0000-0002-3888-2251;",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,346,353,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200042,0

It is a billion-dollar industry involving hundreds of countries but the raw material is overwhelmingly collected from forests. Indonesia is the world's largest supplier of rattan. This article uses a value chain approach to elucidate the market, environmental, and social implications of an Indonesian policy that bans the export of un- and semi-processed rattan, which started on 1 January, 2012. The justification for policy was to reduce competition so that domestic furniture producers would fare better in export markets. A year after the policy took effect, actors benefit differently depending on where they are in the value chain and the nature of their activities. Only the largest and highest-end furniture factories on Java have experienced increased in sales. Forest-adjacent rattan-supplying actors in Kalimantan, Sulawesi and Sumatera are adversely affected. Those engaged in rattan smuggling from Indonesia are receiving the most immediate benefits. Together, these findings show that in the short term, the policy serves elite interests, whose political prowess enabled the policy to pass. In the long term, the industry is at risk of suffocation and the forests are jeopardised. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

First, there has been little diversification from agriculture into industry, particularly manufacturing. Second, the poverty headcount and inequality remain high in many countries, even as African countries continue to rank lowest on the United Nations Development Programme's Gender Inequality Index. This contribution goes beyond the individualistic approach of supply-side policies and unveils deeper mechanisms that need to be tackled for the two transformations (diversification and inequality reduction) to occur. It demonstrates that gender inequality relies on unwritten but dominant social norms, hence, informal institutions. The removal of formal legislation that constrains women's agency, the enactment of formal laws, and the implementation of economic policies designed specifically to create incentives for behavior change are recommended.","[Oduro, Abena D.] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, POB LG57, Legon, Ghana; [van Staveren, Irene] Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",University of Ghana; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Oduro, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, POB LG57, Legon, Ghana.",aoduro@ug.edu.gh; staveren@iss.nl,,"van Staveren, Irene/0000-0001-7548-6795",Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC); IAFFE (International Association for Feminist Economics) office,Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC); IAFFE (International Association for Feminist Economics) office,"This special issue was made possible by the generous support of a grant to Feminist Economics by the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC).

Therefore, the correlations made to determine the behavior of Romanian online consumer are based on various data series related to the volume and number of online shopping transactions in Romania between 2010 and 2014, the type of products and services that Romanians seek over the Internet and demographic aspects of Romanian online consumer.

This paper considers their role in the assemblage of the British subsidised cultural sector as part of the assembling of culture more generally. In particular, it is concerned with the status of consultants as private sector actors, which differentiates them from other forms of expertise that tend to be located in the state apparatus, in that they must earn money to resource their work and remain solvent. By placing their work of assemblage in relation to this imperative, we can understand the difference it makes. Based on a close study of a London cultural consultancy, it is argued that specific governmental and managerial trends send trajectories of value through the assemblage which the networked consultants attempt to control and capture. These economies have seen consultants contribute to the broad shift in the assemblage of culture from something that occupied a distinctive sphere requiring protection from the ravages of the market to a potential contributor to economic and social development.","[Prince, Russell] Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Prince, R (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch People Environm & Planning, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",r.j.prince@massey.ac.nz,,"Prince, Russell/0000-0002-9671-7414",,,,,54,13,14,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

It is argued that the examination of the GAYS jurisprudence and state practice reveal that the GATS does not address the needs of the developing countries in general and the prospects of Internet gambling services in the Caribbean Community in particular. First, the article discusses the extent of service-producing activities within the GATS provisions and outlines the main principles of WTO. It stresses that 'services' include gambling and games provided online. It also asserts that cross-border trade in services via Information and Communication Technologies presents several challenges for policy makers including enforcement, control and accountability. Second, the article critically analyses the United States (US) domestic legal instruments, which led to the complaint by Antigua and Barbuda. Subsequently, the focus is shifted to the critique of the judgments by WTO dispute settlement bodies.

But what hurt even more was the way the WTO, in common with most multilateral organizations, has not caught up with the shifting centre of gravity in global governance.

Beta loadings on innovations in high-minus-low, interest rate and term spread induce significant risk premiums, and should be priced to determine the cross-sectional expected returns of the forestry-related assets. In general, average excess returns of the forestry-related assets decrease from the period of 1988Q1-1999Q4 to the period of 2000Q1-2011Q4.

Means for the semi-partial ((r) over bar = 0.12) correlations were relatively small but significantly different, supporting the claim that school building condition is related to student performance. Furthermore, results revealed that the magnitude of the correlation varied as a function of a number of moderator variables.

We based our analyses in two proposals: four pathways of influence as well as context specific impact study. The methodology was carried out through a context-specific impact study; it consisted of describing changes in Mexican society and the history of the forest policy with the aim of understand the contribution of the Finnish-Mexican cooperation. The information was collected following 3 steps: 1) collecting historical data in Mexico and from the archive of Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland; 2) interviews with Finnish and Mexican forestry experts involved in the cooperation interventions and 3) validating by contrasting sources. In conclusion, we found that Finnish cooperation had direct effects on Mexican forestry policy in terms of helping the incorporation of CFM in national forestry planning. At the same time, the cooperation program went deeper and shaped wider objectives, mainly through training and the mutual learning of Mexican and Finnish participants. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Assessing the economic viability of timber production and the value of other ecosystem services of planted forests has become increasingly important for policy and investment decisions. A spatial economic tool called the Forest Investment Framework (FIF) has been developed to enable the assessment of key ecosystem services provided by planted forests in New Zealand. The FIF has a timber viability component that has been used to assess where in New Zealand new forest establishment is viable. The framework can also estimate indicative values of carbon sequestration credits and avoided sedimentation of waterways. In this paper, FIF's timber viability component is validated using data from seven case-study forests in New Zealand. Results of the validation exercise suggest that FIF is a very good viability assessment tool because it provides very accurate estimates of costs and revenues that case-study forests actually generated. The paper also discusses the new ecosystem services that have been identified for incorporation into this framework: water quality, water yield, recreation and biodiversity conservation.

The certainty equivalent discount rate that often underpins this guidance embodies uncertainty in the primitives of the SDR, such as growth. For distant time horizons the probability distributions of these primitives are ambiguous and the certainty equivalent itself is uncertain. Yet, if a limited set of characteristics of the unknown probability distributions can be agreed upon, 'sharp' upper and lower bounds can be defined for the certainty-equivalent SDR. Unfortunately, even with considerable agreement on these features, these bounds are widely spread for horizons beyond 75 years.

Young people in long-term unemployment risk becoming a lost generation'. We investigate individual and family characteristics predicting young people's vulnerability to the scarring effects of long-term unemployment. After overviewing aggregate youth unemployment trends in several European countries, we focus on Russia and Italy - countries with contrasting structural and institutional conditions and exhibiting different macroeconomic trends - in order to determine whether, despite these differences, there were similar patterns in the relationship between individual and family characteristics and the of risk of unemployment and its adverse impacts. We use a Heckman probit model to estimate the unemployment risk of young people - compared to adults - during the period 2004-2011, before and after the global financial crisis. Despite many differences between the two countries, most of the explanatory variables acted in the same direction in each and so we compare the relative size of such effects. The policy significance of the findings is that personal and family characteristics are more amenable to modification than macroeconomic variables.

It is one thing to be a part of WTO agreements and know the WTO rules, and another to know how to use and take advantage of those agreements and rules in practice. The present investigation seeks to conduct a detailed examination of the latter with a specific focus on critically examining public private partnership (PPP) strategies that can enable developing countries to effectively utilize the provisions of WTO DSU. To achieve this purpose, the article examines how Brazil, one of the most active DSU users among developing countries, has strengthened its DSU participation by engaging its private stakeholders during the management of WTO disputes. The identification and evaluation of the PPP strategies employed by the government and industries in Brazil may prompt other developing countries to determine their individual approach towards PPP for the handling of WTO disputes.","[Bahri, Amrita] ITAM Univ, Sch Law, Law, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Bahri, A (通讯作者)，ITAM Univ, Sch Law, Law, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",amrita.bahri@itam.mx,,,,,,,60,4,4,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Using data from the National Center of Educational Statistics School District Demographic System, estimates of native flight are constructed using enrollment data on native and foreign-born, school-age children from 1990, 2000, and 2010. Concern regarding omitted variables bias necessitates the use of an instrumental variables technique. An instrument for the foreign-born enrollment is created using information about the ethnic composition of school districts in 1980 to predict the enrollment patterns of foreign-born students in later years. Two-stage least squares estimates confirm the presence of native flight. Flight to private school among white native students is occurring in smaller school districts in non-traditional immigrant receiving states, while flight among native minorities and Hispanics is located in school districts that reside in traditional immigrant receiving states.

This policy-induced uncertainty has distorted the harvesting decisions of individuals granted rights to grow trees and has lowered the value of China's forest output. We provide an analytical framework for assessing these effects quantitatively. Understanding the consequences of this policy-induced uncertainty is particularly important since China is currently engaged in an ambitious plan to increase its domestic supply of timber. To conduct this analysis, we extend the literature on forestry economics when there is a risk of loss due to forest fire or pests. We (1) take account of the possibility that replanting can only resume after an interval of uncertain length (with immediate replanting as a special Case); (2) investigate the effects of compensation for such losses based only on the net value of the stand of trees at the time of the loss; and (3) compare it to compensation that would leave the wealth and rotation decisions of the farmer unaffected by the presence of uncertainty.

J,"Ram, JR",,,,"Raghu Ram, Jayant",,,Pitching outside the DSU: Preliminary Rulings in WTO Dispute Settlement,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"It has become the norm for WTO panels to issue rulings on preliminary issues such as jurisdiction, terms of reference and other related issues pertaining to a dispute upon the request of the disputing parties at the preliminary stage itself In recent practice, panels have even started to circulate these preliminary rulings. Panel practice on preliminary rulings has developed despite of the absence of any express or implied provision in the Dispute Settlement Understanding. This paper discusses panel jurisprudence pertaining to preliminary rulings on salient aspects such as the scope of preliminary rulings, the timing of requests, et al. It also discusses issues pertaining to preliminary rulings which have legal bearing on the WTO dispute settlement system such as circulation, appellate review, and adoption; some of which WTO Members have themselves identified. While the practice of issuing preliminary rulings may be beneficial to the WTO's Members and the dispute settlement system as such, the unfettered practice of issuing preliminary rulings coupled with the absence of any express rules or a formal WTO understanding regarding the same raises certain systemic concerns. Given the systemic importance and utility of preliminary rulings in WTO dispute settlement, and also the legal uncertainties that may arise, it would be in Members' best interests if they took steps to codify current practice to ensure uniformity. However, a better alternative may be for panels/AB to develop the extant framework by either adding or modifying the Working Procedures.","[Raghu Ram, Jayant] Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Ctr WTO Studies, New Delhi, India",,"Ram, JR (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Foreign Trade, Ctr WTO Studies, New Delhi, India.",jayant.raghuram89@gmail.com,,,,,,,21,1,2,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Tumor detection can be considered as a random event, so that we can compare individuals' average outcomes in the year of diagnosis with the year before. We argue for using panel data estimation techniques that enable us to control for observed and unobserved information intrinsic to the individual and time constants. We use data of a national representative panel in the Netherlands that includes health survey information and data on work, education, and income between 2007 and 2012. Our findings show differences in the psychosocial dysfunction of men and women in response to tumor detection and treatment. Women, not men, are decreasingly likely to participate in the labor force as a result of malignant tumor detection, while no significant effects are found on her personal or household income.

We examine the program that preceded this effort and evaluate its potential effect on college-going and college persistence. Knox Achieves originated in Knox County, Tennessee with the class of 2009. Eligibility was neither need-based nor merit-based, negating some of the application hurdles that accompany other aid vehicles. We find that program participation is strongly associated with an increased likelihood of graduating from high school and enrolling directly in college, albeit with a modestly lower chance of starting in a four-year college. The evidence suggests that aid per se is not the only lever by which Knox Achieves worked: college enrollment and college credit gains are largest among lower-income students who likely saw little to no scholarship aid from the program.

We connect these literatures by highlighting a previously unstudied determinant of college choice, namely the college choice made by one's older sibling. Data on 1.6 million sibling pairs of SAT-takers reveals that younger and older siblings' choices are very closely related. One-fifth of younger siblings enroll in the same college as their older siblings. Compared to their high school classmates of similar academic skill and with observably similar families, younger siblings are about 15-20 percentage points more likely to enroll in 4-year colleges or highly competitive colleges if their older siblings do so first. These findings vary little by family characteristics. Younger siblings are more likely to follow the college choices of their older siblings the more they resemble each other in terms of academic skill, age and gender. We discuss channels through which older siblings' college choices might causally influence their younger siblings, noting that the facts documented here should prompt further research on the sharing of information and shaping of educational preferences within families.

The policy is inherently distortionary and welfare-reducing for a small open economy, at least according to the canonical economic model.

We also highlight open questions arising out of the Peru-Agricultural Products dispute for the WTO's Appellate Body to address in order to clarify how a PRS consistent with WTO rules could be designed. Finally, we discuss the possibility that a WTO member might resort to a free trade agreement (FTA) to preserve its flexibility to implement a PRS and how an FTA provision of this sort ought to be treated in WTO litigation.","[Saggi, Kamal] Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA; [Wu, Mark] Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Vanderbilt University; Harvard University,"Saggi, K (通讯作者)，Vanderbilt Univ, Nashville, TN 37235 USA.;Wu, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Law, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",K.saggi@vanderbilt.edu; mwu@law.harvard.edu,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,26,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,APR,2016,15,2.0,,,,,259,286,,10.1017/S1474745615000750,0.0,,,28,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GM,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372461000006,0

A large part of London's stronger recovery can be explained by increased employment and reduced inactivity among overseas-born immigrants. Furthermore, net outmigration from London to other UK regions fell during the recession, and is only beginning to return to previous levels. Both factors have increased labour supply and may have contributed to more marked real wage falls in London than in other regions.

Aims and objectives To determine costs and resource utilization associated with asthma and to analyze the impact of disease severity on subgroups based on age and gender. Methods A claims database analysis from the statutory health insurance perspective was conducted. Patients with an ICD-10-GM code of asthma were extracted from a 10 % sample of a large German sickness fund. Five controls for each asthma patient matched by age and gender were randomly selected from the same database. Costs and resource utilization were calculated for each individual in the asthma and control group. Incremental asthma-related costs were calculated as the mean cost difference. Based on prescribed asthma medication, patients were classified as intermittent or persistent. In addition, age groups of B5, 6-18, and >18 years were analyzed separately and gender differences were investigated. Results Overall, 49,668 individuals were included in the asthma group. On average, total annual costs per patient were (sic)753 higher (p = 0.000)compared to the control group ((sic)2,168 vs. (sic)1,415). Asthma patients had significantly higher (p = 0.000)outpatient ((sic)217), inpatient ((sic)176), and pharmacy costs ((sic)259). Incremental asthma-related total costs were higher for patients with persistent asthma compared to patients with intermittent asthma ((sic)1,091 vs. (sic)408). Women aged[18 years with persistent asthma had the highest difference in costs compared to their controls ((sic.)1,207; p < 0.0001). Corresponding healthcare resource utilization was significantly higher in the asthma group (p = 0.000). Conclusions The treatment of asthma is associated with an increased level of healthcare resource utilization and significantly higher healthcare costs. Asthma imposes a substantial economic burden on sickness funds.","[Jacob, Christian; Braun, Sebastian] Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Bechtel, Benno] GlaxoSmithKline, Uxbridge, Greater London, England; [Engel, Susanne; Linder, Roland] Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Hamburg, Germany; [Kardos, Peter] Red Cross Maingau Hosp, Grp Practice, Frankfurt, Germany; [Kardos, Peter] Red Cross Maingau Hosp, Ctr Pneumol Allergy & Sleep Med, Frankfurt, Germany; [Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, Fac Hlth Sci, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",GlaxoSmithKline; University of Bielefeld,"Jacob, C (通讯作者)，Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",christian.jacob@xcenda.de,,,GlaxoSmithKline,GlaxoSmithKline(GlaxoSmithKline),The study was funded by an unrestricted grant from GlaxoSmithKline.,,25,34,40,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In South Africa, the majority of children do not speak English as their first language but are required to undertake their final school-leaving examinations in English. Most schools offer mother-tongue instruction in the first three grades of school and then transition to English as the language of instruction in the fourth grade. Some schools use English as the language of instruction from the first grade. In recent years a number of schools have changed their policy, thus creating within-school, cross-grade variation in the language of instruction received in the early grades. Using longitudinal data from the population of South African primary schools and a fixed-effects approach, we find that mother tongue instruction in the early grades significantly improves English acquisition, as measured in grades 4, 5 and 6.

However, there is a significant growth disparity among aquaculture-producing countries. The reasons why some countries have achieved remarkable growth in aquaculture while others have stagnated or even declined have not been determined. In this article, we investigate whether environmental regulations have an impact on aquaculture growth. Using a cross-country regression analysis, we show that stringent environmental regulations are negatively related to aquaculture growth, whereas GDP growth has a positive effect. Countries often face a difficult balancing act between growth and environmental considerations when devising regulations. Our empirical results suggest that stricter environmental regulations in developed countries have contributed to lower growth rates and that these countries are falling behind emerging and developing economies that have more lenient environmental regulations.","[Abate, Tenaw G.; Nielsen, Rasmus] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger Ctr Innovat Res, Stavanger, Norway",University of Copenhagen; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Abate, TG (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",tga@ifro.ku.dk,"Nielsen, Rasmus/P-4322-2014","Nielsen, Rasmus/0000-0001-7357-6965; Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X",,,,,39,86,89,2,42,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The results reveal that, before GNAEP, there was a longer prawn marketing chain with a number of intermediaries who used to share a considerable amount of market margin. However, after implementation of GNAEP, the prawn marketing chain has become shorter with a significant reduction of intermediaries which facilitates direct selling of prawns to processing plants through local Community Based Organizations (CBOs). The present prawn marketing system in the regions is in favor of prawn farmers. Farmers have greater advantages because 1) CBOs provide reasonable market price and actual weight, 2) CBOs can bargain with processing plants as the former are aware of the latest international market prices through Marketing Information System 3) number of intermediaries is lowered and 4) transport and preservation costs are reduced. The displaced intermediaries, some of whom are powerful persons in the society, have again started to influence the prawn market in different ways. This fact has opened up another discussion on how the power structure is shifting in this region and how they are affecting prawn marketing.","[Ahmed, Md.

Adopting governance variables (executive remuneration, managerial ownership, and board diversity), we find that managerial ownership is positively related to bank merger results and that board size is negatively correlated with bank mergers' performance. This study supports sound governance mechanisms to prevent banks from pursuing a value-loss merger and acquisition (M&A). Our results offer the insight that internal bank governance structures have a bigger impact on the value effects from bank mergers.

The results of the research conducted and the practical implementation of expert procedures allowed forming SSRT structure, which is based on the key components of the service space: institutional and social environment, service structure, service space, service infrastructure. Each of the SSRT components is a set of factors and conditions that affect the production of strategic solutions on the development of individual business projects and rural tourism destination (RTD) in general: the standard of living of the local population, development of state-private partnership, social and economic activity of the local population, tourist resources structure, competence and experience, drivers of economic growth, service mentality, level of cooperation and collaboration, motivation and target setting, transport accessibility, availability of service infrastructure facilities, utility networks and energy supply. The characteristics of the key business models in the field of rural tourism, successfully implemented on the territory of Central Russia, are shown: cooperation, specialization and diversification. The design units that form the basis of business models have been determined. It is shown that the SSRT structure determines the content and design stages of the service space, and SSRT design process itself is associated with the analysis and study of the relationships between the components of SSRT, design units of business models and strategic solutions on the development of RTD. SSRT design algorithm, based on the key subsystems of rural tourism, has been developed. The basis of the algorithm is the scale of the strategic design solutions for SSRT development, the part of which are: assessment of the resource potential, strategy formation of tourism products, mechanisms of cooperation of businessmen and heads of household, strategy of promotion of tourist products, RTD management strategy. The proposed methodological approach to SSRT design is one of the most effective tools for the development of design solutions in the field of rural tourism and development of the main components of SSRT: institutional and social environment, service structure, service space, service infrastructure.","[Evgeny, Tsyshchuk] Russian State Univ, Tourism & Serv, Tomsk, Russia",,"Evgeny, T (通讯作者)，Russian State Univ, Tourism & Serv, Tomsk, Russia.",,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,245,252,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100033,0

According to estimates of the World Health Organization more than 26,000 people (including suspected cases) suffered from Ebola until April 2015. About 40 % of them died from this infectious disease [2]. The dynamics and intensity of the epidemic took many experts by surprise. Above all, it represented excessive demands on local health care systems as well as-at least initially-of international organizations tasked with coordinated intervention [3]. From a health economic perspective, especially, the complete dysfunctionality of local health care services is not surprising. The Ebola fever epidemic in Western Africa rather reveals fundamental failures in establishing health policies within those countries as well as in development policies of industrialized nations. In the following, some of these structural defects are outlined and conclusions from the Ebola epidemic are drawn.","[Flessa, Steffen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Greifswald, Germany; [Marx, Michael] Heidelberg Univ, Fac Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Flessa, S (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Greifswald, Germany.",steffen.flessa@uni-greifswald.de,"Flessa, Steffen/AEO-9609-2022",,,,,,14,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In the present paper, in order to collect the data and the theoretical foundations of the research, the field and library methods are respectively used and the tools used in the present study are standard questionnaires and note taking. The statistical population of the research is professional auditors and accountants, among whom the desired sample is determined and selected using respectively the Cochran's formula and random sampling method. In the research, the approval of the relationships between variables and factors is carried out through confirmatory factor analysis and PLS modeling technique using PLS2 SMART software, which is a variance based path modeling technique that provides the possibility of the simultaneous investigation of the theory and measures. In addition, using the Sobel test, the assumption of the mediator role of the professional judgment variable has been examined. The results indicated that auditors' professionalism is effective on professional judgment. They also showed that professional judgment has an impact on the conflict between auditor and management, but professionalism doesn't have any impact on it and professional judgment doesn't play a moderator role in the effect of professionalism on the conflict between auditor and management.

A multi-scalar analytical framework is utilised to discuss processes of uneven development and changing state-society relations, which together will continue to condition the trajectory of India's polity and society. It examines how researchers can critically engage with orthodox approaches to the study of India in ways that challenge the epistemic and ontological closures of the current neoliberal conjuncture. In doing so, the chapter places the contributions of this volume into a broader examination of how different disciplines have approached the study of India. The chapter then looks forward and asserts that the politics of space, scale and aspiration will be enduring concerns in understanding how India is transforming. The last part of the chapter is focused on what the election of Narendra Modi's NDA government may portend for the possible futures of India. It argues that we may see the ascension of Modi as evidence of the rise of a strain of neoliberal, semi-authoritarian populism.","[Hill, Douglas P.] Univ Otago, Dept Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand",University of Otago,"Hill, DP (通讯作者)，Univ Otago, Dept Geog, Dunedin, New Zealand.",dph@geography.otago.ac.nz,,,,,,,88,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,251,270,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_13,0.0,,,20,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800013,0

This study reviews China's cement industry in terms of energy intensity and examines the effects of technological progress on energy intensity.

Another paper's goal is to evaluate the performance of the monetary policy strategy in terms of transmission mechanism of the monetary policy impulses. With other words, as the monetary policy interest rate is the most important instrument used currently, we aim to measure the performance of inflation targeting regime on inflation by studying the characteristics of interest rate transmission mechanism on inflation. In order to do this, we use the VAR technique, assessing the monetary policy interest rate transmission mechanism.

The imperialist competitive algorithm belongs to the group of evolutionary algorithms. Originally it was proposed for continuous optimization. It is inspired by imperialistic competition, where dominating countries tend to gain control over colonies and spread their empires. In optimization, countries correspond to particular solutions to the problem. Good solutions represent imperialist countries, worse solutions their colonies. The colonies have to adapt to the dominating countries, which means that they acquire some of the imperialist's traits. This process may result in a possibly better characteristics of the country, i.e. a better solution to the problem. The algorithm is applied to the capacitated p-median problem and tested using benchmark instances.","[Janosikova, Ludmila; Haviar, Michal] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Jánosíková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",Ludmila.Janosikova@fri.uniza.sk,"Jánošíková, Ľudmila/C-9712-2010","Jánošíková, Ľudmila/0000-0003-3983-6713",research grant Resilient rescue systems with uncertain accessibility of service [VEGA 1/0518/15]; research grant Designing of Fair Service Systems on Transportation Networks [APVV-0760-11],research grant Resilient rescue systems with uncertain accessibility of service; research grant Designing of Fair Service Systems on Transportation Networks,This research was supported by the research grants VEGA 1/0518/15 Resilient rescue systems with uncertain accessibility of service and APVV-0760-11 Designing of Fair Service Systems on Transportation Networks.,,5,1,1,0,2,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-972328-0-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,196,201,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG9XU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000394099300031,0

There is a need to use the multi-criteria choice when addressing a variety of issues such as the integrated assessment of business parameters of the companies in the branch of industry, the analysis of economic performance of the enterprises for investment, the cost-benefit analysis of investment projects based on the set of economic indicators, the cost-benefit analysis of socially significant investment projects based on the population of economic, social, environmental and other indicators. Multicriteriality of settings enables to take into account different aspects, but exacerbates dramatically the comparing procedure due to inconsistency of estimated indicators. Improvement of one estimated index results in degradation of the others; and the particular optima are obtained in different points. With the aim of fulfilling these tasks, one shall apply the relevant principles of multiobjective optimization, in particular, the Pareto principle. The direct formation of a Pareto set according to the definition is rather difficult, especially if there is a significant number of indicators and alternatives to be compared. In view of this, different methods for formation of an effective set and lower ranks have been elaborated to facilitate the analysis. The paper presents typical three-criteria examples of the author's methods implementation for the analysis of enterprises and branches of industry in terms of maximization and minimization of indicators, as well as under oppositely directed indicators.","[Lapaev, D.

The analysis is based on the LuxLeaks sample and compared to a control group of large multinational companies. The panel dataset covers the years from 2001 to 2015 and comprises 19,109 observations. The LuxLeaks firms appear to engage in higher levels of discretionary earnings management measured by the variability of net income to cash flows from operations and the correlation between cash flows from operations and accruals. The LuxLeaks sample shows a lower analyst coverage, lower willingness to switch to IFRS and a lower Big4 auditor rate. The difference in difference design supports these findings regarding earnings management and the analyst coverage. The analysis concludes that the LuxLeaks firms are less transparent and infers a relation between corporate transparency and the engagement in tax avoidance.

The purpose of this paper is to find an answer at this question by comparing the forecasting power of probabilistic Stochastic volatility models with the classic deterministic model, GARCH (1,1) and realized volatility. To be able to forecast the volatilities using SV model I will use a Kalman filter approach proposed by Harvey, Ruiz and Shepard in 2002. The quality of these models with be evaluated using AIC and BIC indicators.

At about the same time as the UFS program was launched, Kansas State University opened a new campus in Olathe, KS, a suburb of the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. This new campus focuses on animal health, food safety and security, and provides graduate education, research and engagement with strong academic/industry/government partnerships. The UFS program was the first graduate program approved to be offered through the K-State Olathe campus. This paper will present the model of collaboration between the two campuses as well as the collaboration between the institutions and industry. This paper will also present the challenges and opportunities of placing a traditional graduate program with tenure-track faculty on a campus that has an expectation to serve the local residents and the greater Kansas City animal and food industries, help attract new business to the local county, provide training to the local workforce, and develop new technologies in collaboration with public and private companies. And finally, this paper will discuss how the UFS program was developed to grow student numbers and respond to future needs of the areas.","[Pliakoni, E. D.; Shoemaker, C. A.; Janke, R.; Rivard, C.

As the social development is taking place within the territory and the change of the functional status of territories and cities' image is an all-around and continuous process, the evaluation of cities' role in the touristic attraction of the region is an urgent task. This article studies main functional components of a city from the viewpoint of a touristic attraction (presence of recreation resources, ease of travel to the touristic object, presence of foodservice outlets and accommodation means) and their significance in the formation of the touristic brand. Basing on the numerical score the authors calculated an integral index which shows the level of touristic-recreation sphere development of the cities in the Republic of Tatarstan. As the result of the conducted investigation the authors pointed out some problem issues which are connected with the insufficient or limited resource base, unsuccessful system of the tourist services of tourists and visitors. The capital's break-off of the other cities of the Republic according to the main indices forms the feeling of capital hegemony. An even development of the touristic infrastructure in all the cities of the Republic is necessary to create a single regional tourist-recreation field.","[Rubtzov, Vladimir A.; Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz K.] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Respublika Tata, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Rubtzov, VA (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Respublika Tata, Russia.",,"Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/V-8823-2019; Rubtzov, Vladimir/M-2953-2013; Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/AAZ-5861-2020","Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/0000-0001-7336-4890; Rubtzov, Vladimir/0000-0002-9918-9231;",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,881,888,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200115,0

Specifically, politically connected firms underperform nonconnected firms directors by almost 17 percent and 15 percent based on return on assets and return on equity, respectively. By stratifying the sample duration into two periods based on the political environment, we find that this effect is more pronounced in autocratic as opposed to democratic regimes.

Then a modified Harmony search algorithm called HSDS based on Dimensional-Selection (DS) strategy and dynamic fret width (FW) strategy is proposed to solve PO problems, in which the DS strategy is for avoiding generating invalid solutions and the FW strategy is to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Finally, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search are compared with the HSDS algorithm employing five portfolio problems (HangSeng, DAX 100, FTSE 100, S&P 100 and Nikkei).

The response of school budgets to accountability grades,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Accountability; School finance,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT; INCENTIVES; FLORIDA; VOUCHER,"This paper examines how school administrators reallocate resources to schools in response to marginal changes in accountability ratings. We study this through an analysis of budgetary changes for schools on the margin of distinct rating boundaries. By determining how close each school is to an accountability grade change we are able to conduct a regression discontinuity analysis on schools that are on either side of the sharp line that separates school ratings. If administrators care about accountability ratings on the margin we would expect to see changes in budgetary allocations that reward higher performing, or punish lower performing, schools. Using data in Texas from 1994 to 2002, we find evidence suggesting that schools with higher ratings received more funds than others, and the differential funds were targeted toward administration/training, counseling and extra-curricular activities.

We test these relationships by running quantile regressions with data collected from 182 households in the Loess Plateau region covering the period of 1998-2011. We find that the more cropland was retired, the more subsidy was received, and the more labor was set free from farming, which, in turn, led to a larger decrease in farming income but a much larger gain in off-farm income. Further, the area enrolled had a more positive effect during 1998-2004 than that during 2006-2011 on all households; and the positive effect was significant only on those households of the 025th and 0.50th income quantiles later. Also, the proportion of off-farm labor to total labor, the off-farm work time, and the local GDP per capita had a larger income effect in the later sub-period, especially for households in the 0.75th and 0.90th income quantiles. These results carry major implications in terms of how to reduce poverty and increase income in ecologically fragile regions in and outside of China and how to assess the effect and effectiveness of any ecological conservation program.

The Central African Forest Commission (COMIFAC) recognises the importance of NTFPs in alleviating poverty and conserving biodiversity and has proposed directives to aid member states to implement appropriate regulations. Data on the regulations governing the chain and its impacts were collected from literature, 12 small and medium enterprises trading an NTFP known as okok (Gnetum spp.) from the production forests to the port of export in Cameroon, and workshops. Laws were bureaucratically, arbitrarily and weakly implemented and enforced. Of 18,368 financial transactions recorded, 81% were bribes, comprising 34% of trader's costs. Corruption in the permit system further creates high transaction costs, negative environmental impacts due to illegal and over-exploitation, and reduces government revenues. The regulatory framework does not promote an enabling business environment. Improvements in governance are imperative if the economic impact upon the livelihoods of thousands of people in the chain is to be maintained and enhanced to ensure sustainable trade. Recommendations to improve the sector in Cameroon include revisions in the regulatory framework and its implementation to increase transparency and counter corruption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Data from the World Bank's Enterprise Surveys (waves 2006-07, 2009-10) are used in a cross-country analysis to investigate whether export propensity and intensity differ according to the gender of top managers and entrepreneurs. Exporting is riskier than selling domestically and women, on average, tend to be more risk averse than men. Exporting entails costs, and women may have reduced access to finance compared to men. Most firms managed or solely owned by women are young and small and may have more difficulty obtaining credit. Women may self-select into routine sectors with lower mean productivity. Unlike most previous research, here the gender effect only takes into account firms where women have decision-making power. Accounting for the endogeneity of firm productivity, firm self-selection into exporting, and several factors influencing export propensity and intensity, the gender effect operates indirectly via some of those factors.","Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Marques, H (通讯作者)，Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma de Mallorca, Spain.",helena.ferreira-marques@uib.es,,,,,,,37,18,19,2,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

However, a lack of common technical language and differing attitudes on collaborative research can create challenges. This paper reports results of an evaluative survey on changes of collaborative capacity within a large transdisciplinary project. Our survey data, collected through pre-assessment (2011) and mid-assessment (2013) evaluation surveys of project participants, measured participants' attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs regarding transdisciplinary research. Paired samples t-tests were employed to compare measures from the same individuals at two points in time. The key variables were transdisciplinary attitudes, transdisciplinary behaviors, satisfaction with collaboration, perceived impacts of collaboration, and trust and respect. Changes over time were evaluated for the overall project team and by project role subgrouping that included principal investigators, professional and technical staff, graduate students, advisory board members, and extension educators. The analysis examined the following research questions: (1) Do participants' attitudes and behaviors toward the transdisciplinary process change over the course of the project? (2) Do these changes vary by participant role? Results indicate that while transdisciplinary behaviors did not significantly change for most of the role subgroups, advisory board members showed a decrease in transdisciplinary behaviors from the pre-assessment to the mid-assessment evaluation. Analysis of the other measures consistently showed a positive increase in mean scores from the pre- to the mid-assessment with one exception. Graduate student scores on the transdisciplinary attitude scale decreased over time. Understanding how participant perceptions may change over the course of a project and how project roles may influence these changes is important to managing effective long-term transdisciplinary projects.

Special emphasis is given to the herd effect. We analyzed direct medical and non-medical costs of RV infection for Social Health Insurance between 2007 and 2010 based on 360,000 routine data observations from the AOK PLUS for children below 5 years of age. We compared the actual annual number of RV cases (vaccination scenario) with the number derived from 2005 (no vaccination, base case scenario). The vaccination coverage rate has increased from 5 % to 61 % between 2007 and 2010. The number of RV cases decreased by 21 % from 32,274 in 2007 to 25,614 in 2010. Based on vaccination coverage, the total cost savings per 1,000 children due to RV vaccination was estimated to be 39,686 Euros. The overall share of outpatient costs was 60 %. Mean gross cost savings were expected to be 304 Euros per avoided case. The net cost savings were expected to be 19 Euros per avoided case. About 59 % of total savings was due to herd protection resulting from increasing vaccine rates. The herd effect per avoided case increased with increasing vaccine coverage. Incidence of RV cases, vaccination costs and days absent from work were sensitive parameters. This retrospective analysis showed that the increase in RV vaccination coverage in Saxony has been budget neutral if not cost saving for sick funds.","[Karmann, Alexander] Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Gesundheitsokonom Zentrum, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Jurack, Andrea] Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Lehrstuhl Allokat Theorie, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Lukas, Daniel] Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Lehrstuhl Wirtschaftsforsch & Wirtschaftspolit, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden; Technische Universitat Dresden; Technische Universitat Dresden,"Jurack, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, Fak Wirtschaftswissensch, Lehrstuhl Allokat Theorie, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",andrea.jurack@tu-dresden.de,,,"GlaxoSmithKline GmbH & Co.

With increasing functional and cognitive decline, it is likely that many people suffering from dementia will receive institutional care in their lifetime. To delay entry to institutional care, many European countries invest in home and community based care services. This study aimed to compare costs for people with dementia (PwD) at risk for institutionalization receiving professional home care (HC) with cost for PwD recently admitted to institutional long-term nursing care (ILTC) in eight European countries. Special emphasis was placed on differences in cost patterns across settings and countries, on the main predictors of costs and on a comprehensive assessment of costs from a societal perspective. Interviews using structured questionnaires were conducted with 2,014 people with dementia and their primary informal caregivers living at home or in an ILTC facility. Costs of care were assessed with the resource utilization in dementia instrument. Dementia severity was measured with the standardized mini mental state examination. ADL dependence was assessed using the Katz index, neuropsychiatric symptoms using the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and comorbidities using the Charlson. Descriptive analysis and multivariate regression models were used to estimate mean costs in both settings. A log link generalized linear model assuming gamma distributed costs was applied to identify the most important cost drivers of dementia care. In all countries costs for PwD in the HC setting were significantly lower in comparison to ILTC costs. On average ILTC costs amounted to 4,491 Euro per month and were 1.8 fold higher than HC costs (2,491 Euro). The relation of costs between settings ranged from 2.4 (Sweden) to 1.4 (UK). Costs in the ILTC setting were dominated by nursing home costs (on average 94 %). In the HC setting, informal care giving was the most important cost contributor (on average 52 %). In all countries costs in the HC setting increased strongly with disease severity. The most important predictor of cost was ADL independence in all countries, except Spain and France where NPI severity was the most important cost driver. A standard deviation increase in ADL independence translated on average into a cost decrease of about 22 %. Transition into ILTC seems to increase total costs of dementia care from a societal perspective. The prevention of long-term care placement might be cost reducing for European health systems. However, this conclusion depends on the country, on the valuation method for informal caregiving and on the degree of impairment.","[Wuebker, Ansgar] Univ Witten Herdecke, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Wuebker, Ansgar] Rhein Westfal Inst Wirtschaftsfororschung, Hlth Devis, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Zwakhalen, Sandra M.

Overall, a 1% increase in base salary for teachers of a particular experience level increases the proportion of the targeted teachers hired by 0.04-0.08 percentage points. Pay increases have the largest effect on hire rates among teachers with 2-3 years of experience and the effect diminishes with experience. I show that higher teacher salaries provide a dual benefit of retaining and attracting a more effective distribution of teachers. Districts may also improve student achievement growth at no cost by reshaping their salary schedules so that they are increasing and concave in teacher experience. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Financialization of French non-financial corporations has increased their dependence on earnings through financial channels, and diminished labor bargaining power in income distribution. We examine the effects of these financial revenues on wage share using a panel data model of 6980 French non-financial firms. We conclude that increased dependence on financial profits is likely to decrease wage share in non-financial corporations. Moreover, this variable is more influential in our model than the other variables usually identified by the literature as determinants of functional income distribution, such as trade openness or labor market institutions. Of the determinants traditionally emphasized by the literature, only technological change has a greater impact than financialization.","[Alvarez, Ignacio] Univ Valladolid Spain, Dept Appl Econ, Segovia, Spain; [Alvarez, Ignacio] Complutense Inst Interat Studies ICEI, Madrid, Spain",,"Alvarez, I (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid Spain, Dept Appl Econ, Segovia, Spain.",nacho.alvarez@icei.ucm.es,"ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/AAR-3498-2020; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/F-7039-2016","ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447; ALVAREZ, IGNACIO/0000-0003-2801-3447",,,,,55,87,93,12,90,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

First, by matching the duration of the payments with the duration of the environmental benefits, survey respondents are spared from performing complicated present value calculations. Second, willingness to pay (WTP) estimates from CV surveys that include ongoing annual payments best match WTP estimates obtained using travel cost surveys. Third, respondents are less likely to face binding mental budget constraints with ongoing annual payments than with a larger one-time payment. In addition, respondents' discount rates may be estimated by collecting non-hypothetical, individual time preference data as part of the valuation survey. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

I investigate policies aimed at externalities for present-biased consumers. Optimal policy includes an instrument to correct the externality and an instrument to correct the present bias. Either instrument can be an incentive-based policy (e.g. a tax on fuel economy) or a command-and-control policy (e.g. a fuel economy mandate). Under consumer heterogeneity, a command-and-control policy may dominate an incentive-based policy. Calibrated to the US automobile market, simulation results suggest that the second-best gasoline tax is 3-30% higher than marginal external damages. The optimal price policy includes a gasoline tax set about equal to marginal external damages and a fuel economy tax that increases the price of an average non-hybrid car by about $550-$2200 relative to the price of an average hybrid car.

A key concern, however, is how these students will perform. This paper examines the relationship between high school quality and student success in college. Using administrative data from the University of Texas at Austin, we take advantage of the unique policy environment provided by Texas's Top 10% automatic admissions law, which has not only increased the diversity of high schools in the state that send students to the university, but also provides an admission criteria based on a sole observable characteristic: high school class rank. We find that high school characteristics do affect student performance, and these effects seem more pronounced for women and low-income students. In addition, there is little evidence that the effects of high school characteristics decay over students' time in college. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our objective was to estimate the potential epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of an LAIV-based extension of the influenza vaccination programme to healthy children in Germany. An age-structured dynamic model of influenza transmission was developed and combined with a decision-tree to evaluate different vaccination strategies in the German health care system. Model inputs were based on published literature or were derived by expert consulting using the Delphi technique. Unit costs were drawn from German sources. Under base-case assumptions, annual routine vaccination of children aged 2-17 years with LAIV assuming an uptake of 50 % would prevent, across all ages, 16 million cases of symptomatic influenza, over 600,000 cases of acute otitis media, nearly 130,000 cases of community-acquired pneumonia, nearly 1.7 million prescriptions of antibiotics and over 165,000 hospitalisations over 10 years. The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was a,not sign1,228 per quality-adjusted life year gained from a broad third-party payer perspective (including reimbursed direct costs and specific transfer payments), when compared with the current strategy of vaccinating primarily risk groups with the conventional trivalent inactivated vaccine. Inclusion of patient co-payments and indirect costs in terms of productivity losses resulted in discounted 10-year cost savings of a,not sign3.4 billion. In conclusion, adopting universal influenza immunisation of healthy children and adolescents would lead to a substantial reduction in influenza-associated disease at a reasonable cost to the German statutory health insurance system. On the basis of the epidemiological and health economic simulation results, a recommendation of introducing annual routine influenza vaccination of children 2-17 years of age might be taken into consideration.","[Damm, Oliver; Greiner, Wolfgang] Univ Bielefeld, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Bielefeld Sch Publ Hlth, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany; [Eichner, Martin] Univ Tubingen, Dept Med Biometry, Tubingen, Germany; [Eichner, Martin] Epimos GmbH & Co KG, Dusslingen, Germany; [Rose, Markus Andreas] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Pulmonol Allergy & Infect Dis, Childrens Hosp, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Knuf, Markus] Dr Horst Schmidt Klin, Dept Children & Adolescents, Wiesbaden, Germany; [Knuf, Markus] Univ Med Mainz, Paediat Infect Dis, Mainz, Germany; [Wutzler, Peter] Univ Jena, Inst Virol & Antiviral Therapy, Univ Hosp, Jena, Germany; [Liese, Johannes Guenter] Univ Childrens Hosp Wurzburg, Dept Paediat Infect Dis, Wurzburg, Germany; [Krueger, Hagen] AstraZeneca GmbH, Dept Med, Wedel, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen; Eberhard Karls University Hospital; Goethe University Frankfurt; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz; Friedrich Schiller University of Jena; University of Wurzburg; AstraZeneca,"Damm, O (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Bielefeld Sch Publ Hlth, Univ Str 25, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany.",oliver.damm@uni-bielefeld.de,,"Kruger, Hagen/0000-0002-5208-7414",Astra-Zeneca Germany,Astra-Zeneca Germany(AstraZeneca),Funding for this study was provided by Astra-Zeneca Germany.

Theoretically, the effect is ambiguous, as the public health insurance expansion and low-income subsidies would be expected to increase mobility, but the employer mandate and price effects could either increase or decrease mobility depending on the relative impacts on an individual's current job and the attractiveness of other modes of employment or retirement. Utilizing data from tax returns that span 2002-10, in which job changes are identified using employer information reported on W-2 forms, we estimate the impact of the Massachusetts reform using a difference-in-differences approach, comparing the prevalence of job changes in Massachusetts to those of a comparison group, while controlling for individual fixed effects. The estimates suggest the Massachusetts reform generally did not have a significant impact on job separations overall, though it may have increased separations from primary jobs among married women. There is evidence, however, that mobility increased among low-income married couples, young married men, and older married women.","[Heim, Bradley T.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Lurie, Ithai Z.] US Dept Treasury, Washington, DC 20226 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; United States Department of the Treasury,"Heim, BT (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",heimb@indiana.edu,,,,,,,32,13,13,0,12,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

However, in the past years, the wood input increased in some wood processing sectors in Germany whereas their value added decreased. Against this background we aimed to decompose changes in input and output in order to isolate the effects of value added and to determine the role of wood as intermediate input of the sawmilling and wood processing industries. We regarded the years 2006 compared to 2002 and 2010 compared to 2006. Based on statistical data, a decomposition method was developed that determines changes in the product price, the intermediate input price, the growth and the structural effect. Furthermore, a special focus was set on the impacts of price and quantity changes of the input of wood-based products. We found out, that the growth effect is connected to the wood input in the sawmilling industry in the considered years. Also, it became apparent that a higher input of wood and wood products does not automatically lead to an increase in value added. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on the 2005-6 National Family Health Survey III, a nationally representative dataset from India, the analysis illustrates that married women who experienced spousal violence are more likely to be employed and are also more likely to work for cash remuneration and be employed year-round. These results may appear to suggest that spousal violence is associated with higher likelihood of married women seeking financial self-reliance. However, investigation of who decides how to spend women's earnings reveals that Indian women who experienced spousal violence are less likely to have a say in that vital decision, which suggests that women who experience spousal violence may also be more susceptible to financial exploitation. The evidence further indicates a need for caution among analyses that uniformly embrace employment as a financial empowerment tool for women.","Univ Utah, Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Bhattacharya, H (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",haimanti.bhattacharya@utah.edu,"Bhattacharya, Haimanti/K-9789-2019","Bhattacharya, Haimanti/0000-0002-3157-482X",,,,,70,27,30,0,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Instead, they are exposed to economics research early and often, allowing them to see and experience the potential of economics training to explore a variety of interesting questions and career possibilities.

Toward this end, we examine the impact of endogenous health insurance coverage, which creates variation in the prices of medical care across individuals as well as a change in the relative price of nonmedical health inputs. Specifically, we analyze the decisions of individuals with diabetes to monitor, treat, and manage their condition and their subsequent health outcomes. Diabetics can experience serious or fatal complications without regular monitoring (of blood glucose and other indicators of disease severity) and, in some cases, prescription medication. These activities can present a significant financial burden that could be substantially attenuated by health insurance. Through cross-price effects, insurance may also influence important nonmedical input choices such as exercise and diet. Using a sample of nonelderly diabetics from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we jointly estimate demand equations for health insurance, medical treatment, lifestyle decisions, and health, controlling for their common unobserved determinants. We find that insurance with drug coverage leads to better adherence to diabetic care guidelines. There is, however, some evidence of ex ante moral hazard: those covered by insurance with a drug plan show slightly lower probabilities of exercising regularly.","[Fout, Betty Tao] Abt Associates Inc, Bethesda, MA USA; [Gilleskie, Donna B.] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA",ABT Associates; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Gilleskie, DB (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",donna_gilleskie@unc.edu,,"Gilleskie, Donna/0000-0002-1278-7707",,,,,44,2,2,2,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Where such conflict arises, this paper argues that proper treaty interpretation requires that trade obligations, as the 'harder' version of law, would take precedence over conflicting tobacco rules.

The difference of concepts of sustainability of system in the specified theories is also shown. Showing that in the existing economic theory crisis is considered as the undesirable phenomenon and, therefore, the primary method of work in this direction are attempts to prevent or suppress crisis. In the theory of self-organization crisis is considered necessary and an unavoidable stage of development of open system. Therefore some of the development trends of the social and economic policy should be: taking the necessity of crisis into account; preparation of the system to the crisis; moving social and economic processes into necessity direction during manifested crisis. The social and economic crises which became frequent recently convincingly testify to need to change of methodological approaches for the analysis of behavior of social and economic systems. New approaches have to consider not only the current stage of development of the system and consider it in dynamics, but also consider structure of the system, and also structure of the processes proceeding in it.

Our analysis explores the cost-effectiveness of systematically optimized (SO, 3 times a year) vs. non-systematically optimized (NSO, less than 3 times a year) CRT, whatever the echo optimization method used (manual or SonR (R) automatic). A longitudinal cohort model was developed to predict clinical and economic outcomes for SO vs. NSO strategies over 5 years. The analysis was performed from the payer perspective. Data from CLEAR study post-hoc analysis was used with 199 pts with CRT pacemaker (CRT-P). The main economic outcome measure was incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) expressed as cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained. To assess the impact of data uncertainty, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The model also predicts outcomes for the two optimization strategies for CRT-D therapy vs. optimal medical treatment (OPT). Results: At 1 year, ICERs for SO CRT vs. NSO CRT-P range between (sic) 22,226 (Spain) and (sic) 26,977 (Italy). Therefore, on the basis of a Willingness-To-Pay of (sic) 30,000 per QALY, the SO method develops into a cost effective strategy from 1 year, onwards. These favorable outcomes are supported by the sensitivity analysis. Systematic optimization of CRT-D might also improve the cost-effectiveness of this device therapy by 27 % to 30 % dependent on the country analyzed, at 5 years. Conclusions: Our economic evaluation shows promising health economic benefits associated with SO CRT. These preliminary findings need further confirmation.","[Banz, Kurt] OUTCOMES Int Ltd, Malzgasse 9, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland; [Delnoy, Peter Paul] Isala Klin, Zwolle, Netherlands; [Billuart, Jean Renaud] Sorin CRM, Clamart, France",Isala Clinics,"Banz, K (通讯作者)，OUTCOMES Int Ltd, Malzgasse 9, CH-4052 Basel, Switzerland.",kurt.banz@outcomes.ch,,,Sorin CRM SAS,Sorin CRM SAS,This analysis was sponsored by Sorin CRM SAS.,,26,2,2,0,0,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

It is a new decision making technique that generalized the OWD measure, having been proved suitable to deal with the situation where the given information is represented in exact numerical values.

Firstly, we develop some distance measures for intuitionistic uncertain linguistic sets, including the intuitionistic uncertain linguistic weighted distance (IULWD) measure, the intuitionistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted distance (IULOWD) measure, the intuitionistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted Hamming distance (IULOWHD) measure, the intuitionistic uncertain linguistic ordered weighted Euclidean distance (IULOWED) measure, the intuitionistic uncertain linguistic hybrid weighted distance (IULHWD) measure. These developed distance measures are very suitable to deal with the situation where the input arguments are represented in intuitionistic uncertain linguistic sets.

Prediction models were developed by application of the logistic regression with different specification.","[Bielikova, Tatiana] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Bansk Bystrica 97590, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bieliková, T (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Tajovskeho 10, Bansk Bystrica 97590, Slovakia.",tatiana.bielikova@umb.sk,,,projects VEGA [1/0647/14],projects VEGA,The contribution was prepared in the framework of the projects VEGA No. 1/0647/14 - Variant methods of the financial health prediction of enterprises in terms of dynamic economic environment.,,13,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,62,69,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500008,0

There are structural impediments to transdisciplinarity such as university structures, publication requirements and funding preferences that perpetuate disciplinary differences and researchers often lack transdisciplinary experience and expertise. In this paper we present a heuristic that aims to encourage researchers to think about their current research as performance and then imagine different performances, with the view to encouraging reflection and creativity about the transdisciplinary potential and dilemmas. The heuristic is inspired by the metaphor of performance that Erving Goffman uses to understand everyday, face-to-face interactions. The heuristic includes scaffolding for imagining research as performance through a transdisciplinary lens, a suggested process for using the tool, and examples based on the every day research projects. The paper describes the application of the heuristic in a graduate masterclass, reflecting on whether it does indeed 'prompt' transdisciplinary research. Limitations and lessons learned for further refinement of the heuristic are also included. The authors conclude that the heuristic has a range of uses including for self-reflection, and as a practical learning tool that can also be used at the start of integrative research projects.

Currently, evaluations performed by the business environment on efficiency concern to an ever greater extent human health and environmental, aspects which have to be taken into account in order to ensure sustainable development. Knowledge of demographic trends is important for characterization of consumption and analysis of all phases of production. The two aspects, demographic and sustainable business enjoy a wide literature, but their relationship has not been widely debated. The link between sustainable business and demographic issues can be analyzed through the labor market. Therefore, our work captures demographic characteristics that influence the sustainable business model, in this respect taking into account aspects concerning labor productivity, education level and availability for innovation.","[Burghelea, Cristina] Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela; Serban, Andreea Claudia; Vuta, Mariana] Acad Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Burghelea, C (通讯作者)，Hyperion Univ, Bucharest, Romania.",crystachy@yahoo.com; aceleanu_mirela@yahoo.com; andre_serban@yahoo.com; mariavuta@yahoo.fr,"Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/GYU-2760-2022; Serban, Andreea Claudia/M-8642-2015; mariana, vuta/ABC-8195-2020","Serban, Andreea Claudia/0000-0001-9361-2345; mariana, vuta/0000-0002-1165-4021",,,,,23,0,0,1,11,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,131,138,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200017,0

Such differences may result in different collective decisions even when individual preferences are similar. The relation between voting rules and redistribution provides an illustration for this phenomenon. Even when accounting for various country characteristics and social preferences, proportional systems seem to spend more on redistribution. The explanation lies in the different incentives created by the voting rules, namely the size of electoral districts and the type of public spending they encourage. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this paper I analyze the 2008 consolidated version of IAS/IFRS as published on the EU site. I found that the translation of some words, formulas, sentences could be improved. For a list of 16 items, I propose different Romanian version. These proposals are based on my knowledge of Romanian language and of the Romanian accounting but also on the use as intermediate of French version of IAS / IFRS. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Their interconnection with the controlling system of a firm multiples its assets in terms of the synergy effect, facilitates implementation of controlling functions and thus increases the efficiency of management and the productivity of the entire organization. For these purposes graphic model of operative controlling is created that represents these relations within four basic questions where, what, how and who. For each of these perspectives common interfaces are analysed and interdependence with process management and closely related management tools is interpreted.

However, it is being discouraged by a scientific reward system based on disciplinary logic. The disincentive is even stronger for junior scholars who should be developing the capabilities necessary for achieving long-term scientific excellence. Building on theories of the coordination of scientific communities and using the case of a research center of Kyoto University investigating the boundary between cell and material sciences, we aim to disentangle the interplay between institutional incentives and intrinsic motivation in the prioritization of TDR over monodisciplinary research. We find that, despite strong interest in TDR among scientists and the center's mission to promote this orientation, only a minority of scientists prioritize this approach. Choice of research strategy is associated with its perceived benefits for idea generation, publication opportunities, intellectual effort required, the costs of team coordination, and satisfaction with organizational resources. Furthermore, the propensity to prioritize TDR drops among scientists beginning their careers. Therefore, we recommend the development of evaluation schemes grounded in activity-based measures and the granting of permanent positions to scientists pursuing TDR. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Utilizing Foucault's reflections on 'state-phobia' as a source of inspiration, I show how an organization-phobia has gained a hold within Organization Theory (OT). By attending to the history of this organization-phobia, the paper argues that OT has become increasingly incapable of speaking about its core object. I show how organizations went from being conceptualized as entities of major importance to becoming theoretically deconstructed and associated with all kinds of ills. Through this history, organizations as distinct entities have been rendered so problematic that they have gradually come to be removed from the center of OT. The costs of this have been rather significant. Besides undermining the grounds that gave OT intellectual credibility and legitimacy to begin with, the organization-phobia resulting from this history has been implicated in dismantling organizations, and in making OT progressively irrelevant to a wider public.","[Lopdrup-Hjorth, Thomas] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Lopdrup-Hjorth, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",tlh.ioa@cbs.dk,,,,,,,101,7,7,4,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The performed study highlighted the fact that within the analysed period, the weight of innovative SMEs in the total SMEs doubled. Within the same period of time the number of Romanian SMEs that initiated research-development-innovation projects unfinished and/or abandoned went up significantly, which proves that the initiatives of these businesses in developing ever more complex and riskier research projects multiplied.

The Mother Earth feeds humans generously, but to certain limits of her carrying capacity, which can't be exceeded. The three goals: economic efficiency, ecosystem protection, and social fairness are not compatible, they stand rather in opposition one to another.. We share one world, therefore we have tojointly solve our common problems. This requires a general platform for policy making, which in turn requires envisioning the future.

Nonetheless, the concept of reflexivity underlying transdisciplinary research is not sufficiently clarified and, as a result, is hardly able to support the development of social learning and social experimentation processes needed to support sustainability transitions. In particular, the concept of reflexivity is often restricted to building social legitimacy for the results of a new kind of 'complex systems science', with little consideration of the role of nonscientific expertise and social innovators in the design of the research practice itself. The key hypothesis of the paper is that transdisciplinary research would benefit from adopting a pragmatist approach to reflexivity. Such an approach relates reflexivity to collective processes of problem framing and problem solving through joint experimentation and social learning that directly involve the scientific and extra-scientific expertise. To test this hypothesis, the paper proposes a framework for analysing the different types of reflexive processes that play role in transdisciplinary research. The main conclusion of the analysis is the need to combine conventional consensus-oriented deliberative approaches to reflexivity with more open-ended, action-oriented transformative approaches.

We started from the premise that streamlining the activities depends on the extent to which tourism units prove their ability to retain customers. For this, the units must take into account primarily their customer satisfaction with the services they received. In our study we stopped at an innovative way to consult and take into account the opinion of tourism establishments clients: the crowdsourcing.

The aim of the article is to provide an in-depth analysis of problems related to performance indicators and their application in policy development in Latvia. By analysing 46 white papers(1) being into force since December 1, 2014, the author identified major tendencies regarding performance measurement in Latvia. The selected white papers were researched in the following aspects whether they apply composite index, the established performance measurement system is followed, and if the regional dimension is included in the white papers. The author concludes that the current white papers do not reflect the use of indicators for selecting policy strategies or monitoring policies. Instead, the current white papers are mostly designed to resolve narrow and very specific policy problems; and white papers also lack cross-sectorial coordination, both within one policy field as well as in a wider perspective.","Univ Latvia, Fac Social Sci, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Reinholde, I (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Social Sci, Riga, Latvia.",iveta.reinholde@lu.lv,,,,,,,18,3,3,0,0,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,50,59,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400005,0

Universities have assumed an expanded role in local economic and social development especially in institutionally fragile countries and have helped to initiate a slow, but effective process of development within communities and territories, as the evidence collected in two Balkan post-conflict countries, Croatia and Kosovo, will demonstrate. By leveraging insights from the literature on Community Governance, Community Resilience, social capital, capacity/capability building, and sustainable development, this paper emphasises a socially embedded and community-centric approach to development of territories as a strategy to transform post-conflict situations into contexts of community empowerment. On these premises, the working hypothesis this paper will be based upon is that Universities are actors, amongst the others, which most likely drive territories and their communities towards resilience though steering processes of learning and adaptation, though the shaping of a knowledge based economy and through promoting sustainable development by facilitating the increase of social capital stocks. The paper's research question is conducted through a methodology based on a qualitative investigation that has been carried out in two countries of the Balkan region both affected by the Balkan's War which ended in 1995. Central to the transformations developed in the aftermath of the end of the war is the emergence of new approaches for the country's resilience. The establishment of network-based relationships amongst actors helped triggering processes pursuant strategies of development supported by the role played by Universities that have helped creating the building up of social capital within the communities. The paper, moreover, will seek to demonstrate that social capital leveraged by Universities plays a significant role in compensating for the weaknesses of formal structures responsible for public education, community empowerment being a crucial variable affecting policy change processes resulting from the modernization agenda. Therefore, the argument that Universities could be strengthened or weakened by informal networks connecting formal institutions with the wider society and for that reason they should be studied.","[Ricciardelli, Alessandra] Univ LUM Jean Monnet, Fac Econ, Publ Management & Policies, Bari, Italy",Lum Jean Monnet University,"Ricciardelli, A (通讯作者)，Univ LUM Jean Monnet, Fac Econ, Publ Management & Policies, Bari, Italy.",ricciardelli@lum.it,,,,,,,45,0,0,1,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,351,373,,,,,,23,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000032,0

While the mortality can be modelled based on known conditions (decrease of the probability of death in time and increase of life expectancy, which can be applied to the most of advanced populations in general), in the case of fertility the approach must be slightly different. Changes in the level and distribution of fertility are characterized by social conditions, lifestyle and also by decision makings of individuals. There are studies that try (using the principal components method and stochastic trend) to find a model that explains and predicts the future development of age-specific fertility rates. Our study utilize also this approach. The aim of this paper is to identify appropriate form of the Lee-Carter model based on the data set of Czech females' age-specific fertility rates. It will be used for modelling a matrix of age-specific fertility rates of Czech females. The predictions of these rates up to the year 2050 will be constructed. It is required that the shape of the distribution of predicted fertility rates follows the current data (which is not respected in some studies). The model also has to respect the trend that arises from past data. Predictions which are output of this paper provide lower values than expectations published by Eurostat. As our projections of age-specific fertility rates of Czech females are predicted by modern and sophisticated system, it is possible to claim that the future would be more pessimistic than Eurostat expects.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Stat & Probabil, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,799,804,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900137,0

Application of the linear programming generally enables the managers to maximize the profit and minimize the costs on the other hand and of course, it is necessary to involve the ecological costs in their calculations. This contribution presents the results of the pilot research focused on the use of operations research methods in this field. The authors of the contribution primarily took into consideration the linear programming, particularly application and results achieved by this method. The analysis was carried out and the environmental aspects of activities of the company were evaluated particularly production of CO2 emissions.

In this paper, several similarity measures for HCA are applied and resulting clusters are further compared with the ones gotten by CATPCA. Their quality is determined by the within-cluster mutability coefficient, and by judgments of researchers. For the comparison of approaches mentioned above, datasets from economic and sociological researches conducted in the Czech Republic in 2014 were used.

Now it acts as a famous umbrella brand and also as a pattern for tourism development in other parts of the country. The Golden Ring sites still keep up high tourism and recreational attractiveness, but the inbound and domestic tourist flows are declining. In the last decade this route is subjected to significant changes that lead to its functional and spatial transformation. The article discusses various factors which cause these changes. The research methodology is based on a combination of systems approach, geographical and statistical studies and spatial construction management. The research results show that the original circle route is now replaced by a number of radial or single-point routes. The former multi-day tour is converted to short, even single-day trips. At the same time new tourism attractions and new amenities along with new forms of tourism activities emerge in this region. In addition to traditional Russian historical towns and museums innovative tourism clusters appear now in different parts of the Golden Ring area. At the same time parts of the former Golden Ring route are integrated in new regional tourism products. Transformation of tourist destinations together with the changes in consumers' interests and demand had notably diversified types of tourism in the Golden Ring of Russia. If formerly this route was aimed mainly at cultural tourism, now there are ecotourism, leisure, family, business, event and other types of tourism developing here. But it is necessary to differentiate regional tourism destinations by working out their distinct tourism specialization, to distinguish and diversify local tourism brands and programs.","[Tulskaya, Nadezhda; Aigina, Ekaterina] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow 117234, Russia",Lomonosov Moscow State University,"Tulskaya, N (通讯作者)，Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Moscow 117234, Russia.",,"Aigina, Ekaterina V/C-2652-2015; Tulskaya, Nadezhda/L-5821-2015","Aigina, Ekaterina V/0000-0002-3832-169X; Tulskaya, Nadezhda/0000-0002-0386-511X",,,,,4,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,883,889,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200113,0

By Bayesian belief update, acquirers are able to tell their partners' type posteriorly and then JV dissolution can occur Empirical tests based on US JV data reveal that only manufacturers gain from JV strategy and hierarchical ownership structure is helpful to enhancing acquirers' performances.

One aspect of this research is the comparison of linear and non-linear analytical structures of physics with analytical structures of economics. The application of methods of non-relativistic mechanics in microeconomics presented in this work aims to derive motion equation for price which describes non-chaotic as well as chaotic fluctuations of price on a market with nearly perfect competition. The question remains whether the import of concepts from physics to economics is merely an applied metaphor, or actually a modification of the analytical structure of economics. This is also one of the reasons for comparing the analytical structures of both scientific disciplines. To enable such a comparison, work has begun on a principle of correspondence between economic variables and the physical variables used in one of the most highly developed disciplines of classical physics, classical non-relativistic mechanics. Methodological approaches of theoretical physics are used to derive the first step for constructing a principle of correspondence between microeconomics variables and kinematic variables of non-relativistic mechanics: the path corresponds to the instantaneous commodity price; the jerk in mechanics corresponds to the price jerk. Assuming that the market value of the commodity is fully determined exclusively by the value of the instantaneous commodity price, the price jerk equation acquires the form that corresponds to the non-relativistic equation for jerk in mechanics, following from Newton's second law of motion. During the past four decades, great efforts have been made to understand chaotic dynamics in greater detail. Both the geometric theory of dynamics, which analyzes dynamic systems from the perspective of their flow in phase space, and its numeric counterpart, have proven to be powerful tools on the road to this success. For three-dimensional non-linear dynamic systems, the minimal functional forms required to generate a chaotic flow are discussed. Minimal chaotic dynamics is also investigated from the viewpoint of jerky dynamics. Jerky dynamics is founded on the well known fact that any explicit ordinary differential equation of order n > 1 can be replaced by an equivalent system of n first-order differential equations. This means that a scalar third-order ordinary differential equation can be transformed into a dynamic system although the contrary does not hold in general. For this reason, jerky dynamics should also be able to investigate non-chaotic as well as chaotic development over time. Elementary jerky dynamics can also be found in economics, as shown in this paper. In this paper price jounce and price crackle are defined. The paper also focuses on factual research in bibliographic and biographical databases showing that representatives of the Czech School of Economics took a leading role in the methodological use of applied and theoretical physics in the basic economic research, especially in the second half of the twentieth century.","[Zeithamer, Tomas R.] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zeithamer, TR (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Math, Ekon 957, Prague 14800 4, Czech Republic.",zeith@vse.cz,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1198,1206,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800116,0

This study aimed at estimating the economic values of selected ecosystem services of the PA and the direct on-site REDD+ opportunity costs to communities. We found that the PA stocks 32.8 million m(3) (627 m(3)/ha) of standing trees with a stumpage value of about $ 19.1 million (364 $/ha), 64.3 million tCO(2)e (1230 tCO(2)e/ha) of carbon worth of $379.5 million ($7257/ha), and 6380 tons of nutrients worth of 0.64 million USD. The direct on-site REDD + opportunity cost for conserving the PA until 2042 was about 6.7-24.1 $/tCO(2)e (0.22-0.80 $/tCO(2)e per year) in net present value. From our field observation of the PA, we did not see a buffer zone that separates the PA from the surrounding land uses. Establishing a buffer zone is very important for the sustainability of the PA. Such an effort, however, should take in to account the opportunity costs to the rural communities associated with possible displacement. Thus, the results of the study could be used as important input for designing policies that will reinforce the sustainability of the Ankasa PA and other conservation sites in Ghana.

The paper sets the goal of boundless profession of forest economics and suggests three key areas of research: (i) economic models that interweave other-regarding and non-cooperative self-interest preferences; (ii) rigorous analysis and synthesis of externalities and development of new economic approaches to address the diversity of interrelated property rights of complex ecosystems; and (iii) treating markets and political institutions as entangled institutions.

My main concern is the application of rather marginal approaches to address future potentials for sustainable urban development variously referred to as holistic, integral, transdisciplinary or meta theoretical. What characterizes them is an attempt to acknowledge many different types of knowledge, including what is typically called Eastern and Western approaches to science, culture, the arts and also perennial wisdom traditions. In spite of this apparent neglect, these approaches have been noticeably linked in the past to futures studies by several scholars. A key argument is that as much as we recognize the outer built environment of cities to address major challenges of our times like the ecological crisis, we also need to integrate the much more subtle interior dimensions of human existence to address them adequately. On the one hand, this research inquires about the potentials of social urban pioneers and change agents, intentional communities and such transnational initiatives like the transition town movement, which are discussed within the context of their global relevance in developed and developing countries illustrated by the case of India. While on the other hand, it is a quest to develop a conceptual-theoretical approach to what may be called integral transformative urban development planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper is one of the first to investigate whether education has not only a positive impact on legitimate, but also on illegitimate activities. We use as a case study one of the longest running criminal corporations in history: the Italian-American mafia. Its most successful members were capable businessmen, orchestrating crimes that required abilities that might be learned at school: extracting the optimal rent when setting up a racket, weighting interests against default risk when starting a loan sharking business or organizing supply chains, logistics and distribution when setting up a drug dealing system. We address this question by comparing mobsters to a variety of samples drawn from the United States 1940 Population Census, including a sample of their closest (non-mobster) neighbors. We document that mobsters have one year less education than their neighbors on average. We find that mobsters have significant returns to education of 7.5-8.5%, which is only slightly smaller than their neighbors and 2-5 percentage points smaller than for U.S.-born men or male citizens. Mobster returns were consistently about twice as large as a sample of Italian immigrants or immigrants from all origin countries. Within that, those charged with complex crimes including embezzlement and bookmaking have the highest returns. We conclude that private returns to education exist even in the illegal activities characterized by a certain degree of complexity as in the case of organized crime in mid-twentieth century United States.

However, cross-border state investment has also grown. Weexamine government policies towards a prominent type of state investment-equity purchases by sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). We argue that policymakers in 'insider' corporate governance systems can see such investment as an attractive international source of patient capital to offset declines in traditional sources of patient capital. We compare Germany and France and show that policymakers actively welcome SWF investment. Policy is driven by coalitions of 'insiders' of the managements of large industrial firms and governments who seek passive patient capital and beneficial relationships with overseas investors. Thus, financial liberalization and internationalization can allow new sources of patient capital through overseas state investors.","[Thatcher, Mark] London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Vlandas, Tim] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 6UR, Berks, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Reading,"Thatcher, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.thatcher@lse.ac.uk,"Vlandas, Tim/AAH-2583-2019","Vlandas, Tim/0000-0003-4245-3932",Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science [2010-1103-03],Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science(Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Sciences (KFAS)),"Funding for the research came from a grant supported by the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science number 2010-1103-03, which is gratefully acknowledged.

However, NFPs do not always reconcile conflicting perspectives or produce legitimate strategies for sustainable forestry. Thus, further analysis of NFPs organization and processes is required, including exploration of effective means to address such challenges in early stages. These are key concerns of this paper, focusing on the first process to establish a Swedish NFP. Possibilities for an NFP to constitute a new arena for deliberation and consensus-building, producing forest policy statements and action plans considered legitimate by various stakeholders, are discussed. A number of key challenges are identified through a theoretical framework based on notions regarding the input and output legitimacy of collaborative governance. Analysis of official documentation, records of public hearings and stakeholder comments from the establishment phase in 2013-2015 suggests that the process will continually face a number of challenges, including balancing production and conservation values in the new bio-economy and securing equal stakeholder participation. The paper concludes with some remarks on the future of the NFP process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Futures studies have used simulation in different ways such as evaluating scenarios. Nonetheless, the central attributes of computer simulation such as reductionism-based abstraction, determinism and elimination of stakeholders are the main barriers of successful implementation of simulation in FS. In this paper, we would paint the plausible evolutionary panorama of futures of simulation in futures studies after looking at the role of simulation in FS so far. The possible mechanisms and partnerships required to be applied to pgrapple the above-mentioned difficulties will be enumerated and investigated. These, in three categories, comprise firstly, human-machine interactions such as quasi-game simulations, and scenario visualization, secondly, large-network simulations including crowd sourcing, and thirdly, simulation platforms for replication of emergence. Ergo, crafting a classification of simulation in futures studies and the possible developments will be the main contribution of this paper. A novel double diamond classification will be presented as well which reflects the past and plausible futures of simulation in futures studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the least able students, the correlation between the academic and labor market effectiveness of teachers turns out to be negative.","[Braga, Michela] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy; [Paccagnella, Marco] OECD, Paris, France; [Paccagnella, Marco] Bank Italy, Rome, Italy; [Pellizzari, Michele] Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland; [Pellizzari, Michele] CEPR, London, England; [Pellizzari, Michele] IZA, London, England",Bocconi University; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; University of Geneva; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Pellizzari, M (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, CH-1211 Geneva 4, Switzerland.;Pellizzari, M (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.;Pellizzari, M (通讯作者)，IZA, London, England.",michele.pellizzari@unige.ch,"Paccagnella, Marco/AAD-4777-2019","Paccagnella, Marco/0000-0003-3549-9190",,,,,40,9,11,2,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

The fall in the world interest rate weakens this weak Green Paradox effect, especially if intertemporal substitution is weak. Still, social damages from greenhouse gases drop if the fall in oil supply and cumulative emissions is strong enough. If the current carbon tax is set too low, the second-best future carbon tax is set below the first best too to mitigate adverse Green Paradox effects. Unilateral second-best optimal carbon taxes exceed the first-best taxes due to an import tariff component. The intertemporal terms of trade effects of the future carbon tax increase current and future tariffs and those of the current tax lower the current tariff. Finally, carbon leakage and globally altruistic and unilateral second-best optimal carbon taxes if non-Kyoto oil importers price carbon too low are analysed in a three-country model of the global economy.

High and increasing food prices can generate an immediate threat to the security of a household's food supply, thereby undermining population health. This paper aims to assess the precise effects of food price inflation on child health in developing countries. This paper employs a panel dataset covering 95 developing countries for the period 2001-2011 to make a comprehensive assessment of the effects of food price inflation on child health as measured in terms of infant mortality rate and child mortality rate. Focusing on any departure of health indicators from their respective trends, we find that rising food prices have a significant detrimental effect on nourishment and consequently lead to higher levels of both infant and child mortality in developing countries, and especially in least developed countries (LDCs). High food price inflation rates are also found to cause an increase in undernourishment only in LDCs and thus leading to an increase in infant and child mortality in these poorest countries. This result is consistent with the observation that, in lower-income countries, food has a higher share in household expenditures and LDCs are likely to be net food importing countries. Hence, there should be increased efforts by both LDC governments and the international community to alleviate the detrimental link between food price inflation and undernourishment and also the link between undernourishment and infant mortality.","[Lee, Hyun-Hoon] Kangwon Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Chunchon 200701, South Korea; [Lee, Suejin A.] Cornell Univ, Field Econ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Lim, Jae-Young] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Park, Cyn-Young] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Mandaluyong 1550, Philippines",Kangwon National University; Cornell University; Korea University; Asian Development Bank,"Lim, JY (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",hhlee@kangwon.ac.kr; sal278@cornell.edu; jylimecon@korea.ac.kr; cypark@adb.org,"Park, Cyn-Young/E-7489-2015","Park, Cyn-Young/0000-0002-9634-219X",Kangwon National University [C1010781-01-01],Kangwon National University,This study was supported by 2014 Research Grant from Kangwon National University (No. C1010781-01-01).,,44,14,15,3,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To examine whether adherence is associated with a long-term decrease in HCU. This is a retrospective cohort study of 1582 patients with CVD who enrolled in Maccabi Healthcare Services in Israel, initiating CVD medication therapy in 2006. Adherence was assessed by the proportion of days covered (PDC) with medications. Patients were defined as: non-adherent (PDC < 0.4), partially adherent (0.4 a parts per thousand currency sign PDC < 0.8), and fully adherent (PDC a parts per thousand yen0.8). HCU was estimated for 4 years following treatment initiation. Multivariable GEE models were used to analyze predictors of HCU. Model I included total adherence during the entire follow-up period as well as the interaction between this measure and the follow-up year. Model II included previous and current year's adherence as well as previous year's HCU cost. Both models were adjusted for potential confounders including: patient's age, gender, socioeconomic status, ownership of voluntary supplementary health insurance, and comorbidities. The median age of patients was 63 (69 % males). Fifty-four percent of patients (n = 860) were defined as adherent, 24 % as partially adherent and 22 % as non-adherent. Model I: the annual HCU costs of adherent patients decreased by 10 % following treatment initiation [rate ratio (RR) = 0.90, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.86-0.94, P < 0.001]. This decrease stemmed predominantly from reduction in hospitalization costs. No significant changes in annual costs following treatment initiation were observed among partially adherent (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI 0.90-1.10, P = 0.935) and non-adherent (RR = 0.98, 95 % CI 0.87-1.10, P = 0.681) patients. Model II: no temporal association was found between adherence and HCU. Adherence to CVD medications is relatively low. Adherence is associated with long-term decrease in healthcare expenditure. Exploring reasons for the high non-adherence and ways to improve adherence may optimize utilization of health systems' scarce resources.","[Simon-Tuval, Tzahit; Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hlth Syst Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Simon-Tuval, Tzahit; Greenberg, Dan] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Triki, Noa; Chodick, Gabriel] Maccabi Healthcare Serv, Div Med, Tel Aviv, Israel; [Chodick, Gabriel] Tel Aviv Univ, Sackler Fac Med, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Ben Gurion University; Ben Gurion University; Sackler Faculty of Medicine,"Simon-Tuval, T (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Guilford Glazer Fac Business & Management, Dept Hlth Syst Management, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.;Simon-Tuval, T (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Fac Hlth Sci, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",simont@bgu.ac.il,"Simon-Tuval, Tzahit/E-6328-2011","Simon-Tuval, Tzahit/0000-0003-4518-7828; /0000-0002-5189-8995; Greenberg, Dan/0000-0002-6759-3985",Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research,Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research,"The authors would like to thank the Israel National Institute for Health Policy Research for supporting this study.

Severe dengue can lead to hospitalisation and death. This study was performed to assess the economic burden of hospitalisations for dengue from 2007 to 2011 in three French territories of the Americas where dengue is endemic (French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe). Methods Data on dengue-associated hospitalisations were extracted from the French national hospital administrative database, Programme de Medicalisation des Systemes dInformation (PMSI). The numbers of stays and the corresponding number of hospitalised patients were determined using disease-specific ICD-10 codes. Associated hospital costs were estimated from the payer perspective, using French official tariffs. Results Overall, 4183 patients (mean age 32 years; 51 % male) were hospitalised for dengue, corresponding to 4574 hospital stays. In nearly all hospital stays (98 %; 4471), the illness was medically managed and the mean length of stay was 4.3 days. The mean cost per stay was (sic)2522, corresponding to a total hospital cost of (sic)11.5 million over the 5 years assessed. The majority of hospitalisations (80 % of patients) and associated costs (75 % of total hospital costs) were incurred during two epidemics. Conclusion Severe dengue is associated with significant hospital costs that escalate during outbreaks.","[Uhart, M.] Global Hlth Sanofi Pasteur, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Blein, C.] HEVA, 186 Ave Thiers, F-69465 Lyon 06, France; [L'Azou, M.; Durand, L.] Sanofi Pasteur, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Thomas, L.] Ctr Hosp Univ, Emergency Dept, Fort De France 97200, Martinique, France",CHU Martinique,"Blein, C (通讯作者)，HEVA, 186 Ave Thiers, F-69465 Lyon 06, France.",cblein@hevaweb.com,"Thomas, Laurent/HHN-4511-2022","L'Azou Jackson, Maina/0000-0001-7753-0630",Sanofi-Pasteur,Sanofi-Pasteur,"This study was sponsored by Sanofi-Pasteur.

This study finds that since the mid 1980s, export growth in developing countries is associated with feminization in some countries and a defeminization in others. Focusing on Southeast Asia and Latin America, it uses a fixed-effects econometric model to test whether the technological conditions of production (labor or capital intensity) rather than export growth account for shifts in the female share of employment in manufacturing. It finds that the capital intensity of production, evidenced by shifts in labor productivity, is negatively and significantly related to shifts in the female share of employment in manufacturing, while exports are statistically insignificant. The study concludes that an anti-female bias exists in labor demand changes that result from output or employment shifts in developing countries when manufacturing becomes more capital intensive, a process likely related to industrial upgrading.","[Tejani, Sheba] New Sch, Studley Grad Program Int Affairs, 72 Fifth Ave,7 Floor, New York, NY 10011 USA; [Milberg, William] New Sch Social Res, 6 East 16th St,Suite 27, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School; The New School,"Tejani, S (通讯作者)，New Sch, Studley Grad Program Int Affairs, 72 Fifth Ave,7 Floor, New York, NY 10011 USA.;Milberg, W (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, 6 East 16th St,Suite 27, New York, NY 10011 USA.",tejanis@newschool.edu; MilbergW@newschool.edu,,,New School's Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis,New School's Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis,"We are grateful to Stephanie Barrientos, Gunseli Berik, Diane Elson, Teresa Ghilarducci, David Kucera, and Stephanie Seguino for advice and detailed background discussion.

This paper brings the organizational level into the analysis of work-family policy effects on female employees. We theorize that managers' evaluation of female employees' use of parental leave is shaped not only by policy content, but also by labour market structure and the dominant cultural model of household gender relations. Using Japan as a case study, we analyse in-depth interviews with human resource managers in 25 large firms and show that managers' implementation of parental leave and their evaluation of leave-takers occur within the context of norms about ideal employee behaviour in firm-internal labour markets and about the gendered division of care work. These conflicting norms produce managerial expectations that can only be met by a small number of women. The article contributes to theory and research on work-family policies and female employment outcomes in two ways: by demonstrating the critical role of managers, and by showing how labour market structure and associated work norms together with the dominant cultural understanding of household gender relations act as filters through which managers construct their evaluations of employees who take leave.","[Brinton, Mary C.] Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Mun, Eunmi] Amherst Coll, Dept Anthropol & Sociol, Amherst, MA 01002 USA",Harvard University; Amherst College,"Brinton, MC (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Dept Sociol, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",brinton@wjh.harvard.edu,,,,,,,84,32,32,1,46,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

It does so on the basis of interviews with editors of large publishing houses and regression analysis of a dataset that contains prices and their determinants of over 80 000 fiction books. We show that material properties such as the size, binding and number of pages of a book are the strongest predictors of price. This is surprising, because the actual paper and printing costs constitute only a small fraction of the sales price. Publishers, we argue, set prices as if material properties matter. The advantage of relying on these material properties is that publishers can manipulate them through their main pricing device, the profit and loss statement. Moreover, relying on materiality instead of quality when pricing goods allows publishers to create market order and to make their prices seem fair to consumers. In one respect, quality is factored into price as well: publishers use genre as a judgement device when setting prices. As a result, the dominant status hierarchy is reproduced through prices.","[Franssen, Thomas] Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Velthuis, Olav] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Social Sci Res, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; University of Amsterdam,"Franssen, T (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol Studies, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",t.p.franssen@fsw.leidenuniv.nl,,"Franssen, Thomas/0000-0002-4852-8862",,,,,57,19,19,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

However, in most countries such cooperation is not widespread. The purpose of this paper is to explore the question why forest owners' cooperation is not a common practice. We do it by exploring the institutional barriers of cooperation. Based on an Estonian case example we find that the formal institutions reflect mainly the economic aspects of cooperation. The informal institutions, however, are more diverse and often do not relate to the formal ones. Therefore, a number of institutional barriers influences forest owners' decision-making towards cooperation. If policies and policy implementation fail to tackle these barriers then policy goals might not be met and cooperation might not be enhanced. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using administrative data from the largest sickness fund in Germany, this study was designed to estimate the effect of institutionalization on the drug intake of the frail elderly. Difference-in-differences propensity score matching techniques were used to compare drug prescriptions for the frail elderly who entered a nursing home with those who remained in the outpatient care system; findings suggest that nursing home residents receive more doses of antipsychotics, antidepressants, and analgesics. The potential overprescription correlates with estimated drug costs of about a,not sign87 million per year.","[Stroka, Magdalena A.] RWI Essen, Essen, Germany; [Stroka, Magdalena A.] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Dept Econ, Univ Str 150, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Stroka, Magdalena A.] WINEG Sci Inst TK Benefit & Efficiency Hlth Care, Hamburg, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Ruhr University Bochum,"Stroka, MA (通讯作者)，RWI Essen, Essen, Germany.",Magdalena.Stroka@rub.de,,,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Helpful comments by Thomas Bauer, Hendrik Schmitz, and participants of the Annual Meeting of the DDGO (Bayreuth) are gratefully acknowledged.

We find that financial development plays a significant role in dampening the volatility of macroeconomic growth rate, but up to a limit. The more the interest rate is liberalized, the more likely that financial development can stabilize the economy. Particularly, interest rate liberalization has a more positive influence on emerging and developing countries. Financial development and interest rate liberalization can also alleviate the influence of external shocks. They mutually enhance their functions as economic stabilizers.","[Yang, Gongyan; Liu, Hongzhong] Liaoning Univ, Sch Int Studies, 58 Daoyi South St, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China",Liaoning University,"Yang, GY (通讯作者)，Liaoning Univ, Sch Int Studies, 58 Daoyi South St, Shenyang 110136, Peoples R China.",ygy85@163.com,"Yang, Gongyan/ITT-5692-2023","Yang, Gongyan/0000-0001-9290-9032",Ministry of Education of China [13JJD810006]; Education Department of Liaoning Province [ZJ2014004],"Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Education Department of Liaoning Province",The authors acknowledge financial support from Ministry of Education of China (Grant no. 13JJD810006) and form The Education Department of Liaoning Province (Grant no.

We argue that the minimum wage will impact employment over time through changes in growth rather than an immediate drop in relative employment levels. We show that commonly used specifications in this literature, especially those that include state-specific time trends, will not accurately capture these effects. Using three separate state panels of administrative employment data, we find that the minimum wage reduces job growth over a period of several years.

Such methods do not create much problems when the number of parties to an FTA is small and the common parties in different FTAs are also limited in number. However, with the emergence of mega-FTAs, the issue about FTA-FTA conflicts has different dimension. For instance, within TPP's geographic coverage (the outer-FTA), there are some FTAs (the inner-FTAs). The existing methods fail to take into account the possible adverse effect to the outer-FTA. The article argues that it is desirable to coordinate the outer-FTA and its inner-FTAs. It suggests a procedural coordination to prioritize the application of the dispute settlement mechanism in the outer-FTA, with some exceptions to allow further trade liberalization and higher quality standards. It also suggests admitting third-party participation by other outer-PTA parties in the dispute settlement proceedings conducted under the inner-FTA. It further suggests outer-FTA serving as a platform to coordinate the substantive standards/rules so as to fundamentally resolve the difference.","[Lo, Chang-fa] Constitut Court, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lo, Chang-fa] Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Law, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lo, CF (通讯作者)，Constitut Court, Taipei, Taiwan.;Lo, CF (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Coll Law, Taipei, Taiwan.",lohuang@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,5,2,2,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

However, the direction of the relationship between the two is heavily dependent on which dimension of social capital is studied and which alcohol measure is used. In this paper, we examine the effect of social interactions and generalised trust on drinking in the general Danish population survey. Methods: Participants (n = 2569) were recruited as part of a larger study. The double-hurdle model for the volume of alcohol consumption and the multivariate logistic model for heavy episodic drinking were estimated. Results: We found evidence that social networking with male friends, membership in voluntary organisations, and generalised trust were significantly associated with the mean volume of alcohol consumption and heavy drinking. We also observed that social support at the community level had a buffering effect against heavy episodic drinking. Conclusions: The findings support previous findings in which social interactions and generalised trust were found to predict individuals' volume of drinking and heavy episodic drinking. However, the results varied across the indicators.","[Seid, Abdu Kedir] Aarhus Univ, Ctr Alcohol & Drug Res, Artillerivej 90,2, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Seid, AK (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Ctr Alcohol & Drug Res, Artillerivej 90,2, DK-2300 Copenhagen S, Denmark.",ak.crf@psy.au.dk,,"Seid, Abdu Kedir/0000-0003-2390-6860",Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research of Aarhus University,Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research of Aarhus University,"This study was part of a PhD project and support for this research was provided by Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research of Aarhus University.

There have been many comments for and against the dissemination of these incremental innovations but few papers have broached the subject from an econometric point of view, possibly because identification of metoo or follow-on drugs is not so obvious. This paper focuses on the impact of entry order on follow-on drug competition in the French market between the years 2001 and 2007. More precisely, this study examines the effects on market share of first entrants in the follow-on drug market and how this possible competitive advantage changes over time. First results are coherent with theoretical microeconomic issues concerning the importance of being first. We find evidence that first movers in the follow-on drug market have the ability to capture and maintain greater market share for a long period of time. The hierarchical market position of follow-on drugs does not seem to be affected by generic drug emergence. From a dynamic perspective, our analysis shows that market share is positively correlated with the ability of follow-on drugs to set prices higher than the average follow-on drug prices in a specific therapeutic class, which means that market power remains considerably important for first movers. Moreover, we found that the optimum level of innovation to maximize market share is the highest one.","[Andrade, Luiz Flavio] Univ Lyon 2, CNRS, GATE, F-69365 Lyon 07, France; [Andrade, Luiz Flavio; Sermet, Catherine; Pichetti, Sylvain] IRDES Paris, Paris, France",Universite Lyon 2; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Andrade, LF (通讯作者)，IRDES Paris, Paris, France.",andrade@gate.cnrs.fr; serrmet@irdes.fr; pichetti@irdes.fr,"Andrade, Luiz Felipe/N-1506-2018","Andrade, Luiz Felipe/0000-0002-4868-737X",,,,,48,11,13,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Results suggest that countercyclical capital requirements have a significant stabilizing effect on key macroeconomic variables, but mostly after financial shocks. Moreover, the bank capital regulatory policy and monetary policy interact, and this interaction is contingent on the type of shocks that drive the economic cycle. Finally, we analyze loss functions based on macroeconomic and financial variables to arrive at an optimal countercyclical regulatory policy in a class of simple implementable Taylor-type rules. Compared to bank capital regulatory policy, monetary policy is able to stabilize the economy more efficiently after real shocks. On the other hand, financial shocks require the regulator to be more aggressive in loosening/tightening capital requirements for banks, even as monetary policy works to counter the deviations of inflation from the target.","[de Resende, Carlos] Int Monetary Fund, ICD, Washington, DC 20341 USA; [Dib, Ali; Lalonde, Rene; Perevalov, Nikita] Bank Canada, Int Econ Anal, Ottawa, ON, Canada",International Monetary Fund; Bank of Canada,"de Resende, C (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20341 USA.",cderesende@imf.org,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Such evolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient climate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for enhanced carbon sequestration. For an infinitely long sequence of even-aged forest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due to the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore also involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and allow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of forest rotations. Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land, the initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length of the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters, the optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is released to the atmosphere upon harvest. In the near term, however, a higher growth rate of carbon price can lead to shorter rotations for forests that are already near their optimal rotation age, indicating that the effect of carbon price dynamics on optimal rotation is not entirely monotonous. The introduction of carbon pricing can also have a significant impact on bare land value, and in some considered parametrizations the land value was based solely on its potential to capture and store atmospheric carbon.

We will discuss discount curves, a tool for the valuation of deterministic cash-flows and forward curves, a tool for the valuation of linear cash-flows of an index. A curve is mainly a tool to interpolate certain basic financial products (zero coupon bonds, FRAs) with respect to maturity date and fixing date, such that it can be used to value products, which can be represented as linear functions of possibly interpolated values of a discount or forward curve. For this, the chosen interpolation method and interpolation entity plays an important role. Distinguishing forward curves from discount curves (representing the collateralization of the forward) motivates an alternative interpolation method, namely interpolation of the forward value (the product of the forward and the discount factor). In addition, treating forward curves as native curves (instead of representing them by pseudo-discount curves) will avoid other problems, like that of overlapping instruments. Besides the interpolation, we discuss the calibration of the curves for which we give a generic object-oriented implementation in Fries (Curve calibration. Object-oriented reference implementation, 2010-2015, [11]). We give some numerical results, which have been obtained using this implementation and conclude with a remark on how to define term-structure models (analog to a LIBOR market model) based on the definition of the performance index of an accrual account associated with a discount curve.","[Fries, Christian P.] DZ BANK AG, Frankfurt, Germany; [Fries, Christian P.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Math, Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Fries, CP (通讯作者)，DZ BANK AG, Frankfurt, Germany.",email@christian-fries.de,,,,,,,22,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,227,250,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_11,0.0,,,24,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500011,0

At the same time, the growth of shopping gross leasable area (GLA) in Estonia plays a significant role in supermarket saturation, because an increase in GLA leads to strong competition and disperses demand between all the retail players. The veracity of this research is supported by a sharp increase in the number of retail stores by different companies and supermarket chains. The purpose of this study is to analyse the formation of profit per employee of four major Estonian supermarket chains during the period 2010-2014 by using publicly available annual reports. Two methods efficiency matrix analysis and ranking of supermarket chains based on overall performance efficiency indicator (OPEI) were selected by the authors. Primarily, such methodology was chosen due to its multidimensional specifics and the fact that it can provide a systematic and comprehensive picture of a company's financial position and all financial ratios to be analysed in a clearly expressed relationship. In general, it was found that profit per employee fell in regard to both Maxima and Selver during the 2010-2014 period. In the case of Rimi, it was volatile and increased in 2013, but it decreased in 2014. Only in the case of Prisma did this component show positive growth during the 20102014 period. According to component analysis, profit margin mainly impacted changes in profit per employee for all the companies investigated. According to the OPEI, Selver had the highest performance efficiency overall, aside from 2014 when Prisma was the most efficient as it had the highest increase in profit per employee in 2014.","[Gofaizen, Mark; Siimann, Paavo; Alver, Jaan] Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Gofaizen, M (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Dept Accounting, Tallinn, Estonia.",,"Siimann, Paavo/AAA-4592-2020",,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,79,89,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700009,0

A serious outbreak in Germany and neighbouring countries in 2011 when 3,950 people were affected and 53 died, was induced by a novel strain of E. coli bacteria and suggested fresh vegetables as the source of infection. However, due to global food logistics it is an increasing challenge to trace back the source of infected food. A German-Dutch team of scientists analysed the EHEC outbreak from 2011 in order to provide new insights about risk assessment and crises control as well as communication infrastructure and strategies between responsible authorities and to the public, even across borders. Besides preventive measures to avoid contamination of horticultural products and to impede the spreading of human pathogens, the team analysed deficits in the field of crisis communication in order to develop a communication plan for decision-makers in a crisis situation. Technical innovations that can be used for decision-relevant information at the right time, with the required quality, will support the communication strategy.

These charges cover both current and future unexpected losses; the capital costs for derivatives transactions can become substantial if not prohibitive. At the same time, capital optimization through CDS hedging of counterparty risks will result in a hedge position beyond the economic risk (over-hedging) required to meet Basel II/III rules. In addition, IFRS accounting rules again differ from Basel, creating a mismatch when hedging CVA. Even worse, CVA hedging using CDS may introduce significant profit and loss volatility while satisfying the conditions for capital relief.

It does this in order to engage and extend work that has sought to defend bureaucratic forms of activity. The paper offers an empirical case study of how the civil servants' ethic of office [DuGay, P. (2008) `Max weber and the moral economy of office', Journal of Cultural Economy, vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 129-144] is reinforced by the identity of the social scientist. The use of social science in policy advice is a moment where the bureaucrats are able to distance themselves from political decision-making, thus reasserting an important aspect of civil service practice and identity. However, as the latter part of the article illustrates, the dynamics of cultural policy-making, in particular the use of economics, situate the role of social science as paradoxical. It is both supportive and corrosive of the bureaucratic ethic. This paradox is the basis for a critical perspective on the ethic of office as deployed in contemporary government.","[O'Brien, Dave] Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, Cultural Policy, London SE14 6NW, England",University of London; Goldsmiths University London,"O'Brien, D (通讯作者)，Univ London Goldsmiths Coll, Cultural Policy, London SE14 6NW, England.",d.obrien@gold.ac.uk,,"O'Brien, Dave/0000-0002-1991-756X",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H039171/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H039171/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,63,12,13,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Consideration is given to sand quality, water quality, congestion levels, and swimming safety conditions in the context of a choice experiment. The choice experiment conveys attribute levels almost entirely through pictures, and results suggest that this novel portrayal is well understood by respondents. Excessive congestion and water quality are regarded as the most important beach attributes, specifically the avoidance of poor water quality in favor of a chance to experience excellent water quality. Some evidence suggests that significantly different willingness to pay (WTP) exists among residents and tourists on Oahu with poor water quality and excellent water quality being more important to tourists, while residents place greater value on avoiding excessive congestion.","[Penn, Jerrod; Hu, Wuyang] Univ Kentucky, Dept Agr Econ, Lexington, KY 40546 USA; [Hu, Wuyang] Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Cox, Linda] Univ Hawaii Manoa, Dept Nat Resources & Environm Management, Honolulu, HI 96822 USA; [Kozloff, Lara] Univ Chicago, Biol Sci, Dept Med, Sect Hematol Oncol, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Kentucky; Huazhong Agricultural University; University of Hawaii System; University of Hawaii Manoa; University of Chicago,"Hu, W (通讯作者)，Huazhong Agr Univ, Coll Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",jerrod.penn@uky.edu; wuyang.hu@uky.edu; lcox@hawaii.edu; lara.kozloff@gmail.com,,,University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station [15-04-105]; Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific and Technological Self-Innovation Foundation [2012RC003],University of Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station; Huazhong Agricultural University Scientific and Technological Self-Innovation Foundation,"We are grateful for feedback and comments from Christian Vossler and Leigh Maynard.

In some companies quality is a synonym of conformity, i.e. meeting specified technical standards. The presented paper understands the quality in a wider scale than conformity and introduces a system of compliance as a tool supporting the operation of quality management system. The compliance system brings a more general view of conformity as it deals with conformity of external (e.g. governmental) and internal (company's) regulations, conformity of internal regulations with each other and conformity of real practice and regulations. In addition, it deals with arrangement and configuration of internal regulations and effectiveness of monitoring and warning processes in relation with the mentioned components of the compliance system. The paper summarizes research performed in a selected medium-sized company where strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of existing system were identified and introduces a newly outlined compliance system as a component of hierarchical system of strategies developed by BIBS Brno International Business School.","[Pospisil, Karel; Fric, Jindrich] CDV Transport Res Ctr, Brno, Czech Republic",Transport Research Centre CDV,"Pospisil, K (通讯作者)，CDV Transport Res Ctr, Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Fric, Jindrich/T-6285-2017; Pospisil, Karel/C-2785-2008","Pospisil, Karel/0000-0002-4773-0428","Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the project of Transport R&D Centre of the National Sustainability Programme I using the research infrastructure get from Operational Program Research, Development and Innovation project [LO1610, CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0064]","Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the project of Transport R&D Centre of the National Sustainability Programme I using the research infrastructure get from Operational Program Research, Development and Innovation project","The paper was produced under the support of the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports within the project of Transport R&D Centre No. LO1610 of the National Sustainability Programme I using the research infrastructure get from Operational Program Research, Development and Innovation project No. CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0064.",,8,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,323,330,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100043,0

Also many citizens that do not own forest are against clear-felling do to its harmful effects on amenity values and ecosystem services. Most studies on continuous cover forest management (CCF) deal with regular, steady state uneven-aged forests (Plenterwald), or with the conversion of stands into steady-state structure. However, people who want CCF management seldom want Plenterwald in particular; continuous tree cover would in most cases be sufficient. This type of management corresponds to the German Dauerwald concept This study compared the profitability of Plenterwald, Dauerwald and clear-cutting schedules in Finnish spruce forests. As expected, Dauerwald was more profitable than cutting schedules that converted the stand into steady-state Plenterwald structure. The difference in net present value decreased with increasing number of conversion cuttings. Clear-cutting and planting was more profitable than optimal CCF only in a mature initial stand when the planted spruces were assumed to grow 20% faster in dbh and height, compared to naturally regenerated spruces. In young, medium-aged and uneven-aged initial' stands, CCF was more profitable even when 20% tree breeding benefit was assumed in the plantation that was established in the clear-felling site.

The study is based on a comprehensive dataset of 4173 rural households from all the agro-ecological regions of Bhutan. The probit estimation on the factors influencing household participation indicates that educated, young and wealthy households are more likely to participate in the community forest management program. The propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to correct for potential sample selection bias that may arise due to systematic differences between the participant and non-participant households. The PSM analysis was carried out by employing different matching algorithms i.e. nearest neighbor matching, kernel-based matching, radius matching and mahalanobis metric matching. The empirical results indicate that participating households have higher income levels in the range of Ngultrum 2605-3169. In addition, the study finds that the participation in community forest management by households may reduce poverty in the range of 5-12 percentage point The participating households have higher food security levels in the range of 12%-19% as compared to non-participating households.

We propose a version of the model that describes household choices at the city (MSA) level and, conditional on city, the neighborhood (census tract) level. We use a two-stage budgeting argument to develop an empirically feasible sorting model that allows us to estimate preferences for regionally varying air quality while accounting for sorting at the local level. Our conceptual and empirical approach nests previous sorting models as special cases, allowing us to assess the importance of accounting for multiple spatial scales in our predictions for the cost of air pollution. Furthermore our preferred specification connects the city and neighborhood sorting margins to the upper and lower elements of a nested logit model, thereby establishing a useful correspondence between two stage budgeting and nested logit estimation. Empirically we find that estimates from a conventional model of sorting across MSAs imply a smaller marginal willingness to pay for air quality than estimates from our proposed model. We discuss how the difference is attributable in part to the omitted variable problems arising when tract level sorting is ignored. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship is robust to a large number of controls at the firm and country level.

However, there is little empirical evidence specifically concerning the effects of parents holding a dedicated education savings account on their children's attainment of associate's and bachelor's degrees. There is a need for more replication studies to help confirm that the emerging evidence is accurate and applicable with different populations and under different situations. This study helps fill this research gap by using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 97. Data are analyzed using propensity score adjusted regression techniques. Results show if parents create a savings account earmarked for their children's education, the children are more likely to attain college degrees. These findings suggest that current asset-based policies and programs that encourage low- and moderate-income parents to create and hold education savings accounts can also serve as a policy strategy to help improve higher educational attainment of children from lower income households.

Globally, forest area managed by local communities is on the rise. However, transferring management responsibilities to forest users alone cannot guarantee the sustainability of forest management. A monitoring tool, that allows the local communities to track the progress of forest management towards the goal of sustainability, is essential. A case study, including six forest user groups (FUGs), two from each three community based forestry models community forestry (CF), buffer zone community forestry (BZCF), and collaborative forest management (CFM) representing three different physiographic regions, was conducted in Nepal. The study explores which community based forest management model (CF. BZCF or CFM) is doing well in terms of sustainable forest management. The study assesses the overall performance of the three models towards SFM using locally developed criteria (four), indicators (26) and verifiers (60). This paper attempts to quantify the sustainability of the models using sustainability index for individual criteria (SIIC), and overall sustainability index (OSI). In addition, rating to the criteria and scoring of the verifiers by the FUGs were done. Among the four criteria, the FUGs ascribed the highest weightage to institutional framework and governance criterion; followed by economic and social benefits, forest management practices, and extent of forest resources. Similarly, the SIIC was found to be the highest for the institutional framework and governance criterion. The average values of OSI for CFM, CF, and BZCF were 0.48, 0.51 and 0.60 respectively; suggesting that buffer zone community forestry is the more sustainable model among the three. The study also suggested that the SIIC and OSI help local communities to quantify the overall progress of their forestry practices towards sustainability. The indices provided a clear picture of forest management practices to indicate the direction where they are heading in terms of sustainability; and informed the users on issues to pay attention to enhance sustainability of their forests.

This paper looks at all relevant actors and tests the hypothesis of whether they have a significant influence on the outcomes of community forestry. The empirical basis comprises 57 cases of community forestry in four developing and one developed country. The cases were selected to represent a variety of political conditions and best practices, defined as success in the achievement of high outcomes. The actors were theoretically defined, and we identified political, economic and societal actors. Additionally, their power and interests were theoretically defined and observed in the field studies. The group of powerful actors desires specific outcomes for the local users of the community forests. As far as the ecological outcomes, some 40% of the powerful actors prefer sustained forest stands, and 20% also find biodiversity to be important. With regard to the economic contribution to the local users, 25% of powerful actors support only a subsistence level for the local users, and 25% prefer higher economic contributions. Within the social outcomes, 40% of powerful actors accept devolution of some information and decision rights to the local users, but only 2% would grant them full empowerment. The interests of the powerful actors were compared with the outcomes achieved in practice. A comparison shows that within each outcome there is a congruence of 82-90% between the interests of powerful actors and the outcomes for local users. We interpret these findings as empirical evidence that powerful actors have a significant influence on the outcomes of community forestry for the local users. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Risk of fire and the resulting economic loss is a common problem in Mediterranean areas, mainly in years when climatic conditions are more unfavorable. Specific strategies for dealing with that risk imply costs, have an impact on biodiversity, and are always implemented following different stakeholders' (landowners/farmers and managers) preferences. Furthermore, this kind of decision always implies a conflict of objectives. Compromise programming represents a very satisfactory way to combine different stakeholders' preferences regarding the criteria considered. The objective of this work is to present a methodology based on the MCDM approach that facilitates the collaborative planning process in the scope of Mediterranean forests, dealing with multiple criteria and multiple stakeholders in a risky situation.

An interesting segment that could help to achieve this is older consumers, due to their growing numbers. There seems to be a lack of attention, in the research looking specifically at different age categories of older consumers' green behaviour, and whether their level of greenness can be explained by their personality. Using Socioemotional Selectivity Theory and Time Perspective, the research presented here was designed to provide an exploratory analysis of how the green behaviour of older consumers is explained by their personality types. Based on the responses of 204 older consumers in the UK, our results find the openness personality trait to be positively linked to green behaviour, whilst the extraversion personality trait is negatively related to green behaviour. Although the level of green behaviour increased with older consumers' age, this did not reach significance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The average cost per CTCA was determined via a micro-costing method in four French hospitals, and the cost of CA was taken from the 2011 French National Cost Study that collects data at the patient level from a sample of 51 public or not-for-profit hospitals. The average cost of CTCA was estimated to be 180a,not sign (95 % CI 162-206a,not sign) based on the use of a 64-slice CT scanner active for 10 h per day. The average cost of CA was estimated to be 1,378a,not sign (95 % CI 1,126-1,670a,not sign). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CA for all patients over a strategy including CTCA triage in the intermediate risk group, no imaging test in the low risk group, and CA in the high risk group, was estimated to be 6,380a,not sign (95 % CI 4,714-8,965a,not sign) for each additional correctly classified patient. This strategy correctly classifies 95.3 % (95 % CI 94.4-96.2) of all patients in the population studied. A strategy of CTCA triage in the intermediate-risk group, no imaging test in the low-risk group, and CA in the high-risk group, has good diagnostic accuracy and could significantly cut costs. Medium-term and long-term outcomes need to be evaluated in patients with coronary stenosis potentially misclassified by CTCA due to false negative examinations.","[Darlington, Meryl; Pierucci, Antoine Filipovic; Maoulida, Hassani; Quelen, Celine; Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle] URC Eco IdF, AP HP, Hotel Dieu, Paris Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res Unit, F-75004 Paris, France; [Gueret, Pascal] Henri Mondor Hosp, Dept Cardiol, Creteil, France; [Gueret, Pascal] Univ Paris Est Creteil, Creteil, France; [Laissy, Jean-Pierre] Hop Xavier Bichat, Dept Radiol, Paris, France; [Laissy, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 07, Paris, France; [Niarra, Ralph; Chatellier, Gilles] Georges Pompidou Hosp, Dept Biostat, Paris, France; [Niarra, Ralph; Chatellier, Gilles] Univ Paris 05, Paris, France",Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Hotel-Dieu - APHP; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Hopital Universitaire Henri-Mondor - APHP; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Bichat-Claude Bernard - APHP; Universite Paris Cite; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Hopital Universitaire Europeen Georges-Pompidou - APHP; Universite Paris Cite,"Darlington, M (通讯作者)，URC Eco IdF, AP HP, Hotel Dieu, Paris Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res Unit, 1 Pl Parvis Notre Dame, F-75004 Paris, France.",meryl.darlington@urc-eco.fr,"Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle/AFP-1493-2022; Darlington, Meryl/JED-9657-2023","Durand-Zaleski, Isabelle/0000-0002-4078-1476; DARLINGTON, Meryl/0000-0001-8029-1925",French Ministry of Health [STIC IC 050126],French Ministry of Health,"Many thanks to the medical corps, statisticians, administrators, and purchasers who helped with the micro-costing.

We provide a new explanation for this move to law. We argue that important contextual variables of the negotiations have been largely overlooked by existing explanations, namely 'experiential learning'. While negotiations to create institutions are characterized by uncertainty about distributional effects, negotiators will look for clues that moderate uncertainty. In the context of the Uruguay Round negotiations, a significant amount of information was drawn from actual practice and experience with the existing General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) dispute settlement system. In short, experience gained with judicial institutions and outcomes is important to understand the key results of the negotiations: a legalization leap, more specifically a judicialization of the existing dispute settlement system. We focus on the two dominant actors in the negotiations (the United States and the (then) European Community) and provide evidence for our argument based on an analysis of GATT cases in the 1980s, GATT documents, and in-depth interviews with negotiators who participated in the negotiations.","[Elsig, Manfred] Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Eckhardt, Jappe] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",University of Bern; Simon Fraser University,"Elsig, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bern, World Trade Inst, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland.",manfred.elsig@wti.org; jappe.eckhardt@gmail.com,,"Eckhardt, Jappe/0000-0002-8823-0905; Elsig, Manfred/0000-0001-6950-108X",NCCR Trade Regulation,NCCR Trade Regulation,"We wish to thank Christian Arnold, Dirk De Bievre, Andreas Dur, Bernard Hoekman, Susan Kaplan, Soo Yeon Kim, Petros Mavroidis, Arlo Poletti, an anonymous reviewer, as well as participants at the Workshop 'The EU in International Negotiations', EUI, Florence, 23-24 June 2014.

We develop a categorization of PTAs that contrasts enforcement mechanisms with the level of trade policy discretion allowed by a trade agreement and the degree of flexibility allowed for members. Utilizing an original dataset of PTAs signed by countries in Asia, which has emerged as one of the most active regions of PTA formation and which exhibits wide variability in levels of judicialization, we compare the effects of trade policy discretion, flexibility provisions, and enforcement mechanisms in PTAs on trade flows. We examine the empirical strength of our theoretical framework distinguishing between discretion, flexibility, and enforcement using confirmatory factor analysis. The empirical analysis then goes on to examine their respective effects on trade flows. The results show that agreements with strong commitments, that is, those that remove more trade policy discretion from a government, lead to a greater expansion of trade between signatories. Enforcement and flexibility mechanisms, however, have mixed effects.","[Hicks, Raymond] Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Kim, Soo Yeon] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Polit Sci, Singapore 117548, Singapore",Princeton University; National University of Singapore,"Hicks, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.",rhicks@princeton.edu; sooyeon.kim@nus.edu.sg,"Kim, Soo Yeon/W-2394-2019","Kim, Soo Yeon/0000-0002-5765-9709",National University of Singapore [R-108-000-046-133],National University of Singapore(National University of Singapore),"The authors are especially grateful to Joanne Gowa, Kris Johnson, Helen Milner, and Rob O'Reilly, and also to Thilo Bodenstein, Stephen Chaudoin, Christina Davis, Yoram Haftel, Yuch Kono, Peter Rosendorff, Dustin Tingley for their feedback and suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper.

One option to facilitate the design and implementation of REDD + is to build on the experiences of community forest management (CFM). Despite tensions between the central objectives of REDD + and CFM, the two policy interventions share the objective of managing forests sustainably. REDD + projects can build on and benefit from the environmental, social, human, and institutional capital associated with existing community forest governance. Using a comparative case approach with studies from Nepal and Tanzania, we illustrate interactions between REDD + and CFM. In Nepal, most REDD + pilot projects have been located in community forest sites, especially in high-carbon forests. In Tanzania, REDD + funding is being used to expand the area of forest under Participatory Forest Management. Our study also highlights how community forestry institutions may need to be modified to satisfy key REDD + criteria. Greater institutional coordination, equitable benefit sharing mechanisms, and higher community capacity for monitoring, reporting, and verification are key areas needing change. There are significant risks, but the vast experience and significant successes of CFM can improve prospects for achieving REDD + objectives in other less-industrialized, forested countries.

In the diverse field of scenario planning, this is perhaps the single point of universal agreement. Yet if scenarios are stories, their literary qualities are often underdeveloped. Scenarios used in business and government frequently do not contain a relatable protagonist, move a plot toward resolution, or compellingly use metaphor, imagery, or other emotionally persuasive techniques of literature. In these cases, narrative is relegated to an adjunct role of summarizing the final results of the workshop. While this neglect of narrative may be reasonable in some contexts, the power of narrative should not be underestimated. Scenario planning methodologies can benefit from using diverse narrative techniques to craft compelling and infectious visions of the future. This article explores the relationship between science fiction and scenarios as story genres and investigates a creative story-telling technique, Science Fiction Prototyping (Johnson, 2011). While the method is promising, it is an ultimately problematic means to incorporating narrative into scenario planning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In Turkey, all forestry activities, such as regeneration and stand tending, are carried out according to forest management plans, which are used as a tool for achieving sustainable forest management goals. An intermediate yield harvest plan, which is a part of management plan, is used for stand tending. Every year, the compartments (stands) within the same stand tending block are thinned. Decision support systems have not been used so far in order to designate the size and location of these stand tending blocks. In this study, we used multi-objective goal programming to designate stand tending blocks for an entire decade. We developed two models: a linear goal programming model and a nonlinear goal programming model. To design these models, we only considered wood flow and distance between the centroids of compartments as the objectives. Then, we used a working circle of the Golcuk forest sub-district, which is a planning unit in Turkey, as a case study. The linear model worked very well, and for reference scenarios, the deviation in volume scheduled for the entire decade was only 16.8 m(3) and the deviation in total distance between compartments was 172 km. Scenario 3, with weights of 02 for distance and 0.8 for volume, produced the best results. The nonlinear model, which in theory would better represent the problem, was not as useful due to a combination of the time required to produce a solution and the quality of the solutions. The linear model can be developed by including other factors and used by forest planners. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Studying private activity determinants helps to predict doctors' provision of care. In the context of strong feminization and heterogeneity in general practitioners' (GP) behavior, we first aim to measure the effects of the determinants of private activity. Second, we study the evolution of these effects along the private activity distribution. Third, we examine the differences between male and female GPs. From an exhaustive database of French GPs working in private practice in 2008, we performed an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and quantile regressions (QR) on the GPs' private activity. Among other determinants, we examined the trade-offs within the GPs' household considering his/her marital status, spousal income, and children. While the OLS results showed that female GPs had less private activity than male GPs (-13 %), the QR results emphasized a private activity gender gap that increased significantly in the upper tail of the distribution. We also find gender differences in the private activity determinants, including family structure, practice characteristics, and case-mix variables. For instance, having a youngest child under 12 years old had a positive effect on the level of private activity for male GPs and a negative effect for female GPs. The results allow us to understand to what extent the supply of care differs between male and female GPs. In the context of strong feminization, this is essential to consider for organizing and forecasting the GPs' supply of care.","[Dumontet, Magali; Franc, Carine] CNRS, INSERM, U988, CERMES3,UMR 8211, Villejuif, France; [Dumontet, Magali] Univ Paris 09, Paris, France",Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Dumontet, M (通讯作者)，CNRS, INSERM, U988, CERMES3,UMR 8211, Villejuif, France.",magali.dumontet@inserm.fr,"Franc, Carine/R-4207-2018","Franc, Carine/0000-0001-7166-6895","DREES (Direction of Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics) of the French Ministry of Health","DREES (Direction of Research, Studies, Evaluation and Statistics) of the French Ministry of Health","We are grateful to the two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

Noncompliers tend to present lower corporate governance (CG) quality, higher ownership concentration, larger total assets, and less profitability. State- and foreign-owned companies are significantly less likely noncompliers. Shareholders correctly anticipated that lower CG quality firms were more likely noncompliers but may have been negatively surprised when some higher CG quality firms did not comply.","[Barros, Lucas Ayres B. de C.] Univ Sao Paulo, Sch Econ Management & Accounting, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [da Silveira, Alexandre Di Miceli] Univ Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [da Silveira, Alexandre Di Miceli] Alvares Penteado Sch Business, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Bortolon, Patricia M.] Univ Fed Espirito Santo, Accounting Dept, Vitoria, Brazil; [Leal, Ricardo P.

Norway is used as example, since all recent extensions in the parental leave scheme have been reserved for fathers and at the same time the daycare sector has expanded rapidly. We find that Norwegian mothers did enter work faster after childbirth in the late 2000s than a decade earlier. The latest initiatives may thus have contributed to a shortening of women's career interruptions and a more equal division of paid and unpaid work among parents.","[Ronsen, Marit] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway; [Kitterod, Ragni Hege] Inst Social Res, Oslo, Norway",Statistics Norway,"Ronsen, M (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Res Dept, Oslo, Norway.",marit.ronsen@ssb.no; hege.kitterod@samfunnsforskning.no,,,,,,,42,30,32,1,53,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Considering the common historical and socio-cultural experience of the Baltic States, it can be assumed that the influence of the present transformation processes on the youth is similar. The results of the research show that in contrast with the assumption the study of youth capability reveals both the similarities and statistically significant differences in the values and actions of the young generation in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. In the area of values, youth are aware of the importance of sustainable habits but their actions do not always correspond with the principles of sustainable development. Considering that the compliance of values to actions is the measuring stick of responsibility; the youth of all three Baltic States demonstrate rather low level of responsibility. It is necessary to promote the implementation of the ideas of global education and sustainability into the everyday life, real social practices, since youth values and views comply with the principles of sustainable development.","[Bite, Dina; Kronberga, Ginta; Kruzmetra, Zenija; Janmere, Lana] Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Bite, D (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Inst Social Sci & Humanities, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",dina.bite@llu.lv,"Bite, Dina/AAG-3835-2019","Bite, Dina/0000-0003-1589-3676",,,,,12,1,1,0,3,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,81,91,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400008,0

Significantly stronger economic position of the large enterprises in the Czech beverages sector and large share of these enterprises on the performance of the sector were also confirmed by the Spider Analysis.

Network theories highlight the importance of information sharing, social cohesion and mutual goals that constitute social capital. We test and demonstrate how these ties relate to each other and which ones are crucial for collaboration in a government funded collaborative network for forest biodiversity and Siberian Jay conservation in Finland. Our analysis shows that short-term governance networks operate on trust. Seemingly, differences in goals can be put aside for a collective good; that is, being able to cooperate and find solutions to conservation issues. Additionally, exchange and flow of information are a necessity in network functions. However, a network may be successful despite difficulties in flow of information, as our case of Siberian Jay Network shows.

The paper is based on current scientific research in the field of measuring and evaluating central bank independence. Subsequently, the CBI index (Central Bank Independence Index) was designed. It is based on the most important criteria for central bank independence and the determination of their values. Then, using the proposed CBI index, the independence of selected central banks was measured. CBI values were compared with the average rate of inflation in those countries from 1999-2014. The calculated results do not prove the hypothesis; however, it can be concluded that central banks with a higher rate of independence tend to achieve an inflation target of around 2%, which is currently the target of most central banks in market economies. Our results do not correspond to the results of previous studies, which were conducted when it was believed that a higher rate of central bank independence meant a lower rate of inflation. This is possible to explain by the fact that nowadays central banks do not aim to reduce the rate of inflation, as in the past, but to hold it around the inflation target, which is usually around 2%. Of course, it is necessary to consider that, in reality, there are a number of factors having an influence on inflation rate that a central bank cannot control. The importance of central bank independence lies mainly in the fact that elected politicians are watching primarily to achieve short-term objectives. They can try to influence the central bank to act in a way that leads to the support of economic growth in the short term, though the effect would cause unwanted inflation over the long term.","[Cernohorsky, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Cernohorsky, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Inst Econ, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Cernohorsky, Jan/HGU-5477-2022",,,,,,12,0,0,1,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,411,418,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200053,0

A decade of negotiations is likely to go nowhere. This paper argues that absence of a landing-zone was in the data. Quantitative tools modelling the detail of the modalities predicted failure but were not taken seriously: the design of the negotiations implied that any achievements of the Round could only be limited. Such a weakness was induced by the way multilateral negotiations were organized-in separate groups, without much consideration for, or understanding of, how the different elements added up to more than the sum of the parts. We put sensible figures on that argument by using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, addressing exceptions, flexibilities, as well as the non-linear design of the liberalization formulas, a reduction in domestic support, the phasing out of export subsidies in agriculture, and trade facilitation. Our conclusion is that negotiators have to go back to simplicity and re-bundle the topics if they wish to revamp multilateral negotiations.","[Decreux, Yvan] Int Trade Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland; [Fontagne, Lionel] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Fontagne, Lionel] CEPII, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Decreux, Y (通讯作者)，Int Trade Ctr, Geneva, Switzerland.",lionel.fontagne@univ-paris1.fr,,,,,,,22,6,7,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2015,14,1.0,,,,,29,43,,10.1017/S1474745614000354,0.0,,,15,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CE2HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351637400003,0

We note that an analysis of the way in which the business organization's mission is formulated can be materialized in the conditions in which it is reported to the actual requirements of economic markets. Consequently, our attention focuses on the conceptual-theoretical, but also on the practical valences of the two dimensions encountered in the enunciation and definition of the business organization's mission: the strategies and the objectives set by (managerial) decision makers. In addition, the substantiation of this scientific research aims, in this context, to an epistemological analysis of the understanding and explicitation process concerning the idea of mission within a business organization's system. We consider that this methodological substantiation finds its full justification to the extent that this evaluation of a business mission idea implies a reference to the managerial authorities' skills, but also to the need of economic education, focused on economic aspects of financial nature. An important role in the initiated approach is held by the idea of economic reassessment of the need, requirement and demand concepts. Therefore, the methodological issue under discussion reveals an explanatory endeavour that legitimizes the suppositions pertaining to the acceptance of an economic pragmatism within a knowledge society.

The Credit Institutions Act, which largely relies on Basel II regulations, was introduced in Croatia in 2009. The pillars of Basel II recommendations are minimal capital requirements, supervisory reviews and market discipline. In this paper we focus on the IRB framework for regulating bank capital and consider some scenarios of capital reservations practice in the changing economic conditions, prevailing in Croatia for last several years. Indications that risk management practice in the Croatian banking sector was not fully satisfactory in recession period, are revealed here.

Simulation results show that although the 2007-8 energy crisis contributed to slowing down South African gross domestic product (GDP) growth and reducing employment and earnings, the distributional impact between men and women has been neutral. This neutrality is driven by an increase in capital inflows, which has mitigated the exchange rate depreciation owing to the oil price hike. Without an increase in capital inflows, the crisis would have significantly depreciated the exchange rate and contributed to decreasing women's market opportunities and increasing women's workload as compared to men.","[Fofana, Ismael] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Titre 3396 Lot 2,BP 24063 Dakar Almadies, Dakar, Senegal",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI),"Fofana, I (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Titre 3396 Lot 2,BP 24063 Dakar Almadies, Dakar, Senegal.",I.Fofana@cgiar.org,,,,,,,32,3,3,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

According to evolutionary biologists this approach is less psychologically acceptable for untrained individuals in mathematics, which results in many wrong solutions to problems of this type. This paper proposes alternative calculation procedures that are based on an adaptive approach. The classical probability formula and on it constructed model of Venn diagram (normative approach) will be transformed firstly into a frequency format, secondly into a probability decision tree (adaptive approach). Compared to the normative solution the usage of the adaptive approach facilitates comprehension by means of its visualization property and the possibility of checking the correctness of the solution. This is demonstrated in a Bayesian task of a managerial type. The adaptive procedure applied in it enables us to replace the original conditional probabilities by simpler Laplace probabilities that are easily understandable to managers without prejudice to the accuracy of the result.","[Haskova, Simona] VSE Praha, Fak Managementu, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic",,"Hasková, S (通讯作者)，VSE Praha, Fak Managementu, Jarosovska 1117-2, Jindrichuv Hrade 37701, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,22,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,219,224,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900038,0

From kings to common folk, not only did fashion represent the answer to a primal need, but it also constituted a way of communicating with society, a way in which one could show his or her social status. Because of this, the motivation behind the acquisition of luxury products proves to be an interesting subject, in order to explore the factors that influence the buying process. Numerous studies (Dubois, 2009, pp.273-278; Cardoso and Pinto, 2010) have shown the importance of luxury for consumers, as a result of a series of factors such as: demographic aspects, economic conditions, education, reputation or fashion trends. This article stems from a quantitative study on the analisys of the reasons for purchasing or not purchasing luxury textile producs and sets to determin new reasons that influence the buying process. The hypotheses were tested using a One Way ANOVA and a t-Test, offering important data regarding the study of luxury buyer and also, non-buyer behaviour. The analisys has shown that individuals tend to follow a hedonistic motivation, more so than economic aspects or fashion trends.","[Iuliana, Diaconu Valentina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Iuliana, DV (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",valentina.iuliana.diaconu@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,3,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,330,337,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200040,0

CR was devised by the corporate capitalist elite, broadly defined, as an instrument for pre-empting governmental intervention. Corporations responded to surging public expectations for governmental-not corporate-assumption of social responsibility. In deploying CR practices, they would strategically enable the creation of the latter at the expense of the former, thus redefining the parameters of business's role in society and, along with it, the societal division of regulatory labour in the direction of increasing privatization. It is hypothesized that present-day attempts at 'civil regulation' of corporations embody a script of interaction among companies, publics and states that was designed to secure corporate power rather than limit it. Synthesizing organizational neoinstitutionalism and elite theory, the article shows how elites can defend their position of power through engagement in a 'defensive institutionalization project', that is, a sophisticated modification of the system aimed at redefining the very perceptions and strategies of everyone involved.","Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany",Free University of Berlin,"Kaplan, R (通讯作者)，Free Univ Berlin, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.",ramikaplan@gmail.com,,,,,,,119,52,57,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Firstly, using Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as the measure of risk, we compute three mean-risk efficient portfolios from the mean-CVaR in-sample efficiency frontier. These portfolios are identified as the optimal solutions of the CVaR minimizing problem under the condition on minimal required portfolio mean return. Three levels of minimal required portfolio mean return are considered. Then we test out-of-sample efficiency of all these portfolios with respect to the second order stochastic dominance. We apply this procedure to US stock market daily data 1927-2014 such that we use one year moving window period for both in-sample and out-of-sample analysis. Hence we identify 87 in-sample sets of three mean-CVaR efficient portfolios and we test SSD efficiency of all these 261 portfolios. Moreover, we analyze the out-of-sample efficiency (measure of SSD inefficiency) for each minimal required level of portfolio mean return separately.","[Kopa, Milos] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Kopa, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Math & Phys, Dept Probabil & Math Stat, Sokolovska 83, Prague 18675 8, Czech Republic.",kopa@karlin.mff.cuni.cz,"Kopa, Miloš/H-4481-2014","Kopa, Miloš/0000-0002-9438-4484",,,,,22,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,377,382,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900065,0

Results of the analysis are used for answering the question - Which standard should be chosen for given business? From the business point of view for managers it is crucial to realize what is more important for their business. Whether more attention on process skills or on people skills will lead them to project's success? Even though both of them seems to be at the same importance when to choose one of the standards the answer must be found however it is complicated. There can be found a key to solution in the type of business. Where the business is met with larger, hard projects the process approach can be the answer and on the contrary where the business is met with smaller, soft projects the personal skills approach might be of crucial importance.","[Kopeckova, Martina] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Project Management, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Kopeckova, M (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Dept Project Management, Brno, Czech Republic.",martina.kopeckova@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,3,0,0,2,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,468,481,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800047,0

As resources are limited, it is important to ascertain the costs and benefits of such programs. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the currently available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of programs encouraging physical activity in children and adolescents and to assess their quality. A systematic review was conducted searching in well established literature databases considering all studies before February 2015. Citation tracking in Google Scholar and a manual search of the reference lists of included studies were used to consolidate this. The fundamental methodological elements of the included economic evaluations were extracted, and the quality of the included studies was evaluated using the Pediatric Quality Appraisal Questionnaire (PQAQ). In total, 14 studies were included. Considering the performance of the economic evaluation, the studies showed wide variation. Most of the studies used a societal perspective for their analyses and discounted costs and effects. The findings ranged from US$11.59 for a person to become more active (cheapest intervention) up to US$669,138 for a disability adjusted life year (DALY) saved (most expensive intervention), with everything in between. Overall, the results of three studies are below a value of US$3061, with one of them even below US$200.00, for the achieved effects. For the other programs, the context-specific assessment of cost-effectiveness is problematic as there are different thresholds for cost-effectiveness in different countries or no clearly defined thresholds at all. There are multiple methodological difficulties involved in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing physical activity, which results in little consistency between different evaluations. The quality of the evaluations ranged from poor to excellent while a large majority of them was of very good methodological quality. Better comparability could be reached by greater standardization, especially regarding systematic consideration of implementation costs.","[Korber, Katharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Ludwigstr 28-RG, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Korber, Katharina] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Korber, Katharina] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen GmbH, German Res Ctr Environm Hlth, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Korber, K (通讯作者)，Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Ludwigstr 28-RG, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",korber@bwl.lmu.de,,,Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA),Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA),The project was financially supported by the The Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA).

It finds that men and women with low social status distribute water equally when water is abundant but keep larger shares when water is scarce, although low-status women try to be as fair as possible at the expense of their returns from irrigated agriculture. Men of high social status keep more than half of the available water for themselves, both in abundance and scarcity, and deprive others from sizeable returns from irrigated agriculture.

It has been widely acknowledged that coordinated economies with larger public sectors have somewhat regressive tax systems, with a heavy reliance on the taxation of consumption and wages over capital and property. Liberal economies, alternatively, have had more progressive tax systems but smaller welfare states. I suggest that the divergence in the mechanisms for representing employers-through industrial relations and party systems-helps to explain how different models of taxing and spending develop over the course of the twentieth century. Industrial coordination encourages higher levels of tax consent among employers, by simultaneously expanding employers' support for social programmes and giving employers the leverage to restrict taxation of capital and to push consumption taxes. The paper evaluates the role of employers and industrial coordination in the architecture of tax regimes in Denmark and the USA in the early 1900s and 1960s.","Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Martin, CJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 232 Bay State Rd, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",cjmartin@bu.edu,,,,,,,71,25,27,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Manufacturers launching new molecules in existing drug classes have often been criticized for inflating health systems' expenses, but it has been argued that such drugs increase therapeutic options. Economic theory suggests that follow-on drugs induce price competition. We contribute to this discussion by addressing the topic of pricing at market entry and price development in the German market. We measure determinants of price strategies of follow-on drugs using regression analyses, considering all new molecules launched in the German market from 1993 to 2008. Prices of products are standardized on defined daily dosages controlling for sales volumes based on data from the IMS Health DPM database and for the therapeutic quality of a new product using ratings by Fricke/Klaus as a proxy for innovation. We identify prices correlating with therapeutic value at market entry. While the first two molecules engage in quality competition, price discounts below the market price can be observed from the third entrant on. Price discounts are even more distinct in development races with several drugs entering the market within 2 years and in classes with a low degree of therapeutic differentiation. Prices remain relatively constant over time. This study contributes to assessments of competition in pharmaceutical markets focusing on price strategies of new market entrants. After an initial phase of market building, further follow-on products induce price competition. Largely unchanged prices after 4 years may be interpreted as quality competition and can be attributed to prices in Germany being anchor points for international price referencing.","[Mueller, Michael T.] Univ Witten Herdecke, Lehrstuhl Inst Enokon & Gesundheitssyst Managemen, D-58448 Witten, Germany; [Frenzel, Alexander] IMS Hlth GmbH & Co OHG, D-60598 Frankfurt, Germany",Witten Herdecke University,"Mueller, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Witten Herdecke, Lehrstuhl Inst Enokon & Gesundheitssyst Managemen, Alfred Herrhausen Str 50, D-58448 Witten, Germany.",michael.t.mueller@gmail.com; AFrenzel@de.imshealth.com,,,,,,,42,4,4,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

This study also tested the mediating effect of organizational commitment on the relationship between organizational justice dimensions and turnover intention. A survey questionnaire was used to gather data from a sample of 217 employees in manufacturing industry. SPSS was used for analyzing the data. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to test the postulated hypotheses and examine the direct and mediated relationships among variables. The results of this study suggested that perceived distributive and procedural justice hadpositive effectson employees' organizational commitment. Distributive justice had a significant negative effect on employees' turnover intentions while procedural and interactional justice were not found be predictors of turnover intention. The results also indicated that organizational commitment significantly and positively affected turnover intention and it partially mediated the negative effect of distributive justiceon turnover intention.","Univ Mustafa Kemal, Dept Business Adm, Hatay Merkez, Turkey",,"Ölçer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Mustafa Kemal, Dept Business Adm, Hatay Merkez, Turkey.",folcer@hotmail.com,,,,,,,25,3,7,4,35,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The FV is burdened with risk of quantified uncertainty. A formal model of this uncertainty is to present the FV as a random variable. On the other side, it is fully justified by economic reasons that imprecisely assessed PV may be described as intuitionistic fuzzy subset. Then the return rate is determined as intuitionistic fuzzy probability set. Then return risk consists of quantified uncertainty risk, imprecision risk and knightian risk. The quantified uncertainty risk is characterized in usual way as variance of distribution of precisely determined return rate. Subsequently the expected return rate is estimated as intuitionistic fuzzy set. Its membership function is the image of imprecision risk. Imprecision is composed of ambiguity and indistinctness. The ambiguity risk is evaluated by energy measure. The indistinctness risk is characterized by entropy measure. The hesitation function of expected return rate can be interpreted as an image of knightian uncertainty. As a result, knightian uncertainty risk may be rated by indeterminacy measure. This way, four-dimensional image of risk is introduced. This perception of risk endangering a security will lead to the formulation of new approaches to risk management.","[Piasecki, Krzysztof] Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Piasecki, K (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",k.piasecki@ue.poznan.pl,"Piasecki, Krzysztof/F-2352-2013","Piasecki, Krzysztof/0000-0002-9629-4167",,,,,20,4,4,0,3,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,641,646,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900110,0

Administrative data are collected for the purpose of billing and reimbursement, and are valued by health researchers because the data are routinely audited to maintain accurate financial records. However, the quantity of incorporated clinical data can be variable. In this paper we reconstruct the medical record from health service invoices to estimate the cost of treating keratinocytic cancer (KC). The data from an epidemiological survey were linked to an administrative data set supplied by the national health insurer. A matched sampling technique with multivariable analysis was used to estimate cost. A KC treatment was identified with 42 service codes which explicitly nominated treatment of a KC. Algorithms identifying comorbities potentially correlated with KC were constructed from the service codes. The annual cost of a KC treatment was estimated to be AU$667 per individual. The average cost of explicit KC treatments was AU$231, while the cost of generic procedures used to treat KC was AU$436. Our ability to accurately control for the medical history enabled our analysis to quantify and describe the constituent costs of KC treatment.","[Rowell, David; Gordon, Louisa G.] Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Logan Campus,Univ Dr, Brisbane, Qld 4131, Australia; [Rowell, David] Univ Queensland, UQ Ctr Clin Res, Asia Pacific Ctr Neuromodulat, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Olsen, Catherine M.; Whiteman, David C.] Royal Brisbane Hosp, QIMR Berghofer Med Res Inst, Populat Hlth Dept, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia; [Gordon, Louisa G.; Olsen, Catherine M.; Whiteman, David C.] Queensland Univ Technol, NHMRC Ctr Res Excellence Sun & Hlth, Brisbane, Qld 4059, Australia",Menzies Health Institute Queensland; Griffith University; University of Queensland; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute; Royal Brisbane & Women's Hospital; University of Queensland; Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Rowell, D (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Ctr Appl Hlth Econ, Griffith Hlth Inst, Logan Campus,Univ Dr, Brisbane, Qld 4131, Australia.",d.rowell@uq.edu.au,"Olsen, Catherine/C-8785-2009; Gordon, Louisa/P-1427-2016; Whiteman, David/P-2728-2014","Olsen, Catherine/0000-0003-4483-1888; Gordon, Louisa/0000-0002-3159-4249; Whiteman, David/0000-0003-2563-9559",National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre for Research Excellence in Sun and Health; Research Fellowship from the NHMRC; Program Grant from the NHMRC [552429],National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre for Research Excellence in Sun and Health(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Research Fellowship from the NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Program Grant from the NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),Dr Rowell received funding through a postdoctoral fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Centre for Research Excellence in Sun and Health.

Harvest of a target fish species, costly avoidance of the bycatch species, and harvesting efficiency are examined in a stochastic production environment with and without at-sea observability of bycatch, and with and without trade in harvest quotas and bycatch caps. Our results suggest that precise implementation of a socially optimal management plan is possible only if bycatch is observable and trade in fish quotas and bycatch cap is frictionless.

However, these values are often difficult to measure, and few attempts have been made to do so. The recent European Union (EU) eel management directive creates an unusually clear-cut tradeoff between eel fishing and other agents affecting the European eel population. It is possible, therefore, to directly measure the perceived public good value of the eel fishery in terms of other economic costs that policymakers are willing to incur in order to maintain eel fishing. Using Swedish data, we find that Swedish policymakers value the public good aspect of the remaining Swedish eel fishery at a minimum of SEK 34 million (approximately EUR 3.4 million) annually, which is more than the commercial eel fishery's actual production value.","[Stage, Jesper] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden; [Stage, Jesper] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Business Econ & Law, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden",Lulea University of Technology; Mid-Sweden University,"Stage, J (通讯作者)，Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden.",Jesper.Stage@ltu.se,"Stage, Jesper/B-6718-2009","Stage, Jesper/0000-0001-7206-6568",Elforsk,Elforsk,"Three anonymous referees and an associate editor, as well as seminar participants at the Centre for Environmental and Resource Economics in Umea, Sweden, provided constructive comments and criticism on earlier versions of this work.

Although the importance of the problem has been raised many times in the literature, the matter has not been explored very well. Broadly admitting that financial reports should be reliable, there is limited literature on reliability definition. Few attempts to define reliability were based on conceptual framework created by International Accounting Standard Board. On the other hand, literature analysis presents the changes in the characterization of reliability formed on the transformation of scope and course of previous researches. Previous studies represent diverse collection and consist mainly of selected problems concentrating on earnings management. A few studies were directed at selected reliability determinants' investigation (maximum of 2 or 3 determinants in one study) in the context of financial reports' information quality. At the same time, very sophisticated methods of earning management are used in order to realize well-bred and complicated financial strategies that are hard to fairness judgment. Methods used in the article include worldwide literature analysis together with the study of accountancy theoretical background directed at earnings management. The qualitative mixed-methods are employed with broad emphasis on critical research, in-depth examinations of accountancy foundations, and interpretive techniques referring to smoothing of financial reports. The aim of the study is twofold. Firstly, authors present the review of previous literature on reliability of information disclosed in financial statements and describe the status of up-to-date researches. Secondly, the desired direction for the future research is indicated in the area of reliability characterization and reliability determinants' classifications. Our article contributes to understanding about fairness in accounting showing past confusions about characterization of the reliability and pinpointing future areas of reliability research.","[Szewieczek, Aleksandra; Strojek-Filus, Marzena; Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda] Univ Econ, Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Szewieczek, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Katowice, Poland.",,"Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/A-3596-2014; Szewieczek, Aleksandra/C-2258-2015; Szewieczek, Aleksandra/HZL-8687-2023","Maruszewska, Ewa Wanda/0000-0003-0461-4133;",,,,,15,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,275,282,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200036,0

In recent years, the autonomy of universities has been strengthened. In connection with this change, the responsibility for funding has been increased as well as for the proper management of allocated funds. Public universities receive a significant portion of their funding for their activities from public sources, which are limited, and therefore it is important that these resources are used as efficiently as possible. An effective budgeting should be helpful in this process. Public universities might approach budgeting individually with regard to their specific needs. In particular, the allocation of funds to the lowest parts of public universities (departments and institutes) is an important issue in budgeting, since the educational, scientific and research activities of universities are based on them. This paper explores different types of methods which were tested for allocation of funds at public university in Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava.

The effect of collective bargaining on the two main concepts that make up wages (the contractual or basic-bargained wage, and the wage cushion) are analysed during the last period of the upward cycle (2002-2006) and the beginning of the global financial crisis (2006-2010). The wage cushion is defined as the difference between the earned wage and the basic-bargained wage. The results show that workers covered by firm bargaining experienced greater wage dispersion than workers covered by multi-employer bargaining. On the other hand, wage dispersion for all workers decreased during the analysis period, mainly during the first stage of the current economic crisis, and particularly among workers covered by multi-employer bargaining. Both the decreasing relevance of the wage cushion in actual wage formation and its reduced dispersion make it possible to explain this wage compression.","[Canal Dominguez, Juan Francisco; Rodriguez Gutierrez, Cesar] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Domínguez, JFC (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, Campus Cristo, Oviedo 33006, Asturias, Spain.",jfcanal@uniovi.es,,"Rodriguez Gutierrez, Cesar/0000-0001-6689-6119",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-43925-R]; Principality of Asturias [SV-15-GRUPUO-RULE],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Principality of Asturias(Principality of Asturias),This paper has been funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Project ECO2013-43925-R) and the Principality of Asturias (Project SV-15-GRUPUO-RULE).,,44,5,5,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using survey data sent out to 900 randomly selected participants in Virginia, we assess if forestland owners would allocate parts of their currently non-forested land, such as cropland and pasture/grazing land, to growing loblolly pine for bioenergy production purposes. Using recursive partitioning based logistic regression, we show that the decision to plant pine on non-forested land depends both on economic and non-economic factors, including price, demographic attributes of the forestland owner, mode of land acquisition and their respective threshold values, providing profile types policies encouraging biomass supply can use in tailoring their efforts. Using bid values, expected landowner revenue from growing pine, we also find a mean willingness to accept value of $1424/acre.

Globalizing National Regulation for International Trade,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Countries craft their regulations in a specific national context. When foreign exporters apply this regulation to achieve market access, it becomes subject to a global array of implementation conditions. Several World Trade aganization (WTO) disputes have ruled that regulation failed to acknowledge the conditions of foreign exporters. The WTO Appellate Body has suggested that comparing conditions or 'situations' is part of not discriminating between foreign and domestic products, but the implications remain vague. In fact, pulling too hard on this thread could unravel the non-discrimination principle as it leads to its inherent contradiction: regulation will never treat all trade partners exactly the same precisely because of their diverse conditions. Further, suggesting that it should put a huge undue burden on regulators: deep integration run amok. Key WTO environment and development controversies centre on how to acknowledge differences between countries' situations and still achieve the formal equality that the system promises. The case law on situational discrimination feeds into these debates. This article proposes that the focus should be on how different situations influence the comparative effectiveness of a regulation in meeting its goal, an approach which delimits and clarifies.","[Lydgate, Emily] Univ Sussex, Law, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England; [Lydgate, Emily] Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy",University of Sussex; Bocconi University,"Lydgate, E (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Law, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.;Lydgate, E (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Milan, Italy.",e.lydgate@sussex.ac.uk,,,Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) under the EU's Seventh Framework Programme [FP7-PEOPLE-2010-ITN_264633],Marie Curie Initial Training Network (ITN) under the EU's Seventh Framework Programme,"Lecturer in Law, University of Sussex; Marie Curie Fellow, Bocconi University, Milan, e.lydgate@ussex.ac.uk.

Governments are often prone to negotiate PTAs due to distinctive pressures from IPR-intensive industries to disseminate TRIPS-Plus standards, which are particularly willing to capitalize on the advantages of preferential arrangements. To illustrate this argument, we examine the processes around the expansion of IPR provisions in the PTAs signed by the United States with Latin American countries, as enabled by the Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002. We find that, while broad variations of TRIPS-Plus standards emerged across these PTAs, both governments and private sector tend to perceive gains from this setup, since PTAs are unlikely to undermine the IPR standards achieved by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter 'TRIPS Agreement'), but still provide opportunity for the promotion of higher IPR standards in each individual market.","[Tang, Yi Shin; Hernandes Teodoro, Joao Paulo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Int Relat, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Tang, Yi Shin] Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Copenhagen, Denmark",Universidade de Sao Paulo; University of Copenhagen,"Tang, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Int Relat, Sao Paulo, Brazil.;Tang, YS (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Fac Law, Copenhagen, Denmark.",yi.shin.tang@jur.ku.dk; jpteodoro@usp.br,"Hernandes Teodoro, João Paulo/GLS-0709-2022","Hernandes Teodoro, Joao Paulo/0000-0003-0270-9710",Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) [2013/10931-1],Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),"This research was partially funded by the Sao Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), Grant # 2013/10931-1.

Monthly regional data on pharmaceutical expenditures, volumes and policies in Italy from 2000 to 2014 are analysed using a difference-in-differences model enriched to capture short- versus long-term effects and simultaneous and interactive effects. Sobel-Goodman test and bootstrap analyses were used to test for mediation. The three policies have different short- and long-run effects. Interactions support the hypothesis of reinforcing effects. Behavioural reactions to policies such as reducing the demand or total per capita expenditures mediate the impact of policies, thus explaining the different effects between the short and long term. Evidence on the impact over time of regional policies diversely introduced in different times have important policy implications. First, pharmaceutical policies interact with each other, and the combined effect may be different from what we would expect from the sum of each single policy. Hence, policymakers should be very careful in designing mixed policies for their unexpected combined effects. Second, the impact of policies tends to reduce over time. If longer-term impact is desired, it would be appropriate to introduce some adjustments over time. Third, policies have multiple effects, and this should be considered when they are designed. Finally, pharmaceutical policies may have an unintended impact on health and health care.","[Armeni, Patrizio; Otto, Monica] CERGAS Bocconi, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Jommi, Claudio] Univ Piemonte Orientale, CERGAS Bocconi, Largo Donegani 2-3, I-28100 Novara, Italy",Bocconi University; University of Eastern Piedmont Amedeo Avogadro,"Armeni, P (通讯作者)，CERGAS Bocconi, Via Sarfatti 25, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",patrizio.armeni@unibocconi.it,,"Jommi, Claudio/0000-0002-2862-2990; Otto, Monica/0000-0002-3144-3133; ARMENI, PATRIZIO/0000-0003-3150-3332",,,,,26,4,4,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Based on the research material gathered in the MEDEIA project, some examples of buildings representing various metaphors will be provided together with reflections on their implications and interpretations from an individual and societal point of view.(1) The method of causal layered analysis (CLA) is applied in the analysis to deconstruct the messages of the buildings and to illustrate the connections between their manifest appearance and the underlying metaphors. The article addresses two central questions. Firstly, how does a building, in addition to its main functions, act as a messenger and mediator of future-related meanings by embodying different types of metaphors? Secondly, which kinds of buildings present conventional metaphors and used futures, and which kinds of buildings suggest novel metaphors and alternative futures? (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Implicit in proofs that cap-and-trade minimizes the expected discounted cost of capping emissions, however, is that the regulator not intervene once the market is established. Otherwise market participants encounter uncertainties beyond what a social planner faces. This paper discusses the equilibrium that results when private agents bank tradable allowances in the face of ongoing risk of future regulatory intervention and shows that the cap will be achieved at unnecessarily high cost even if no regulatory intervention actually occurs. Evidence that such risks are currently distorting EU ETS comes from the depressed current spot price, from the findings of Schopp and Neuhoff (2014) that speculators require multiples of the riskless rate of interest to bank permits, and from the sensitivity of prices to votes and announcements about proposed future regulatory changes.

A critical examination of the rhetoric in the GMO public policy debates in Ghana,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,GMOs; Rhetoric; Idioms; Policy; Human health; Risk; Narratives,CLAIMS; SCIENCE; LECTIN; RISKS; FOOD,"Using narrative policy analysis we examined the adversarial rhetoric of claims-makers in their bid to undermine alternative and conflicting accounts of GMOs as environmental and human health risk and to forestall any challenges to the scientific authority of the technological deterministic account of the GMO policy debates in Ghana. The study shows that the GMO discourse was built with the rhetorical frames of smallholder farmer vulnerability and entitlement used in the account it contradicts, thereby legitimating its own appeal for responsive remedies. Civil society claims attacked GMOs as discriminatory and as an environmental and human health risk. Government and scientists engaged in unsympathetic counter rhetorical strategies in hopes of debunking or neutralizing the claim made by civil society. In other words, Government and scientists were denying the claim that GMO was discriminatory and posed significant human health risk, as well as the call to action to do something about GMOs. Civil society adapted the counter rhetoric of insincerity, claiming that scientists had some kind of hidden agenda behind their claim, such as eagerness to just earn money from their patents on GMOs. It is imperative that communication on GMOs includes the underlying assumptions, the uncertainties and the probabilities associated with both best and worst case scenarios. This is a necessary condition to minimise misinformation on GMOs but may be insufficient to completely erase conspiracy theories from the minds of the public especially when scientists and government are perceived to be biased towards multinational corporations that are ostensibly preoccupied with making profits.

We analyze a unique data-set featuring mixed teaching teams and a diverse, multicultural, multi-ethnic group of students and teachers. Blended co-teaching allows us to study the link between student evaluations of teaching and teacher gender as well as ethnicity exploiting within course variation in a panel data model with course-year fixed effects. We document a negative effect of being a female teacher on student evaluations of teaching, which amounts to roughly one fourth of the sample standard deviation of teaching scores. Overall women are 11 percentage points less likely to attain the teaching evaluation cut-off for promotion to associate professor compared to men. The effect is robust to a host of co-variates such as course leadership, teacher experience and research quality, as well as an alternative teacher fixed effect specification. There is no evidence of a corresponding ethnicity effect. Our results are suggestive of a gender bias against female teachers and indicate that the use of teaching evaluations in hiring and promotion decisions may put female lectures at a disadvantage.

To characterize the role of forest resources in reducing community vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change, a general index of heat vulnerability (HEVI) was developed through Principle Components Analysis (PCA) and subsequently used within ANVOA and Poisson regression to assess the relationship between the amount and type of forest resources (species, management regime, spatial pattern) and a county's vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change. Results of the ANOVA showed significant differences in the extent and characteristics of forests among counties experiencing different levels of heat vulnerability. The Poisson regression using county heat mortality as the dependent variable found forest characteristics to have a significant influence on heat mortality when other determinants of vulnerability were controlled. A negative and significant relationship was specifically found between forest area and heat related mortality, which supports the hypothesis that the extent of forest coverage helps to alleviate vulnerability associated with heat effects. These findings have important implications for understanding the role of forest ecosystem services in reducing a community's vulnerability to the heat effects of climate change. Findings will also be useful in guiding land use planning and preserving desirable forest characteristics to help communities adapt to climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Chronic lymphedema places over 3 million Americans at risk of recurrent cellulitis. Health insurers and legislators have taken an active role in fighting attempts to mandate the treatment of lymphedema for fear that provision of the physical therapy and compression materials would result in large and uncontrollable claim costs. The author knows of no open source of lymphedema treatment cost data based on population coverage or claims. Published studies compare cost of treatment versus cost of non-treatment for a select group of lymphedema patients. They do not provide the data necessary for insurance underwriters' estimations of expected claim costs for a larger general population with a range of severities, or for legislators' evaluations of the costs of proposed mandates to cover treatment of lymphedema according to current medical standards. These data are of interest to providers, advocates and legislators in Canada, Australia and England as well as the U.S. The Commonwealth of Virginia has had a lymphedema treatment mandate since 2004. Reported data for 2004-2013, representing 80 % of the Virginia healthcare insurance market, contains claims and utilization data and claims-based estimates of the premium impact of its lymphedema mandate. The average actual annual lymphedema claim cost was $1.59 per individual contract and $3.24 per group contract for the years reported, representing 0.053 and 0.089 % of average total claims. The estimated premium impact ranged 0.00-0.64 % of total average premium for all mandated coverage contracts. In this study actual costs are compared with pre-mandate state mandate commission estimates for proposed lymphedema mandates from Virginia, Massachusetts and California. Ten years of insurance experience with a lymphedema treatment mandate in Virginia shows that costs of lymphedema treatment are an insignificant part of insured healthcare costs, and that treatment of lymphedema may reduce costs of office visits and hospitalizations due to lymphedema and lymphedema-related cellulitis. Estimates based on more limited data overestimate these costs. Lymphedema treatment is a potent tool for reduction in healthcare costs while improving the quality of care for cancer survivors and others suffering with this chronic progressive condition.","[Weiss, Robert] 10671 Baton Rouge Ave, Porter Ranch, CA 91326 USA",,"Weiss, R (通讯作者)，10671 Baton Rouge Ave, Porter Ranch, CA 91326 USA.",LymphActivist@aol.com,,"Weiss, Robert/0000-0003-2279-8554",,,,,7,14,15,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Against the backdrop of European decarbonization and planned TI expansion, we find that emissions increase for current and targeted year-2020 levels of RE production and decrease for year-2030 targets.

We exploit substantial exogenous variation in state food stamp distribution dates and enrollment numbers to estimate the relationship using binary outcome and count data frameworks. Our main result is that, in contrast to previous work on income receipt and mortality, alcohol-related accidents with fatalities are substantially lower on the date of food stamp receipt, and the result is largely driven by a same-day effect. Further, this effect is only present on weekdays. We find no effect of receipt on non-alcohol-related accidents. We hypothesize that this is possibly driven by families being more likely to eat at home on distribution days.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Connecticut, Univ Wisconsin Oshkosh, Storrs, CT USA; [Gordanier, John; Ozturk, Orgul] Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of Connecticut; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Ozturk, O (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",odozturk@moore.sc.edu,"Ozturk, Orgul/ACY-8203-2022",,,,,,57,10,14,0,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

The other four questionnaires included a 29-item Locus of Control Scale; a 19-item Test Anxiety Scale, with 10 items describing debilitating test anxiety and 9 items describing facilitating test anxiety; a 16-item Procrastination Scale; and a 5-item Fear of Failure Scale. Using the Test Anxiety Scale, the class was divided into two groups of students by a median split of 2.8 for debilitating test anxiety and 2.56 for facilitating test anxiety. The results of this study show that students who suffered more from debilitating test anxiety (higher than the 2.8 median split) scored lower average test scores, were non-white, procrastinated more, and experienced lower facilitating test anxiety. Students who experienced more facilitating test anxiety (higher than the 2.56 median split), scored higher average test scores, were males, were internally oriented, and suffered less from debilitating test anxiety. Regression results show that debilitating test anxiety has a significant and negative effect on student performance as reflected by the average class score for the semester. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The said forests are the result of evolution of the history of Spain itself, in which, during almost three centuries, there has been coexistence between the communal uses inherited from their Muslim forbears and the feudal rights that the House of Fajardo, the present Ducal House of Medina Sidonia, received from the Catholic Monarchs. The beginning of the nineteenth century saw the end of the Old Spanish Regime and, with it, the complete transformation of society and customs in force up to that time. Many of these changes were produced by the laws established by the Cortes de Cadiz (a parliament which established a new Spanish constitution), one of which abolished feudal estates. The political instability the country was going through and the controversies that arose as regards how to execute these rulings postponed their effective implementation and created a legal vacuum regarding what, until then, had been the exclusive right of the nobles, rights that included the ownership and exploitation of the forests. This vacuum caused a rapid deforestation in the district, in which the Administration could not intervene until the enactment of the Royal Order of 31 of January 1879. From this date and until the publication of the Royal Decree dated 21 of September 1900 several Forest Engineers carried out and in depth study of the said forests and the causes of their ruin, which finally lead them to be shared between the Ducal House of Medina Sidonia and the villages of Maria, Velez Blanco and Velez Rubio. This established the bases for the forest management which would be carried out during the twentieth century, some aspects of which have continued up to the present moment. In order to gain knowledge of the evolution of the forests of Maria and Velez Blanco during this period, as well as the influence the Forestry Administration had on the same, a study has been carried out on the events that occurred during the last quarter of the nineteen century. These commence with the first years of public intervention and end with the drafting of the Forestry Engineer Domingo Olazabal's Report regarding the specification of territories, approved by Royal Decree dated 21 September 1900 which, by sharing the forests between the Ducal House and the villages, confirmed the public nature of those assigned to the latter, thus establishing the bases for the public forestry management carried out during the twentieth century.

We exploit a rich panel of residential water consumption data to examine heterogeneous responses to both price and nonprice conservation policies during times of drought while controlling for unobservable household characteristics. Our empirical models suggest that among owners of detached, single-family homes in six North Carolina municipalities, relatively low-income households are more sensitive to price and relatively high-consumption households are less sensitive to price. However, prescriptive policies such as restrictions on outdoor water use result in uniform responses across income levels, while simultaneously targeting reductions from households with irrigation systems and historically high consumption.

Foregrounding the importance of systems comprehension, we argue for the strong potential of interactive games to be helpful in engaging consumers in sustainable energy practices, as they can demonstrate complex system dynamics through simulation-based experiences. Focusing on interrogations of engagement and social change posed by gaming theorists and designers, and using several flagship interactive games as points of reference, we discuss the elements of game space that make it capable of simulating complex systems and large-scale implications of energy decisions richly and effectively. We discuss social, technological, and narrative elements of game play, pairing a theoretical investigation with a practical exploration of how energy related games can link with data in the real world, with particular emphasis on the emerging Internet of Things. Our conclusions emphasise the importance of game simulation toward the longer-term goal of cultivating more complex patterns of interaction and cultural analysis around energy use; this is based on the assertion that energy, a social resource, must be managed in ways that are equally social.

Little is known about their comparative effectiveness in the real world, particularly their impact on cost and resources use. The objective of this study was to analyze charges and resource use associated with saxagliptin and sitagliptin to understand the impact of these DPP-4 inhibitor treatment options in a real-world setting. Methods: This was a retrospective, new-user study approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Toledo. Data were collected from a US insurance claims dataset (OptumInsight) for patients newly initiating treatment with saxagliptin or sitagliptin between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2011. ICD-9 code 250 was used to identify patients with T2D. Overall and diabetes-related medical and pharmacy charges were observed. Inpatient hospitalizations were also compared. Propensity score matching was used to balance the cohorts of patients prescribed saxagliptin and sitagliptin. Appropriate univariate statistical tests were applied to the propensity-matched sample to examine differences in resource utilization outcomes. Statistical significance was evaluated at P < 0.05. Result: After the propensity score matching, each cohort included 7711 patients. Saxagliptin treatment was associated with lower overall charges ($13,292 vs $14,032; P = 0.0023) and overall medical charges ($9,540 vs $10,296; P = 0.0024) during the 6-month follow-up period compared with sitagliptin treatment. No significant differences were observed in the overall pharmacy charges ($3,751 vs $3,753; P = 0.6937) and the diabetes-related charges ($5,141 vs $5,232; P = 0. 2957). All-cause and diabetes-related inpatient hospitalization rates were significantly lower with saxagliptin treatment (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0019, respectively). All-caused inpatient charges were also significantly lower with saxagliptin ($2,917.26 vs $3445.89; P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Compared with patients initiating sitagliptin treatment, patients initiating saxagliptin treatment reported lower overall and medical charges and lower overall and diabetes-related hospitalization rates. These findings may aid payers in managing patients with T2D.","[Vaidya, Varun] Univ Toledo, Coll Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Hlth Outcomes & Socioecon Sci, Hlth Sci Campus,Mail Stop 1013,3000 Arlington Ave, Toledo, OH 43614 USA; [Adhikari, Keyuri] Novartis Pharmaceut, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Sheehan, Jack] AstraZeneca, Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res, Ft Washington, PA 19034 USA; [Kalsekar, Iftekhar] Johnson & Johnson, Hlth Informat Med Devices, New York, NY USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo; University of Toledo Health Science Campus; AstraZeneca; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA; Johnson & Johnson; Johnson & Johnson USA,"Vaidya, V (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Coll Pharm & Pharmaceut Sci, Hlth Outcomes & Socioecon Sci, Hlth Sci Campus,Mail Stop 1013,3000 Arlington Ave, Toledo, OH 43614 USA.",varun.vaidya@utoledo.edu,"Adhikari, Keyuri/AAP-7094-2020",,AstraZeneca,AstraZeneca(AstraZeneca),This study was funded by AstraZeneca.

Meanwhile financing costs grew from $ 21 billion in 2003 to $ 48 billion in 2012, or from 5 to 9% of the total higher education spending, even as interest rates declined. Increases in financial returns, however, were concentrated at wealthy colleges whereas increases in financing costs tended to outpace returns at poorer institutions.

In addition, the impact of socioeconomic factors on care use is included in the forecasts. The model is also suitable for the simulation of possible implications of some specific policy measures. The model is a static micro-simulation model, consisting of an explanatory model and a population model. The explanatory model statistically relates care use to individual characteristics. The population model mimics the composition of the population at future points in time. The forecasts of care use are driven by changes in the composition of the population in terms of relevant characteristics instead of dynamics at the individual level. The results show that a further 37 % increase in the use of elderly care (from 7 to 9 % of the Dutch 30-plus population) between 2008 and 2030 can be expected due to a further ageing of the population. However, the use of care is expected to increase less than if it were based on the increasing number of elderly only (+70 %), due to decreasing disability levels and increasing levels of education. As an application of the model, we simulated the effects of restricting access to residential care to elderly people with severe physical disabilities. The result was a lower growth of residential care use (32 % instead of 57 %), but a somewhat faster growth in the use of home care (35 % instead of 32 %).","[Eggink, Evelien; Woittiez, Isolde; Ras, Michiel] Netherlands Inst Social Res SCP, POB 16164, NL-2500 BD The Hague, Netherlands",,"Eggink, E (通讯作者)，Netherlands Inst Social Res SCP, POB 16164, NL-2500 BD The Hague, Netherlands.",e.eggink@scp.nl,,,,,,,34,6,8,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Other authors however, place more emphasis on trends in specialisation and differences in productive bases as the driving forces behind urban divergence. Somewhat similarly, Storper (2013) argues that recent divergence been fundamentally been driven by the fact that some cities have become more specialised in knowledge intensive sectors. While most of this interest in urban divergence has been based on US cities, recent European research also reports divergent processes. The aim of this article is to examine the degree of divergence across UK cities and to analyse how far this has been driven by differences among cities in industrial structure and specialisation, tradable bases and productivity.","[Martin, Ron; Gardiner, Ben] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CBE 9EP, England; [Gardiner, Ben] Cambridge Econometr, Cambridge CB1 2HT, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton; University of Cambridge,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk; P.J.Sunley@soton.ac.uk; pt23@cam.ac.uk; bg@camecon.com,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023","SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",Foresight Project; ESRC [ES/N006135/1]; ESRC [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N006135/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Foresight Project; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research for this article was undertaken as part of the UK Government Office for Science Foresight Project on The Future of Cities.

In this investigation, we would like to assess whether: (1) the general practitioners (GPs) having signed P4P contract obtain better results regarding the target-goal than non-signatories; (2) (part of) this progression is due to the CAPI contract itself (tentative measurement of a causal effect''); (3) (part of) the money spent on this P4P incentive can be self-financed with the amount of pharmaceuticals saved. Methods We matched cross-sectional and longitudinal data including 4622 French GPs from June 2011 to December 2012. A treatment effect model using instrumental variables was performed to take into account potential self-selection issue in signing. After having identified the NET impact of the P4P, we calculate the cost of an avoided benzodiazepines treatment. Results In our study, GPs who have signed the CAPI contract (36 % of the sample) are more numerous in achieving benzodiazepines target goal than non-signatories: 90.7 vs. 85.5 %. After controlling for the self-selection bias, the propensity of GPs to achieve the benzodiazepines target is only 0.31 % higher for signatories than for their non-signing counterparts-estimate for June 2012, which yields a statistically significant gap. Our economic analysis demonstrates that the CAPI contract does not allow savings, but presents in 2012 a NET cost of 93.6(sic) per avoided benzodiazepines treatment (291(sic) in 2011). Conclusions The P4P contract has a positive but modest impact on the achievement of GPs regarding benzodiazepines indicator.","[Michel-Lepage, Audrey] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, SESSTIM UMR912, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, GREQAM UMR7316, Marseille, France; [Ventelou, Bruno] ORS PACA, 23 Rue Stanislas Torrent, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Michel-Lepage, Audrey] IHU, Fdn Mediterranee Infect, Marseille, France",Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Michel-Lepage, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Aix Marseille Sch Econ, SESSTIM UMR912, Marseille, France.;Michel-Lepage, A (通讯作者)，IHU, Fdn Mediterranee Infect, Marseille, France.",audrey.michel-lepage@inserm.fr,,"MICHEL-LEPAGE, Audrey/0000-0001-8851-5540",Mediterranee Infection foundation; Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des produits de sante (ANSM),Mediterranee Infection foundation; Agence Nationale de Securite du Medicament et des produits de sante (ANSM)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"A.M-L. received a PhD grant from the Mediterranee Infection foundation (a non-profit-making foundation, http://www.mediterranee-infection.com/).

These so called. ecosystem services, have recently gained a lot of scientific interest, also in the field of forest science. This approach is not new to the forest sector, as forest ecosystems have been used in the past for many different purposes besides wood production and even their non-consumptive benefits have been well known for more than one hundred years. Central European forest scientists summarized these diverse services under the term forest functions, a widely accepted approach in the region. Since both concepts have developed separately this paper aims at creating a base to enable interdisciplinary scientific exchange among forest scientists and other disciplines by reviewing and comparing the concepts of ecosystem services and forest functions systematically. This review uses scientific publications (generally in English) to encompass the ecosystem service concept and textbooks as well as legislation and forest management guidelines (predominantly German), for the forest functions concept. Additionally a meta-analysis was conducted to examine their publication patterns. The review shows that despite their different backgrounds, both concepts developed similar definitions and classification schemes. Both consider the valuation of services or functions using similar methods, although their motivations for valuation differ. Interactions of functions and services are more intensely investigated within the ecosystem service concept, whereas forest functions have been more management orientated and consider aspects of sustainability two points that have been criticized to be insufficiently considered within the ecosystem service concept. Merging the ideas of ecosystem services and forest functions can therefore contribute to science in general, forest policy as well as forest management (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A sizeable body of literature has explained the driving factors of the land movement but most of them focus on processes at the national level, principally on the changing socio-political landscapes, and the overlapping land use policy and regulations. In contrast, this paper attempts to find explanation of the dynamics of the land movement, and tries to explain the emerging power of peasant farmers at the field. The research was conducted in the forest of the state company of Perhutani Sub-Forest District (BKPH) Kalibodri, Forest District (KPH) Kendal, Central Java, where nearly two-fifths of the forestland is illegally occupied by peasant farmers for agricultural cropping. This paper borrows actor-centred power (ACP) of Krott et al. (2014), which offers an analytical approach to understand the empirical power resources of actors in social-political relationships. It finds the prolonged occupation of the state forestland is due to the combination of the weakened power of the state apparatus and the more consolidated power of peasant farmers. The state apparatus is weakened by its diminishing coercive power. It is also unable to provide concrete incentives that would otherwise alter the behavior of the peasant farmers. At the same time, the peasant farmers accumulate support from a wider society, from local to national level. Even international actors also play a part so that significantly affect how the state company deals with the peasant farmers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We develop a closed-form formula that approximates the SCC for a general economy, and then explore the capacity of the analytical approach to capture the key SCC drivers, and thus to replicate the results of the deterministic IAMs. The formula explains the parameter-driven SCC variation of a mainstream IAM without a systematic bias. The sensitivity analysis identifies and measures the performance limits of the closed-form formulas. We then use the analytic formula to structurally interpret a distribution of SCCs from deterministic IAMs, and develop an analytical breakdown and quantification of how different sets of parameters contribute to the SCC distribution. This allows the user of the formula to evaluate where particular parameter choices tend to place the resulting SCC outcome in the distribution of outcomes for the universe of deterministic IAMs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

There is a resulting problem of possible misinterpretation, as well as a dearth of appropriate attention to substantive significance. Additionally, one of the two surveys suffers from problems of statistical validity, possibly due to confirmation bias.

One explanation is that individuals use these benefits to overcome borrowing constraints. I explore this by examining the enlistment response of individuals to additional financial aid that can be used immediately upon high-school graduation or delayed until after military enlistment. I find that the introduction of a merit-aid program decreases the probability that a male enlists in the military by 0.6 percentage points (a 6% reduction), and that these effects are concentrated among applicants who are more likely to qualify for merit scholarships. The reductions are largest in low-income areas, supporting the argument that the effects on enlistment are a result of easing financial constraints. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

New insights can be gained by looking closely at how local advocates seek to leverage symbolic commitments. Leveraging can be a route towhatwe call 'contingent coupling', a circumstantial shrinking of the gap between legitimating symbols and concrete conditions. Based on interview data, this article maps several modes of leveraging by examining how unions in apparel/footwear factories in Indonesia sought to use foreign brands'/retailers' CSR commitments. The modes include not only cross-border activist campaigns but also more subtle and previously overlooked forms of negotiation. Our qualitative accounts and a quantitative analysis of factories suggest that CSR has been a platform for some modest gains for Indonesian unions, but it has not allowed robust, transformative changes. This elucidation of leveraging suggests hypotheses about conditions for tighter coupling.","[Bartley, Tim] Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Egels-Zanden, Niklas] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business Econ & Law, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Gothenburg,"Bartley, T (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Dept Sociol, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",bartley.83@osu.edu,"Egels-Zandén, Niklas/K-4590-2012","Bartley, Tim/0000-0002-0049-0607",American Sociological Association's Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline; Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council,American Sociological Association's Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline; Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council,Partial funding for the research was provided by a grant from the American Sociological Association's Fund for the Advancement of the Discipline and a grant from the Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council.,,62,61,67,2,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The study concludes that the larger events in Canada have resulted in a longer policy window, with a higher focus on developing responses on multiple levels, while the issue in Sweden has led to more specialized response, with the policy window closing after instrumental revisions of legislation.

We also analyze the effect of bank upsizing on the financial stability. Our results show that a rise in large banks' market power, accompanying an increase in their market shares, lowers the capital adequacy of small banks. Small banks' nonperforming loans and the possibility of their bankruptcy also increase as large banks' market shares rise. We further show that larger banks tend to have lower capital adequacy ratios, liquidity ratios, and distance-to-default ratios. Our study suggests that large banks' greater market shares are associated with small banks' financial instability.

Since the end of the 1950s, natural gas exploration and exploitation has been a major focus of the Dutch energy policy. Discussions about the future of energy in the Netherlands tend to focus either on pro-gas or pro-renewable energy. Using Q methodology we have constructed more nuanced perspectives on the future of energy in the Netherlands. We used these perspectives in a stakeholder dialogue, in which the participants further detailed the perspectives and discussed future policy options. Analysis of the outcomes of this process teaches us that the Netherlands remain gas-focused, that renewable energy sources are as much a dogma as nuclear power was in the 1960s, and that the prospect of an austere future is a non-debatable issue. From a methodological perspective it can be concluded that the refined methodology contributed to diversity in views, opened up the dominant discourse and led to learning among participating stakeholders.

About 90 % of this population are members of social health insurances (SHI) whose premiums are generally income-related and independent of health status. For most of these members, holding social health insurance is mandatory. As a consequence, genuine information about preferences for health insurance is not available. The aim of this study was therefore to determine and analyze the willingness to pay (WTP) for health insurance among elderly Germans. Methods Data from a population-based 8-year follow-up of a large cohort study conducted in the Saarland, Germany was used. Participants aged 57-84 years passed a geriatric assessment and responded to a health economic questionnaire. Individuals' WTP was elicited based on a contingent valuation method with a payment card. Results Mean monthly WTP per capita for health insurance amounted to (sic)260. This corresponded to about 20 % of individual disposable income. Regression analyses showed that WTP increased significantly with higher income, male gender, higher educational level, and privately insured status. In contrast, neither increasing morbidity level nor higher individual health care costs influenced WTP significantly. Discussion The relatively large extent of average WTP for health insurance indicates that the elderly would probably accept higher contributions to SHI rather than policy efforts to reduce contributions. The identified determinants of WTP might indicate that elderly generally approve the principle of solidarity of the SHI with contributions depending on income rather than morbidity.","[Bock, Jens-Oliver; Heider, Dirk; Matschinger, Herbert; Koenig, Hans-Helmut] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Matschinger, Herbert] Univ Leipzig, Inst Social Med Occupat Hlth & Publ Hlth, Philipp Rosenthal Str 55, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany; [Brenner, Hermann; Saum, Kai-Uwe] German Canc Res Ctr, Div Clin Epidemiol & Aging Res, Neuenheimer Feld 581, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; [Brenner, Hermann] Heidelberg Univ, Network Aging Res, Bergheimer Str 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany; [Haefeli, Walter E.] Heidelberg Univ, Dept Clin Pharmacol & Pharmacoepidemiol, Neuenheimer Feld 410, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Leipzig University; Helmholtz Association; German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ); Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg,"Bock, JO (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",j.bock@uke.de,"Brenner, Hermann/ABE-6383-2020; Haefeli, Walter Emil/AAJ-3024-2020; König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018; Brenner, Hermann/B-4627-2017","Brenner, Hermann/0000-0002-6129-1572; Haefeli, Walter Emil/0000-0003-0672-6876; Brenner, Hermann/0000-0002-6129-1572; Matschinger, Herbert/0000-0001-7146-6770","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research [01ET0717, 01ET0718, 01ET0719, 01ET1004A, 01ET1004B, 01ET1004C]",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),"This study was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Grant numbers 01ET0717, 01ET0718, 01ET0719, 01ET1004A, 01ET1004B, 01ET1004C).",,42,11,11,6,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, even a relatively low number of dimensions in future conditions can lead to hundreds or even thousands of plausible future scenarios. Creating highly diverse but conceivable visions of the future in which to explore decision-making, exploratory futures techniques rely on the selection of a small number of plausible scenarios from the larger set. In this paper we describe a new method for finding maximally diverse sets containing a small number of plausible scenarios from a multi-dimensional morphological analysis. It is based on a mathematical optimization of diversity that is robust to the uncertainty in the framing of future factors and states and in what stakeholders might consider diverse combinations of those factors and states. We also describe implementation of the method as a software tool and its performance in recent exploratory scenario development by CGIAR and partners for regional environmental change, food security and livelihoods.

The old system of minimum wage setting was based on a single nationwide minimum wage which was differentiated across regions and occupations via a cumbersome framework of coefficients. The new system is a mixture of the government-set minimum wage at the federal level and collective agreements at the regional level. We show that the system of minimum wage setting has become more flexible. The reform succeeded in raising the real value of the minimum wage and increasing earnings of low-paid workers without causing significant negative effects in terms of employment. The reform did not lead to greater regional variation of minimum wages. Nevertheless, it introduced some new imbalances: an unintended consequence of the reform was the emergence of separate regional wage sub-minima for private and public sector workers in many regions. The major challenge in coming years is to strengthen the institutions of collective bargaining, introduce evidence-based evaluation and boost the capacities of government and non-government monitoring agencies.","[Lukiyanova, Anna; Vishnevskaya, Nina] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ HSE, Moscow 101000, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Vishnevskaya, N (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ HSE, Ctr Labour Market Studies, 20 Maysnitskaya Str, Moscow 101000, Russia.",vishnev@hse.ru,"Lukyanova, Anna/AAS-9103-2021; Lukiyanova, Anna/J-9596-2015","Lukiyanova, Anna/0000-0003-0917-7438",National Research University Higher School of Economics,National Research University Higher School of Economics,This work is supported by the Basic Research Programme of the National Research University Higher School of Economics.,,29,6,6,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

In particular, we show that around the year 2000, the demand for cognitive tasks underwent a reversal. In response, high-skilled workers moved down the occupational ladder and increasingly displaced lower-educated workers in less skill-intensive jobs. While these effects were present before the financial crisis of 2008, they became more obvious after jobs associated with the housing bubble disappeared.","[Beaudry, Paul] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Beaudry, Paul] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Green, David A.] Univ British Columbia, London, ON, Canada; [Green, David A.] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Sand, Benjamin M.] York Univ, N York, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",University of British Columbia; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; York University - Canada,"Beaudry, P (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",bmsand@yorku.ca,,,Alfred P.

Restaurants are particularly affected by online reviewing. If the impact of online consumer reviews (OCRs) on the demand side of markets is now well understood and measured, few studies examine the reception of this new evaluation method by those who are assessed. Based on interviews with French restaurant managers, our research shows that OCRs systems reconfigure relations of accountability in the restaurant industry. We use the notion of reactivity to describe the mechanisms through which the new evaluation system transforms the activity of restaurants. We also examine the affects surrounding the reception of ratings and reviews by restaurant managers and the moral criteria that accompany their discourses on online reviews. Many restaurants consider online reviews as a brutal and hypocritical mode of judgment. The judgment produced by online ratings and reviews is not easily borne by restaurant managers, because it challenges the conventions of quality they had previously internalized as legitimate, that is, those produced by professional experts. We interpret this ambivalent reception as the unfinished movement of transforming a performative reputation device into a legitimate evaluation institution.","[Beuscart, Jean-Samuel; Mellet, Kevin; Trespeuch, Marie] Orange Labs, Sociol & Econ Networks & Serv SENSE, Chatillon, France; [Beuscart, Jean-Samuel] Univ Paris Est Marne La Vallee, LISIS, Paris, France; [Mellet, Kevin] Mines ParisTech, CSI, Paris, France",Orange SA; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; ESIEE Paris; Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech,"Trespeuch, M (通讯作者)，Orange Labs, Sociol & Econ Networks & Serv SENSE, Chatillon, France.",mtrespeuch@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,21,25,3,41,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Sea turtles, along with US and foreign fisheries for swordfish co-occur on the high seas in the North and Central Pacific and that allows for spillover effects. When one fishery is required to curtail fishing activity to reduce incidental fishing mortality on sea turtle populations, the activity of other, unregulated fleets may change in ways that adversely affect the very species intended for protection. This study provides an empirical model that estimates these spillover effects on sea turtle bycatch resulting from production displacement between regulated US and less-regulated non-US fleets in the North and Central Pacific Ocean. The study demonstrates strong spillover effects, resulting in more sea turtle interaction due to increased foreign fleet activity when Hawaii swordfish production declines.","[Chan, Hing Ling] Univ Hawaii, JIMAR, NOAA Fisheries Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA IRC,NMFS PIFSC ESD Socioecon, 1845 Wasp Blvd.,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA; [Pan, Minling] NOAA IRC, Natl Marine Fisheries Serv, Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NMFS PIFSC ESD Socioecon, 1845 Wasp Blvd,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA",University of Hawaii System; National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA; National Aeronautics & Space Administration (NASA); National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA,"Chan, HL (通讯作者)，Univ Hawaii, JIMAR, NOAA Fisheries Pacific Isl Fisheries Sci Ctr, NOAA IRC,NMFS PIFSC ESD Socioecon, 1845 Wasp Blvd.,Bldg 176, Honolulu, HI 96818 USA.",hingling.chan@noaa.gov; minling.pan@noaa.gov,"Fennell, Hannah/AAI-1408-2019",,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [NA11NMF4320128],National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)(National Oceanic Atmospheric Admin (NOAA) - USA),"Funding for this study was provided to the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research (JIMAR) via National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), grant number NA11NMF4320128.

Several studies were funded by the European Commission in order to offer a deeper understanding of what accessible tourism means. Also, several research projects were supported to create accessible tourism itineraries. In 2014, the European Excellence Awards for Accessible Tourism rewarded the true commitment to accessibility of several European enterprises and public authorities. Making European tourism more accessible is also directly correlated with making it more competitive. In this context, the present article advances the idea of creating an innovative tool, based on a friendly technology, offering the possibility to destination management organizations to obtain direct information regarding the accessibility of the tourism and hospitality facilities and services within destinations. We used the literature review, the case study and the innovation, as qualitative research methods. The first part of the article is an overview of the importance of accessibility for the European tourism. In the second part of this paper, we presented the central role of improving accessibility within the most recent European Tourism Indicator System ETIS Toolkit for sustainable destination management which was launched in March 2016. In this context, a brief presentation of the research project called Destination Intelligent Management for Sustainable Tourism (DIMAST) was included due to the fact that it was conceived mainly based on the first European Tourism Indicator System Toolkit for Sustainable Destinations, launched in 2013. We advanced the idea of improving the Business Intelligence tool created within this project by conceiving an innovative technology to obtain direct information from tourists with special needs from Brasov County. Such approach can support the efforts of the local destination management organization to improve the accessibility of tourism, hence making it more sustainable and competitive.","[Dinca, Gheorghita; Cismaru, Laura; Bratucu, Gabriel] Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania",Transylvania University of Brasov,"Dinca, G (通讯作者)，Transilvania Univ Brasov, Brasov, Romania.",,,,"Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects PN-II-PT-PCCA [324/2014]","Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects PN-II-PT-PCCA","The research presented in this paper is supported by the Romanian Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation, the Joint Applied Research Projects PN-II-PT-PCCA-2013-4, under the contract no. 324/2014.",,10,0,0,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,329,336,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200043,0

Working methodology relied on gathering the data through applying questionnaires with fix answers and open ending answers and on interviews with local producers and authorities. So, we stopped on identifying local food, the role they play in maintaining biodiversity in studied area, but also on identifying agricultural systems practiced referring to agriculture type, technology degree, labour force required and its assuring, but also others aspects related to production manner. We try to identify the producers from the village that are selling their products on local market or on markets from Timisoara (Timisoara is the largest city from western Romania, with 300,000 inhabitants) where the major part of the market is owned by big store chains. An important aspect is the social one through underlining the added value that human relation bring to this economic process by way of communication and partnerships establishment. A part of the study was dedicated to analyse the implications at household level that capitalization of local food in short supply chains, but also all in all local economy. At the end of the study, we can conclude that the village has large potential of production, but from the producers point of view there is the need for consultancy aimed to solve the difficulties they face in organizing and association for a better entry to Timisoara market, and in this way the local products can have a larger importance in agricultural systems and local economy of this peri-urban locality.","[Dumitrescu, Carmen Simona; Salasan, Cosmin; Mateoc-Sirb, Nicoleta; Gavruta, Adrian] Banat Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Michael I Roman, Fac Agr Management, Timisoara, Romania",Banat University of Agricultural Sciences & Veterinary Medicine,"Dumitrescu, CS (通讯作者)，Banat Univ Agr Sci & Vet Med King Michael I Roman, Fac Agr Management, Timisoara, Romania.",,"Dumitrescu, Carmen Simona/S-2951-2019; MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/AAB-9355-2021; MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/AAO-7110-2021; Salasan, Cosmin C/C-9565-2009; Dumitrescu, Carmen Simona/U-4005-2017","Dumitrescu, Carmen Simona/0000-0002-0060-6753; MATEOC-SÎRB, Nicoleta/0000-0002-6023-9668; Dumitrescu, Carmen Simona/0000-0002-0060-6753",,,,,7,0,0,0,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,193,197,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100026,0

This phenomenal development has resulted in a plethora of food related contamination scandals. With the increasing complexity within the supply chain networks, it is imperative that all actors within the food supply chain operate in an ethical and sustainable manner and this paper illustrates a process model that will effectively bolster the ethical underpinning of a fresh produce supply chain. This paper evinces a structural conceptual model that facilitates the integration of responsibility within the operations of the organizations, within a fruit and vegetable supply chain. It also conceptualises a seven-tiered sequential model, the Vision to Innovation model (The V2I model) of responsibility, which has its foundation based on the congruence of the ethics related values, and Values consonance along its supply chain actors. The second element involves Communication among the supply chain elements; the successive elements include Implementation of ethical standards along the supply chain, the Monitoring systems, Control systems, Collaboration and finally, Innovation. This model accounts for responsibility-centricity along the entire supply chain and the implementation of this model, within the practical business world, would render an ethical climate for the industry. The authors postulate that this will positively influence the T's of fresh produce supply chains, namely: Traceability, Testability, Transparency, Trust and Time. Currently minimal research on social responsibility and sustainability within the supply chain context is present and this paper contributes to such a gap in literature.","[Jacob-John, J.; Veerapa, N.

The concept of performation has for instance been used to enable discursive and material assemblages that challenge this dichotomy, with the general aim of transforming the economy. While the overall intent of this article is to contribute to this bridging, its direction of travel is the opposite: to bring the economy into politics. Specifically, it situates the notion of performativity within studies on grassroots politics in a material sense. First, it discusses some of the leading scholarship on grassroots movements, focusing on their take on the economy. It moves on to suggest that some of the problems that are identified can be addressed using performativity theory, the benefits of which are discussed in the second part. Finally, it empirically illustrates the theoretical discussion by analysing the performativity of the discourses, things and people that are jointly fighting the Mafia today. The article places social movement studies in dialogue with scholarship which is preoccupied with the economic-political cleft, in order to encourage thinking of the economy as a space for political possibility and social struggle, rather than seeing it as a place of capitalocentrism, structural exploitation and inescapability.","[Jerne, Christina] Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Jerne, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Sch Commun & Culture, Aarhus, Denmark.",cjerne@cc.au.dk,,"Jerne, Christina/0000-0003-0438-6441",,,,,58,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The objective of the paper is to investigate the impact of the formality of PMS 1) on the key success factors (KFs) of PMS and 2) on the achievement of performance. The formality of PMS is investigated on three different levels: structured and formal PMS, formal PMS, and informal PMS. We define a PMS structured & formal when it is designed and built upon a well-known existing system structure, such as the BSC. It is regarded as formal when it is formal and designed by the own staff of the firm. PMS is considered informal when the firm does not use any formal system. The paper makes use of the chain framework developed by Kadak and Laitinen (2016) to assess the links between the formality and KFs. The links between the formality and performance are assessed by three different impact measures on performance. The results implicate that the usage of a structured & formal PMS has stronger links to KFs of PMS than the usage of the formal in-house designed PMS. Moreover, the usage of a formal PMS leads to stronger links with KFs than using an informal PMS. Formal PMSs make a stronger impact on financial performance than an informal PMS. The same finding can also be observed for achievement of strategic objectives and non-financial performance but the results are not statistically significant due to the small number of informal PMS (5) in the sample. Thus our empirical findings encourage organizations to implement PMSs based on the existing system structures rather than own in-house design and to move from the usage of informal PMSs to formal systems.","[Kadak, Tarmo] Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia; [Laitinen, Erkki K.] Univ Vaasa, Vaasa, Finland",Tallinn University of Technology; University of Vaasa,"Kadak, T (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Tallinn, Estonia.",,"Kadak, Tarmo/D-1352-2015",,,,,,54,2,2,0,4,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,173,189,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700019,0

My particular concern is social scientific writing about the crisis that might be grouped loosely under the rubric of 'performativity', namely the argument that models (or representations, either mathematic or linguistic) produce markets, and that markets are best studied through ethnographic observation. I ask why language, performance and metaphor itself - what was once the province of a more literary tradition - have become a methodological tool for social scientists now in their particular investigations of finance. I suggest that a more complete analysis of finance may be located if economic performativity and aesthetic theories of performance are brought into dialogue. In part one, I read the ethnographic work of Donald MacKenzie, most centrally, as well as that of Janet Roitman, both of whom have isolated some literary problem of the economy: performativity and narrative, respectively. In the second section, I look at a series of artists and theorists of performance who might be understood to offer a critique of the relationship between language, money and performativity.","[La Berge, Leigh Claire] St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada",Saint Marys University - Canada,"La Berge, LC (通讯作者)，St Marys Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 3C3, Canada.",lclaberge@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,8,11,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The chapter starts by considering the growth models of an unexploited population and then introduces commercial harvesting. Still maintaining a dynamic perspective, an analysis of equilibrium situations is proposed for a natural resource under various market structures (monopoly, oligopoly and open access). The essential dynamic properties of these models are explained, as well as their main economic insights. Moreover, some key assumptions and tools of intertemporal optimal harvesting are recalled, thus providing an interesting application of the theory of optimal growth.","[Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, 3C Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Lamantia, Fabio] Univ Manchester, Economics Sch Social Sci, Arthur Lewis Bldg, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Radi, Davide] LIUC Univ Cattaneo, Sch Econ & Management, 22 Cso Matteotti, I-21053 Castellanza, VA, Italy; [Sbragia, Lucia] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Durham, England",University of Calabria; University of Manchester; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc; Durham University,"Lamantia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, 3C Via P Bucci, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",fabio.lamantia@unical.it; dradi@liuc.it; lucia.sbragia@durham.ac.uk,"Radi, Davide/M-6403-2013; Sbragia, Lucia/AAH-1762-2021; Radi, Davide/HHR-9023-2022","Radi, Davide/0000-0001-7809-1166; Lamantia, Fabio/0000-0003-2147-0979",,,,,30,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-33276-5; 978-3-319-33274-1,SPRINGER PR COMPLEX,,,2016,,,,,,,257,289,,10.1007/978-3-319-33276-5_5,0.0,,,33,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG5RU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389714900005,0

When dealing with these issues, we have analysed the existing approaches of economic theory to the issue of interference or non-interference to the existence and operation of the monopoly (and oligopoly). We reviewed the possible benefits of regulation and the cost of regulation. We also compared the benefits of regulation with the benefits and negatives of non-interference into the imperfect market structure. On the basis of the experience of the implementation of antitrust policy in Slovakia, we have recommended changes in the approach of the state to the regulation of monopolies. Typical monopolies are usually power plants, distribution networks for elektricity, gasworks and waterworks. In most countries, these energy companies have arisen as a state businesses at the time, when was built the basic energy infrastructure. To date, little has changed in the world in this area. Gaz de France, Ruhrgas, Enel, Gazprom, E.ON, ?EZ and other companies remained state or parastatal. In Slovakia has taken place in this sector the extensive privatization. The paradox, however, is that these strategic enterprises (SPP and other) were sold to the state or parastatal companies in foreign countries. The result of this is the fact that today they employ only 3.2% people in the industry, while their sales reaching up to 16.6% of the entire industry. The total profit in this industry is up 48%. Gross profitability of companies in the energy sector in Slovakia is almost three times higher in comparison with Germany. It is caused also by wrong state regulatory policy. As a result, they are extremely high profits of companies and high prices of energy in Slovakia. There are three options for resolving this situation. The first option is to provide a substantially stronger regulation of the final prices for retail customers and wholesalers. The second option consists in a special taxation for these companies. A third option is to buy back shares of these companies.","[Matouskova, Eleonora] Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Matouskova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,,,grant agency VEGA [1/00246/16],grant agency VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article has been prepared with the support of the grant agency VEGA - research project no. 1/00246/16 The effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy in the course of the economic cycle.,,4,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,109,114,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100015,0

The aim of the study to carry out theoretical analysis of the company's financial crisis diagnostics in the view of insolvency prevention is achieved applying monographic or descriptive research method, comparative analysis methods, as well as employing qualitative, grouping, and graphical methods. As a result of the research, the authors have concluded that a status of company's insolvency, which can be characterized by the company's inability to perform its commitments and by predominance of the company's liabilities over its assets, is the last and the most severe stage of financial crises, mostly deriving from a long-term reluctance by the management to react to the current financial crisis in the company. Thus, one of the company's insolvency prevention options shall be timely detecting of symptoms of the company's financial crisis in its early stages that is a priority objective of the crisis diagnostics. Crisis diagnostics is a systematic application of a several different (usually financial) models to assess the company's status and to identify possible symptoms of the crisis. Early detection of the crisis indications significantly increases possibilities of saving the company's assets.","[Mietule, Iveta; Klodane, Alona] Rezekne Acad Technol, Riga, Latvia",Rezekne Academy of Technologies,"Mietule, I (通讯作者)，Rezekne Acad Technol, Riga, Latvia.",,"Mietule, Iveta/AAM-4272-2020; Mietule, Iveta I/A-5299-2016",,,,,,31,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,345,353,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700034,0

In 2004 RBGE formed a new Education Department and over the last 10 years has significantly expanded the horticulture programmes offered and the number of students. The DHE was replaced by a Higher National Diploma and a BSc (Hons) in Horticulture with Plantsmanship, delivered in partnership with the University of Glasgow and the Scotland's Rural Collage (SRUC) and the level of practical hands-on experience within the gardens has been increased. In addition to the HND/BSc, RBGE launched Apprenticeships in their garden and a range of RBGE branded Certificates and Diplomas, including the RBGE Certificate in Practical Horticulture (CPH) in 2006. The CPH delivers the key practical skills of a horticulturist in a 10-day programme. This has been endorsed by Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) and, as well as a number of UK centres now offering the programme, it has been used to develop horticultural capacity in countries including China, Lao PDR, Mexico, Oman, Thailand and Turkey. RBGE subsequently created a Train the Trainers course in conjunction with the Royal Horticultural Society to better enable horticulturists to pass on their skills and knowledge. Most recently RBGE launched their own on-line learning environment Propagate Learning and horticultural courses are now available through remote and blended learning. This paper concludes with the future ambitions and plans for the development of horticultural education at RBGE, including the potential for an International Diploma in Botanic Garden Horticulture, an increased use of technology and the development of a Scottish School of Horticulture.","[Morris, L.

The effects are analyzed at the individual vessel level through representative surveys of costs and earnings. Bioeconomic theory and a vessel economics framework for open-access fisheries are the basis for the empirical discussion of a case study involving Vietnam's offshore gillnet fishery. The results demonstrate that the subsidy program has positive effects on vessel profitability, but the profits erode over the two years of the analysis. Subsidies have a positive impact on the operating cash flows of large vessels but negative effects on their intra-marginal rent, and bring benefits to vessel owners rather than crew members.

The obtained results indicate a positive impact of entrepreneurship and investment on decline in unemployment rate and improvement of Poland's socio-economic situation.","[Pietrzak, Michal Bernard] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland; [Balcerzak, Adam P.] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econ, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University; Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Pietrzak, MB (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ, Dept Econometr & Stat, Ul Gagarina 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",michal.pietrzak@umk.pl; adam.balcerzak@umk.pl,"Balcerzak, Adam/D-7224-2016; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/I-4919-2014","Balcerzak, Adam/0000-0003-0352-1373; Pietrzak, Michal Bernard/0000-0002-9263-4478",,,,,23,26,26,0,2,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-972328-0-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,303,308,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG9XU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000394099300049,0

We develop a dynamic model, incorporating quasi-malleable capital, race to fish and invest behaviors and myopic expectations, in which the level of excess capacity is endogenously determined. We show the importance of capital malleability, and of other biological and economic conditions, in determining the existence and strength of persistent equilibrium excess capacity in the fishery. We also highlight a link between the state of the fishery at the time race behavior emerges and the resultant level of excess capacity. Our results have implications for both the management of excess capacity and the use of empirical measures of excess capacity as performance indicators in fisheries where race behaviors are present.","[Rust, Steven; Jennings, Sarah; Yamazaki, Satoshi] Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Rust, S (通讯作者)，Univ Tasmania, Tasmanian Sch Business & Econ, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",steven.rust@utas.edu.au; sarah.jennings@utas.edu.au; satoshi.yamazaki@utas.edu.au,"Jennings, Sarah M/J-7888-2014; Yamazaki, Satoshi/J-7538-2014","Yamazaki, Satoshi/0000-0003-1279-2706; Rust, STeven/0000-0002-1689-0437",,,,,62,8,8,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

See, for all, the work of Aurora Teixeira, Donald McCabe, Dan Ariely, Francesca Gino or Steven Levitt. More than an ethic crises, the explanation could arise not only of utility-maximization behaviours but also, in a competitive environment, from perverse incentives associated to bounded rationality and cognitive biases. Based in Harry Potter's fiction, mainly spent in a school environment and transversal to most cultural and age strata, and in Behavioural Law and Economics insights, we will both look for illustrations and explanations for this phenomenon and for effective and efficient solutions to deal with it without imposing a typical paternalistic approach. Firstly, this task implies the identification of the costs and benefits behind the motivation of cheating and of the risk taken both in an individual and collective perspective. Secondly, it is necessary to recognize the biases behind the decision of cheating (after all agents are of flesh and bone, contextualized and with computational and motivational limitations), including an eventual distortive institutional framework. Inspired by Hogwarts, we will try to present some proposals for a correct and preventive architecture of choice and nudging behaviours to decrease academic fraud. Even though some may doubt its normative inferences, this approach has positive, normative and prescriptive potential, i.e. prevision, redirection of conducts and design of a legal framework to contradict systematic biases. Therefore, as institutions serve as behavioural anchors, the readjustment of a new choice architecture implies, surely, its re-appreciation (at least in relative terms) and a re-equation of values, mainly academic integrity.","[Saraiva, Rute] Univ Lisbon, Sch Law, Alamedad Univ,Cidade Univ, P-1649014 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Saraiva, R (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Sch Law, Alamedad Univ,Cidade Univ, P-1649014 Lisbon, Portugal.",rutesaraiva@fd.ul.pt,,,,,,,134,0,0,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,343,374,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_17,0.0,,,32,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500018,0

Decline has not been arrested or reversed by the many strategic initiatives undertaken in recent years such as organising campaigns or coalition building, although it is possible that the state of the unions would be even more parlous if these initiatives had not been pursued. Against this bleak backcloth, there are some positive signs: unions representing specific occupations, such as school teachers, nurses and airline pilots, have retained high levels of density; and union confederations in many parts of Europe have launched successful general strikes against unpopular government reforms to pensions and welfare benefits. Unions need to position themselves as agencies that can help deal with the growing problems of wage stagnation, low wages, income inequality and insufficient economic demand. That in turn requires a coherent challenge to the dominant neoliberal narrative.","[Kelly, John] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Ind Relat, London WC1E 7HX, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Kelly, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Dept Management, Malet St, London WC1E 7HX, England.",j.kelly@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,52,34,38,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

They are usually produced by agencies operating at the national or supra national level. However, water and sanitation policies are implemented at the local level. Our article addresses the question of data and indicator usability at the municipal level, while investigating water supply and sanitation services. Firstly, we selected a sample of municipalities in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Area and classified them according to a set of national indicators. Then, we interviewed the person responsible for water and sanitation policies in each municipality. By triangulating qualitative and quantitative data, we found gaps between the indicators produced by national information systems and the data required and employed by local decision-makers. Discussing these results in relation to the literature, we identified gaps and bridges, which could serve as key elements for a governance design baseline with the power to guide future local decision-making processes.

The objectives in our study were to analyse differences in health state valuations among three respondent groups in the context of medical rehabilitation in Germany. Using the time trade-off (TTO) technique, valuations of EQ-5D-3L health states were obtained from patients with musculoskeletal diseases, healthy volunteers and health care professionals. We used linear mixed models to predict TTO utilities and specified and tested interaction effects. We identified statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences among the three groups in six out of 42 health states. On average, patients' TTO values were somewhat higher compared with other respondent groups. Most of these differences occurred in severe health states. Mean differences and mean absolute differences were 0.02 and 0.14 for patients vs healthy volunteers and 0.06 and 0.14 for patients vs health care professionals. Furthermore, significant effects among respondents were observed for seven of the 22 possible interactions describing differences between respondent groups. Coefficients associated with significant interaction effects ranged from 0.08 to 0.18 (absolute values). The results of our study suggest that TTO valuations of health states differ depending on the specific respondent group from which valuations are obtained. On average, these differences were small. However, researchers and decision makers should remain aware of these differences when interpreting incremental cost-utility assessments.","[Schwalm, Anja; Feng, You-Shan; Kohlmann, Thomas] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Sect Methods Community Med, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany; [Moock, Jorn] Leuphana Univ Luneburg, Innovat Incubator, Competence Tandem PsychNetwork, Luneburg, Germany",Universitat Greifswald; Leuphana University Luneburg,"Schwalm, A (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Community Med, Sect Methods Community Med, Walther Rathenau Str 48, D-17475 Greifswald, Germany.",anja.schwalm@uni-greifswald.de,,"Feng, You-Shan/0000-0003-1509-3409",,,,,38,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The discontinuity in labor trajectories of Spanish employees from 2005 to 2010 is examined by measuring the duration of unemployment periods from employees' first Social Security affiliation to the last job at which they were employed. Through the use of the database Muestra Continua de Vidas Laborales (MCVL), the estimated gender wage gap is found to be 13.1 percent. Introducing an index of interruptions as an explanatory variable, the results show that interruptions have a negative impact on both men's and women's wages. These interruptions explain 7.4 percent of the daily gender wage gap in Spain, primarily because women experience more interruptions in employment than men.","[Cebrian, Inmaculada; Moreno, Gloria] Univ Alcala de Henares, Econ, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Cebrián, I (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala de Henares, Econ, Plaza Victoria 3, Alcala De Henares 28802, Spain.",inmaculada.cebrian@uah.es; gloria.moreno@uah.es,"Cebrián, Inmaculada/K-3607-2017; Moreno, Gloria/K-7247-2014","Cebrián, Inmaculada/0000-0001-9710-6503; Moreno, Gloria/0000-0002-5311-0890",,,,,37,22,24,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

To help overcome these challenges we look at the contributions of foresight from multiple perspectives in a systemic way and propose the concept of multilayered foresight, which analyses the contributions of foresight to knowledge, relations and capabilities on four layers: landscape, system, organisation and individual. We construct these layers building on earlier literature and illustrate them with a case example from the region of Antofagasta in Chile. We argue that foresight exercises benefit from considering multiple levels and respective different emphases in analysis. For instance, on the landscape layer the focus tends to be on contributions to knowledge while on the organisational layer it is more on capabilities. The layers help position the foresight exercise and its effects in relation to the broader context. Thus, we expect the concept of multilayered foresight to support the design, management and evaluation of foresight. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Although certain developing countries have become major emitters of greenhouse gases, they are not in a position to access the clean technologies that are prevalent in developed nations. In advocating technology transfers under the United Nations' climate change regime, developing countries argue that the intellectual property regime covering climate-related technologies must be ameliorated. In their proposals, they argue that compulsory licensing for clean technologies can be instrumental in furthering global access. This paper examines the legal issues associated with granting compulsory licenses for clean technologies. I analyze the legal challenges to authorizing such licenses, particularly in light of WTO/TRIPS and of national practices. An analysis of the previous practices surrounding the application of compulsory licensing reveals the severe hurdles facing competent national authorities and indicates the costs and burdens of such an action, which not every WTO member can afford. Jumping to the conclusion that the compulsory licensing of clean technologies is simply an illusory option may be premature; nevertheless, the legal barriers and burdens may dissuade developing nations from using such licenses injudiciously.","[Ni, Kuei-Jung] Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Sch Law, Inst Technol Law, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan",National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University,"Ni, KJ (通讯作者)，Natl Chiao Tung Univ, Sch Law, Inst Technol Law, Law, Hsinchu, Taiwan.",kueijungni@gmail.com,,,National Science Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (Taiwan) [NSC 102-2410-H-009-031-],"National Science Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (Taiwan)(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",This paper was supported by a grant from the National Science Council (NSC) of the Republic of China (Taiwan)(NSC 102-2410-H-009-031-).,,23,5,6,1,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2015,14,4.0,,,,,701,719,,10.1017/S1474745614000524,0.0,,,19,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CW4HO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364952400006,0

In this paper, I examine the implementation of a discretionary layoff policy in Charlotte Mecklenburg Schools. Administrators did not uniformly lay off the most or least senior teachers but instead selected teachers who were previously retired, late-hired, unlicensed, low-performing, or nontenured. Using quasi-experimental variation within schools across grades, I then estimate the differential effects of teacher layoffs on student achievement based on teacher seniority and effectiveness. Mathematics achievement in grades that lost an effective teacher, as measured by principal evaluations or value-added scores, decreased 0.05 to 0.11 standard deviations more than in grades that lost an ineffective teacher. In contrast, teacher seniority has limited predictive power on the effects of layoffs. Simulation analyses show that the district selected teachers who were, on average, less effective than those teachers identified under an inverse-seniority policy, and also reduced job losses.","[Kraft, Matthew A.] Brown Univ, Dept Educ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Brown University,"Kraft, MA (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Dept Educ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",mkraft@brown.edu,,,,,,,37,11,26,2,21,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

In this study, we examine the determinants of the NSS overall student satisfaction score across eleven subject areas for 121 UK universities between 2007 and 2010. Using a unique panel data set and estimating random effects and fixed effects models, we find large differences in NSS scores across subjects and across different groups of universities, which implies that the raw scores should not be used as a method of ranking. Additionally, the student-staff ratio and student employability are strong influencers of student satisfaction; both of which suggest that a policy which places emphasis on student support, personal development and employability skills will yield an advantage in the higher education marketplace.

In the tradition of studies in environmental, public and urban economics, housing sales prices are used to reveal local preferences for views of wind farm developments. Estimation is based on quasi-experimental research designs that compare price changes occurring in places where wind farms become visible, with price changes in appropriate comparison groups. These groups include places close to wind farms that became visible in the past, or where they will become operational in the future and places close to wind farms sites but where the turbines are hidden by the terrain. All these comparisons suggest that wind farm visibility reduces local house prices, and the implied visual environmental costs are substantial. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

More than 10 years after the implementation of this law, the statistics analysing its effectiveness are contradictory, which raises the question of the potential negative effects of the ONIAM on the compensation system. In order to address this question, the article analyses the impact of the ONIAM on the nature of settlement negotiations between the physician and the victim. Using a dynamic game within incomplete information, we develop a comparative analysis of two types of compensation systems in case of medical accidents: socialised financing granted by the ONIAM and private financing provided by the physician. We show that the ONIAM could encourage out-of-court settlements provided that the hypothesis of judicial error is relevant. On the contrary, in the case of a low probability of judicial errors, the ONIAM could be effective only for severe medical accidents.","[Ancelot, Lydie; Oros, Cornel] Univ Poitiers, IRIAF CRIEF, F-86022 Poitiers, France; [Ancelot, Lydie] Univ Strasbourg, UMR CNRS 7522, BETA, Strasbourg, France; [Ancelot, Lydie] Univ Lorraine, UMR CNRS 7522, BETA, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Oros, Cornel] Univ Orleans, LEO, F-45067 Orleans, France",Universite de Poitiers; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; Universite de Orleans,"Oros, C (通讯作者)，Univ Poitiers, IRIAF CRIEF, 2 Rue Jean Carbonnier Bat A1 BP 623, F-86022 Poitiers, France.",lydie.ancelot@univ-poitiers.fr; cornel.oros@univ-poitiers.fr,,,,,,,29,4,4,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Setting-up a new energy mix, initially based on renewable primary energy and electrification of the economy, seems unavoidable and it may start a last expansive cycle, but it also will deplete an important fraction of reserves of several crucial minerals. Soon after it, exponential growth of energy and GDP may be no longer possible due to minerals limitations. A general crisis of resilience of global ecosystems has been predicted by 2025-2045 if the current global growth rate is sustained. Under these new circumstances of zero growth and new global problems demanding new solutions, capitalism will face challenges out of its historical work parameters and that will require much more than partial reforms. Nucleation centres of new economic practices may be the cooperative and solidarity-economy movements in synergy with transition towns and virtual communities which, with political mobilizations oriented to maintain past standards of occupation and life quality (expectations of progress) may force a transition to some regulated steady-state capitalism.

EVIDENCE FROM THE FLORIDA RETIREMENT SYSTEM,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,BENEFITS,"Since 2002, public school teachers in Florida have been permitted to choose between a defined benefit (DB) and a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan. We exploit this unique policy environment to study new teachers' revealed preferences over pension plan structures. Roughly 30 percent of teachers hired between 2003 and 2008 selected the DC plan, despite the fact that teachers not actively deciding within six months were defaulted into the DB plan. The share choosing the DC plan was higher among teachers with advanced degrees, math and science teachers, and teachers in charter schools. It was lower among special education teachers and especially among black and Hispanic teachers. There was only a slight relationship between plan choice and teacher value added to student achievement, with teachers in the bottom value-added quartile roughly 2 percentage points less likely to choose the DC option.","[Chingos, Matthew M.] Brookings Inst, Brown Ctr Educ Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [West, Martin R.] Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brookings Institution; Harvard University,"West, MR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",mchingos@brookings.edu; martin_west@gse.harvard.edu,,,Laura and John Arnold Foundation; Thomas B.

To address the problem of endogeneity related to participation in study abroad programs, I use a combination of fixed effects and instrumental variable estimation where the instrumental variable is exposure to international student exchange schemes. My estimates show that studying abroad has a relatively large and statistically meaningful effect on the probability of being in employment three years after graduation. This effect is mainly driven by the impact that study abroad programs have on the employment prospects of graduates from disadvantaged (but not very disadvantaged) backgrounds, though positive but imprecise effects are also found for graduates from advantaged backgrounds.","Westminster Business Sch, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London NW1 5LS, England",University of Westminster,"Di Pietro, G (通讯作者)，Westminster Business Sch, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, London NW1 5LS, England.",G.D.I.Pietro@westminster.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,48,57,1,49,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The financial analysis was conducted over a range of discount rates (0-16%) and the total cost included the opportunity cost due to harvest reduction and the Carbon project cost (the Carbon project initial establishment and validation cost and the ongoing verification cost for two frequencies (1-year and 5-year)). When the opportunity cost was not included, the cost per Carbon credit was similar to previous findings (lower cost per Carbon credit for higher site index (i.e. top height in meters at age 50)). However, when the opportunity cost was included the cost per Carbon credit was higher for higher site indices which corresponded to higher average value per hectare harvested (AVHH) (i.e. timber revenue multiplied by average harvested volume per hectare per year). The reversal of trends is the result of the average timber revenue being higher for higher site indices which resulted in a higher opportunity cost and higher AVHH. The opportunity cost represented 58% to 97% of the cost per Carbon credit Compared to the 5-year verification, the 1-year verification frequency increased the total cost per Carbon credit by 1% to 22%, with the smallest increase being when the Carbon project cost represented a small percent of the total cost. The estimates for the three forest estates analyzed here represent three points from a larger spectrum, and they identify the cost per Carbon credit over a range of site indices (14.7 to 25.6 meters top height at age 50), AVHH (12.2 to 63.7 thousand $ ha(-1) year(-1)), and timber net revenues ($4 to $35 m(-3)). Further research is required to determine if the trends found in this study hold over a more densely populated spectrum. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previous literature on college internships has focused on labor market effects and the literature on academic leave has emphasized its causes. Much less has been done to analyze effects of these occurrences on collegiate outcomes. College internships are found to have a positive effect on grades, increase desires to work full-time or attend graduate school immediately following graduation, and slightly increase ambitions to have administrative responsibilities and be financially well off. Voluntary academic leave is found to have only negative effects on collegiate outcomes, including study habits and academic achievement upon return. Implied policy implications are that colleges and universities should champion internship programs but discourage college tenure interruption for other reasons.","[Routon, P.

Furthermore, infrastructure mediates the way in which everyday lives are conducted; their form and function creating a persistence of unsustainable practice and behaviour that cannot be changed even if change is desired. There is a need to find means by which this obduracy can be broken so that new, more sustainable futures can be planned. This paper develops a methodology, taking concepts from both engineering and social science. Wild cards, or physical disruptions, are used to 'destructively test' complex infrastructure systems and the multi-level perspective is used as a framework for analysing the resulting data. This methodology was used to examine a number of case studies, and with focus groups consisting of a range of different infrastructure providers and managers, to gain a better understanding of systems' sociotechnical characteristics and behaviours. A number of impactful 'intervention points' emerged that offered the opportunity to promote radical changes towards configurations of infrastructure systems that provide for 'less' physical infrastructure. This paper also examines the utility of wild cards as enablers of transition to these 'less' configurations and demonstrates how a 'wild card scenario' can be used to co-design infrastructure adaptation from with both infrastructure providers and users.

In The Netherlands, a future perspective is obvious in the vision behind the curriculum for secondary education, but this perspective becomes thinner and less open when elaborated in the syllabus, textbooks and examinations. From an intended ideal curriculum with challenging future relevant issues and a call for scenario thinking, it changes into a presentation of a fixed and often negative future in the perceived implemented Curriculum. In a focus group meeting with stakeholders of the geography educators' community, there is recognition of the importance of a futures perspective. But there is also uncertainty and unfamiliarity, when it comes to implementing a futures perspective in geography education. Moreover, the institutional constraints, with an output testing regime, prevent the geography educators from making substantial room in their implemented curriculum for futures education. To enable geography teachers to implement or improve a futures perspective in their education, more clarity about the function and form is necessary. By researching and supporting good teaching practice, the expertise needed can be built, extended and used to empower a lobby advocating a more supportive national policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The first section demonstrates how national reputation management emerged as a part of the globalization discourse and illustrates its hybrid character. The paper then gives a short overview of the two approaches, nation branding and public diplomacy. In the next section, national reputation management efforts in Denmark and Norway are compared according to three variables: how they were launched in response to globalization, the role of consultants, and the countries' different institutional settings. The article concludes with a discussion of how the elements of national reputation management interact in the initiatives of the two countries and how this relates to the general change in the relationship between nation-states on the global scene. The paper concludes that Norway and Denmark represent two different variations of a new, hybrid national reputation management.

We evaluate the impact of the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) by themselves, assess their mutual compatibility, and compare them with a scenario including all bilateral agreements as well as a benchmark global free trade scenario. In 2006, the EU decided to abandon its moratorium on negotiating new FTAs. Since then, numerous negotiations have been started. In particular; the EU joined the scramble for preferential market access by launching bilateral negotiations with both individual countries and regional sub-groupings. The discriminatory character of these agreements is controversial in economics, not simply because of the classic 'Vinerian' view that they can divert rather than create trade, but also because of the unresolved disagreements on when a regional trade agreement is likely to precede, rather than preclude, more global agreements. In this article, we use a CGE model to assess the effects of possible agreements between the EU and different partners, namely India, Mercado Comun del Sur (MERCOSUR), and the USA.

To do so, the influence of changing sample size on High Leverage Collinearity-Influential Measure (HLCIM) and Condition Number (CN) was studied. According to the simulation results, by increasing the percentage of high leverage points for each magnitude of contamination and fixed sample size and also by increasing magnitude of contamination for each percentage of high leverage point and fixed sample size, the CN and the absolute HLCIM values increase.

The aim of the research is to analyse the theoretical aspects of the gender balance and diversity management in companies, to explore the situation of the gender proportion within the large companies of Latvia and to identify the factors that contribute to the growth of the women representation within the TOP management. The European Commission (EC) has set the target to reach the women representation up to 40% within the management of companies by 2020 and encourages the EU Member States on the application of the legislative quotas. Latvia is among those EU countries that has expressed official position against the introduction of quotas within the legislation, and thus, is seeking for other opportunities to stimulate gender balance within the companies. Latvia is a newcomer and lacks research in this field that emphasises the novelty of this paper. The paper investigates the gender situation in order to determine to what extent the 'glass ceiling' affects women's career growth in large companies of Latvia. Moreover, the paper analyses the benefits of the gender diversity to be used as incentive for the large companies of Latvia. The article has been prepared based on the analysis of primary and secondary sources, outcome synthesis and the evaluation of results of a survey of employees of large companies of Latvia (n =211) and survey of HR managers of large companies (n = 50). Results present characteristic features of good female and male managers as perceived by the respondents.

HMOs vertically integrate health care providers and pay them at a competitive price, while nonintegrated health insurers work as indemnity plans and pay the health care providers freely chosen by policyholders at a wholesale price. Such difference is referred to as an input price effect which, at first glance, favors HMOs. Moreover, we assume that policyholders place a positive value on the provider diversity supplied by their health insurance plan and that this value increases with the probability of disease. Due to the restricted choice of health care providers in HMOs a risk segmentation occurs: policyholders who choose nonintegrated health insurers are characterized by higher risk, which also tends to favor HMOs. Our equilibrium analysis reveals that the equilibrium allocation only depends on the number of HMOs in the case of exclusivity contracts between HMOs and providers. Surprisingly, our model shows that the interplay between risk segmentation and input price effects may generate ambiguous results. More precisely, we reveal that vertical integration in health insurance markets may decrease health insurers' premiums.","[Baranes, Edmond] Univ Montpellier Lameta & Labex Entreprendre, F-34090 Montpellier, France; [Bardey, David] Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia; [Bardey, David] Toulouse Sch Econ Gremaq, Toulouse, France",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bardey, D (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia.",d.bardey@uniandes.edu.co,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

And is such elicitation of unpredictability as unintended as it might appear - the accidental consequence of the extension of a modernist attitude to control and domesticate nature? To grasp what is at stake in such questions, this paper traces out the marginal history of ocean geoengineering, its correlative 'green' economy, and through the deployment of algae as an inventive world-remaking device, their co-formation of the earth as a site of unbounded experimentation - of what I call experiment earth. My argument here is that such methods of geoengineering inject disturbances into the algae-ocean-earth system that do not seek control, but to elicit surprise and explicate the mechanisms of the complex permutations of their unpredictability, where new forms of knowledge and value are created not through the application of preconceived ideas or a process of commensuration, but through the harnessing of anticipation and the generation of surprise. How, I ask, are we to understand the lineaments of a pre-emptive 'green' economy that is premised on not just managing, but speculatively materially recomposing the non-linear chemical and ecological constitution of the earth's metabolism? And what, from this vantage point, is the earth becoming?","[Factor, Simon] Univ Sydney, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, 2-11a Livingstone Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Factor, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Sociol & Social Policy, 2-11a Livingstone Rd, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",sfac5147@uni.sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,48,6,7,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

This latter treatment, which we refer to as the 'tools of coordination' approach, sees technologies as mediators of market behavior that promote standardization and coordination. While this may be one important function of some technologies, taking a cultural approach to studying financial technologies highlights other important aspects of financial activity - in particular profit making. Instead of focusing primarily on how technologies coordinate market behavior, we focus on how technologies enable profit-making practices, in particular arbitrage. In two different case studies, one examining arbitrage between stock exchanges during the late nineteenth century and the other focusing on contemporary high-frequency trading, we employ the cultural approach to technology. We find that while new technologies do eventually promote greater coordination in financial markets, they are initially deployed for the opposite purpose, to produce what we call network differentials that allow some to profit at the expense of others.","[Hardin, Carolyn] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Commun Studies, Durham, NC 27713 USA; [Rottinghaus, Adam Richard] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Commun Studies, Unit B, 510 Oak Ave, Carrboro, NC 27510 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Rottinghaus, AR (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Dept Commun Studies, Unit B, 510 Oak Ave, Carrboro, NC 27510 USA.",adamrott@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,60,14,14,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Store environment, store atmosphere and shopping comfort are elements evocating positive or negative emotions during the process of purchase. Due to increasing competition at the retail sector in generally, higher demands of customers for the sales culture and convenience the marketers and business practitioners are forced to implement any possible progressive features able to increase the attractiveness and efficiency of the retail store. Main aim of the paper is to explain the impact of different visual merchandising elements and store atmosphere on consumer behavior and shopping comfort. As the numbers of similar studies have been done in this area worldwide, added value of our study lies in the combination of classical merchandising approaches with nowadays rapidly developing neuro-science approach, supported with economic or environmental aspects, if appropriate. Object of the study is food merchandising. To explain the importance of individual visual merchandising elements we use traditional classification of 5 senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Besides 5 senses there are also some demographic and psychographic segmentation criteria to be considered, especially in two extreme situations: economic buyer versus hedonistic buyer. In the paper we devote attention to visual merchandising factors as light, music, smell, visual, touch and taste experience, space comfort and weight-price-labelling systems are. While the factors as light, music, etc. are highly connected with consumer psychology, weight-price-labelling systems provide relevant and exact information to customers, e.g. weight of the product, price, date of packaging and expiration, ingredients, bar code for better product identification, country of origin, producer or trader identification or article number as well.

The problem of establishing a tax system that will encourage economic growth is especially evident in the recent years due to the consequences of global economic crisis and especially in those countries with very low or negative economic growth rates.

There are very few studies available on agricultural cooperatives in the Central and Eastern European Countries. In the paper we analyse economic performance of the Slovak agricultural production cooperatives, members and non-members of the AMC over 2009-2012 in selected regions. We assume that the APC associated in the AMC benefited from the membership and had better economic performance than the non-associated ones. We used fully balanced panel of annual data of selected economic indicators (MoAaRD SR, 2012) of 109 agricultural primary production cooperatives. We constructed econometric models and estimated parameters of AMC membership impact on the APC performance expressed by selected economic indicators. We found statistically significant differences in average revenue of the AMC members and those AMC non-members, regardless of the region and AMC specialisation. The revenue per hectare increased with the size (UAA) of the APC and their partial productivity of land (value added per hectare). There were regional differences. The agricultural marketing cooperatives significantly contributed to average profit per hectare of their members only in Nitra region. The membership in the AMC however significantly increased the agricultural production cooperative average costs per hectare. In the future, besides of improving the AMC services, their members could benefit from the economy of scale by further extension of their size (UAA).","[Lazikova, Jarmila; Bandlerova, Anna] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Dept Law, Nitra, Slovakia; [Bartova, Lubica] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lazíková, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac European Studies & Reg Dev, Dept Law, Nitra, Slovakia.",Jarmila.Lazikova@uniag.sk; lubica.bartova@uniag.sk; anna.bandlerova@uniag.sk,"Bartova, Lubica/A-9056-2016; Bandlerová, Anna/O-4973-2014; Lazikova, Jarmila/F-4608-2019","Lazikova, Jarmila/0000-0001-8764-1051",,,,,38,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,588,599,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800057,0

Because currently there is a social and political pressure on efficiency and effectiveness in public administration, the assessment of efficiency within subsystems of public administration represents very actual topic. The objective of the paper is to present the assessment of state administration efficiency in the field of trade licensing in Slovakia within the years 2009 - 2012. The state administration in this field in Slovakia is provided by Trade Licensing Offices-departments of District Offices within 49 territorial districts. The study employs a non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis to measure relative efficiency of the offices and distance function approach to measure Malmquist productivity index which is decomposed into technical efficiency change, scale efficiency change, and technical change. The results show that total productivity was growing yearly in average by 2.3%. Within the examined period it increased by 7.14%. The growth was driven mainly by positive technical change (8.26% growth), what indicates improvement of the best practice offices performance (technological change). Decreasing technical efficiency corresponds to declining share of efficient Trade Licensing Offices within the examined time period. Total decrease in technical efficiency is 1.06% and fall in efficient offices share is 21.6%, what indicates that the lag of inefficient offices behind efficient ones is increasing. The average measure of scale efficiency increased within the time period 2009-2012 by 1.68%, what may be a result of a better set up of the size of the offices. Regression analysis indicates that there is statistically significant relationship between the office size measured by number of employees and the scale efficiency. This factor explains 25% of scale efficiency variability. The statistically significant difference in scale efficiency was found between Trade Licensing Offices in the seat of regions (8) and the other Trade Licensing Offices (41). In the paper we present also results of super-efficiency estimation, what enables to rank all Trade Licensing Offices into an unambiguous performance order and project target inputs/outputs values for inefficient offices to catch-up best practice offices.","[Malatinec, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia; [Marisova, Eleonora; Fandel, Peter] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Malatinec, T (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Kosice, Slovakia.",malatinec.tomas@gmail.com; eleonora.marisova@uniag.sk; peter.fandel@uniag.sk,"Malatinec, Tomáš/AAH-4075-2019; Marisova, Eleonora/F-5555-2019","Malatinec, Tomáš/0000-0002-2308-7634; Marisova, Eleonora/0000-0001-9057-6553; FANDEL, Peter/0000-0003-4285-6811",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,641,653,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800062,0

The second sample consists of the assets comprising the IBrX-100 index, the portfolio valid from January to April 2015 which similarly was compared with the portfolio generated by SVM and the BRAX11 index fund. In order to evaluate the proposed strategy results were also compared to the free return indicator CDI risk. The portfolio cumulative return of the sample selected by SVM was 94.15%, compared to -14.42% of BOVA11 that replicates the Ibovespa. While the portfolio selected on the portfolio of IBrX100 was 38.25% against 13.86% of BRAX11 index fund. For the period rated the CDI presented a return of 53.75%. The average cumulative return of assets in the study period was in the case of portfolio of the Ibovespa 57.1% and 34.4% for IBrX100 portfolio.","[Marcelino, Sarah; Henrique, Pedro Alexandre; Albuquerque, Pedro Henrique Melo] Univ Brasilia, Fac Econ Business & Accounting FACE, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Marcelino, S (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, Fac Econ Business & Accounting FACE, BR-70910900 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",sarahsabino17@gmail.com; pedroalexandre.df@gmail.com; pedroa@unb.br,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,4,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

A special group are the solutions based on the median. The unquestionable advantage of the median methods is their resistance to the presence of the outliers, which can negatively affect the final form of the estimated model. In this paper a simulation method based on median was proposed to estimate the unknown parameter. Also different methods which can be used to estimate the parameters of the regression function were presented. In particular a modification of the Theil's method where the bootstrap and the jackknife simulations were used to estimate the appropriate median.

Population cancer screening rates are suboptimal and many cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, which results in increased morbidity and mortality. Younger populations are more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage, and this age disparity is not well understood. We examine the associations between late-stage breast cancer (BC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnoses and multilevel factors, focusing on individual state regulations of insurance and health practitioners, and interactions between such policies and age. We expect state-level regulations are significant predictors of the rates of late-stage diagnosis among younger adults. Methods: We included adults of all ages, with BC or CRC diagnosed between 2004 2009, obtained from a newly available cancer population database covering 98 % of all known new cancer cases. We included personal characteristics, linked with a set of county and state-level predictors based on residence. We applied multilevel models to robustly examine differences in risk of late-stage cancer diagnosis across age groups (defined as age 65+ or < 65), focusing specifically on the effects of state regulatory factors and their interactions with age. Results: Late stage BC diagnoses range from 24 %-36 %, while CRC diagnoses range from 54 %-60 % of newly diagnosed BC or CRC cases across states. After controlling statistically for many confounding factors at three levels, age < 65 is the largest person-level predictor for CRC, while black race is the largest predictor for BC. State regulations of health markets exhibit significant interactions with age groups. Conclusions: The state regulatory climate is an important predictor of late-stage BC and CRC diagnoses, especially among people younger than Medicare eligible age (65). State regulations can enhance the climate of access for younger, less well-insured or uninsured persons who fall outside normative screening guidelines.","[Mobley, Lee R.] Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Mobley, Lee R.] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studie, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Kuo, Tzy-Mey] Univ N Carolina, Lineberger Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Mobley, LR (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",lmobley@gsu.edu,,,National Cancer Institute [2R01CA126858],National Cancer Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),"CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries contributed funds to cover the standard RDC fees for researchers conducting analyses under approved research projects.

At the same time, measures designed to counter the effects of the crisis should be promoted by both the central government, which traditionally performs the task of macro stabilization, and the local governments which, considering the responsibilities assigned to them and the local dimensions of the crisis, should supplement central government's efforts and support for the occurrence of the expected positive effects. In order to outline some possible courses of action, it is, however, necessary to perform a careful analysis of the effects of the crisis on local governments' revenues and expenditures. This is only rarely assumed in the literature (especially for the case of Romania), often concerned with the issue of the central budget. On these grounds, this paper aims to provide, based on the analysis of data coming from Eurostat, the Romanian Ministry of Public Finance, the Romanian National Institute of Statistics and the Fiscal Council, a detailed assessment of the effects of the crisis on the revenues, expenditures, budget balance and debt of Romanian local governments, highlighting their peculiarities in relation to the effects recorded by the theory or by other Central and Eastern European countries. The paper also aims, by analyzing the changes recorded in the structure of Romanian local budget revenues and expenditures, to assess the rationality of the measures adopted at local level during the crisis, as well as their compatibility with the objectives of economic stabilization and long-term economic growth, suggesting, when appropriate, some alternative viable solutions.

The level of demand forecasting in retail grocery stores in the Czech Republic was the subject of the quantitative research. The main objective of the research was to find out what methods are used in demand forecasting, what factors affecting demand for food are considered and what sources of information retail stores use to base the forecasting on. When analyzing the data obtained through personal inquiries in 75 retail outlets, methods of descriptive and inferential statistics were used. The research showed that retailers rely in demand forecasting mainly on their own intuition and experience in retailing, and therefore qualitative methods of forecasting are applied most frequently. Although retailers consider a variety of factors influencing the demand, the research has identified an absence of statistical methods that are able to effectively implement the influence of factors into the final predictions. The article also discusses the differences among stores with sales area of different sizes and depending on the affiliation of the store with a retail chain.

Within the accompanying literature we are informed that quality is not produced, but is monitored. If we assume that the records of defects can be considered a strategic tool then analysis of this data can be used to develop continuous improvement strategies. One of the methods of analysis of the reliability of whole sets, using statistics and probability theory is Benford's law. In the available literature we can find many examples of the application of Benford's law to assess the reliability of different sets of data, mainly in searching for fraud and signs of manipulation. The analysis of compliance data using Benford's distribution could also be applied in the study of the reliability of the defects detected during quality control. The aim of this paper is the verification of the effectiveness of Benford's law in different sets of data. The hypothesis is that the collected data conforms to Benford's law.

First, we assess the sensitivity to the selection of the subset of model parameters that are assumed to be time-varying. For that purpose, the model is estimated in three different configurations of the time-varying and constant parameters. Second, we examine the sensitivity of the time-varying estimates with respect to the calibration of the initial value of the adhesion parameter. The value of a time-varying parameter is given by the model law of motion as a weighted average of the last known value of the parameter and its initial value plus stochastic innovation. The weights are determined by the adhesion parameter that is common for all the time-varying parameters. Thus, the adhesion parameter determines the general tendency of the time-varying parameters to return to their respective initial values. Three different calibrations of the adhesion parameter are compared in the paper. The model is estimated using the data of the Czech economy.","[Tvrz, Stanislav] Natl Bank Slovakia, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia; [Tvrz, Stanislav; Vasicek, Osvald] Fac Econ & Adm, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",National Bank of Slovakia; Masaryk University Brno,"Tvrz, S (通讯作者)，Natl Bank Slovakia, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava 81325, Slovakia.",tvrz@mail.muni.cz; osvald@econ.muni.cz,"Vašíček, Osvald/AAR-5742-2021","Vašíček, Osvald/0000-0003-3805-4939",,,,,8,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,841,846,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900144,0

With the number of the Member States and the number of individuals engaged in governmental decision-making increasing, an increasing role is played by various nongovernmental organisations that advocate the interests of farmers and the rest of society. The purpose of nongovernmental organisations is to advocate the interests of farmers at national and international institutions as well as not to allow organisations unrelated to agriculture make decisions instead of them. The EU nongovernmental organisations, of course, most actively advocate producer interests in the agricultural industry, which also includes fisheries and forestry. This is also evidenced by the large number of agricultural organisations involved in cooperation with national institutions in the EU compared with other industries. The research aim is to analyse the historical development of the CAP and the engagement of agricultural nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) in making the CAP. Methods used in the research: the monographic and descriptive methods, analysis and synthesis, the logical and constructive methods.

This paper models the distributional processes entailed by two alternative educational voucher systems, universal and target vouchers, by using an agent-based model of a highly heterogeneous school district. Using this approach allows to track which students actually switch schools and thereby evaluate peer effects. At the same it is possible to model an endogenous reaction of public schools in order to assess their reaction to increased competition. The results indicate an ambiguous effect of universal vouchers on low-income students. The introduction has a negative peer effect on students in low-performing schools due to cream skimming, i.e. highly motivated students leaving the schools. In contrast, students who switch to better schools observe a positive effect. The negative effects are partly alleviated by low-performing schools improving their educational services as a response to a decline in enrollment. When examining target vouchers which are a function of student ability, the paper shows that they allow the school district to benefit from the increased competition while avoiding the deterioration of the peer group.

Selection is addressed using institutional rules that regulate class formation: first year students are divided into groups distinguished by letters, they remain in the same group across grades at the school, and the composition of teachers assigned to groups is stable over time. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we consider consecutive cohorts of first year students enrolled in the same group. We compare participating groups to non-participating groups within the same school, as well as to groups in non-participating schools. We find that the intervention raised scores in mathematics for students from the least advantaged backgrounds. We also find that targeting the best students with extra activities in language comes at the cost of lowering performance in mathematics. We go beyond average effects, finding that the positive effect for mathematics is driven by larger effects for the best students. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

Policy divergence between Swedish forestry and the Swedish pulp and paper industry after the 1990s,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmental regulation; Policy divergence; Forestry; Pulp and paper; Sweden,TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; PATH DEPENDENCY; IMPLEMENTATION; TRANSITION; STATE,"This article reviews the divergence of environmental regulatory arrangements in the Swedish forestry sector in relation to the closely-linked Swedish pulp and paper industry. The study finds that while the Swedish forestry sector was deregulated in 1993, with decreased state intervention in forest management, the pulp and paper sector has remained controlled by strong national mandatory requirements which have been further strengthened by European Union Directives after the 1990s. We suggest that one reason for the persistent, strict mandatory regulation of the pulp and paper sector is that conflicting goals between environmental protection and production growth have been aligned through technological change, while such a strong alignment of conflicting interests has not been possible to achieve in the forestry sector. Thus, policy divergence between the forestry and the pulp and paper industries may be explained by the success of established regulatory paths in the case of the pulp and paper industry, while in forestry deregulation has instead been used to, at least formally, increase focus on protection of the environment while maintaining a high level of productivity. Further studies in other sectors and countries will be necessary to clarify the specific role of, for example, discourses of deregulation and concepts of competitive advantage conceming e.g. particular actor's roles in specific elements of regulative change.

The genesis of the conflict lies in a proposal to amend the Agreement to exclude certain policies of price support, given by developing countries to answer their food security goals, from the disciplines of the Agreement. The issue has thrown into sharp relief the overall conflict between development oriented goals and trade liberalization within the WTO legal order. This article posits that the most significant opposition to the amendment pretends to be economic in content, while masking an obviously political nature. In order to unmask this, the article investigates some theoretical foundations of subsidy regulation in WTO law, and particularly attacks the concept of distortion which is frequently used to classify subsidies. This article aims to show that as a theoretical matter, the amendment to Agreement on Agriculture is not perniciously trade-distorting as has been projected, and that developing countries can stake legitimate claim to have such amendment passed. Finally, through such argument, the article aims to place the conflict between two normative ideals, trade liberalization and food security in proper perspective.","[Das, Sannoy] Jindal Global Law Sch, Sonipat, India",O.P.

In this paper, we focus on voluntary conservation and investigate complex ways to use evidence in implementation of the Forest Biodiversity Programme METSO in Finland. Data were collected via nine focus group discussions involving a total of 59 forest conservation stakeholders. Through interpretative qualitative analysis, we found that forest owners' and forest advisers' awareness of the voluntary instrument and the smooth interplay of knowledge types are important factors in implementing voluntary conservation. Knowledge use should be locally bound for policy implementation to be effective. Social relationships enable integrating local knowledge. Forest owners, advisers, authorities and other actors interpret scientific and other knowledges (and simultaneously co-produce new knowledge) in practical action. We conclude that educating forest advisers, informing forest owners, and increasing collaboration can enhance evidence flows from research to practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While maintaining biological stability is an objective for the state, the village community aims at maximizing net present value of income from all uses of land. Biodiversity preservation is only an externality to villagers. Three analytical approaches, namely, goal programming, non-cooperative game, and bargaining game have been used to study strategic interactions between the state and the local community. Results showed that the current situation in the study area of Zagros in Iran where wood harvesting is prohibited de jure even though some illegal charcoal production by village communities still exist, is very close to the Nash equilibrium found in the bargaining game. The dominant strategy equilibrium found in the non-cooperative game, however, is far from that found under business as usual. This indicates that the structure of the game between state and local community in northern Zagros is most probably cooperative even though there is no formal agreement between the state authorities and members of the local community.

From 2019 onwards, the MSR will adjust the number of allowances auctioned as a function of the size of the surplus, i.e. in times of a large surplus it shifts the issue date of allowances into the future. In a perfectly competitive allowance market the MSR only affects price and emission paths if the baseline equilibrium becomes unfeasible. If the MSR is binding, prices increase in the short run but drop in the medium run relative to the baseline. The MSR increases price variability if uncertainty over future allowance demand is resolved while there is a surplus. The long run cap is unaffected by both the MSR and overlapping climate policies. This contrasts the EU's objectives of improving the resilience of the EU ETS and increasing synergies with overlapping climate policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Multi-criteria decision methodology offers an effective alternative to address such forest management issues, particularly if they involve multiple stakeholders - including local communities, public representatives, and environmentalists - each of which possess different knowledge, experiences, and prospects. Group methods, based on participatory planning, can be applied to integrate such different interests into an optimal, joint decision. It is for this reason that a new decision model based on a group fuzzy analytic network process was designed. In a case study of the forest area at Pohorje, Slovenia, alternative development scenarios were evaluated by means of the generated model. Six possible management scenarios defined by sustainability indicators were identified. The scenarios were compared and assessed by several stakeholders according to the results of a SWOT analysis. The results reveal that most attention should be devoted to preserved nature, cultural heritage, and local tradition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Communities across Canada have used this method to develop collective desirable futures, in many cases to provide an end goal for local sustainable development. In this paper, we conduct a meta analysis of desired futures created by communities across Canada with the aim of identifying regional commonalities according to the three pillars of sustainability, social, environmental, and economic. Although sustainability demands a balance between its social, economic and environmental components, Canadians futures apparently place the greatest importance on social aspects with 338 desires against 222 and 230 respectively for economic and environmental sustainability. Community (105); Infrastructure, development, and transportation (126); and Natural environment (157) are the categories most frequently recorded within each of the three components of sustainability. The metaanalysis also noted significant differences amongst regions. The study was conducted in the context of an initiative known as the Sustainable Canada Dialogues that mobilized 60 + scholars from across the country around a consensus on science based, viable solutions for greenhouse gas reduction. Our results suggest that climate policy that simultaneously reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing some of the key aspects of social sustainability would be attractive to many Canadians.

We observed that forest income contributed 5.8% to total household income, ranging from 3.8% in the top income quartile to 17.4% in the lowest quartile. Analyses of poverty indices and Gini decomposition showed that incorporating forest incomes in total household income reduces measured rural poverty and income inequality. Community forestry income constituted 49.7% of forest income, followed by 27.5% from government-managed forest, and 22.8% from private forests/trees. Community forestry income, however, contributed more than other sources of forest income to income inequality, indicating elite capture. We argue that a full realisation of community forestry's poverty reduction and income equalizing potential requires modifications of rules that govern forest extraction and pricing at community forest user group level.

These changes are reflected in the renewed Finnish Forest Act from 2014, which is based on an underlying assumption that increasing freedom in the management will support the objectives of the renewal such as the promotion of more active and innovative uses of forests. But a change in law does not change practice automatically or linearly. We study the role of intermediary actors facilitating the objectives by focusing on specialized forest journals. Informed by the Narrative Policy Framework and the role of media therein, we show how these actors contribute to institutional change. We suggest that their roles can be understood by analyzing five key functions: informing, activating, interest promotion, self-promotion and marketing. We argue that these functions affect how a policy change is turned into practice. In this change specialized journals are not just intermediaries transmitting messages of change. They can also act as street level bureaucrats that actively influence practice or as lobbies that anxiously aim to maintain their positions. A careful analysis of the roles helps to understand why specialized journals that should be in forefront of progress in practice often promote incremental change rather than innovative alternatives.

While qualitative methods, taking advantage of the human cognitive system, have a great potential in addressing a wide range of problems in futures studies, this potential is mostly due to the human visual logic that can handle the task of imagining future scenarios much better than mathematical logic. On the other hand, computational methods benefit from the advantages of silicon based systems namely speed, large memory, rapid networking, and communication. Hence, it would be extremely beneficial to come up with a solution that combines the positive sides of both qualitative and computational approaches. Cognitive artificial agents are computational units that make use of the human cognitive system. Their interaction with foresight and futures researchers can result in promising solutions for the problems addressed in futures studies. In addition, these agents can serve as a great source of inspiration for taking the first step towards vision based computers that can simulate humans' imaginations of the future. This paper reviews some of the previous attempts in this field and finally sheds light on the main issues where methods in futures studies can play a key role in the future of Human Computer Interaction systems.

One major question about state investments in early childhood education programs is to what extent these initiatives create new child care options rather than crowd-out existing private child care options. We investigate this issue using Florida's universal pre-kindergarten program (VPK), a national leader with respect to preschool access, as a case study. Leveraging a 9-year panel of data we find that the introduction of Florida's VPK program expanded the size of the state's licensed child care market by 13% relative to the predicted market size. Using a synthetic control difference-in-difference approach we also show that VPK led to an increase in the percentage of 4-year-olds enrolled in formal care but a drop in the percentage of 3-year-olds enrolled in these settings.

Unequal urban growth and development,CAMBRIDGE JOURNAL OF REGIONS ECONOMY AND SOCIETY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CITY,"According to Moretti (2013), deindustrialisation has been responsible for a great divergence between cities that have moved to become centres of innovation and ideas, and those that have continued to produce material goods. Other authors, however, place more emphasis on trends in specialisation and differences in productive bases as the driving forces behind urban divergence. Somewhat similarly, Storper (2013) argues that recent divergence has been fundamentally driven by some cities becoming more specialised in knowledge intensive sectors. While most of this interest in urban divergence has been based on US cities, recent European research also reports divergent processes. The aim of this article is to examine the degree of divergence across UK cities and to analyse how far this has been driven by differences among cities in industrial structure and specialisation, tradable bases and productivity.","[Clarke, Greg] UCL, City Leadership Initiat, Fitzroy Sq, London W1T 6EY, England; [Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Tyler, Peter] Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Silver St, Cambridge CBE 9EP, England",University of London; University College London; University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Clarke, G (通讯作者)，UCL, City Leadership Initiat, Fitzroy Sq, London W1T 6EY, England.",gregclark@thebusinessofcities.com; rlm1@cam.ac.uk; pt23@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023",,"ESRC [ES/N006135/1, ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N006135/1, ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,34,11,13,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

This article analyses the consequences of these dramatic transformations for public attitudes about redistribution. Contrary to the predictions of standard economic models, it finds that countries with faster rates of poverty reduction tend to report growing support for redistribution. In addition, there are signs that changing poverty levels and public redistribution preferences were accompanied by changes in public spending on basic social services.","[Wietzke, Frank-Borge] London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Wietzke, FB (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",bwietzke@gmail.com,"Wietzke, Frank-Borge/N-4014-2018","Wietzke, Frank-Borge/0000-0002-4720-708X",,,,,81,11,11,2,26,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

A retrospective population-based cohort study was conducted using Swedish national registers and electronic medical records. Patients with hyperlipidemia or prior CV events were stratified into three cohorts based on CV risk level: history of major cardiovascular disease (CVD), coronary heart disease (CHD) risk-equivalent, and low/unknown risk. Propensity score matching was applied to compare patients with new events to patients without new events for estimation of incremental costs of any event and by event type. A CV event resulted in increased costs over 3 years of follow-up, with the majority of costs occurring in the 1st year following the event. The mean incremental cost of patients with a history of major CVD (n = 6881) was a,not sign8588 during the 1st year following the event. This was similar to that of CHD risk-equivalent patients (n = 3226; a,not sign6663) and patients at low/unknown risk (n = 2497; a,not sign8346).

In the unique setting of the new Dutch health care system with regulated competition, this paper evaluates the impact of a 1-year natural experiment with patient channeling on providers' market shares. In 2009 a large regional Dutch health insurer designated preferred providers for two different procedures (cataract surgery and varicose veins treatment) and gave its enrollees a positive financial incentive for choosing them. That is, patients were exempted from paying their deductible when they went to a preferred provider. Using claims data over the period 2007-2009, we apply a difference-in-difference approach to study the impact of this channeling strategy on the allocation of patients across individual providers. Our estimation results show that, in the year of the experiment, preferred providers of varicose veins treatment on average experienced a significant increase in patient volume relative to non-preferred providers. However, for cataract surgery no significant effect is found. Possible explanations for the observed difference between both procedures may be the insurer's selection of preferred providers and the design of the channeling incentive resulting in different expected financial benefits for both patient groups.","[van der Geest, Stephanie A.; Varkevisser, Marco] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"van der Geest, SA (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vandergeest@bmg.eur.nl,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in a sample of European countries. Patients were recruited through patients' associations. Data on their resource use and absence from the labour market were retrospectively obtained from an online questionnaire. Costs were estimated by a bottom-up approach and the EuroQol-5 Domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire was used to measure patients' and caregivers' HRQOL. Five countries were included in the analysis. The mean annual cost of FXS per patient varied from a,not sign4951 in Hungary to a,not sign58,862 in Sweden. Direct non-healthcare costs represented the majority of costs in all countries but there were differences in the share incurred by formal and informal care among those costs. Costs were also shown to differ between children and adults.

One important difference is that a substantial share of costs of dental services-especially costs beyond routine dental treatment-is paid directly by the patient out-of-pocket. Settings and design: This study analyses the socio-economic determinants of out-of-pocket expenditure for dental services (OOPE) in Austria at the household level. Methods and material: Cross-sectional information on OOPE and household characteristics provided by the Austrian household budget survey 2009/10 was analysed. Statistical analysis used: A two-part model (Logit/GLM) and one-part GLM was applied. Results: The probability of OOPE is strongly affected by the life cycle (structure) of the household. It is higher for higher age classes, higher income, and partially higher levels of education. The type of public insurance has an influence on expenditure probability while the existence of private health insurance has no significant effect. In contrast to the highly statistically significant coefficients in the first stage, the covariates of the second stage remain predominantly insignificant. According to the results, the level of expenditure is driven mainly by the level of education and income. The results of the one-part GLM confirm the results of the two-part model. Conclusions: The results allow new insights into the determinants of OOPE for dental care. The household level turns out to be an adequate basis to study the determinants of OOPE, although caution should be applied before jumping to conclusions for the individual level.","[Sanwald, Alice; Theurl, Engelbert] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria",University of Innsbruck,"Theurl, E (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Econ & Stat, Univ Str 15, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",Engelbert.Theurl@uibk.ac.at,,,,,,,27,8,8,0,1,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We show that, if the general budget constraint is binding, the proposed transfer rule leads to higher fiscal discipline under fiscal decentralization (FD) than under centralized redistribution. Although the centralized decision yields better income distribution than FD, FD also improves income distribution unambiguously when equalization across regions is targeted explicitly.

A dual empirical approach is used: examination of regional unemployment rate variations before, during and after the recession using a labour supply and demand framework; examination of the determinants of regional variations via a spatial econometric model. The findings reveal that Canadian labour markets reacted on the whole as expected to the Great Recession, labour supply adjusting to falling labour demand, thus keeping (rising) unemployment rates in check, although rarely completely. Small, rural regions were often most responsive. The primary determinant of regional variations in unemployment rates was found to be variations in neighbouring regions suggesting highly localised impacts.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement Terr & Dev Reg ESAD, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Polese, Mario] INRS, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada",Laval University; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Dubé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Ecole Super Amenagement Terr & Dev Reg ESAD, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.;Polèse, M (通讯作者)，INRS, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; mario.polese@ucs.inrs.ca,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); Canada Research Chairs Program,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)CGIAR); Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),"The authors thank as the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), and the Canada Research Chairs Program for their financial support.

Furthermore, we estimate the effect of such financial inclusion on economic growth by reducing income inequality. From the results of our empirical analysis, we can draw the following three conclusions. First, income inequality has a very negative effect on GDP growth. The negative relationship between income inequality and GDP growth is strong in low-income countries. In addition, income inequality has a stronger effect on reducing economic growth in high-fragility countries. Second, progressivity is not a major factor in reducing income inequality in low-income countries or in high-fragility countries. Finally, financial inclusion improves the relationship between income inequality and economic growth. The reduction in income inequality through financial inclusion changes the negative relationship between income inequality and economic growth into a positive relationship. This trend is stronger in high-fragility countries than in low-fragility countries.","[Kim, Jong-Hee] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Econ Coll Commerce, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 561756, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Econ Coll Commerce, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 561756, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",jonghk5@jbnu.ac.kr,,,,,,,29,104,115,7,106,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The investigation carried out suggest an idea that new industrialization is, first of all, a new stage of evolutionary development of social and production consciousness, when the human is perceived as the valuable resource having the bigger importance, than natural resources or the wealth accumulated.

This thesis is commonly accepted and has been discussing in many theoretical papers. However, there seems to be a lack of empirical evidence that innovations are affecting socio-economic performance. The aim of this article is to provide arguments for this effect using econometric approach. To characterise innovation activity, we use the Summary Innovation Index of EU and consider several indicators of economic, social and energy effectiveness, using the approach of the EU working group. The connection between innovation and economic performance is strong for all European countries, and the economic crisis has made this relationship even more strong. However if we divide countries into groups according to their innovation performance, the most substantial relationship turns out to be the one between metrics of innovation activity and state wealth and not the labour productivity, at least in the case of the Innovation leaders. It is shown that innovation performance can be regarded as Granger cause for GDP per capita, the unemployment rate, energy effectiveness, but not labour productivity or income inequality. Quantile regressions have been used to consider the impact of innovation activity on socio-economic performance in different countries. It is shown that the effect of innovation performance is considerably stronger for countries less efficient concerning socio-economic performance, but not environmental performance.","[Balashova, Svetlana] RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia",Peoples Friendship University of Russia,"Balashova, S (通讯作者)，RUDN Univ, Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia.",,"Balashova, Svetlana/N-8285-2016","Balashova, Svetlana/0000-0003-1797-8825",RFBR [15-06-05146],RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)),"The reported study was partially supported by RFBR, research project No 15-06-05146.",,9,3,4,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,777,784,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200102,0

Through its geographic positioning, through characteristics of soil and climate, Romania has a huge potential in producing topquality wines and to produce a wine tourism competitive with countries with a long tradition in the field. This requires adequate infrastructure, complete tourist packages and complex to meet and motivate the most exigent tourists. Romania can be considered a tourist attraction itself, but also a means to exploit the rich historical heritage, cultural and hence the production and processing of the vine and wine.

The choice of food and the related consumer behaviour is influenced by several factors that interact with each other. The analysis of the consumption of fishery products is very topical, and is the object of analysis of many research studies. In this context, there are several analysed aspects, such as issues of health, environmental problems related to the overconsumption of some species that may affect the ecological and environmental balance, the importance of some species over others, the origin of products, etc. This paper focuses on the consumption patterns of fish products, and in particular on the consumption of oily fish among Sicilian consumers, in an attempt to identify the main variables that influence the purchasing decisions, eating habits, and consumer attitudes and patterns of behaviour. The research results have shown that the socioeconomic characteristics of consumers such as gender, age, and education, can influence the consumption of oily fish in terms of frequency and the perception of freshness of the purchased fish, and its place in the preferences of the consumer and consequent probability of purchase.","[Chinnici, Gaetano; Pecorino, Biagio; Allegra, Valeria; Pappalardo, Giacchino; D'Amico, Mario] Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Sicily, Italy",University of Catania,"Chinnici, G (通讯作者)，Univ Catania, Dept Agr Food & Environm, Sicily, Italy.",,"D'Amico, Mario/F-2992-2017; Chinnici, Gaetano/E-9681-2016; Pappalardo, Gioacchino/F-7624-2016","Chinnici, Gaetano/0000-0002-4728-646X; Pappalardo, Gioacchino/0000-0002-8312-0862",,,,,15,1,1,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,35,42,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200005,0

The `carbon market' instituted by the European Emissions Trading directive from 2003 is a canonical example, which has been described, and critiqued, as a delegation of policy objectives to market exchanges. In this paper, we examine the complex ways in which the operationalization of policy objectives and the organization of markets are intertwined, focusing on two other examples of European environmental regulation. The first one is the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive from 1996, which defined the `best available techniques' to curb emissions in air, water and soil. The second one is the Renewable Energy Directive from 2009, which introduced criteria for the definition of the sustainability of biofuels. Through the analysis of the design and implementation of these two directives, we identify a central concern for the coexistence of various objects, and various initiatives undertaken by European institutions, member states and private actors. We use the notion of coexistence to describe a European political and economic ordering that is inherently hybrid, and cannot be reduced to a mere delegation of policy objectives to the market, or a legal constraint imposed on all European actors. It grounds its political legitimacy and economic rationality on the distribution of roles and responsibilities across public and private actors, and on the ability to `keep things different' according to local variabilities.","[Doganova, Liliana; Laurent, Brice] PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CSI, CNRS UMR 7185, Paris, France",Universite PSL; MINES ParisTech; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Doganova, L (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, MINES ParisTech, CSI, CNRS UMR 7185, Paris, France.",liliana.doganova@mines-paristech.fr,,,European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant) [263529]; European Research Council (ERC) [263529] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),One of the authors acknowledges support from the project Performabusiness funded by the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant 263529).,,41,14,14,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

However, forest conservation efforts may conflict with other uses, particularly timber harvest. Incentives for forest conservation can be established through payment for ecosystem services (PES) policies. PES policies rely on forest valuation studies which traditionally have valued the whole forest, or characteristics of a forest. Methods that allow variability in estimated forest values over space can provide valuation information at a finer scale and aid in the optimization of PES policies. These spatially explicit values provide information critical to many policy decisions, particularly conservation prioritization and planning. Using moderate resolution satellite remote sensing (i.e., LandSat) and a forest use survey conducted in Kam. Cha i, Thailand, methods to estimate forest product valuation for spatially heterogeneous plots are demonstrated. These estimates are produced using geographic information system (GIS) multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA). The MCDA method combines forest use data with associated travel costs and vegetation cover estimates to provide spatially explicit estimates of forest values. This information is then used to compare local use values against potential carbon credit values estimated from the literature. The results show that a majority of the forest plots have higher PES values than for local forest products. Some do not, however, which suggests a possible cause for resistance against potential PES policies implemented in these areas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Estimation results indicate that (1) risk sharing in the Euro area is higher than those in the G-7 and the OECD, and (2) a higher degree of risk sharing is associated with a greater degree of financial integration and a lower level of financial development. These results suggest that more financially integrated countries might be better able to insure themselves against idiosyncratic income shocks and countries with more developed financial markets might tend to engage in less consumption risk sharing with other countries thanks to their own sophisticated financial markets. Holding financial integration and financial development equal, countries in the Euro area engage in significantly more risk sharing than the ones in the G7 and the OECD.","[Mimir, Yasin] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Istanbul Sch Cent Banking, Istanbul, Turkey",Ministry of National Education - Turkey,"Mimir, Y (通讯作者)，Fener Kalamis Cad Atlihan Sok 30 Kadikoy, Istanbul, Turkey.",yasin.mimir@tcmb.gov.tr,,,,,,,32,7,7,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to investigate the factors affecting female consumers' willingness for green purchase based on the model of planned behavior in Iran. The research method is applied, fundamental and developmental in terms of its objective and it is descriptive-survey in term of its method. The study population consists of women living in the West of Tehran. The results show that positive attitude toward green products affects personal self-image, social impacts and willingness to buy green products. The willingness to buy green products does not affect environmental concerns and subjective norms; therefore, consumers' willingness to buy green products increases by increasing environmental concerns. However, positive attitude toward green products does not affect environmental concerns, subjective norms and personal naturalism.

The import of horticultural produce as well as domestic production increased by 20 times. The competition on the market for horticultural produce significantly increased from the 1930s. The costs of fuel and labor rose, and imports took a larger share of the Swedish market as the century progressed, except during the wars. Competition was stiff from countries with lower production costs. After World War II, a series of measures were introduced to stabilize the world economy and kick-start trade. These included the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which intended to boost international trade by reducing customs, duties, and trade quotas. At the negotiating table, Sweden was particularly anxious about the export opportunities for major industries. This meant easing imports for some products for the sake of the balance of trade, and one category sacrificed was horticultural products. This resulted in a backlash for the market gardens, and the number of market gardens decreased in favor of large-scale, modern companies with a rationalized and specialized production, often situated in southern Sweden. However, there are examples of small-scale family businesses that survived competition from large-scale companies, increasing imports, and rising costs of fuel and labor. These businesses adapted their production to the demands of local markets. Two of these have been reviewed in case studies: Nilsson's market garden on Runmaro in the Stockholm archipelago, founded in 1929, and Nora market garden in Danderyd, founded in 1938 and still run by the Welander family. Referring to M. Porters generic strategies, Nilsson had a focused strategy, providing a custom range of products to wealthy summer visitors in the Stockholm archipelago. Welander had a differentiated approach, selling products of superior quality, with customers including a delicatessen in Stockholm.","[Olausson, I.] Linkoping Univ, Dept Studies Social Change & Culture, Tema Q, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Olausson, I (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Studies Social Change & Culture, Tema Q, SE-60174 Norrkoping, Sweden.",,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,135,140,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.18,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400018,0

The main aim of research was to analyze the impact of parental migration on performing paid work and on the involvement in household chores by university students within the age range of 18 - 25 years. The survey was carried out from July to September 2014 in State Agrarian University of Moldova and Academy of Economic Studies of Moldova university and includes students of bachelor and master degrees (n = 121). Collected data were processed in Stata 13. Using a binary probit model it was found that migration and remittances have an insignificant effect on performing of paid job and involvement in household duties. It was investigated that students living in rural areas have significantly higher probability to be involved in household duties including housework, engagement in agricultural work care about siblings and grandparents. More than 59 percent of students spent daily between 3 7 hours working in agriculture and cleaning of houses. When age of student influence the engagement in household chores, gender does not seems to play an important role. Moreover, living in the rural area significantly decreases the probability of involvement in paid work. Interestingly, almost 80 percent of surveyed students intend to migrate abroad mainly due to economic reasons such as lack of suitable and well-paid job and 36 percent of them have already worked abroad.","[Pilarova, Tereza; Kandakov, Alexander] Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ & Dev, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pilarova, T (通讯作者)，Czech Univ Life Sci Prague, Dept Econ & Dev, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,"Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague [20165011]","Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague","This research was conducted with the financial support provided by the Internal Grant Agency of the Faculty of Tropical AgriSciences, Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, projects number [20165011].",,14,0,0,0,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,785,791,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200103,0

In this paper I apply a game theoretical approach, based on a Social Network Analysis. I establish the importance of players in the designed network using cooperative game, by computing a form of the Shapley Value. The model allows for both the structure of the network as well as non-network related features to be taken into consideration. The model is applied to the July 7th London bombings and results suggest that Haroon Rashid Aswat was the mastermind behind the attack, which is consistent with the decision that was ruled out in the case. The application of the described methodology consists on the possibility to assign rankings of the terrorists inside the network they belong to, thus leading to more efficient counter-terrorist measures. Nevertheless, the difficulty lies in the fact that information prior to an attack taking place is not easy to obtain or even when available, it is probable not to read it correctly.","[Stanculescu, Diana Mihaela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stanculescu, DM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",stanculescu_diana@yahoo.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,3,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,366,372,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300058,0

The second constraint represents the usage of the foreign exchange rate as an unconventional tool for monetary easing.

In conclusion, this case was not a special case insofar as we considered it in this study. In general, it might be difficult to judge their appropriateness for some expenses in practice. Accounting frauds committed using these items would not be a problem of Toshiba only. If we try to judge whether an accounting treatment that is based on a firm's future expectations is right, we need to share at least the probability space that the firm assumes. As a result, it is necessary to look into the extent of costs and benefits obtaining by the users of information when financial statements contain data where it is not possible to determine whether this data is appropriate or not. This equilibrium solution would decide the extent of management's decision in the socially appropriate accounting standards.","[Suzuki, Daisuke] Reitaku Univ, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan; [Yamada, Junpei] Meiji Gakuin Univ, Minato, Japan",,"Suzuki, D (通讯作者)，Reitaku Univ, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,5,22,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,439,449,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700043,0

The purpose of the present paper is to evaluate the development ability of migrants by taking the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region as an example. Based on an in-depth interview survey and questionnaire survey data, collected during a wide-scale field research of 201 valid questionnaires in five typical resettled villages, using fuzzy mathematical method, it was found out that the overall development ability of ecological migration in Ningxia is 0.4887, increased by 36.93% over five years, compared to the initial assumption value 0. The results show that the relocation significantly improved the development ability of the migrants, but is not able to completely change their poor production and living conditions.

The establishment of interactive communication is possible mainly through social media platforms and therefore, businesses should produce strategies that aim to manage, enhance and protect corporate reputation, which is also affected by the use of social media.

Coupled with membership decline and internal restructuring through union amalgamations, they prompted an important reorientation by unions (back) to the workplace, and precipitated different strategic decisions and organising challenges. However, the proliferation of fragmented employment relationships rendered workplace-centred organising an insufficient response. As a result, some unions experimented with ways of supplementing existing legal frameworks by other regulatory initiatives, through campaigns that resulted in the layering of regulation. In this article, we examine attempts by three unions - covering garment workers, road transport workers and aged care workers - to address the needs of members in garment homeworking, road transport and aged care in a contested regulatory environment.","[Kaine, Sarah] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Business, Human Resource Management, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Kaine, Sarah] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Business, Ind Relat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia; [Brigden, Cathy] RMIT Univ, Sch Management, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Brigden, Cathy] RMIT Univ, Ctr Sustainable Org & Work, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",University of Technology Sydney; University of Technology Sydney; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Kaine, S (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, UTS Business Sch, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",sarah.kaine@uts.edu.au,,"Kaine, Sarah Jane/0000-0001-8485-7156",,,,,45,4,4,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

It then shows how those concepts map onto futures practice, before going into detail regarding the variety of narrative strategies available across a range of different forms and media, and the qualitative effects that they can reproduce in audiences. There follows the construction of a 2 x 2 matrix based on the critical concepts of narrative mode and narrative logic, within which narratives of futurity might be usefully catalogued and compared, and from which certain broad conclusions may be reached as regards the relation between choice of medium and rhetorical effect. The implications of this analysis are explored in detail. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find that rural families that had less access to banks actually participated in greater numbers; that the poorest and richest income deciles participated least; and that, at least in its early phase, the program's net effect was pro-poor.

They show that even when the zero lower bound is not binding, a prudent central bank must match every decrease in the natural real interest rate with an equal increase in the target rate of inflation in order to stabilize the risk of the economy falling into a deflationary spiral, which is an acute case of simultaneously falling output and inflation in which the economy's self-correcting forces are inactive.","[Buttet, Sebastien] CUNY, Guttman Community Coll, New York, NY 10018 USA; [Roy, Udayan] Long Isl Univ, Brookville, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Long Island University Post,"Buttet, S (通讯作者)，CUNY, Guttman Community Coll, New York, NY 10018 USA.",sebastien.buttet@guttman.cuny.edu; udayan.roy@liu.edu,"Roy, Udayan/AAP-9904-2021",,,,,,26,0,0,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

This includes agreements involving the 50 odd WTO Members that are currently negotiating a Trade in Services Agreement (TISA). While these agreements might have improved significantly on many commitments contained in current GATS schedules, mostly submitted two decades ago, they also introduced new restrictions for which no GATS equivalents exist. Moreover, in a number of cases the parties fiddled with the definitional framework provisions and generally binding obligations and disciplines of the GATS. Should these attempts continue, TISA could not live up to its proclaimed objective of promoting future multilateral liberalization. Nevertheless, a closer look at some RTAs previously concluded by TISA parties also suggests that, with political will, there is a possibility to avoid aberrations: a clause providing that in the event of inconsistencies with WTO/GATS provisions, the latter shall prevail. The incorporation of such a clause might be viewed as a litmus test on participants' continued commitment to multilateralism.","[Adlung, Rudolf] WTO Secretariat, Trade Serv Div, Geneva, Switzerland",,,rudolf.adlung@gmail.com,,,,,,,29,10,10,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2015,14,4.0,,,,,617,641,,10.1017/S1474745615000294,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CW4HO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364952400003,0

However, challenges to identification mean that this work has yet to coalesce around specific instructional dimensions that increase student achievement. I build on this discussion by exploiting within-school, between-grade, and cross-cohort variation in scores from two observation instruments; further, I condition on a uniquely rich set of teacher characteristics, practices, and skills. Findings indicate that inquiry-oriented instruction positively predicts student achievement. Content errors and imprecisions are negatively related, though these estimates are sensitive to the set of covariates included in the model. Two other dimensions of instruction, classroom emotional support and classroom organization, are not related to this outcome. Findings can inform recruitment and development efforts aimed at improving the quality of the teacher workforce. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We show that an important source of policy ideas are knowledge regimes-fields of policy research organizations. We show as well that the organization of knowledge regimes is heavily influenced by the organization of their surrounding political economies such that knowledge regimes have particular national characters. Furthermore, when people perceive that the utility of their knowledge regime for the rest of the political economy breaks down, they often try to restore it by transforming their knowledge regimes, albeit in ways that are still shaped by the surrounding political and economic institutions. The effectiveness of their efforts is not guaranteed. The argument is based on an analysis of the evolution of knowledge regimes since the 1970s in the USA, France and Germany.

This however, remains challenging because, while the number of scientific assessments of deforestation drivers is increasing, they often reach diverging conclusions. Deforestation drivers can have long underlying causal chains and take different shapes depending on the perspective that is chosen. As states are the official owners of forests in most African countries, analyzing the perspective of policy makers on deforestation in this context, helps revealing deforestation drivers that are harder to quantify, define and measure with usual proxies. It also potentially allows identifying politically and institutionally feasible deforestation reduction measures. In this paper content analysis is used to assess how African policy makers perceive deforestation drivers. We find that they strongly emphasize the role of institutional and policy drivers. Furthermore, we find that some of the complex issues related to forest governance in general, can be narrowed down to very specific problems. In light of these findings, we will argue that mechanisms and standards have to be found to allow institutional and policy drivers of deforestation to be addressed in the result-based payments phase of REDD+.

Disturbance, robustness and adaptation are here examined through the lens of Forest Commons, as a typical institution, developed by communities in the southeastern Alps since several centuries. The paper relies on Commons' theory and further developments and carries out a historically-embedded analysis of disturbances, robustness and adaptation in Forest Commons of Slovenia and Veneto (Italy). Data have been drawn from multiple sources, following an approach based on an area scale and later on case-studies. The analysis focuses on evidence of Forest Commons' reactions to disturbances induced by political changes and State actions. Ostrom's design principles are used to test robustness of eight selected cases and identification of their adaptation patterns. The paper concludes by confirming Forest Commons as robust and adaptive social-ecological systems and thus useful in Community Forestry conceptualisation. However, thanks to its cross-border analysis, it also points out future research needs for their better understanding. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article focuses on job-sharing, which is a unique yet underexplored form of part-time work and one which has rarely been analysed in terms of the consequences for all stakeholders. This case study of job-sharing details its positive outcomes for some employees, in assisting them to balance career and family. The study also highlights some previously unexplored and, we argue, unintended negative consequences of job-sharing. In this case, job-sharing contributed to the increased use of temporary employees who were locked out of many of the benefits of quality flexible work. Furthermore, the case study reveals competing interests between permanent and temporary employees, creating a range of challenges for human resource practitioners in managing and developing both groups.","[Williamson, Sue] UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, Canberra, BC 2610, Canada; [Cooper, Rae; Baird, Marian] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Williamson, S (通讯作者)，UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, POB 7916, Canberra, BC 2610, Canada.",s.williamson@adfa.edu.au,,"Williamson, Sue/0000-0001-9061-7466; Baird, Marian/0000-0002-7104-1788; Cooper, Rachel (Rae)/0000-0002-6964-3085","Australian Research Council, Discovery Grant [DP120100125]","Australian Research Council, Discovery Grant(Australian Research Council)","The authors acknowledge the support of an Australian Research Council, Discovery Grant (DP120100125).",,33,5,6,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Using proxy variables in a cross-sectional regression setting, they find a positive and significant effect of attendance and study time, with a substantially higher return on each additional hour of attendance. However, when panel data first-difference estimators are used to eliminate time-invariant individual-specific unobservables possibly correlated with regressors of interest, the attendance effect disappears, while study time substantially increases its economic impact. These results suggest that study time may be much more important than attendance as a causal determinant of academic performance.","[Andrietti, Vincenzo] Univ G dAnnunzio Chieti & Pescara, Econometr, Chieti, CH, Italy; [Velasco, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Econometr, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Andrietti, V (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio Chieti & Pescara, Econometr, Chieti, CH, Italy.",vandriet@unich.it; carlos.velasco@uc3m.es,"Velasco, Carlos/K-7112-2014","Velasco, Carlos/0000-0001-5913-0107; ANDRIETTI, Vincenzo/0000-0003-0152-9427",MEYC's Programa de Estudios y Analysis [2007/04188/001],MEYC's Programa de Estudios y Analysis,Financial support from the MEYC's Programa de Estudios y Analysis (grant 2007/04188/001) is gratefully acknowledged.,,24,27,32,5,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Using a newspaper article index as a proxy for information, a two-stage demand model is estimated. In the first stage, total U.S. import demand for fresh farmed salmon is estimated to determine the overall effect of the information, while the second stage determines if there were any significant changes in market shares of source countries. Results indicate that imports declined by approximately one-third of what would have been in the absence of the PCB media stories during 2004-2006, and that some changes in exporters' market shares occurred.

This paper confronts this question by exploring the extent to which different explanations of institutional change hold in the context of trade RIO third party dispute settlement. The paper considers the role of three variables in explaining dispute settlement reform: the balance of power, the level of trade interdependence between member states and the nature of the organization's founding contract. A truth table reveals that although power and trade interdependence can explain some cases of institutional reform, the nature of the organization's founding contract is the strongest predictor for change in dispute settlement. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that not all cases can be explained, and that the influence of other institutions on the same issue can also play an important role. A case study of the Latin American Free Trade Association illustrates the importance of the institutional environment in which the RIO operates for institutional reform.","Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Bezuijen, J (通讯作者)，Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.bezuijen@vu.nl,,,European Research Council [249543]; European Research Council (ERC) [249543] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The author acknowledges funding by the European Research Council Advanced Grant #249543 'Causes and Consequences of Multilevel Governance'.

Chairs of the General Council (GC), subsidiary and negotiating committees play important roles in the outcome of trade negotiations and in administrative and implementation issues in Geneva. The GC selects most committee chairs, and must consider the balance of member representation and the quality of the candidates in its choices. Regression results indicate that the selection of a chair by nationality generally reflects the country's mission size in Geneva, the country's years of experience as a WTO member, and its economic interests in trade. The experience of individuals and continuity in committee leadership also appear to play important roles. Among developing countries, emerging markets (EMs) tend to have the largest proportional representation. The GC thus appears to follow a human capital model of chair selection, geographical constraints and especially development status balance considerations. Continued investments among all WTO members, but especially EM and other developing countries, in WTO representation and leadership capacity will be required in order to promote multilateral trade liberalization in the future.","[Jones, Kent; Gai, Yunwei] Babson Coll, Econ Div, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA",Babson College,"Jones, K (通讯作者)，Babson Coll, Econ Div, Babson Pk, MA 02157 USA.",kjones@babson.edu,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2015,14,3.0,,,,,419,450,,10.1017/S1474745614000305,0.0,,,32,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CR7ZJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361570500002,0

According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, approximately 1.37 million people die each year from lung cancer. Different therapeutic approaches as well as several treatment options exist. To date decisions on which therapies to use have largely been made by clinical experts. Comparative preference studies show that underlying weighting of treatment goals by experts is not necessarily congruent with the preferences of affected patients. The aim of this empirical study was to ascertain patient preferences in relation to treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). After identification of patient-relevant treatment attributes via literature review and qualitative interviews(ten) a discrete-choice experiment including seven patient-relevant attributes was conducted using a fractional factorial NGene-design. Statistical data analysis was performed using latent class models. The qualitative part of this study identified outcome measures related to efficacy, side effects and mode of administration. A total of 211 NSCLC patients (N = 211) participated in the computer-assisted personal interview. A clear preference for an increase in progression-free survival (coef.: 1.087) and a reduction of tumor-associated symptoms(cough, shortness of breath and pain); coef.: 1.090) was demonstrated, followed by the reduction of side effects: nausea and vomiting (coef.: 0.605); rash (coef.: 0.432); diarrhea (coef.: 0.427); and, tiredness and fatigue (coef.: 0.423). The mode of administration was less important for participants (coef.: 0.141). Preference measurement showed progression-free survival and tumor-associated symptoms had a significant influence on the treatment decision. Subgroup analysis revealed that the importance of progression-free survival increases with increased therapy experience. Based on the presented results therapies can be designed, assessed and chosen on the basis of patient-oriented findings. As such, more effective and efficient care of patients can be achieved and benefits increased.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Bethge, Susanne] Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.] Gesell Empir Beratung GmbH GEB, Freiburg, Germany",,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211","Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

To account for time-invariant unobservable parental characteristics, we compare affected individuals with their own unaffected siblings. The analysis is based on unique data comprising the entire cohort of individuals born with oral clefts in Denmark tracked until adulthood in administrative register data. We find that children with oral clefts use more health services than their unaffected siblings. Additional results show that the effects are driven primarily by congenital malformation-related hospitalizations and intake of anti-infectives. Although the absolute differences in most health care utilization diminish over time, affected individuals have slightly higher utilization of some health care services in adulthood (particularly for diseases of the nervous and respiratory system).

In Swedish forestry today, however, it is experts in biodiversity who are responsible for the management policies used when planning tree retention as a biodiversity conservation strategy. This gives the forest a certain structure, but it is uncertain whether this structure is felt to represent the same biodiversity when assessed by novices rather than biodiversity experts. Using eye tracking and subjective assessment scales, the present study investigates whether biodiversity expertise has an effect on biodiversity rating and its certainty, fixation durations, and dwell times in the field layer in the foreground when assessing images of recently logged forest that has some degree of tree retention. The results show no significant difference in the assessments of the images between the two groups; however, the certainty assessments and the eye-tracking data suggest that there are differences in strategies and behaviour. The findings have implications for the interpretation of self-reported data corresponding to measured behaviour when judging the biodiversity of a forest landscape. The study suggest that there could be differences between user groups that previous studies miss out on, and that eye tracking as a method could help detect these differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In many WTO disputes, the existence or degree of trade-restrictiveness of a challenged measure is simply assumed or addressed in a few brief sentences. Yet whether a measure is more trade-restrictive than necessary, or more trade-restrictive than a proposed alternative measure, is crucial to the legality of a range of measures currently in place around the world, some under challenge in the WTO. A careful analysis of the existing case law and treaty text-focusing on Article 2.2 of the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade and the general exceptions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 and the General Agreement on Trade in Services-demonstrates that while the existence of discrimination is likely to restrict trade, discrimination is not necessary to establish trade-restrictiveness, which also necessarily arises from direct barriers to market access such as import bans. In the absence of an explicit barrier to imports, a WTO panel is likely to focus on the extent to which a challenged measure negatively affects the competitive opportunities of imported products vis-a-vis domestic products.","Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Voon, T (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Law Sch, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",tania.voon@unimelb.edu.au,,"Voon, Tania/0000-0001-7925-9389",Australian National Preventive Health Agency [203MIT2011]; Australian Research Council [LP120200028]; Australian Research Council [LP120200028] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian National Preventive Health Agency; Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"I gratefully acknowledge the generous financial support provided for this independent research by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency (Grant ID 203MIT2011) and the Australian Research Council pursuant to the Linkage Project scheme (project number LP120200028).

It has been observed throughout Europe and in Germany specifically, that often long-term timber contracts have been negotiated to cope with these challenges and problems concerning the exchange of timber. However, the use, and economic value of, long-term timber contracts have not been rationalized yet even where trade involves little or no specific investments. The economic explanation for the use of long-term timber contracts is therefore sought within the theoretical framework based on the insights of transaction cost theory. The presented case study on Germany used 68 semi-structured interviews with forest enterprises and sawmills represented by 71 individual decision makers. The interviews have been analyzed with a content analysis. The results show that motivation for the use of long-term timber contracts was not always based upon transaction cost advantage or upon significant investments, but also upon cost-economizing rationale such as that which occurs with the bundling of timber volume by allowing for efficient price adjustment. The tradeoff of flexibility and hazards of being bound in long-term timber contracts was the consequence. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We fill this gap in the literature using 10years of student-level, statewide data on fourth- and fifth-grade students in Florida and North Carolina. A variance decomposition analysis based on hierarchical linear models indicates that districts account for only a small share (1 to 2 percent) of the total variation in student achievement. Nevertheless, the differences between lower- and higher-performing districts are large enough to be of practical and policy significance, with a one standard deviation difference in district effectiveness corresponding to about 0.11 standard deviations in student achievement (about nine weeks of schooling). District performance is generally stable over time, but there are examples of districts that have shown significant increases or decreases in performance.","[Chingos, Matthew M.; Whitehurst, Grover J.; Gallaher, Michael R.] Brookings Inst, Brown Ctr Educ Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Brookings Institution,"Chingos, MM (通讯作者)，Brookings Inst, Brown Ctr Educ Policy, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",mchingos@brookings.edu; gwhitehurst@brookings.edu; mrgallaher@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,9,17,0,6,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

We do so by comparing PISA language, mathematics and science scores of second-generation immigrants of different origins living in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland. We use the valuation of different child qualities in the student's country of ancestry by mid 1980s to approximate students' cultural heritage. Our estimates suggest that culture plays a prominent role in explaining variation in 15-years-old scholastic performance. A one-standard-deviation increase in our cultural variable accounts to between 10% and 30% of the standard deviation of student performance across ancestries depending on the host country considered. We find that the intergenerational transmission of some child qualities positively related to the conscientiousness personality factor like hard work, responsibility, perseverance and thrift favors the acquisition of cognition as measured by achievement test. A similar result is obtained for the child qualities independence and imagination. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A growing research stream on organizational ambidexterity, however, challenges this traditional view and recommends the pursuit of hybrid strategies, a phenomenon that we note existing among forest sector firms. In this study, we set out to compare the financial performance of firms pursuing a singular or pure strategy and those pursuing hybrid strategies. We compare whether a differentiation, overall low cost, or hybrid strategy yields higher financial performance. We first deduce our study hypotheses and then test each using data from 441 US-based manufacturing firms drawn from multiple sub-sectors. We find no evidence that a hybrid strategy is a more effective choice towards enhanced firm performance than a singular strategy. We also find that firms pursuing a differentiation strategy are the highest performers while there is little difference in performance of firms pursuing other strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Findings reveal that although access to technology and employment in the energy sector is limited by inadequate purchasing power and low social status, there is tremendous potential to create livelihoods for women at all levels of the energy supply chain.

Having at least one of these official sanctions entitles the disabled person to a number of financial and tax advantages. However, only support benefits entail a monthly allowance and, at the same time, the individual is required to undertake a different job to that of his/her previous one. To jointly estimate (after controlling for the health characteristics of the disabling condition and for unobserved factors) the probability of receiving disability benefits and the probability of working, we make use of a newly released database of individuals with a certificate of disability. Additionally, we exploit the rich set of health measures that this database also provides. Our results show that the probability of working is 5 % lower (average treatment effect, ATE) for those disabled individuals receiving benefits. However, when we perform the estimation for individuals with differing degrees of disability, the disincentive effects of the benefits are only significant for individuals with the mildest level of disability (33-44 %) i.e. those who are on the threshold of being disabled.","[Frutos, Eva Maria Lopez] Univ Grenoble, Grenoble, France; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona, Spain; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Econ & Hlth, Barcelona, Spain",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Universitat de Girona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Castello, JV (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Dept Econ, Girona, Spain.",eva.m.lopez.89@gmail.com; Judit.vall@udg.edu,,"Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657",,,,,18,8,9,1,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

J,"Ongolo, S",,,,"Ongolo, Symphorien",,,On the banality of forest governance fragmentation: Exploring gecko politics as a bureaucratic behaviour in limited statehood,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forest governance; Politics; Regime complex; Land-use change; Cameroon,INTERNATIONAL FOREST; REGIME COMPLEXES; GLOBAL GOVERNANCE; POLICY COHERENCY; ACTORS; ISSUE; FORCE; POWER,"Governance of tropical forests at both the international and the national level is more and more fragmented because of the large constellation of actors, ideas and interests influencing forestland policies for their conservation or change. In public policy area, fragmentation is to some extent the result of competing interests and objectives that lead to a power play in policy-making between actor groups (both public and private), i.e., state bureaucracies, Intergovernmental organisations, nongovernmental organisations and private companies. In this power relationship for the control of tropical forestlands, the hegemony of state bureaucracies in forest governance processes is increasingly contested because of the growing influence of external actor groups in forest governance. Our findings show that the fragmentation of forest governance, which might be considered specific to pluralistic systems, became banal even in tropical countries with a state-centred system like Cameroon where the state claims hegemonic ownership of forestlands. This fragmentation is particularly reinforced in limited statehood where state bureaucracies are attracted to/dependent on external resources for dealing with weak institutional capacity and to face the government's lack of ability to supply public goods and services. But despite the governance fragmentation constraints, this article reveals that some governments and sectoral bureaucracies in limited statehood are capable of using cunning behaviours to secure their own interests in domestic forestland policies and avoid pressure from external actors. In the case of Cameroon for example, the strategy being used relies on a wait-and-see game, uncertainty and recourse to sudden, ambiguous decisions; this is what we call gecko politics. Broadly, this article seeks to understand how a government or state bureaucracy in limited statehood with a state-centred system can try to impose its own interests in the context of forest governance fragmentation?

While previous findings suggest that delaying school entry may improve school readiness, less is known about whether it has differential effects for advantaged and disadvantaged children. For disadvantaged children, starting school early may be a better alternative to staying at home for longer as school provides a more stable and educational environment than the family home, overcompensating for the penalties of starting school early. This may be less applicable to relatively advantaged children who generally have greater access to resources in the home and who are more likely to utilise formal pre-school services. We use the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children to investigate if there is support for this hypothesis. The endogeneity of school starting age is addressed using the regression discontinuity design. We find that an early school start generally improves children's cognitive skills, which is even more pronounced for disadvantaged children. In contrast, an early school start tends to negatively affect children's non-cognitive skills with both advantaged and disadvantaged children affected in similar ways. Thus, our findings suggest that an earlier school entry may narrow the gaps in cognitive skills, whereas the gaps in non-cognitive skills are not affected by the school starting age.

The empirical results imply that high cognitive test scores help young adults overcome the effects of having lived in a disadvantaged neighborhood during adolescence with respect to attainment of a high school diploma and enrollment in a two- or four-year college. The results are robust to using alternative proxies for investments in children, such as mother's highest grade completed and measures of non-cognitive skills.

The goal of these approaches is to improve lifelong economic decision making, but the evidence supporting their efficacy is thin. In this article, the authors discuss the trend toward elementary financial education and propose a framework for developing evidence-based programs. They emphasize the need for understanding the underlying mechanisms that facilitate the translation of student knowledge into the ability to make sound economic decisions over the life course. The framework illustrates the importance of articulating the intended mechanisms and effects of education programs. This focus on mechanisms will not only facilitate the evaluation of individual programs, but also the synthesis of evidence across interventions.","[Collins, J.
