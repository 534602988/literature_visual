These frictions induce financial accelerator mechanisms and motivate the examination of a macroprudential toolkit. Following credit shocks, countercyclical regulation is more effective than monetary policy in promoting price, financial and macroeconomic stability. For supply shocks, combining macroprudential regulation with a stronger anti-inflationary policy stance is optimal. The findings emphasizethe importance of the Basel III accords in alleviating the output-inflation trade-off faced by central banks, and cast doubt on the desirability of conventional (and unconventional) Taylor rules during periods of financial distress.

We first document health status differences in disease prevalence, disability, mortality and co-morbidity. We find higher disease prevalence in the US than in England (confirming previous findings) but much smaller differences between the two countries in disability and mortality. We attribute the smaller differences in disability to the fact that disability measures rely primarily on subjective questions on experiencing disabilities, which are reported differently in the two countries. Smaller mortality differences are most likely due to a combination of earlier disease diagnosis and more effective disease treatment in the US. Co-morbidity is a common and important dimension of disease in both countries that is often neglected in scientific papers, especially by economists.","[Banks, James; Keynes, Soumaya] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England; [Banks, James] Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Smith, James P.] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90406 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Manchester; RAND Corporation,"Banks, J (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.;Banks, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",james_b@ifs.org.uk; soumaya_k@ifs.org.uk; smith@rand.org,"smith, james/HTQ-1933-2023; Banks, James/C-2022-2008","Banks, James/0000-0002-9726-8921","National Institute on Aging [R37-AG025529, P01-AG022481]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/M010147/1]; ESRC [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010147/1] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research was funded by grants from the National Institute on Aging (R37-AG025529 and P01-AG022481).

In addition, we provide overviews of institutional details of the Danish health care system, aggregate trends in health care expenditures and the relevant register data. Nearly two-thirds of expenditures are on hospitals and one-fifth on long-term care, with the remainder roughly equally split between primary care and prescription drugs. Health expenditures are higher for men than for women from ages 61 to 78, and otherwise higher for women. Between ages 50 and 80, hospital expenditures more than triple for men while more than doubling for women, and total health expenditures quadruple for men while tripling for women. The top 1 per cent of all spenders account for nearly one-quarter of total spending in a given year, and averaging over three years only reduces this fraction to one-fifth. The top 20 per cent of spenders in a given year are more likely to remain in that category two years later than not. The poorest fifth of the population aged 25 and above are responsible for more than twice as much spending on health as the richest, and this reverse social gradient is even stronger for long-term care and is stronger among men than among women, especially in hospital expenses. Expenditures in the year (over the three years) before death are nearly 12 times (respectively nine times) higher than average, but nevertheless are only 11 per cent (respectively a quarter) of lifetime spending. Out-of-pocket expenses on prescription drugs only amount to 3 per cent of total health expenditures and are less concentrated than these.","[Christensen, Bent Jesper; Kallestrup-Lamb, Malene] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark; [Christensen, Bent Jesper; Kallestrup-Lamb, Malene] CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University; CREATES,"Christensen, BJ (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.;Christensen, BJ (通讯作者)，CREATES, Aarhus, Denmark.",bjchristensen@econ.au.dk; mette.gortz@econ.ku.dk; mkallestrup@econ.au.dk,"Christensen, Bent Jesper/L-4521-2019","Gortz, Mette/0000-0002-9346-0625; Christensen, Bent Jesper/0000-0001-8448-9752",Health Foundation (Helsefonden); Danish Social Science Research Council; Carlsberg Foundation; Centre for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES); Danish National Research Foundation,Health Foundation (Helsefonden); Danish Social Science Research Council; Carlsberg Foundation(Carlsberg Foundation); Centre for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series (CREATES); Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond),"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees and to Eric French, Yana Gallen, John Kennan, Philipp Kircher, Rasmus Lentz, Pierre Pestieau, Rob Shimer, Oskar Skans, Jon Skinner, George Stoye, Eddy van Doorslaer, KarlWalentin and participants at the workshop 'Medical Spending across the Developed World' (at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2015) for useful comments, to Henning Bunzel, Thomas Stauning and Kenneth L.

We show that, in this situation, their supremum-based test has a non-pivotal limit distribution under the unit root null, and can be quite severely over-sized, thereby giving rise to spurious indications of explosive behaviour, We investigate the performance of a wild bootstrap implementation of their test procedure for this problem, and show it is effective in controlling size, both asymptotically and in finite samples, yet does not sacrifice power relative to an (infeasible) size-adjusted version of their test, even when the shocks are homoskedastic. We also discuss an empirical application involving commodity price time series and find considerably less emphatic evidence for the presence of explosive bubbles in these data when using our proposed wild bootstrap implementation of the Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011) test.

The study found that income shocks and having a person with a disability join the household were the only consistent triggers for all types of material hardship, and that overall, sources of instability had an asymmetrical impact on material hardship; that is, sources of instability did not help households when they were removed as much as they harmed households when introduced.

In states with statutory redemption, a buyer is less likely to purchase if the redemption period lasts longer or housing price inflation fluctuates more severely because the buyer will then be hurt more by the mortgagor who owns more valuable repurchasing option.

Focusing on strong constraints on executive power as one such institution, this paper theoretically studies the cross-country differences in the costs of relaxing these constraints. The model features two political parties that stochastically alternate in office according to a political uncertainty parameter. In each period, the incumbent can make reversible investments into the future government's ability to reform executive constraints. The main results indicate that more competitive elections and higher degrees of policy polarization between the political parties lead to high and persistent levels of investment into the society's stock of democratic capital. These higher costs of institutional reform in turn result in durable strong executive constraint-regimes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The ranking by greater risk aversion meets this demand at the second order, and yields a variety of well-known predictions concerning the effect of greater risk aversion on demands for insurance and risky assets, among many other applications. There has been less success at the third order, where ranking preferences by aversion to downside risk has not produced a strict partial ordering. The problem is that account has not been taken of the fact that an increase in downside risk aversion must induce changes in risk aversion as well. We propose a definition of stronger downside risk aversion that does yield a strict partial ordering by requiring a nested increase in both second-and third-order risk aversion, so that v is more strongly downside risk averse than u if v is more risk averse and more downside risk averse than u. We demonstrate that v being more strongly downside risk averse than u is characterized by v never liking any change in the probability distribution for y that induces a third-order stochastic dominance deterioration in the distribution for u(y). We apply the definition to obtain intuitive comparative statics predictions in the precautionary saving problem, and relate the definition to alternatives proposed in the literature.","[Keenan, Donald C.] Univ Cergy Pontoise, Dept Econ & Management, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Keenan, Donald C.] THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Snow, Arthur] Univ Georgia, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Keenan, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, Dept Econ & Management, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.;Keenan, DC (通讯作者)，THEMA, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France.",dkeenan@uga.edu; snow@uga.edu,,,,,,,14,11,11,0,4,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

Since these premiums are independent of individual risk, high-risk individuals also receive implicit cross subsidies from low-risk individuals. In this paper, we explore ways to reform the tax subsidy by taking this implicit cross-subsidization into account. Using a general equilibrium model, we find that targeting the tax subsidy can result in substantial savings. Specifically, the same level of risk-sharing can be achieved at one-third of current costs if the tax subsidy is targeted only toward low-risk individuals and premiums are age-adjusted.","[Pashchenko, Svetlana] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Porapakkarm, Ponpoje] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Pashchenko, S (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Dept Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",svetlana@uga.edu; p-porapakkarm@grips.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [15K03505]; Policy Research Center at GRIPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03505] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Policy Research Center at GRIPS; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank William Gentry, Joel Slemrod, George Zodrow, two anonymous referees, and all seminar participants at the GRIPS, AS SA meeting in Philadelphia, the Midwest Macro Meeting, NASM in Minneapolis, and the SED in Seoul for their comments and suggestions.

I construct a panel of pairs of US counties that share a state border from the 1970s to 2012. Economic activity is measured by county employment, wages and business establishments. The state and local government spending and revenue shares are aggregates for the states on the respective sides of the border. I estimate distributed lag regressions of changes in economic activity on changes in state and local government budgets in two ways. The first (double difference) utilizes change in the difference between border counties. This suggests a quite modest relocation of economic activity away from states with fiscal expansion. I then look at activity on each side of the border separately and find more substantial and consistently negative effects of fiscal expansion on both sides of the border. A border county shares the negative consequences for its neighbor of growth in the size of that neighbor's state and local governments. This negative fiscal externality is roughly half the size of the direct negative effects from similar own-state spending increases, and the sum of the two is substantial economically.

The increase in housing price is also accompanied by a growing number of vacant apartments. This paper argues that income inequality is one important factor driving up both the housing price relative to income and the housing vacancy rate. Using data from China's Urban Household Survey, the paper empirically examines the effects of income inequality on the housing price-to-income ratio and housing vacancy rate within each city. We find that the income GINI coefficient is positively related to the housing price-to-income ratio as well as the housing vacancy rate. In particular, a one percentage higher GINI coefficient is associated with increases in the housing price-to-income ratio and housing vacancy rate of 0.026 points and 0.166 percentage points, respectively. During 2002 and 2009, approximately 6% of the increase in the housing price-to-income ratio and 10% of the increase in the housing vacancy rate can be attributed to the increase of the GINI coefficient. Further studies show that the development of the capital market and housing rental market are somewhat helpful in mitigating the associations between income inequality and the housing price-to-income ratio and vacancy rate.

The conclusions of the current study are particularly important in the Romanian context, as the employment rate of recent graduates is in a decreasing trend, but also for all the Danube Region ex-communist countries, which have to boost their employment rates as well, to assure their economical growth.

Further analyses reveal that the development of financial intermediation and the enforcement of insider trading law moderate the relation between culture and the cost of debt.

That event, the worst flood the city has suffered in the past 100 years, prompted plans for a new hydraulic infrastructure. Although such an investment is necessary, little is known about its benefits. This paper intends to shed some light on this issue by estimating the willingness to pay to avoid the risk of experiencing a flooding event. For this purpose, we have taken thousands of real estate prices in the La Plata Metropolitan Area and combined them with a high-resolution flood risks map to estimate spatial hedonic price models.

We apply a mixed research methodology that includes in-depth discussions with more than 50 key informants and survey interviews with 640 randomly selected respondents. We find that the number of land conflicts is rising, that land privatisation is becoming increasingly relevant, and that communal land ownership tends to lead to land under-utilisation rather than to natural resource overuse and environmental degradation.

However, studies also tend to focus only on standalone homes, although a substantial portion of the U.S. housing market, particularly within designated floodplains, consists of condominiums: single-unit residences that are bundled with an ownership share in common property. This study investigates the price impact of floodplain designation for condominiums and for standalone properties in Boulder County, Colorado, U.S., and finds a strong impact for condominiums but none for standalone properties. Results are consistent across hedonic price estimation and non-parametric matching estimation. Numerous factors may contribute to this difference, including differences in the pre-transaction provision of flood insurance cost information and whether maintaining ongoing flood insurance is compulsory. These results have implications for the NFIP and offer insights for policy interventions for internalizing risks more generally. They also caution against generalizing from the experience of the NFIP without detailed consideration of the contexts and specific conditions in which it is applied.","[Meldrum, James R.] Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, 483 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Meldrum, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Inst Behav Sci, 483 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",james.meldrum@colorado.edu,"Meldrum, James/W-4994-2019","Meldrum, James/0000-0001-5250-3759",USDA-PREISM program; US Interagency National Fire Plan,USDA-PREISM program; US Interagency National Fire Plan,"This research was greatly improved by feedback from anonymous reviewers and by conversations with Nicholas Flores, Patricia Champ, Craig Bond, Jonathon Hughes, and participants at the 2011 CU Environmental and Resource Economics workshop and the 2013 Belpasso International Summer School on Environmental and Resource Economics.

However, there is limited literature discussing their applications, largely due to the challenges in estimating their structures and their parameters. In this paper, we propose a three-stage estimation procedure to determine the hierarchical structure and the parameters of a LSHAC. This is the first paper to empirically examine the modeling performances of LSHAC models using exchange traded funds. Simulation study demonstrates the reliability and robustness of the proposed estimation method in determining the optimal structure. Empirical analysis further shows that, compared to elliptical copulas, LSHACs have better fitting abilities as well as more accurate out-of-sample Value-at-Risk estimates with less parameters. In addition, from a financial risk management point of view, the LSHACs have the advantage of being very flexible in modeling the asymmetric tail dependence, providing more conservative estimations of the probabilities of extreme downward co-movements in the financial market.

Empirical analysis, using the log-periodogram (LP) and local whittle (LW) based semi-parametric fractional differencing techniques suggest that all sectoral returns at ASE exhibit short memory. However, in the case of volatility measures, we found evidence of long memory. Following the recent literature that argues that structural breaks in a time series could also explain the presence of long memory, we tested the volatility measures for the presence of structural breaks. We found that long memory in some volatility measures could be attributed to the presence of structural breaks. Furthermore, using impulse response functions (IRF) based on ARFIMA, we found that shocks to sectoral returns at ASE exhibit short run persistence, whereas shocks to volatility measures display long run persistence.

An innovation to improve on the flawed but widespread use of loan-to-value measures, is to estimate difficult-to-observe variations in loan quality and access to refinancing, and shifts in lenders' forbearance policy, by common latent variables in a system of equations for arrears and repossessions. We introduce, for the first time in the literature, a theory-justified estimate of the proportion of mortgages in negative equity as a key driver of aggregate repossessions and arrears. This is based on an average debt-equity ratio, corrected for regional deviations, and uses a functional form for the distribution of the debt-equity ratio checked on Irish micro-data from the Bank of Ireland, and Bank of England snapshots of negative equity. We systematically address serious measurement bias in the 'months-in-arrears' measures, neglected in previous UK studies. Highly significant effects on aggregate rates of repossessions and arrears are found for the aggregate debt-service ratio, the proportion of mortgages in negative equity and the unemployment rate. Economic forecast scenarios to 2020 highlight risks faced by the UK and its mortgage lenders, illustrating the usefulness of the approach for bank stress-testing. For macroeconomics, our model traces an important part of the financial accelerator: the feedback from the housing market to bad loans and hence banks' ability to extend credit.

The aim of this study is to investigate how the agrarian communities in rural Burundi accommodate the model of a social enterprise: a market-based community organization with a social mission. We conduct an explorative study of a pilot development intervention in rural Burundi. Nine participating village solidarity groups (child protection committees) have been equipped with energy generators. By selling energy, the groups become self-sustainable economic structures. The profits of the micro-enterprises support the villages' orphans' funds, used to equip the orphan children with uniforms and school supplies. Accordingly, the intervention assumes deep participation (project ownership) on the part of the community and also holds the promise of future economic sustainability (earned income). Using a mixed-method approach, we examine the perceptions, behaviors, and actions of the participating community members. Drawing on the theory of moral economy, we argue that subsistence communities in Burundi are governed by reciprocal and hierarchical relationships that may both enable and hinder social enterprise initiatives. Our results suggest that the social enterprise model may increase the sustainability prospects of the interventions but question its capacity to achieve transformational change.

Following the article by Felsenthal and Tideman (Theory and Decision 75:59-77, 2013), the two paradoxes are denoted as P-TOP and P-BOT paradoxes. According to the P-TOP paradox it is possible that if candidate x has been elected by a given electorate then, ceteris paribus, another candidate, y, may be elected if additional voters join the electorate who rank x at the top of their preference ordering. Similarly, according to the P-BOT paradox it is possible that if candidate y has not been elected by a given electorate then, ceteris paribus, y may be elected if additional voters join the electorate who rank y at the bottom of their preference ordering. Voting procedures that are susceptible to these paradoxes are considered to be afflicted with a particularly serious defect because instead of encouraging voters to participate in an election and vote according to their true preference orderings, they may inhibit voters from participating in an election and thereby undermine the rationale for conducting elections.","[Felsenthal, Dan S.] Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel; [Nurmi, Hannu] Univ Turku, Dept Philosophy Contemporary Hist & Polit Sci, Turku 20014, Finland",University of Haifa; University of Turku,"Felsenthal, DS (通讯作者)，Univ Haifa, Sch Polit Sci, IL-3498838 Haifa, Israel.",msdanfl@mail.huji.ac.il; hnurmi@utu.fi,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JUL,2016,168.0,1-2,,,,,115,135,,10.1007/s11127-016-0352-5,0.0,,,21,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,DR5EY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379927300007,0

We propose an estimation method for the parameters of the Markov-modulated jump diffusion model based upon dependence between jump frequency and size, with our results indicating that when abnormal events occur, the Markov-modulated jump diffusion models with both state-independent jump sizes (MJMI) and state-dependent jump sizes (MJMD) outperform the pure jump diffusion (JD) model in terms of capturing the risks of jump frequency and jump size. Based upon Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Schwarz Bayesian Criterion (SBC), our results further indicate that for 23 of the component stocks, the MJMD model may be better suited, as compared to the MJMI model. Finally, our empirical observations reveal that the behavior of jump risks in the stock markets, including jump frequency and jump size, is not independent, since these phenomena are found to coincide during both financial crisis periods and stock market crashes, with the largest jump size risks, during certain periods, being accompanied by either systematic or idiosyncratic risks.

Holding other things constant, a country's exports are higher if it is perceived by the importer to be exerting a more positive global influence. This effect is statistically and economically significant; a 1% net increase in perceived positive influence raises exports by around .8 percent.

Our results suggest that failures are strongly influenced by ownership structure: high shareholdings of lower-level management and non-chief executive officer (non-CEO) higher-level management increase failure risk significantly. In contrast, shareholdings of banks' CEOs do not have a direct impact on bank failure. These findings suggest that high stakes in the bank induce non-CEO managers to take high risks due to moral hazard incentives, which may result in bank failure. We identify tail risk in noninterest income as a primary risk-taking channel of lower-level managers.","[Berger, Allen N.] Univ South Carolina, Banking & Finance, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Berger, Allen N.] Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA; [Imbierowicz, Bjorn] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Imbierowicz, Bjorn] Ctr Financial Frict FRIC, Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Rauch, Christian] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Entrepreneurial Finance, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia; Copenhagen Business School; University of Oxford,"Berger, AN (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Banking & Finance, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.;Berger, AN (通讯作者)，Univ South Carolina, Moore Sch Business, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",aberger@moore.sc.edu; bi.fi@cbs.dk; christian.rauch@sbs.ox.ac.uk,,"Imbierowicz, Bjorn/0000-0003-1713-4438; Rauch, Christian/0000-0002-3381-7733",Center for Financial Frictions (FRIC) [DNRF102],Center for Financial Frictions (FRIC),"The authors thank the editor, Bob De Young, and two anonymous referees, as well as Lamont Black, Barbara Casu, Zhongdong Chen, Rebel Cole, Meg Donovan, Isil Erel, Michael Erkens, Rudiger Fahlenbrach, Karolin Kirschenmann, Tomislav Ladika, Xiaoding Liu, Daniel Metzger, Lars Norden, Raluca Roman, Klaus Schaeck, Ken Spong, Laura Starks, Sascha Steffen, Nuria Suarez, Rick Sullivan, Larry D.

Heckman's (1979) two-step estimator is commonly used to test for sample selection using a simple t-test on the inverse Mills ratio (IMR) coefficient. Following Puri (1996), this test is often interpreted as a test for private information. We conduct a series of Monte Carlo simulations to show that researchers can reliably use the Heckman estimator to test for private information when this private information is random. However, private information often takes the form of an omitted variable with a deterministic relationship to selection and outcomes. In this case, we show that the IMR coefficient is biased and inconsistent and that t-tests lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the significance of private information as well as its impact on selection and outcomes. We illustrate our results using a unique case in prior literature in which a bank's prior information was revealed. In conclusion, the Heckman model cannot be interpreted as a test for private information (or sample selection) when private information takes the form of an omitted variable in the first stage regression.

The 3SLS model and the 2004 SITRAMP household travel survey were used to achieve this objective. The results show that the time allocation for certain discretionary activities significantly influences the time allocation for other discretionary activities. Workers, students and non-workers have different complex mechanisms pertaining to how they allocate time across different activities and journeys. This unique trade-off mechanism gives an individual a unique distribution of activity locations and spatial movement patterns. This is observed via his/her activity space indices throughout time and space. For example, the estimation result shows that workers' and students' time-use allocation, activities participation and activity space indices are highly influenced by their engagement in mandatory activities. However, this is not the case for non-workers. Furthermore, the mandatory travel time variable has a stronger impact on an individual's discretionary activities time-use pattern than the duration of mandatory activities. This may lead to the argument that, in order to provide more opportunities and flexibilities among the JMA's workers and students for undertaking discretionary activities, travel time reduction policies can play more significant role in shaping the discretionary activity-travel patterns than reduction in working/school hour policies. Additionally, in-line with previous findings in developed countries, locating grocery shops closer to residential areas in the CBD and in suburban areas creates more opportunities for workers and students to spend more time on out-of-home maintenance activities; with a shorter travel time, especially on.

Against this background, this paper frames urban transportation as an issue of justice: contemporary transport systems are characterized by injustice, as they tend to favour and prioritize motorized transport, accepting that considerable environmental and social burdens are put on more sustainable forms of transportation, other traffic participants and society as a whole. To conceptualize 'urban transport justice', the paper discusses three dimensions where injustices are apparent: Exposure to traffic risks and pollutants; distribution of space; and valuation of transport time. It is argued that public and political recognition of urban transport injustices provides significant argument for changes in urban planning, transport infrastructure development and traffic management (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The size and shape of this catchment can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as the transport network, the location of stations and the service quality they offer, as well as the land use density and diversity in the transport corridor. Although numerous studies have been conducted to understand the size of catchment areas, limited research has focused on determining the spatial boundary (shape) of train station catchments. This paper develops a framework for deriving a spatial boundary of a Park and Ride (PnR) catchment area by incorporating the Huff model and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technologies. The approach is staged, firstly determining the PnR station choice as a function of the attractiveness of a train station and the cost of access between the origin (such as a suburb) and the destination of a trip (such as the Perth CBD). Linear referencing method is then applied to re-define the origins to train stations based on the derived station choice probability. Finally, the spatial boundary of a catchment area is determined according to the adjusted origins, using GIS technologies. The model outputs were evaluated against licence plate survey of station users, where the Kappa coefficient (0.74) and overall accuracy (0.88) statistic suggested that the model's results are robust. The paper then shows how catchment area data can be used to better manage travel demand and plan design solutions aimed at increased accessibility to train stations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Its aim is to examine whether these systems meet the requirements of light rail and whether it is possible to continue their development as a functional light rail city transport system. A further aim is a detailed analysis of the conditions and contexts affecting the gradual development of 'rychla tramvaj' schemes in three selected metropolises in the former Czechoslovakia. Urban development in Czechoslovakia was affected by the socialist planning system that constructed large housing estates on the edges of metropolises during the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, many commuters had to be moved between them and city centres daily; therefore, the necessity for high-capacity 'rychla tramvaj' connections became apparent. After socio-political changes in 1989, a market economy was introduced and the trends of commercial and residential suburbanization have modified the spatial structure of the cities, and mobility has begun to be increasingly dependent on cars. In response to this, city councils departed from further development of 'rychla tramvaj' schemes. Currently, the emphasis on sustainable mobility is apparent principally because of smart city solutions, an environmental focus and a common European transport policy; thus, municipalities are rediscovering the virtues of light rail lines again. Because the 'rychla tramvaj' systems from the 1970s and 1980s are still in operation, transforming them into modem light rail systems appears to be a convenient and cheap solution.

A smart card data set and detailed measurements of weather, allied with a suite of statistical and visual analytic techniques, are employed to capture the effect of weather on the local variations of bus ridership. While changes in weather conditions do not significantly affect bus ridership at the system level, some marked influence was found for rainfall, wind speed and relative humidity at a sub-system level. In addition, discernible variations of both the magnitude and direction of weather's effect were found at the sub-system level. Developing a more geographically detailed understanding of the effect of weather on public transport services serves as a critical first step towards establishing a more weather-resilient public transport system. This new understanding has the potential to contribute to an evidence base that can be used to proactively adjust public transport services in response to changes in weather conditions across different parts of the network.

Last-mile problems arise due to lack of adequate connectivity between transit stops and trip origin or termination points. The paper is motivated by previous literature which has pointed out that high-quality public transit needs to consider end-to end connectivity from trip origins to destinations. In contrast to previous work on transit last mile problems, which has focused on physical distance and sidewalks to transit stops, we consider a wider range of area factors including transit availability, job accessibility, parking costs, the quality of the pedestrian environment and risks to pedestrians from vehicular traffic, and social characteristics such as street-level crime. Using a discrete choice model, our goal is to unpack ways in which such factors contribute to the last-mile problem in home-based work trips, while controlling for these wider range of factors as well as the usual variables such as cost and trip time that inform mode choice. We find that the prevalence of non-domestic violent crimes reduces the odds of using all types of non-motorized alternatives as well as transit that is accessed either by walking or driving. Using compensating variation to measure welfare changes, we show that there are significant benefits that could be brought to transit service users through increasing safety in the transit access trip. By separately controlling for origin and destination transit accessibility, we show that improved destination accessibility significantly boosts transit use to a greater degree than increases in origin level accessibility. These findings argue for improving accessibility and related job densities at employment centers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We hypothesise that, when exposed to such shocks and a consecutive crop yield reduction, rural households use migration as a risk management strategy. Our findings confirm that for an average household, a 1 per cent reduction in agricultural income induced by weather shock increases the probability of migration by 13 percentage points on average within the following year. However, this effect is significant only for households in the middle of wealth distribution, suggesting that the choice of migration as an adaptation strategy depends on initial endowment. What is more, the proposed mechanism applies to households whose income is highly dependent on agriculture, but is not important for diversified livelihoods.","[Kubik, Zaneta; Maurel, Mathilde] Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, UMR CNRS 8174, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France; [Maurel, Mathilde] FERDI, Clermont Ferrand, France",,"Maurel, M (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, UMR CNRS 8174, 106-112 Blvd Hop, F-75647 Paris 13, France.",mathilde.maurel@univ-paris1.fr,"Maurel, Mathilde/AAN-2096-2021","Maurel, Mathilde/0000-0003-4543-4286; Kubik, Zaneta/0000-0003-4745-0204",FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program 'Investissement d'Avenir' of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program 'Investissement d'Avenir' of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This paper benefited from the financial support of the FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International) and of the program 'Investissement d'Avenir' (reference ANR-10-LABX-14-01) of the French government.,,58,58,71,1,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Predictions are tested with reference to the expenditures of 36 states in the United States from 1980 to 2000.

Paradoxically, in their eagerness to support development efforts of local firms, states often nullify these advantages and limit the opportunities and capabilities that local firms can leverage in the upgrading process. Using the case studies of three large industrial sectors in China that faced similar prospects but had widely different outcomes, this paper develops a framework for understanding how policy shapes the growth and segmentation of markets, and thus the opportunity for industrial upgrading of indigenous firms. The cases show how restrictive demand-and supply-side policies often inadvertently limited the opportunities for upgrading through their effect on the availability of know-how, inputs, and resources required for industrial upgrading (the supply side), and through their effect on the incentives for upgrading (the demand side). Given that each segment is a crucial rung on the development ladder, industrial upgrading efforts stall when state policy inadvertently knocks out rungs on the development ladder.

These results do not appear to be driven by the economic complexity of derivatives, but rather the financial reporting of such economic complexity. Overall, despite their financial expertise, analysts routinely misjudge the earnings implications of firms' derivatives activity.

Second, the goodness-of-fit results are compared at different time scales of log-returns. Third, the goodness-of-fit results are validated through bootstrapping experiments. Our results show that as the time scale of log-returns decrease NIG model outperforms the VG model consistently and the difference between the goodness-of-fit statistics increase.

Supranational regulators are more inclined to bail-out banks indebted towards international creditors because they take into account cross-border contagion. When banks' creditors are more likely to be bailed out, market discipline decreases and risk-taking by indebted banks increases. Depending on the trade-off between giving the right incentives ex ante and limiting contagion ex post, both a national and a supranational resolution framework can be optimal. In particular, if market discipline is low under both national and supranational resolution mechanisms, supranational resolution improves welfare as it stimulates interbank trade.

We use national-level data along with a regression discontinuity design (RDD) to estimate the impact of the program. We provide intent to treat and the local average treatment effect estimates of the program on enrollment and dropout rates, and on academic performance. Our RDD design takes advantage of the fact that the beneficiaries of the program are selected based on a government mandated procedure to rank individuals at the department (similar to geographic regions in the U.S.) level based on a cutoff score in their high school exit exams. The results confirm that the program has been effective in terms of increasing the potential number of low-income students at the margin who would have enrolled in college, decreasing the number of students who dropped out, and increasing their academic outcomes. Nonetheless, the effects of the credit program on enrollment exhibit the largest magnitude and with clearly positive heterogeneous impact on the poorest applicants.

This effect remains after controlling for various confounds and is robust to the use of mutual fund redemptions as a shock to price changes that is exogenous to fundamental news. Furthermore, investors' private information helps managers improve their forecast accuracy. Together, these findings suggest that stock prices contain information that managers do not otherwise have regarding firms' fundamentals, and that managers incorporate this information in their earnings forecasts.

Unlike the United States, Australia has no quiet-period regulation limiting the dissemination of information from media before IPO listing dates. We find that optimistic news stories are negatively associated with IPO underpricing. Results from a relative valuation model show that IPOs which received positive news stories ahead of the first trading day are not overpriced relative to their industry benchmarks. These results suggest that optimistic news stories mitigate information asymmetry and adverse selection problems. However, optimistic news stories do not appear to inflate the share price on the first day of trading. Our findings suggest that regulation mandating a 'quiet period' before the commencement of trading in IPOs is neither necessary nor desirable in the Australian environment.

In the short run, privatization can narrow wage inequality but reduce output of public firms. However, the favorable effect of privatization on lowering wage inequality vanishes in the long run due to the excessive entry of public firms. Thus, a policy recommendation for privatization would be: to avoid rising wage inequality, entry regulation of public firms should be imposed in the short run, and to mitigate the output contraction, complementary structural changes or policy reforms are needed in the transitional period of privatization.

Without pension wealth, including wealth transfers reduces the Gini coefficient for wealth from 0.57 to 0.52. With pension wealth, the impact is negligible.

The main theoretical contribution of the article is to find the conditions under which a mixed approach (MA) provides a smaller mean squared forecast error than a standard one. The conditions are general and do not rely on distributional assumptions of the forecasting errors or on any particular model specification. The empirical contribution of the article regards a comprehensive comparative exercise of the new approach against standard ones when forecasting the covariance matrix of a portfolio of thirty stocks. The implemented MA uses volatility forecasts computed from high-frequency-based models and correlation forecasts using realized-volatility-adjusted dynamic conditional correlation models. The MA always outperforms the standard methods computed from daily returns and performs equally well to the ones using high-frequency-based specifications, however at a lower computational cost.","[Halbleib, Roxana] Univ Konstanz, Grad Sch Decis Sci, WIN Koleg Zukunftskolleg, Constance, Germany; [Voev, Valeri] Aarhus Univ, CREATES, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark; [Voev, Valeri] Siemens Wind Power AS, Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz; Aarhus University; CREATES; Siemens AG,"Halbleib, R (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Univ Str 10,POB 124, D-78464 Constance, Germany.",roxana.halbleib@uni-konstanz.de,,,"European Social Fund; Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series, CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation","European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Ministry of Science, Research and Arts of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series, CREATES; Danish National Research Foundation(Danmarks Grundforskningsfond)","The authors would like to thank Luc Bauwens, Robert F.

There was no clear evidence that higher women's decision-making power would lead to better nutrition availability in Pakistan, but overall households were more likely to consume less grain and more vegetables.

Using a panel of 18 Western European countries, the study investigates how lending growth was affected by the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis. Banks are classified into four groups based on ownership type: commercial banks, cooperative banks, private savings banks and publicly owned savings banks. The results suggest that both the financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis caused a negative shock in Western European lending growth. The shock was weakened by stakeholder banks whose lending growth either did not decrease during the two crises or decreased substantially less than that of commercial banks. Additionally, the results are particularly strong for cooperative banks. Furthermore, stakeholder banks did not contribute to excess credit growth in the lead-up to the two crises. Given their large market shares, stakeholder banks diminish the procyclicality of the banking sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The Government of Japan released its latest Strategic Energy Plan in April 2014, and announced its CO2 emissions target (24% reduction by 2030 compared to 2005 levels) and energy mix (the desirable composition of power sources) in June 2015. The objective of this paper is to assess Japan's energy mix and potential for CO2 reduction in the years to 2050, independently from such government polides, by analyzing changes in the energy demand and supply structure since the Fukushima accident. We find that Japan's energy structure could change dramatically in the next thirty to fifty years. On the demand side, with the combination of population decline and economic structural change, and assuming a constant fossil energy price increase through steady global demand, we estimate a 40% reduction in energy demand by 2050 relative to 2005. On the supply side, we believe zero emission electricity is achievable from 2040 onward, assuming a significant increase in renewable energy share, the continued use of nuclear power and the introduction of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) from 2025. However, the total costs of carbon reduction do not differ substantially with or without nuclear power, and the contribution from CCS can be more significant than that from nuclear power. We found that a 30% CO2 reduction by 2030, and a 60% reduction by 2050 is achievable. To attain further reductions by 2050, assessment of emissions regulations and carbon pricing cannot be avoided. Our projections are based not only on the economic model, but also on interviews with leading experts from public/private/academic institutions, and thus should not be considered as unrealistic but rather as the best case scenario, applying the most advanced technologies and practices.","[Suzuki, Tatsujiro] Nagasaki Univ RECNA, Res Ctr Nucl Weap Abolit, JCER, Nagasaki, Japan; JCER, Tokyo, Japan; [Kobayashi, Hikaru] Keio Univ, JCER, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan",Nagasaki University; Keio University,"Suzuki, T (通讯作者)，Nagasaki Univ RECNA, Res Ctr Nucl Weap Abolit, JCER, Nagasaki, Japan.",suzukitatsu@nagasaki-u.ac.jp,,,,,,,4,3,3,0,27,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

A theoretical model shows that, when future house-price expectations become more favorable, reducing default concerns, mortgage choices shift toward alternative products, which are characterized by backloading of payments. The empirical work confirms this prediction by showing that an increase in past house-price appreciation, which captures more favorable expectations for the future, raises the market share of alternative mortgages. In addition, the paper tests the fundamental presumption that backloaded mortgages are more likely to default, finding support for this view.","[Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA; [Calem, Paul S.; Nakamura, Leonard I.] Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Philadelphia,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Irvine, CA USA.;Calem, PS; Nakamura, LI (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19106 USA.",jkbrueck@uci.edu; paul.calem@phil.frb.org; leonard.nakamura@phil.frb.org,,,,,,,15,12,15,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

Our evidence suggests that extant findings that have been attributed to constraints may instead reflect differences in the growth and financing policies of firms at different stages of their life cycles.

Our setting takes advantage of a unique quasi-natural experiment, where tax subsidies for Canadian labour-Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCCs) were phased out in one province but not in others. Using a difference-in-differences setting, we show that fund performance-unrelated to the tax credit-decreased substantially following the enactment of the phase-out. We further show empirically that LSVCC managers continued to charge venture capital-like management fees, despite the fact that their investment strategies become more similar to mutual funds.

Adding this concern to the revealed importance of performance indicators on human capital, and that their use is getting momentum, in order to attach financial values to knowledge management assets, it becomes more and more critical to measure human capital value. Key for Romanian FSO's managers becomes to consider that both human and financial values have a focus on adding value in every process and function in the organisation, and to perpetuate organisational profitability by the corporate culture, on the one hand, where culture is a powerful factor that helps a company to engage, on the other hand, talented people. There is a substantial concern on using ROI on Learning and Development programmes, but whilst this is still declared, Romanian FSOs do not yet have a consistent method to measure it. This study is showing the criticality of connecting people to financial results and data analysis suggests that ROI calculation has a positive impact on creating and fostering a powerful organisational culture and that employees' awareness of ROI values within their organisation has a powerful effect on their sense of engagement. Our findings have a more practical implication for the analysed industry by shaping a formal ROI measurement mechanisms blueprint, an ROI calculation model for the Romanian FSOs, in the form of a mechanism that could be employed when considering the design of an ROI Methodology for Romanian FSOs.","[Niculescu, Daniela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Niculescu, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",dana.tolici@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,1,3,0,7,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2016,18.0,41,,,,,120,134,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF9WN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371713100009,0

First, in a game theoretic framework that describes the location choices made by retailers with respect to each other, the connection between relative firm location and transportation demand is outlined. Second, a multivarlate point pattern statistic based on this theoretical framework is applied to location patterns of fast food outlets to measure the effects that major road infrastructure has on firm location behavior in this sector. The results suggest that transportation infrastructure affects the location behavior of firms with respect to their location in relation to their competitors. Access to important transportation infrastructure induces competing outlets to locate next to each other a tendency not necessarily observed among outlets without such access. Theoretically, this does not only affect economic outcomes, but also travel demand and consumer accessibility. The findings from this study stress the importance of accounting for how transportation infrastructure changes the location behavior of firms in travel demand frameworks.

He advocated aggressive stimulus policies, such as a money-financed tax cut and an inflation target of 3%-4%. Yet, after U.S. interest rates hit zero in 2008, the Fed under Chairman Bernanke took more cautious actions. This paper asks when and why Bernanke changed his mind about zero-bound policy. The answer, at one level, is that he was influenced by analysis from the Fed staff that was presented at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of June 2003. This answer raises another question: why did the staff's views influence Bernanke so strongly? I seek answers to this question in the social psychology literature on group decision-making.","[Ball, Laurence] Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21212 USA",Johns Hopkins University,"Ball, L (通讯作者)，Johns Hopkins Univ, Dept Econ, Baltimore, MD 21212 USA.",lball@jhu.edu,,,,,,,28,4,4,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1074-3529,1465-7287,,CONTEMP ECON POLICY,Contemp.

Using nationally representative surveys from years 2009-2012, the analysis applies different gender dummies - female head of household, female plot holder, and female plot manager- to investigate how the variable of choice affects the calculation of the gender gap. Our analysis obtains different results depending on the gender variable of choice. The study finds that regardless of the variable of choice, the gender gap in agricultural productivity decreases or disappears when factors of production and crop choice are controlled for. The conditional gender gap is about 10% and significant when using female plot manager as the gender variable, while we find no conditional gender gap when using the other gender variables. The use of time fixed-effects and decomposition contributes evidence that the typically available gender variables are insufficient for identifying how gender and decision-making of different household members play a role in productivity. This finding is problematic for targeting effective interventions to increase agricultural productivity and reduce gender inequalities in agriculture. Finally, we find that the older status of female heads, holders and manager of plots, child dependency ratio, and limited access to adult male labor are factors decreasing productivity in female plots in Uganda.

Furthermore, the evidence is usually restricted to the impacts of sole low-cost airlines on tourist destinations newly served by such airlines. In contrast to various ideological or naive statements, this paper shows that assessing the relationship between liberalised air markets and trends in tourism is challenging. On the transport side, aviation liberalisation is rarely considered as a dimension that can be measured accurately; similar protected markets are not considered for comparison; and trends in charter flights are neglected. On the tourist side, broad definitions of so-called tourists are usually considered and include immigrants visiting their home country; nights spent are neglected, despite a possible trend in declining length of stay; and substitution between places is usually disregarded, as are the long-term effects.

The projects wanted to offer an alternative marketing channel for the farms in these regions by marketing fairly produced, locally grown products'. The aim of this study is to analyze the determinants of consumers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for fairly-produced, locally grown products using two different WTP measures: the first one describes a more general willingness-to pay (WTPGEN) and the second one quantifies the price premium (WTPQUAN) respondents are willing to pay. The influence of both person-related and environmental factors, which are known to have an impact on food-related consumption behavior, was determined introducing and using the Shapley value (SV) decomposition of R-2. This concept is commonly used in the commercial marketing context, but until now it has rarely been applied in academic research on food related consumption behavior, even though it provides interesting advantages. The results show that consumers' WTP for fairly-produced, locally grown products is influenced by person-related factors as well as by environmental factors. In the case of WTPQUAN, a dominant influence by consumers' price consciousness can be observed, while a higher relative importance of the more global constructs of norms, stated preferences, and values can be detected when explaining WTPGEN.","[Emberger-Klein, Agnes; Menrad, Klaus; Heider, Dominik] Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, D-94315 Straubing, Germany",,"Emberger-Klein, A (通讯作者)，Weihenstephan Triesdorf Univ Appl Sci, Chair Mkt & Management Biogen Resources, Straubing Ctr Sci, Petersgasse 18, D-94315 Straubing, Germany.",a.emberger-klein@wz-straubing.de,"Heider, Dominik/F-8545-2010","Menrad, Klaus/0000-0003-1079-1056; Emberg, Agnes/0000-0001-6620-5162",,,,,61,7,7,1,22,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The empirical results show that there is a significantly positive causality running from corruption to economic growth in South Korea, a significantly positive causality running from economic growth to corruption in China and no significant causality between corruption and economic growth for the remaining countries. According to the empirical results, we do not support the common perception that corruption is bad for economic growth for all thirteen Asia-Pacific. On the contrary, results of this study suggest that the grease the wheels hypothesis is supported for South Korea. Additionally, results of this study indicate that for most Asia-Pacific countries, policy makers' use of anti-corruption policies to promote a country's economic development may not be effective. Finally, results of this study also suggest that for China, increase in economic growth leads to an increase in corruption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recognising the importance of politics in shaping reform outcomes, it highlights reform strategies that have contributed to overcoming both technical and political barriers to reform. It highlights three interconnected arguments. First, there is a need for long-term, hands-on, local partnerships that support local capacity, help to confront political resistance and build a constituency for reform. Second, there should be expanded focus on politically contentious efforts to strengthen transparency, public outreach, and enforcement among elites, as they are critical to programme success and sustainability. Third, a focus on the same politically contentious elements of reform can help external actors better assess the extent of local political commitment to reform early-on, and thus target reform funding and efforts more effectively.","[Jibao, Samuel] Ctr Econ Res & Capac Bldg, Freetown, Sierra Leone; [Prichard, Wilson] Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S3G3, Canada; [Prichard, Wilson] Univ Toronto, Sch Global Affairs, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S3G3, Canada; [Prichard, Wilson] Univ Sussex, Inst Dev Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Toronto; University of Toronto; University of Sussex,"Prichard, W (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Polit Sci, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S3G3, Canada.;Prichard, W (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Sch Global Affairs, 100 St George St, Toronto, ON M5S3G3, Canada.",wilson.prichard@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,41,7,14,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In this study, top-down macro stress testing from a supervisory perspective was analyzed and discussed in general terms. Then, probable effects of credit, interest rate, exchange rate, and contagion risks on capital adequacy of Turkish banking sector in specified baseline and adverse scenarios were examined. First, different satellite panel econometric models for corporate and retail loans were used to estimate loan growth and non-performing loans. Second, model results were utilized to see effects of macro-economic scenarios on Turkish banking system according to the Basel's standard and economic capital approaches. Results of the study showed that economic growth and interest rates change had significant effects on corporate loans while along with these variables unemployment rate had significant effect on retail loans. Moreover, economic growth, exchange rates, and unemployment rate had significant impacts on corporate non-performing loans while only economic growth and unemployment rate had significant impact on non-performing retail loans. According to the study results, while there was no significant impact of exchange rates on net income of the sector because of low level net foreign currency positions, the main effect was on capital adequacy via revaluation of foreign currency denominated risk weighted assets. We found that the robust capital base of Turkish banking sector was a crucial factor in resilience of the sector' capital adequacy against financial shocks. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This instrument, addressed directly to the regions, is aimed at supporting the implementation of regional policy objectives. Until present there are no universally accepted indicators allowing to identify the effects of implementation of this instrument. In the context of the diagnosed research gap, the basic research problem is whether the state interventionism aimed at the development of the tourism sector contributes to positive developmental change in this sector. The undertaken issue concerning the impact of public intervention on the development of the tourism sector is innovative. On the one hand, the effects of public intervention cannot be clearly determined, on the other hand, so far no uniform tools to measure the effects of public intervention were developed. Also, there are no adopted meters, whose data would be widely available, enabling the interregional comparability. The presented research results fill the gap in the theory and practice. Scientific aim This article aims to analyse the impact of the EU financial instruments implemented at regional level on the development of the tourism sector. The specific objectives relate to the analysis of the impact of the EU instruments on the development of tourism enterprises, including the dynamics of changes in the number of enterprises in the tourism sector, employment in the tourism sector, and the dynamics of added value. Methodology/methods In determining the level of the integrated economic effect of public intervention, the methodology of the New Public Management (NPM) concept was applied. In the study on the impact of public intervention on the development of the tourism sector statistical data was used. The study covered the period 2009-2014. Findings Public intervention contributes to the creation of new jobs and has a positive impact on employment in the tourism sector. Co-financing of investments providing services related to accommodation as well as leisure services has a beneficial effect on the dynamics of the development of enterprises providing accommodation and catering services. The increase in employment in facilities newly created as a result of public intervention con-tributes to the growth in the dynamics of the creation of added value and the suppression of the general trend of decline in employment. Conclusions It should be stated that the integrated effect of the public intervention of the Podlaskie Voivodeship in the years 2007-2013 with the use of EU funds from the Regional Operational Programme of the Podlaskie Voivodeship exhibits a positive balance. It significantly affects the growth of entrepreneurship in the tourism sector and the value added generated in this sector. It contributes significantly to the development of the tourism sector.","[Panfiluk, Eugenia] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Panfiluk, E (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",e.panfiluk@pb.edu.pl,"Panfiluk, Eugenia/AAB-4536-2020","Panfiluk, Eugenia/0000-0002-6204-2383",,,,,34,0,0,0,5,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,673,681,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200083,0

This manuscript discusses the existing evidence on life insurance firms and systemic risk, with a focus on the investment-grade corporate bond market. We provide some tentative evidence that life insurers tend to absorb liquidity risk by purchasing bonds when the bonds are less liquid than average. However, we do not find evidence that insurers increased bond purchases specifically during the financial crisis, leaving open the question of whether insurers would play a stabilizing role in a future crisis.","[Paulson, Anna; Rosen, Richard] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago,"Paulson, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",anna.paulson@chi.frb.org; richard.rosen@chi.frb.org,,,,,,,55,1,3,0,15,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1367,,978-0-8243-4808-3,ANNU REV FINANC ECON,Annu.

It uses title deed information to determine year of sale via a number of sources. The main finding of this research is that a great deal of land changed ownership during this period, which, if the government had been committed to land reform, it could have acted upon. Evidence suggests as much as 67 per cent of white-owned land changed ownership after 1980. The second is that, while a large amount of land did change hands, it was not the 80 per cent that many white farmers and their supporters have claimed. The figure of 69 per cent is still very high, but it is apparent that much of this did not represent 'true' transfer of land. By further investigating the land that did change hands, this paper also raises questions about (a) the possibilities of market-led land reform in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa, and (b) the relationship between white capital and the new political elite in the postcolonial state.","[Pilossof, Rory] Univ Free State, Ctr Africa Studies, Bloemfontein, South Africa",University of the Free State,"Pilossof, R (通讯作者)，Univ Free State, Ctr Africa Studies, Bloemfontein, South Africa.",rorypilossof@gmail.com,,,,,,,55,6,10,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

But in the 1960s the East Asian countries developed rapidly despite receiving large amounts of aid. To examine why aid seems to undermine development in some cases but not in others, we conduct a detailed comparison of the mechanisms of the aid curse' in South Korea and Pakistan. We show that South Korea saw astonishing levels of corruption, but this did not hinder its development; and Pakistan had a strong bureaucracy, which did not help it to grow. The key difference between the two countries was in the strength of their tax systems: foreign aid in the context of underdeveloped tax administration leads to increasing cycles of debt that undermine development. When foreign aid arrives in the context of commitment to strong taxation, a country can avoid the aid curse.'","[Prasad, Monica; Nickow, Andre] Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Prasad, Monica] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Prasad, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Sociol, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Prasad, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, 1810 Chicago Ave, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",m-prasad@northwestern.edu,,,,,,,85,5,5,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

The main thesis can be expressed as follows: the present scope and methods used in the implementation of corporate social responsibility in European business is insufficient. In principle, it should cover the most significant aspects of company operation and its socio-environmental impact, as part of a broader, multi-level governance designed to support the transition to smart, efficient and low carbon economy called sustainability transition. Methodology/methods In order to conduct the study, first an extensive review of the literature on the transition to smart and efficient, low carbon economy and events that occurred on the landscape and regime level was conducted. The framework's structure is based upon the multi-level perspective on socio-technical transitions created by F. Geels. Scientific aim The purpose of this study is to identify the new role of corporate sustainability in the transition to smart, efficient low carbon economy. Findings The present problems, both environmental (such as climatic changes, the loss of bio-diversity and depletion of natural resources) and social (mostly associated with steep inequalities in income distribution), present an enormous challenge to economic development. Those problems can only be faced by means of deep structural changes to the adopted production and consumption patterns. Changes of this scale can only be effected through concerted effort of various economic actors: companies, industry sectors, decision-makers, political powers, consumer groups, active civil societies, engineers, and scientists. Conclusions The sustainability transition process has reached an unprecedented scale. Business entities gradually depart from the business as usual model of operation, looking for new business models (and thus introducing the idea of corporate sustainability).","[Ryszawska, Bozena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Ryszawska, B (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland.",bozena.ryszawska@ue.wroc.pl,"Ryszawska, Bożena/T-9320-2018",,,,,,17,0,0,2,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,321,327,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200040,0

Among other things, they focused attention on over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives (or swaps) and provided the impetus for increased regulation of the OTC swaps market. In 2010, Congress enacted Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Title VII provides a comprehensive framework for swaps regulation and is intended to promote financial stability. Among other things, Title VII requires swap dealers (and certain other market participants) to register with regulatory authorities and meet new capital adequacy, collateral, recordkeeping and reporting obligations. Title VII also requires swaps (subject to certain exceptions) to be: (1) traded on exchanges or centralized trading platforms (called swap execution facilities or security-based swap execution facilities); and (2) cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses. This chapter briefly discusses some of the implications of the trade execution and clearing requirements of Title VII for transparency, risk management and financial stability.","[Steigerwald, R.

Using an MIDT dataset of worldwide passenger itineraries served by the European airport network during May 2013, we first establish whether London Heathrow can currently be considered the most important hub for the UK, in terms of traffic generation, connectivity, and centrality, while also measuring the dependence of UK regions on foreign airports and airlines to remain connected with the rest of the world. Results show that, despite the competition, London Heathrow benefits from its massive traffic generation to remain the most central gateway for overall UK air transport markets. However, when only regional markets are considered, significant dependence on foreign hubs appears in many destinations, particularly to Asia Pacific or the BRIC countries where above 80% of passengers use transfer flights. These results fit nicely with the observed trends of seat de-concentration and hub-bypassing in the airline industry. While dependence on foreign hubs can be interpreted as a sign of vulnerability, there is also the argument that bypassing Heathrow allows regional airports to develop new markets and reduce the level of congestion in the London airport system.

Given the effective management of university necessarily requires the correct identification of who stakeholders are, this article seeks to identify and classify the main stakeholders of the university assessing their value provided for the university. Methodology/methods This research was conducted in two phases. The first phase consisted the literature review for identifying main stakeholder analysis and its implementation to higher education sector. The second phase consisted a quantitative methodology, based upon survey, for determining the university's stakeholders created value for the University. Scientific aim The scientific aim is to make a contribution to the value research field of Universities in the contex of stakeholders. Findings The first finding of the article reveals that the concept of stakeholders is critical and difficult to implement everywhere and to everything. The second finding founds students, the teaching and research staff and employers identified as the main stakeholders. The third finding reveals that these university's stakeholders create value for the University, which can be expressed in four dimensions, reflecting economic, functional, social and emotional aspects. These findings allow to identify University's opportunities, benefits and barriers, which can influence the University's management. Conclusions The article shows the complexity of problems in managing higher educational organizations in context of dynamics and its relation to the environment. The quantitative nature of this research represents one of the main research limitations. Another limitation relating to these results is that they derive only from one Lithuanian state university. But studies comparing different higher education institutions stakeholders' created value to the University might prove a highly fruitful approach for future researchs.","[Varaniute, Viktorija] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50-230, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Gimzauskiene, Edita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50-319, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Gimzauskiene, E (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50-319, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",viktorija.varaniute@ktu.lt,"Varaniūtė, Viktorija/N-8650-2016",,,,,,41,1,1,0,3,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,479,487,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200060,0

This special section provides new evidence on the political factors determining taxation in developing countries. The articles gathered here address two distinct yet related questions: first, which factors shape long-term taxation patterns and why are these patterns so difficult to change even when they prove to be dysfunctional in many ways? Second, which factors determine the fate of specific tax reforms?

This study considers there to be three components of household food security (quantity, quality and stability), and attempts to address the concept-to-measurement gap in food security by building an index that spans these three dimensions. A panel data set from rural Zambia is used for descriptive analysis of food security indicators in 2001, 2004 and 2008. A multidimensional index of food security for rural Zambia is then developed using principal component analysis. We use this index to explore the spatial patterns of food security over time and to assess correlates of food security and impacts of climate shocks. Results indicate that both rainfall and temperature have a significant impact on a household's food security score, though not for each individual component of the index. The paper concludes with a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of developing a composite food security index.","[Wineman, Ayala] Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Int Dev, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA",Michigan State University,"Wineman, A (通讯作者)，Michigan State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, Int Dev, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",wineman1@msu.edu,,,"USAID Bureau for Food Security [AIDOAA-LA-11-00010, CDG-A-00-02-00021-00]",USAID Bureau for Food Security(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Financial support for this study was provided by the USAID Bureau for Food Security (Associate Award AIDOAA-LA-11-00010 under Food Security III, CDG-A-00-02-00021-00).

We depart from previous papers on Japan by controlling for prefecture fixed effects, without which the estimates can be severely biased upward. Contrary to popular belief, childcare availability is uncorrelated with maternal employment when prefecture fixed effects are controlled. Evidence suggests that this is because households shift from using informal childcare provided by grandparents to the accredited childcare service, as more and more households do not live with grandparents. If this change of the household structure did not occur, the growth of childcare availability would have increased the maternal employment rate by two percentage points, which accounts for about 30% of the growth in the maternal employment rate from 1990 to 2010.

The Heston model reduces the mismatch in realized variance between the two markets, but deviations are still significant. With the exception of short-dated options, we achieve best approximations after controlling for the presence of jumps in the underlying dynamics. Finally, we provide evidence that, although heavily biased, the realized variance based on the BS model contains relevant predictive information that can be exploited when option high-frequency data is not available.

J,"Brown, A",,,,"Brown, Alison",,,Claiming the Streets: Property Rights and Legal Empowerment in the Urban Informal Economy,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,legal empowerment; property rights; informal economy; street trade,TRANSITION; MYSTERY; TRADERS; AFRICA,"This paper looks at the concept of law and urban development with a focus on property rights and land, exploring the potential collective rights in the public domain to underpin a more equitable approach to the management of public space and challenge inappropriate regulation that criminalizes the lives of the poor. The focus is on street trade and the informal economy. The hypotheses are that: collective use rights extend to public land and are crucial to the livelihoods of the urban poor; such use provides public good as well as private profit, and legal traditions in sub-Saharan Africa can often accommodate the broad definition of rights entailed. The literature review interrogates debates on property rights, legal empowerment, and public space, to suggest that urban public space should be considered as a common resource where open access remains. Fieldwork draws on comparative studies of Dakar, Senegal, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, based on in-depth interviews with street traders and key informants, and a legal review in each city. The findings suggest very different trajectories in each city. In Dakar collective action with political support has created space for dialog, while in Dar es Salaam lack of solidarity among traders meant that evictions were uncontested. In both cities the balance between public and private gain was moderated through complex social processes to create the hybrid space of the street, defined here as a 'collective pool resource'. Finally the paper explores bundles of rights that might include access and beneficial use but with collective management to establish such a 'collective pool resource'. Thus the paper challenges the usual conception of the public domain as state land, to recognize the collective claim for the street that is core to the operation of urban informal economies.

In this regard, we adopt the standard model used to test the law of proportionate effect, augmented by the cash flow variable, to examine both the growth profile of Italian SMEs and the growth-cash flow nexus. We also show that for the SMEs in the Southern backward regions of Italy, the dependence of firm growth on inside finance is more intense than for firms operating in the more developed regions of the country. We conclude remarking that the tightness of the financial arrangement allows a downgraded size distribution, as the right-skewed firm size distribution of the Southern SMEs seems to suggest.","[Donati, Cristiana; Sarno, Domenico] Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Caserta, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Sarno, D (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Dept Econ, Caserta, Italy.",cristiana.donati@unina2.it; domenico.sarno@unina2.it,,,,,,,48,10,10,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We use a model with volatile stock markets where shareholders design compensation schemes that incentivize managers to stimulate short-term increases in stock prices that do not maximize long-run stock market value. We show that D&O insurance provides a convenient instrument for the initial shareholders of a company to take advantage of differences in beliefs between insiders and outsiders in capital markets. The empirical results support the idea that both the insurance coverage and the premium are higher in the presence of new shareholders and volatile markets.

Risk capital is equity investment that backs obligations to creditors and other liability holders and maintains the firm's credit quality. Credit quality is measured by the ratio of the value of the firm's option to default to the default-free value of its liabilities. Marginal default values provide a full and unique allocation of risk capital. Efficient capital allocations maintain credit quality and preclude risk shifting. Our theory leads to an adjusted present value (APV) criterion for making investment and contracting decisions. We set out implications for risk management and corporate finance.

We propose that specific patterns of facial expressions predict the popularity of YouTube videos among users of social media. To test that proposition, we used a neuromarketing tool-FaceReader-to code facial videos of professional speakers who participated in the YouTube social media campaigns of 2 large commercial banks. We analyzed more than 25,000 video frames of 16 speakers' 6 basic facial expressions. We found that less incidence of affiliative facial emotions (happiness and sadness) and more incidence of nonemotional expressions (surprise) explained an additional 25% of variance (from 61% to 86%) in the video's popularity (number of YouTube views) after 8 months in t2 (July 14, 2015), in comparison to t1 (October 31, 2014) as the only baseline predictor. We further showed that the disaffiliative facial emotions of the speakers (anger, fear, and disgust) did not contribute as an indicator of the future performance of social media content. We hope that these findings will open new lines of research in corporate communication by incorporating neuromarketing and nonverbal communication to understand not only what content is effective but how it should be presented.","[Lewinski, Peter] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Commun Sci, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Lewinski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Neuchatel, Fac Econ, Rue A-L Breguet 2, CH-2000 Neuchatel, Switzerland.",peter.lewinski@unine.ch,,,People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA [290255],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme FP7 under REA(Marie Curie Actions),"Peter Lewinski has worked as a Marie Curie Research Fellow at Vicarious Perception Technologies B.V., a firm that develops FaceReader software with Noldus Information Technologies B.V.

However, much remains unknown about activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in developing countries. Can we expect similarity between activity participation and travel behaviour of non-workers in different income group households in developing countries? How do the socio-demographic settings in India, for e.g., traditional gender roles and multi-member households, and land use context influence the activity-travel choices of non-workers in different income group households? The present study attempts to answer these questions by presenting a comparative analysis of activity-travel behaviour of non-workers in low-, medium-, and high-income households in Bangalore city, India. Using a primary activity-travel survey data, the study mainly compares the activity-travel behaviour of the three income-groups with respect to various activity-travel indicators. In addition, statistical models of daily out-of-home time allocation, trip chaining, and mode choice behaviour are estimated separately for the three groups to investigate the potential sensitivity of the groups to various factors influencing these behaviour indicators. The study findings suggest that the low-income group non-workers are more mobility-constrained than others, apparent from longer walk trip length and the lower dependency on other modes of transport The low-income group appears to make more social stops than the other two groups, probably a reflection of social-connections due to the increased dependency on walking. However, the number of recreational and shopping stops made by this group appears to be significantly lower than the other two groups. Further, the influence of mixed residential development on low-income group individuals' maintenance and discretionary activity rime allocation decision appears to be insignificant. Overall, the study suggests that future land use planning for Bangalore might ensure that all groups of individuals have equal access (in terms of travel time/distance) to basic facilities.

S-corporations' single level of taxation increases access to after-tax internal capital and likely enhances S-corporation monitoring efforts. However, S-corporations face strict organizational restrictions on the number and type of allowable shareholders. Given banks' rigid capital criteria and active regulatory environment, this differential access to external capital is likely to influence S-corporations' risk-taking behavior. Our evidence suggests that the organizational restrictions necessary to qualify for S-corporation status reduce risk-taking behaviors and limits some extreme adverse outcomes.","[Mayberry, Michael A.] Univ Florida, Fisher Sch Accounting, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Weaver, Connie D.] Texas A&M Univ, Mays Business Sch, College Stn, TX USA; [Wilde, Jaron H.] Univ Iowa, Henry B Tippie Coll Business, Iowa City, IA USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Mays Business School; University of Iowa,"Mayberry, MA (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Fisher Sch Accounting, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",mayberry@warrington.ufl.edu; cweaver@mays.tamu.edu; jaron-wilde@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,44,1,1,1,12,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Our analyses reveal that activation of 20 emotional states following trust-based interaction is better explained by predictions derived from a multi-dimensional Recalibrational perspective than by predictions derived from two-dimensional Valence and Arousal perspectives. The Recalibrational perspective proposes that emotions are activated according to their functional features for example, emotions help people achieve short or long-sighted goals by up or down-regulating behavioral propensities, whereas Valence and Arousal perspectives consider simpler hedonic dimensions lacking functional specificity. The Recalibrational perspective is also distinguished from the Valence and Arousal perspectives in that it predicts the possibility of conflicted emotions.

Two complementary estimation approaches are used to highlight the importance of taking the household decision-making context into account when modeling the retirement behaviour of partnered men and women. First, a single risk hazard model provides insights into the influences of a spouse's characteristics on the retirement decision of the individual. Second, a competing-risks framework is used to examine the retirement behaviour of couples exiting from a situation in which both are in paid employment. There is strong evidence of coordination of retirement by mature age couples in Australia due to complementarities in leisure and, for women, because of caring responsibilities. In particular, the results suggest that women may delay their own retirement if their partner has a financial incentive to continue in the labour force; or retire early to care for a partner who is in poor health.

This paper uses data reported through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) over the period 1990-2013 to estimate the relationship between annual metropolitan area-level house price inflation and the extent to which Black borrowers are denied relative to 'comparable' White borrowers on their loan applications. The results indicate that, on average, Black borrowers are denied more frequently than White borrowers, but this difference in denial rates decreases significantly as house prices rise more rapidly. Such results demonstrate the importance of considering local housing market conditions when using HMDA data to assess lender compliance with fair lending laws.

Using measures of multinational presence constructed at region and industry levels, our results reveal little evidence of multinational spillovers arising from an increase in the export variety of domestic firms. The growing presence of multinational firms has a strongly negative association with the export unit value of domestic firms, suggesting that exposure to multinational firms may intensify the competition in the product market and force local firms to offer lower-value products in the international markets. This adverse influence is mainly driven by processing trade as opposed to ordinary trade, with private firms being less affected by export spillovers than state-owned enterprises. We also find that the productivity of firms can mitigate the negative effect of the exposure to multinational firms on the unit value of exports. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This article tests whether this is the case, by analysing the extent to which politics, rather than equity and efficiency criteria, have determined the geographical allocation of public investment across the 81 provinces of Turkey between 2005 and 2012. The results show that although the Turkish government has indeed channelled public expenditures to reward its core constituencies, socioeconomic factors remained the most relevant predictors of investment. Moreover, in contrast to official regional development policy principles, we uncover the concentration of public investment in areas with comparatively higher levels of development. We interpret this as the state bureaucracy's intentional strategy of focussing on efficiency by concentrating resources on the better off among the most in need'.","[Luca, Davide; Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Luca, D (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Luca, Davide/AAB-3463-2019","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856;",National Scientific Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK - BIDEB); European Research Council under the European Union [269868]; European Research Council (ERC) [269868] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),National Scientific Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK - BIDEB)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC),The authors thank Riccardo Crescenzi and Waltraud Schelke for comments on an earlier draft.

The common perception is that the increase in comovements is the result of distressed investors selling both assets during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. We show that financial distress alone cannot explain the size and persistence of comovements. Instead, we argue that commodities have become an investment style for institutional investors. Given that institutional investors continue to target funds into commodities, we predict spillovers between commodities and the stock market to remain high in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into consideration that 92% of national surface is classified as rural, it is indispensable to think up models of development whose main reference point is agriculture. Agriculture is the productive activity which more than others set the characteristics of a territory and it takes on both the role of producer of goods and promoter of a socio-cultural and environmental context. Agriculture is not a separate sector but an entity strictly integrated with the other components of the socio-economic system and thanks to this it is able to play a fundamental role for the territorial development. The aim of this paper is to highlight the need to organize an adequate political action aimed at endorsing the multifunctional role of agriculture and to underline how agriculture operating in an integrated way with tourism, handcraft and the other territorial activities is strategic to develop and carry out a development model where the territory is the landmark.","[Calabro, Grazia] Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy; [Vieri, Simone] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Messina; Sapienza University Rome,"Calabrò, G (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, I-98100 Messina, Italy.",grazia.calabro@unime.it,"Vieri, Simone/GQZ-3803-2022",,,,,,34,6,6,0,14,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1346,1358,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300017,0

We estimate several simultaneous-equations models employing the 3SLS technique and instrumental variables to account for endogeneity. We obtain four main results. First, BHC performance measures (return on equity, Tobin's Q and EBIT over total assets) are positively associated with busyness of directors. Second, BHC risk measures (total, market, idiosyncratic, credit and default risks) are inversely related to busyness of directors. Third, performance (risk) benefits of having busy directors strengthened (weakened) during the financial crisis of 2007-2009. Fourth, busy directors are not more likely to become problem directors (fail the 75% attendance standard), and if sitting on boards of both BHC and non-financial firms, they attend more of the BHC board meetings, than those of the non-financials. Our findings partially alleviate concerns that over-boarded directors shirk their responsibilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Second, large and small banks, on the whole, shift lending away from international markets to the domestic market when drawing on government support during periods of liquidity stress.

The central question of the current study is what determines a country's level of export sophistication. I argue that a synergetic relationship between state and society positively contributes to the level of export sophistication. The logic behind the argument is that the socially optimal level of investment in new products can only be realized if both the firm and the government find it individually profitable to carry out the investment. In cases whereby either or both lacks private incentive to invest, higher synergy between public and private sectors makes such joint investments more likely to occur. This logic is formally illustrated using a simultaneous game with incomplete information. The central hypothesis is tested using time series cross-sectional data. The key empirical novelty of this paper is the construction of a synergy index based on Peter Evans' conceptualization of the term. Overall, the data give good support to the hypothesis. This relationship is particularly robust for the subsample of countries with intermediate levels of synergy. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that state-society synergy is subject to diminishing returns as its values get higher.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Polit Sci, Singapore 117573, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Li, AX (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Polit Sci, AS1,11 Arts Link 04-10, Singapore 117573, Singapore.",lixiang577@gmail.com,"Li, Xiang/R-6524-2019","Li, Xiang/0000-0002-6186-9258",,,,,48,8,10,0,20,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

We use a panel of correlated Merton balance sheet models combined with a network clearing algorithm, to measure systemic risk and how it changes with bank capital. The model explicitly incorporates the possibility of default through common exposures to macroeconomic factors and interbank linkages. We use five risk allocation mechanisms to allocate systemic risk to individual banks. Using a sample of Dutch banks, we find that macroprudential capital requirements deviate from the current observed capital levels by as much as 40% and they are positively related to bank size and interbank exposure. Furthermore, macroprudential capital requirements can reduce individual and multiple banks default probabilities by up to 26%. The results suggest that financial stability can be substantially improved by implementing macroprudential regulations for the banking system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Since the valuation of timer options with interest rate risk is a four-dimensional problem, the dimensionality curse causes tremendous difficulty in finding analytic solutions to the pricing of timer options. In this paper, a fast approximate analytic method is developed to price power style timer options with Vasicek interest rate model. The valuation of timer options with interest rate risk is formulated as a four-dimensional partial differential equation (PDE) using Delta-hedging approach. A dimension-reduction technique is then proposed to reduce the four-dimensional PDE into a two-dimensional nonlinear PDE. A perturbation approach is developed to solve the reduced two-dimensional nonlinear PDEs and then an explicit approximate analytic formula for the timer option is obtained. In particular, explicit approximate analytic formulas for timer options under both Heston and Hull-White models are further derived. Numerical examples of pricing timer options under the above two models are provided. Both the approximate analytic method and the crude Monte Carlo simulation method are used for the examples. The numerical results show that prices of timer options by both methods are close and the approximate analytic method is much faster than the crude Monte Carlo method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find the rating of a mutual fund is more optimistic when the MFRC either (i) receives trading commission fees from the mutual fund or (ii) can potentially receive fees in the future. The paper further shows that the usefulness of ratings in terms of predicting a fund's future performance is negatively impacted by conflicts of interest. There is also evidence that investors can see through the problem, responding less enthusiastically (in terms of fund flows) to the ratings of conflicted MFRCs. We further find that the introduction of a rating qualification system that aims to improve mutual fund rating quality exacerbates the rating bias. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Debt literacy is a component of broader financial understanding that measures knowledge about debt and self-assessed financial knowledge. Financial experiences are the participants' reported experiences with traditional borrowing, alternative borrowing, and investing. Overindebtedness is a self-reported measure. Debt literacy is low, with only about one-third of the population grasping the basics of interest compounding. Even after controlling for demographics, we find a relationship between debt literacy and both financial experiences and debt loads. Individuals with lower levels of debt literacy tend to transact in high-cost manners, incurring higher fees and using high-cost borrowing. We provide a rough estimate of the national implications of debt ignorance on credit card costs by consumers. Less knowledgeable individuals also report that their debt loads are excessive or that they are unable to judge their debt position.","[Lusardi, Annamaria] George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Tufano, Peter] Univ Oxford, Said Business Sch, Oxford, England",George Washington University; University of Oxford,"Lusardi, A (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Sch Business, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",alusardi@gwu.edu; peter.tufano@sbs.ox.ac.uk,"Lusardi, Annamaria/AEB-6291-2022",,FINRA Investor Education Foundation; HBS Division of Research and Faculty Development,FINRA Investor Education Foundation; HBS Division of Research and Faculty Development,"We would like to thank TNS Global and, in particular, George Ravich, Bob Neuhaus, and Ellen Sills-Levy for their willingness to partner with us on this project, and Lauren Cohen, James Feigenbaum, Christopher Malloy, Adair Morse, Annette Vissing-Jorgensen, and participants at the Consumer Finance Workshop, the NBER Summer Institute on Capital Markets and the Economy, Williams College, the European Central Bank conference on Household Finances and Consumption, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Symposium on Connecting Financial Education to Consumers, the Herman Colloquium at the University of Michigan, the American Economic Association Meeting in San Francisco, the George Mason School of Public Policy, the George Washington School of Business, and Harvard Business School for suggestions and comments.

It is therefore crucial that we understand the factors affecting this perception so that governments can identify the (public) policies that might reduce it. Among such policies, public resources devoted to policing emerge as a key instrument not only for tackling criminal activity but also for impacting on citizens' crime risk perception. In this framework, the aim of this study is to analyze both the individual and neighbourhood determinants of citizens' crime risk perception in the City of Barcelona (Spain) focusing on the effect of police proximity and taking into account the spatial aspects of neighbourhood characteristics. After controlling for the possible problems of the endogeneity of police forces and crime risk perception and the potential sorting of individuals across neighbourhoods, the results indicate that crime risk perception is reduced when non-victims exogenously interact with police forces. Moreover, neighbourhood variables, such as proxies of social capital and the level of incivilities, together with individual characteristics have an impact on citizens' crime risk perception.

We use a microsimulation model that includes a broader range of policy measures than previous studies to estimate how these reforms affected both household incomes and work incentives. We find that lower-income working-age households and the very richest have lost the most, while working-age households without children in the upper-middle of the income distribution actually gained from these reforms. Some results of our analysis are, however, highly sensitive to the choice of 'no reform' baseline. This is particularly true of how much pensioners have gained or lost from the reforms, since this depends critically on whether the basic state pension is increased in line with earnings or prices in the 'no reform' scenario. When analysing the impact of these reforms on individuals' work incentives, we find that the coalition's changes have slightly strengthened work incentives. The participation tax rate has, on average, been reduced by 3 percentage points, perhaps a less significant strengthening of incentives than might have been expected given the scale of the coalition's benefit cuts. However, this average effect disguises considerable variation across the population; indeed, the majority of workers have seen the incentive to increase their earnings weaken, not strengthen, as a result of the coalition's reforms.","[Adam, Stuart; Browne, James; Elming, William] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Adam, S (通讯作者)，Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England.",stuart.adam@ifs.org.uk; james_browne@ifs.org.uk; william_e@ifs.org.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS [ES/H021221/1]; Nuffield Foundation; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS; Nuffield Foundation; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) through the Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS (grant reference ES/H021221/1).

We use data collected through a large internet-based quasi-experiment carried out during the 2012 French presidential election where we invited subjects to cast a vote for real candidates according to four voting rules: two-round (the official system), one-round, the alternative vote, and approval voting. After voting with each of the four voting rules, subjects were also asked to report which system they liked the most. We find that voters prefer systems that are beneficial to the candidate they prefer, that their preference for the official two-round system (weakly) depends on how they actually vote under this system, and that right-wing voters are more supportive of voting rules under which one can vote for only one candidate (one-round and two-round).","[Blais, Andre] Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Laslier, Jean-Francois] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Laslier, Jean-Francois] CNRS, Paris, France; [Poinas, Francois; Van Der Straeten, Karine] Toulouse Sch Econ, Inst Adv Study Toulouse, Toulouse, France; [Poinas, Francois; Van Der Straeten, Karine] CNRS, Toulouse, France",Universite de Montreal; Paris School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Blais, A (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Polit Sci, CP 6128,Succ Ctr Ville, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.",andre.blais@umontreal.ca; jean-francois.laslier@ens.fr; francois.poinas@tse-fr.eu; Karine.Van-Der-Straeten@tse-fr.eu,"Laslier, Jean-Francois/GSJ-2634-2022; Laslier, Jean-Francois/K-1539-2019","Laslier, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-8334-1350;",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We thank the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council for financial support, Damien Bol and Laura Stephenson for comments on previous drafts, and Henry Milner for careful editing.",,33,14,14,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,SEP,2015,164.0,3-4,,,,,423,442,,10.1007/s11127-015-0287-2,0.0,,,20,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU7NM,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363727500013,0

At the same time, we take a fresh look at the role of distance in the diffusion of knowledge spillovers. Relying on a cited-citing gravity-like equation with high-dimensional fixed effects that control for multiple sources of observed and non-observed heterogeneity, we implement a Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimator. We find that knowledge spillovers correlate positively with industry localization and that the agglomeration of an industry can offset the adverse effect of distance. The results also corroborate the distance decay effect uncovered in earlier research. Our new approach to estimate the PPML with two high-dimensional fixed effects should prove valuable in applications to a variety of other problems in economics, such as the estimation of gravity equations widely used in modeling migration, trade and other flows among countries and regions.

For this purpose we use in the first step different seasonal and structural breaks unit root tests. In the second step we use a conditional VAR model as benchmark, and we focus on the conditional and non-conditional frequency domain causality tests. We find evidence of unidirectional causal relationship between stock prices and industrial production in the long-run, running from stock prices to industrial production. When using the non-conditional model, we find evidence of insignificant business cycle causality from both directions.

However, according to the Adaptive Market Hypothesis, trading rules are only likely to be successful for a limited period of time and, as investors and markets adapt, their predictive power will diminish. We examine the moving average (MA) rule using post-BLL (1987-2013) data and find that after 1986 the rule's predictive power has diminished in all three markets. We investigate the exact process behind the weakening of the predictive power of moving average rules and find that post-1987 markets react to new buy/sell signals not on the days those signals are generated, but the day before. In support of this finding, we show that trading strategies based on anticipation of signals would have yielded superior profits to investors. Hence, trading on anticipated signals constitutes a feasible explanation of price reactions to future, one-day-ahead new signals, and thus in line with the Adaptive Market Hypothesis.

(Entrep Theory Pract 33(1):19-46, 2009). According to the model, CES is built upon the three foundational elements of an entrepreneurial strategic vision, a pro-entrepreneurship organizational architecture, and entrepreneurial processes and behaviors as exhibited throughout the organization (Ireland et al. 2009, p. 38). The purpose of this study is to present a broad, overarching theory-complexity science-to examine the key elements and propositions of the CES model. Complexity science-founded on assumptions of interdependent heterogeneous agents and nonlinear interactions, as well as non-deterministic and potentially extreme outcomes-offers established multi-level concepts, theoretical boundary conditions, and methodological guidance for scholars to build and test future studies on CE and CES. Though our complexity perspective draws extensively from conceptual work on complex adaptive systems and agent-based models, we ground our arguments on the empirical ubiquity of power law distributions in all constructs and levels of analysis within the CES model. We conclude with a detailed research agenda, as well as a prescriptive discussion related to theory development, quantitative analysis, and practical applications to guide future studies on CE.","[Crawford, G.

We extend the model to allow private financial intermediaries to compete with the government in the provision of short-term money-like claims. We argue that, if there are negative externalities associated with private money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short maturities, thereby partially crowding out the private sector's use of short-term debt.","[Greenwood, Robin; Hanson, Samuel G.] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Stein, Jeremy C.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Greenwood, R (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,,,,,57,79,92,2,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1082,1540-6261,,J FINANC,J.

The rapid social and economic transformations have imposed the assumption of an integrative perspective, especially to the organizations oriented to ensure their viability on the market and industry. Hereby, researchers believe that such an approach should be indicative of start-ups which should advance feasible solutions to market imperfections through innovative products and services and through effective marketing models. Against this backdrop, the present paper aims to investigate the correlations between sustainable entrepreneurship and the marketing types articulated by the Contemporary Marketing Practices (CMP) research program, relying on a questionnaire-based survey conducted with 104 start-up entrepreneurs in Romania. As the findings show, the discussed marketing types often discretionary correlate in practice with the most important dimension of sustainability that is people.","[Hapenciuc, Cristian Valentin; Stanciu, Pavel] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania; [Pinzaru, Florina; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, Bucharest, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava; National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Hapenciuc, CV (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",valentinh@seap.usv.ro,"Stanciu, Pavel/HZI-0751-2023; Pinzaru, Florina/ABC-5633-2021; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/F-4872-2017","Stanciu, Pavel/0000-0002-5339-4328; Pinzaru, Florina/0000-0002-8371-5284; Vatamanescu, Elena-Madalina/0000-0002-9397-0385",,,,,47,22,26,1,62,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,AUG,2015,17.0,40,,,,,938,954,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365317700007,0

Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that IPO firms deploy more takeover defenses when they have important business relationships to protect. An IPO firm's use of takeover defenses is positively related to the longevity of its business relationships. IPO firms' use of takeover defenses creates positive spillovers for their large customers.

This means that at least in theory, unlike traditional market capitalization weighted indexes, it prevents overinvestment in overpriced stock and vice versa. It should therefore effectively time the market by avoiding incorrect investment in cyclically mispriced stock. We ascertain if Fundamental Indexation outperforms traditional indexing and whether any outperformance can be attributed to market timing.

The model derives an equilibrium investment strategy on expansion thresholds and scales and evaluates the strategic value of the capacity expansion. It demonstrates that an incumbent firm expands its production capacity by strategic incentive to deter a potential competitor's market entry and prolong its period of monopoly. The results suggest that the strategic value of the expansion is high enough to induce the incumbent firm to undertake the capacity expansion that generates negative cash flows in the future as a stand-alone project.

The least squares and the quantile regressions of stock-returns on lagged idiosyncratic-volatility estimated from daily data using two measures (including GARCH) fail to support such claim. The quantile regression estimation reveals the risk-return relationship to be quantile dependent; it is parabolic but significant only at the extreme quantiles. The parabolic-form is convex (concave) at the lower (upper) quantiles of the returns' conditional distribution. This changing relationship-form reflects uncertainty in predicting returns. Moreover, the idiosyncratic risk-return puzzle is a model specification problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Its reference point is the current standard of living of a household as opposed to other benchmarks such as the poverty line in the case of measures of vulnerability. Using panel data from Thailand and Vietnam we develop an empirical approach to quantify our measure. More precisely, we predict truly forward looking probabilities and deprivation indices of different states of the world and aggregate them to country specific measures of exposure to downside risk. We scrutinize the correlates of these measures in the periods 2007-08 and 2008-09 using regressions with household fixed effects. We examine vulnerability to poverty and hybrid vulnerability to poverty in an identical empirical framework. This allows us to draw conclusions with respect to the value added of our new measure. We find that the measure of exposure to downside risk indeed offers complimentary information that may be relevant from a policy perspective and recommend to incorporate its appraisal in holistic assessments of vulnerability and risk exposure.

Even when the macroeconomic variables reflecting business cycle fluctuations are taken into account, these empirical results remain the same. The rolling regression results also reveal that our findings are quite robust over time; in particular, the range of the rolling estimates is much smaller, suggesting that the time-varying risk-return relationship can be appropriately explained by bull and bear markets.

A number of other programs were first proposed as part of this war but were not implemented until the mid-1970s. These programs had noble goals: to increase incomes at the bottom of the income distribution, reduce poverty, and improve nutrition, heath, and human capital. However, various features of the programs also had the potential to produce unintended consequences: for example, means-tested programs can discourage work. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the main War on Poverty programs that were aimed at the low-income nonelderly population along with several follow-on programs.

This aim is achieved through a mixed-methodology. In this respect, 22 semi-structured interviews were conducted with road traffic injury prevention experts from five OECD countries. In addition, 31 professional road traffic injury prevention stakeholders from seven OECD nations completed a self-administered, online survey. It found that there was resource limitation and inter-dependence across actors within the context of road traffic injury prevention at a local level. Furthermore, this study unveiled the realization of resource-dependency as a trigger for coordinated responses at a local level. Moreover, the present examination has revealed two coordinating strategies favored by experts in road traffic injury prevention - i.e. self-organizing community groups, which are deemed to have a platform to deliver programs within communities, and the funding of community groups to forge partnerships. However, the present study did not appear to endorse other strategies such as the formalization of coordinated responses or a legal mandate to coordinate responses. In essence, this study appears to suggest a need to manage coordinated responses from an adaptive perspective with interactions across road traffic injury prevention programs being forged on a mutual understanding of inter-dependency arising out of resource scarcity. In fact, the role of legislation and top-down national models in local level management of coordinated responses is likely to be one of identifying opportunities to interact with self-organized community groups and fund partnership-based road traffic injury prevention events.

The analysis is focused on firms having positive R&D expenditure and investigates whether higher investments in R&D (in proportion to firm turnover) translate into higher medium-term growth rates. Comparisons with growth on a shorter term are conducted by following the firm size evolution since the R&D investment for five consecutive years and allowing for firm exit. At all time terms, quantile regression techniques indicate that a higher R&D has a positive effect on high growers and allows a higher number of firms to be high growers. Still, once a firm invests in R&D, even if a higher investment makes the firm more likely to have a very good performance, it does not make it less likely to have a bad one.","[Capasso, Marco; Treibich, Tania; Verspagen, Bart] Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Sect AE2, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Treibich, Tania] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, F-06189 Nice, France; [Treibich, Tania] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy; [Verspagen, Bart] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Verspagen, Bart] Univ Oslo, Ctr Technol Innovat & Culture TIK, Oslo, Norway",Maastricht University; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; Maastricht University; University of Oslo,"Capasso, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Econ, Sect AE2, Sch Business & Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",marco.capasso@gmail.com,"Verspagen, Bart/ABE-6732-2020; Treibich, Tania/AAI-9051-2020","Verspagen, Bart/0000-0001-6975-8141; Treibich, Tania/0000-0002-9679-1905; Capasso, Marco/0000-0003-2057-299X",European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The authors want to thank Rudi Bekkers, Alex Coad, Koen Frenken, Onder Nomaler, the participants at the DIME Final Conference held in Maastricht on April 6-8, 2011, and the participants at the ECIS economics seminar held in Eindhoven on October 13, 2011.

Thus, theory on the role of established firms in the emergence of new market segments is underdeveloped. This study informs current research by explaining the product innovation decisions of established firms during the emergence of a new market segment. The results of a case study on the development and commercialization of the minivan at Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors between 1970 and 1985 indicate that existing theories based on managerial cognition, firm capabilities, economic incentives, and organizational structure are insufficient to explain the decisions.

Findings in Bolivia suggest that approaches to M&E can lower staff morale, create burdensome paperwork, blind managers to operational problems and emerging innovations, and reinforce self-censorship, contributing to the very problem M&E is intended to solve. Crafted appropriately, M&E can instead become a tool to build practical judgment, increase staff motivation, and improve implementation incrementally. Ultimately, these findings contribute to efforts to design M&E that can support staff working under complex working conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One introduces a carbon cap-and-trade market and the other creates a plan to build a high-speed rail system connecting the state's major cities. This provides an opportunity to examine the demand for carbon mitigation efforts. Household voting patterns are found to mirror the voting patterns by the US Congress on national carbon legislation. Political liberals and more educated voters favor such regulations while suburbanites tend to oppose such initiatives. By pricing carbon, suburban land becomes less valuable. We find that homeowner communities in suburban areas are more likely to vote against such regulation, while homeowners in the center city area are more likely to favor carbon pricing. Homeowner communities close to high-speed rail stops are also more likely to support this legislation.","[Holian, Matthew J.] San Jose State Univ, San Jose, CA 95192 USA; [Kahn, Matthew E.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",California State University System; San Jose State University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Kahn, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA.",mkahn@ioe.ucla.edu,,"Holian, Matthew/0000-0002-7319-4294",,,,,32,17,23,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Valuing new seed varieties in India,ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,RISK-AVERSION,"Cash is often used in economic experiments as an incentive to encourage realistic decision making or to compensate participants for their time. However, in many less developed countries, remunerating participants with cash can upset existing relationships with local institutions. In cases where the use of cash is not feasible, an alternative type of payment is required. Using a framed field experiment in Odisha, India (formerly Orissa), we explore an alternative payment method, in-kind, where typical household items are used in place of cash. We compare the differences in the valuation of yield stabilizing seed traits between in-kind and cash. Our results suggest that farmers are willing to pay less for seeds when they are paid cash than when they are paid in-kind. Bids are higher by 1.18 Indian Rupees when farmers are paid in-kind, corresponding to about a 7 per cent higher valuation.","[Hossack, Fiona] Hlth Canada, Nations & Inuit Hlth Branch 1, Ottawa, ON K1A 0L2, Canada; [An, Henry] Univ Alberta, Dept Resource Econ & Environm Sociol, Edmonton, AB T6G 2H1, Canada",Health Canada; University of Alberta,"Hossack, F (通讯作者)，Hlth Canada, Nations & Inuit Hlth Branch 1, Ottawa, ON K1A 0L2, Canada.",fiona.hossack@hc-sc.gc.ca; henry.an@ualberta.ca,,,"Canadian International Food Security Research Fund - Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; International Development Research Center","Canadian International Food Security Research Fund - Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development; International Development Research Center(International Development Research Centre - IDRC)","The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Canadian International Food Security Research Fund sponsored by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development and the International Development Research Center.

We find that a drop in output has an intensified impact on loan losses if the private sector is excessively indebted. Because increased bank credit risk should be matched with higher bank capital, the result motivates the Basel III's countercyclical capital buffers as a function of private indebtedness relative to its trend. The result also helps to explain differences in the amount of loan losses in different recessions across time and across countries. The model also indicates that low interest rates during the recent recession have clearly mitigated loan losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using data composed of 8203 model-year pairs, 1071 models from 148 different brands, we find that recent competitive experiences of models, rather than those in the distant past, make them more viable competitors.

We study the market for new transit buses that features a set of non-profit transit agencies purchasing buses primarily from a few domestic bus makers. In contrast with private passenger vehicles, the fuel economy of public buses has not improved during the last thirty years and is irresponsive to fuel price changes. To understand these findings, we build a model of bus fleet management decisions of public transit agencies that yields testable hypotheses. Our empirical analysis of bus fleet turnover and capital investment highlights the role of energy prices, environmental regulations, and the Buy America mandate associated with receiving federal funding to purchase public transit buses.

The cartographic definition and representation of CBD is of great significance in studying the urban development and its functions. In order to facilitate these processes, the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a very efficient tool as it considers the decay impact of services and allows the enrichment of the information from a very simple input scatter plot to a smooth output density surface. However, most existing methods of density analysis consider geographic events in a homogeneous and isotropic space under Euclidean space representation. Considering the case that the physical movement in the urban environment is usually constrained by a street network, we propose a different method for the delimitation of CBD with network configurations. First, starting from the locations of central activities, a concentration index is presented to visualize the functional urban environment by means of a density surface, which is refined with network distances rather than Euclidean ones. Then considering the specialties of network distance computation problem, an efficient way supported by flow extension simulation is proposed. Taking Shenzhen and Guangzhou, two quite developed cities in China as two case studies, we demonstrate the easy implementation and practicability of our method in delineating CBD.

The Pension Research Council of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania recently convened a Technical Review Panel of experts to review key inputs, outputs, and model assumptions. Our review was intended to provide a formal evaluation of the technical adequacy of the model by outside experts. The papers herein summarize views of each expert on this project. Key findings are as follows:. The PIMS models are an important and valuable tool in modeling the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's liability risk. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other model that can do a comparable job.. Nevertheless, some improvements could be integrated in the Agency's approach to modeling. Those deserving highest priority attention, in the experts' view, include incorporating systematic mortality risk (i.e., treat mortality and longevity as stochastic variables); including new asset classes increasingly found in defined benefit plan portfolios (e.g., commercial real estate, private equity funds, infrastructure, hedge funds, and others); developing a more complex model for the term structure of interest rates; and incorporating an option value approach to pricing the insurance provided.. The Agency could also do more to communicate the range of uncertainty and potential for problems associated with the PBGC's financial status. This could include additional information including the conditional value-at-risk, and perhaps an 'intermediate,' 'optimistic', and 'pessimistic' set of projected outcomes, as well as the expected 'date of exhaustion' for assets backing pension benefits insured by the PBGC.","Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Mitchell, OS (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,Suite 3000, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",mitchelo@wharton.upenn.edu,,,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at the Wharton School,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at the Wharton School,"The research reported herein was pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); the author also acknowledges support from the Pension Research Council at the Wharton School.

Liquidity is taken to be M2. A novel finding is that unanticipated increases in the BRIC countries' liquidity is associated with significant and persistent increases in commodity prices that are much larger than the effect of unanticipated increases in G3 liquidity, and the difference increases over time. Over 1999-2012 BRIC liquidity is strongly linked with global energy prices and global real activity whereas G3 liquidity is not. The impact of BRIC liquidity on mineral and metal prices is twice as large as that of G3 liquidity. Granger casualty goes from liquidity to commodity prices.

We first propose an intuitive characterization of the absence of arbitrage opportunities in terms of copula functions. We then address the problem of detecting the presence of arbitrage by formalizing its resolution in two distinct ways that are both suitable for the use of optimization algorithms. The first method is valid in the general multivariate case and is based on Bernstein copulas that are dense in the set of all copula functions. The second one is easier to work with but is only valid in the bivariate case. It relies on results about improved Frechet-Hoeffding bounds in presence of additional information.

Most of these landfills do not comply with European Union Directives. Recently, an incinerator project was abandoned due to strong opposition from various associations and civil society representatives. Opponents to the project put forward potential threats in terms of pollution. Our study applied a latent-class rank-ordered logit model to estimate marginal willingness-to-pay to decrease pollution associated with solid waste management, using data from a ranking choice experiment. It has long been recognized that the rank-ordered logit model provides efficiency gains, when compared to the basic multinomial logit model. However, respondents may not all be able to give a reliable complete ranking of the alternatives they face. In order to deal with the ranking capability issue and avoid noisy rankings which may result in biased estimates, we designed the survey that we conducted in Corsica in a way that allows the respondents to state their actual ranking capability. We suggest that this appropriate survey design may provide the information necessary to assess further the ranking capability issue within the framework of a latent-class rank-ordered logit model. Using rankings given by a representative sample of the Corsican population (530 respondents), we compare estimates obtained using a simple benchmark rank-ordered logit model and 2-class rank-ordered logit model chosen according to the BIC and the CAIC information criteria. We find strong differences in the willingness-to-pay to reduce the environmental impacts of waste management in Corsica for the two classes of respondents, which can be related to the stated ranking capability.","[Beaumais, Olivier; Prunetti, Dominique; Casabianca, Anne; Pieri, Xavier] Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, F-20250 Corte, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Beaumais, O (通讯作者)，Univ Corsica Pasquale Paoli, CNRS, LISA, UMR 6240, Campus Mariani,BP 52, F-20250 Corte, France.",olivier.beaumais@hotmail.fr,,"Prunetti, Dominique/0000-0002-0385-3901",,,,,41,4,4,1,19,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

We develop our analysis under a default intensity model specified by a class of three-dimensional subordinators, allowing for default dependence through common risk factors. We performance a suitable decomposition of the bilateral price into debit and credit valuation adjustment components. Those components do not have a symmetric impact on the price because of the joint event occurrences. Our analysis indicates that simultaneous defaults have material impact on the size and directionality of the adjustments.

This study provides a new estimate of the coresidence effect by addressing non-random selection and heterogeneity in the treatment effect. Examination of Japanese data reveals: (i) an insignificant, negative average coresidence effect; (ii) a significant, negative coresidence effect on the treated; and (iii) that parents with unmet care needs and limited resources, typically widowed, disabled mothers, are most likely to suffer from a significant, negative coresidence effect. The results support the theory that coresidence may worsen elderly parents' health because care burdens on their adult children create disincentives for the parents to invest in longevity. The significant heterogeneity in the coresidence effect suggests potential scope for a better-targeted long-term care program. J. Japanese Int. Economies 35 (2015) 1-22.

It is therefore surprising that, in contrast to the wealth of studies on the sources of pro-cyclical policy, potential consequences of such seemingly suboptimal policies have been largely ignored in the existing literature. By utilising a comprehensive set of indicators from 114 countries for 1950-2010, we aim to address the following important question: does it matter whether a country adopts a pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance rather than a counter-cyclical one? Our results produce a resounding yes' to this question. We find that fiscally pro-cyclical countries have lower rates of economic growth, higher rates of output volatility and higher rates of inflation.","[McManus, Richard] Canterbury Christ Church Univ, Canterbury, Kent, England; [McManus, Richard; Ozkan, F.

We show that the social-welfare-maximizing monetary policy rule features a reaction to house price variations, when the latter are generated by housing demand or financial shocks. The sign and size of the reaction crucially depend on the degree of financial frictions in the economy. When the share of constrained agents is relatively small, the optimal reaction is negative, implying that the central bank must move the policy rate in the opposite direction with respect to house prices. However, when the economy is characterized by a sufficiently high average loan-to-value ratio, then it becomes optimal to counter house price increases by raising the policy rate.","[Notarpietro, Alessandro; Siviero, Stefano] Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Directorate, Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Notarpietro, A (通讯作者)，Banca Italia, Econ Outlook & Monetary Policy Directorate, Rome, Italy.",alessandro.notarpietro@bancaditalia.it; stefano.siviero@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,33,18,19,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

The model helps assessing the relative welfare effects under alternative environmental policies. We find that, when carbon spillover effects are absent, taxing energy resources as an input in energy production is preferable to taxing domestic energy production in terms of minimizing emissions.

The proposed model identifies the factors that need to be activated in the current context to transfer the theoretical importance of SME's in the truly complex world of an economy that desires to be prosperous. Then, the model was exposed to the test of the objective statistical and mathematical testing, starting from the results obtained from a survey of 536 entrepreneurs. The methodological approach makes use both of regression models, which use the relevant aspects from the survey, turned into quantitative or qualitative variables, and of the analysis of variance, with the aim of explaining the way in which the considered variables have managed to determine the economic growth, as well as of determining their importance and their influence. Finally, several conclusions have been outlined, regarding the economic policy measures that are needed and feasible in order to make the business environment in Romania more predictable and more friendly and, thus, to encourage entrepreneurship.","[Grigore, Ana-Maria] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania; [Dragan, Irina-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Grigore, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",anagrig27@gmail.com,"Dragan, Irina Maria/AAA-6838-2021; Dragan, Irina Maria/B-9540-2009; Dragan, Irina Maria/M-1083-2017","Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846; Dragan, Irina Maria/0000-0001-9349-1846;",,,,,25,15,16,0,24,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,FEB,2015,17.0,38,,,,,120,132,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352213800008,0

First, it illustrates that if the importance of sunk costs as well as the expected future returns from exporting are different, depending on whether the export decision refers to a core or a peripheral market, it is plausible that while firms will tend to stay on the core market for a long time, they will enter and exit the peripheral market much more frequently. Second, using firm-product-destination-specific export data for all firms in the Swedish food chain for the period 1997-2007, an empirical test is carried out to ascertain whether there is support for the hypothesis that trade duration will be longer for core markets. Employing two variables that capture different aspects of the core/periphery dimension, it is found that firms will indeed tend to stay longer in their core markets, while export decisions regarding peripheral markets are much less long-term. The conclusion, therefore, is that the empirical puzzle can be explained by taking into account the fact that the trade hysteresis literature builds on data on the core market decision to export or not, while the trade survival literature also includes data on decisions to stay in or exit peripheral markets.","[Gullstrand, Joakim; Persson, Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Persson, Maria] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden",Lund University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Gullstrand, J (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",joakim.gullstrand@nek.lu.se; maria.persson@nek.lu.se,,,,,,,43,27,30,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Our model is based on a synthesis variable of the entrepreneurial national character, which was developed by sequential application of principal component analysis, while the initial variables are from secondary sources with good conceptual representativeness. Depending on the objective relevance of the three model components (cultural, economic and administrative, and entrepreneurial education components), the achieved results confirm the importance of a favourable cultural and economic and administrative background for entrepreneurship development and they reiterate the inefficiency of isolated entrepreneurial education unless supported by good entrepreneurial culture or adequate economic and administrative infrastructure.

A more detailed analysis also shows that rural India benefits most from the intense political competition compared to urban India. We also found that if the same government rules a state for a relatively long period, it helps the state to achieve a higher HDI score.

Interestingly, the fundamentals of CSR are considered to be universal reflecting the globalisation of business and economies. The traditional ethos of maximising shareholder value without regard to other stakeholders is an outdated notion in today's global environment. CSR not only sits comfortably with the mantra of maximising shareholder value, sustainable CRS practices enhance shareholder value. In the case of the Czech Republic it is evident that to a large extent are being used CSR standards for transnational corporations that extend these principles to other national companies and organizations. The objective of the paper is to identify existing frameworks applicable for the assessment of CSR and then evaluate their application to the selected organizations and define their global impact. We indicate a possible future development of CSR frameworks (global and national) for evaluation and implementation of CSR concept and we uncover a summary of possibility using of CSR frameworks. We contribute to the debate for recognition of the global consequences of an organization to combine with CSR frameworks.","[Adamek, Pavel; Koehler, Pavlina; Stepankova, Petra; Marsalkova, Lenka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Adámek, P (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univerzitni 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",adamek@opf.slu.cz; haltofova@opf.slu.cz; O0130070@opf.slu.cz; O130062@opf.slu.cz,"Adámek, Pavel/AAD-2775-2021; Kohler, Philipp/AFH-8715-2022","Adámek, Pavel/0000-0001-5385-1958; Kohler, Philipp/0000-0003-0427-8934",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,13,21,,,,,,9,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300002,0

The empirical results suggest that the direct effect of official development aid in developing countries is mostly negative. This conclusion also holds when the sample is divided into different regions. All three estimation techniques used (i.e., Ordinary Least Squares, panel fixed effects and system Generalised Method of Moments) yield broadly similar results. We find that official development aid and government spending are complementary and hence, depending on the level of effectiveness of government spending programs, official development aid can have an indirect positive impact on income per capita. On the other hand, both remittances and foreign direct investment appear to have a direct positive and statistically significant effect on per capita income. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using the quarterly data for the period from Q1/1998 and Q2/2014 and its gap version, Okun's law is verified for each investigated country and some specifics of labour markets are highlighted so as to explain the magnitude of the estimated Okun's coefficients. The contribution of the paper is two-fold. First, this empirical relationship is confirmed in validity with attention directed to the foursome of countries. Second, the analysis utilizes the non-linear ARDL model proposed in the paper to accommodate possible nonlinearity and asymmetry in Okun's law. Asymmetry is found and economically reasoned by the specifics of the labour market only for Slovakia since there appears to be a different reaction of the unemployment gap to positive output gap and to negative one.","[Bod'a, Martin; Medved'ova, Petra; Povazanova, Mariana] Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, SK-97590 Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Bod'a, M (通讯作者)，Univ Mateja Bela Banskej Bystrici, Ekon Fak, Tajovskeho 10, SK-97590 Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",martin.boda@umb.sk; petra.medvedova@umb.sk; mariana.povazanova@umb.sk,"Boďa, Martin/J-3602-2016; Považanová, Mariana/HTQ-3172-2023; Medveďová, Petra/HKW-5154-2023","Boďa, Martin/0000-0002-7503-6898; Považanová, Mariana/0000-0003-1327-904X;",,,,,37,7,7,1,18,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

While considerable work has been done to gauge the degree of integration between the Canadian and U.S. economies through trade, relatively little analysis has parsed out the underlying costs of the border. The costs of crossing the border can be divided into formal tariff barriers, non-tariff barriers, and the cost of the transport system. This paper focuses on the latter by estimating the cost of shipping goods by truck between Canada and the U.S. during the 2004-2009 period. The incremental cost of import and export over domestic shipments is measured in both absolute and ad valorem terms. The latter provides an estimate of the border increment in transportation cost as a tariff equivalent. The incremental cost is further broken down into fixed and variable (line-haul) components. Higher fixed costs are consistent with border delays and border compliance costs being passed on to the consumers of trucking services. Higher line-haul costs may result from difficulties obtaining backhauls for a portion of the trip home, which may stem from trade imbalances and regulations that restrict the ability of Canadian-based carriers to transport goods between two points in the U.S. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We show that when regulatory intervention is perfect and costless, the volatility of the system can be substantially reduced with no loss of productivity. In fact, perfect credibility can actually reduce the volatility of intrinsically risky banking systems below the volatility of intrinsically less risky systems as banks anticipate intervention and mitigate their investment behaviour accordingly. However, when the credibility of the regime is weakened because of increased uncertainty stemming from regulation, such as random costs or imperfect timing of regulatory intervention, both the stability and productivity of the financial system are impaired. Importantly, we find that in the presence of regulatory costs and imperfect credibility, there is no universal optimal intervention policy rule. The optimal regulatory system depends on the regulator's level of absolute risk aversion. (C) 2014 The Authors.

I use children with migrant fathers as the main control group to separately identify the effects coming from remittances from those resulting from parental absence. Exploiting demand shocks as an exogenous source of variation in the probability that the mother migrates, I find suggestive evidence that children of migrant mothers are more likely to lag behind in school compared to children with migrant fathers. Controlling for remittances does not change this result, supporting the hypothesis that a mother's absence has a stronger detrimental effect than a father's.

Besides, research included the identification of the factors that determine this efficiency of farms. Financial support should motivate to increase the production capacity of farms, as it will significantly reduce the cost of capital. It can be verified by determi-nation of the technical performance indicators and economic indicators. The implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) instruments changed relationships between the factors of production. Subordination of Polish agricultural sector to the principles of the CAP, led many scientists to analyze the problem of affection of CAP instruments on achievement of objectives outlined in the Treaties of Rome. Author performed research of 78 large-scale farms (> 100 ha UAA) each year (panel data 2007-2011) and estimated technical efficiency indicators by using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The sample was divided into two groups: (1) farms with a dominance (60%) of crop production and (2) other farms (with a dominance of livestock or with the mixed production). Parametric method was supplemented to non-parametric approach. Then it was made an analysis of a set of determinants of technical efficiency by using panel models. The analysis of the results showed that the parametric approach was more resistant to the heterogeneity of the sample (its inhomogeneity) than the envelope data (DEA). Own research failed to establish a set of determinants of technical efficiency, which largely corresponds with those of other authors. The methods used here are the most popular ways of calculating technical efficiency. Due to the nature of the agricultural sector the superior properties of the SFA method was confirmed.","[Goral, Justyna] Natl Res Inst, Agr Finance Dept, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland",Institute of Agricultural & Food Economy,"Góral, J (通讯作者)，Natl Res Inst, Agr Finance Dept, Inst Agr & Food Econ, Swietokrzyska 20, PL-00002 Warsaw, Poland.",justyna.goral@ierigz.waw.pl,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,5,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,135,144,,,,,,10,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600014,0

With the new European service procurement directive, a number of changes are underway. Among these are less restrictive procedures for using the more flexible procurement forms like competitive dialogue. Based on a literature review and European statistics, this paper will 1) review the historical changes of European procurement rules, 2) quantify the application of competitive dialogue as procurement procedure, and 3) discuss lessons learned from selected European countries on promoting and managing change in construction through competitive dialogue. This paper will conclude that competitive dialogue seems to have a low potential as driver of innovation in a quantitative sense due to the stable but small number of applications, while the effects on innovation in a qualitative sense needs to be studied further.

In the OECD countries access to safe water supply and sanitation has largely been ensured through substantial investment over many decades. Yet, significant investments will still be required to rehabilitate the existing infrastructures, to bring them into conformity with more stringent environmental and health regulations, and to maintain service quality in the future. In the non-OECD countries the challenges are more daunting. Large parts of their population have no access and many suffer from unsatisfactory services. Nearly one billion people lack access to clean drinking water and 2.6 billion people lack access to improved sanitation services.

Knotworking refers to co-located 'knots' that are organized on a temporary basis to solve a specific task, a problem or an open question requiring multi-disciplinary expertise in a building project. The idea of knotworking was adopted and re-interpreted from elsewhere in a research and development program in the Finnish construction industry and experimented with in the early design of a school building. The aim of this study is to examine how the fragmentation of design and construction work could be reduced through knotworking in building projects. The methodology of the study is based on developmental and interventionist approaches in activity theory (Engestrom 2014; Miettinen et al. 2013), according to which the developmental processes are carefully followed, analyzed and documented. Complex problems such as waiting and decision-making motivated the practitioners to experiment with knotworking in the program. The experimentation required thorough prior preparation in the development of knotworking. The new knotworking concept, using the best existing technology, enabled the creation of 15-20 energy solutions and cost calculations for five architect scenarios in a two-day knotworking workshop. The method was further tested in three other cases during the program, and it was presented to relevant stakeholders at several events. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The aim of the article is to judge the usability of the data on preferential votes for candidates seeking mandates in municipality elections in the Czech Republic while studying the voting behaviour of the electorate. The thesis was created on the basis of the data on elections into local governments in 2010 and 2014, acquired thanks to the Czech Statistical Office (available at www.volby.cz). The exclusive set that we are working with consists of the small municipalities of district Ceske Budejovice (municipalities that have fewer than 500 voters). The data has been subject to an analysis using a simple statistical method and mutual comparison. The analysis of preferential votes to election parties in the small municipalities of the district Cesk Budejovice it appears that the displacement and deformation effects of the electoral system are not as significant as we could first expect. Analysis of preferential votes is a useful tool for understanding voting behavior. Based on the results of this analysis can be argued that the composition of councils small rural municipalities due to real interests of the electorate. Setting the choice of electoral system does not substantially influence political representatives.","[Kopriva, Radek; Kotaskova, Sylvie Kobzev] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Kopriva, R (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",kopriva@pef.czu.cz; kotaskova@pef.czu.cz,"Kobzev Kotaskova, Sylvie/A-5294-2017","Kobzev Kotaskova, Sylvie/0000-0001-9503-9335",,,,,17,0,0,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,224,231,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600024,0

Taking the path dependence effect into consideration, in our opinion, Europe has gone too far in its integration process to be able to continue with policies being fully under the competences of individual member countries. In addition, the establishment of the common currency in the EU as a result of deep harmonization in the monetary policy area is an unambiguous precedent with many consequences. Within this context, should fiscal policy be harmonized to a comparable level as monetary policy? We argue it should not. We employ the arguments from the theory of fiscal federalism, which recommends strengthening of stabilization function of the public finance; typically in form of rules and surveillance institutions (e.g., Fiscal Compact, the Six-Pack, European Semester). On the contrary, these authors usually refuse intensification of redistribution function also because of the fact that intergovernmental transfers in contemporary Europe are highly unpopular. Furthermore, Europe is still too heterogeneous as regards, in particular, informal institutions, different regimes of welfare state and different tax systems. For these reasons, a directed top-down harmonization and centralization path towards a full fiscal union is neither politically, nor economically rational. On the contrary, it is desirable to delimit moral hazard and free ride and strengthen joint responsibility in the area of public finances in nowadays EU.","[Kouba, Ludek; Madr, Michal; Rozmahel, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Nerudova, Danuse] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Kouba, L (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",kouba@mendelu.cz; xmadr@mendelu.cz; danuse.nerudova@mendelu.cz; rozi@mendelu.cz,"Mádr, Michal/V-4235-2018; Kouba, Ludek/E-9951-2013; Rozmahel, Petr/F-7898-2016; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012","Mádr, Michal/0000-0002-4031-531X; Kouba, Ludek/0000-0001-6171-8428;",,,,,44,2,2,3,12,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,404,413,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000045,0

The operations strategies of construction firms are poorly described as they receive less attention than those of project management, although operations strategies (and operations management) are important actions and processes on the permanent firm level. Within many construction contractors, there is a gap between the tactical and operational levels which, for example, is resulting in business strategies being poorly executed on the project level. In this paper, the operations strategies of construction contractors are compared with those reported in business school literature in terms of the prioritisation of decision categories. The findings based on the semi-structured interviews with the tactical level managers inside the three construction contractors clearly indicate that the priorities when forming an operations strategy in construction differ from patterns commonly specified in business school literature. It is initially recommended that construction contractors should plan their operations strategies with a focus on organisation, quality, human resources and planning. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In addition to a literature review and a documentation study, 13 semi-structured interviews were carried out according to a qualitative approach. Four of these were general in nature (with clients) and nine case-specific (with client, contractor and user representatives). Based on the results, a description of ethical challenges in commissioning in construction is established. The findings indicate that a commissioning process poses significant challenges in light of hidden agendas and power play among actors. Clients and contractors tend to be systematically suspicious of one another. Major costs in play reinforce this.

This is all the more since during the past decade the principles of modern education promoted by the Bologna school have become mandatory; one of its essential features is the acceleration of the informational accumulation processes, specific to the engineering education; accordingly, school governance should be readapted to the new requirements of the engineering education. This paper presents a study on the identification of possible ways to support higher education in engineering by the high-school education in Romania. The qualitative analysis led to the prioritization of results based on the consideration of the common areas of interest of high-school and university education. The results of investigations carried out, lead us to claim that school governance can support higher education, particularly in engineering, with well-trained candidates, and furthermore that school governance is perhaps the most important factor in increasing the effectiveness, efficiency, quality and relevance of school education in Romania.

In order to reduce the vulnerability degree of SMEs, we consider that measures are needed with regard to improving the collection of taxes, measures concerning the modernization of the tax system and measures for relaxation and fiscal stimulation. Strengthening taxes in Romanian tax system should represent the main concern of the authorities in order to ensure predictability of any business and of economy as a whole. If things are simple and focused on income size (how much income is obtained) and not on its way to obtain (how to obtain income), it will increase the firms voluntary compliance.

We used data for the Czech public HEIs from 2013 and determined the following variables: the academic staff and other costs as inputs and the bachelor and master's graduates and students, PhD graduates and students as outputs. We run two analyses. The first analysis compared all HEIs with each other and showed that we have to consider the specification of the HEIs. The second analysis divided HEIs into three groups with similar cost coefficients and showed that dividing HEIs into groups helped us to eliminate the high differences in inputs and in outputs and therefore we got better information about the efficiency of HEIs.

A principles-based, stakeholder-driven approach to governance-implementing governance guidelines in accordance with the apply or explain principle has a stronger chance of success than a heavy legislative approach. From this point of view, it is positive that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has improved its Corporate Governance Principles for Banks.

All presented papers point out the presence of accounting conservatism in varying degrees, none of them mentioning its lack. Most often, the topics approached in the accounting conservatism research haven't been exhausted in a single paper, but have been transmitted over years from author to author and from paper to paper. Sometimes, researchers have followed paths which although have proved viable in their study, they haven't been validated by economic reality, a fact signaled by those who subsequently have resumed the respective topics. In our review we presented papers regarding definition and measures of accounting conservatism, conditional and unconditional conservatism, alternative explanations for conservatism and accounting conservatism in varied legal settings.

Among job creation policies, there is some evidence that well-designed hiring credits or steep wage subsidies can increase the number of jobs, and business-friendly tax policies may spur job growth although also increasing income inequality. Evidence on enterprise zones generally does not establish job creation effects. The earned income tax credit successfully raises income from work, whereas a higher minimum wage entails some job loss and does not do a good job at delivering benefits to poor families.","[Neumark, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] Univ Calif Irvine, Ctr Econ & Publ Policy, Irvine, CA USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of California System; University of California Irvine; University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,1,1,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN,LONDON,"4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, LONDON, ENGLAND",,,978-1-137-53017-2; 978-1-137-53016-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,15,31,,,,,,17,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BQ5BN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000598368600001,0

The market-based financial system characterising the USA and the Commonwealth countries is larger, more liquid and more capitalized stock market than the bank-based financial systems which are prevalent in continental, central and south-eastern Europe. This research examines the existing literature on the relationship between private consumption, housing wealth, stock market wealth and income comparing different methods that were used by different authors in order to illustrate this relationship.

There is a widespread view that these companies are very fallible. New businesses do not have a history that demonstrates, indirectly, their ability to meet the expectations of customers and stakeholders (investors, lenders, strategic partners, suppliers, dealers). Therefore, the main cause of the fragility of the new businesses is the lack of a reputation. This is the weakness that unites the newly established firms, distinguishing them from those who have already passed the first stage of life. This lack of reputation hinders the acquisition of human resources, financial and technical they need to survive. Therefore, these young firms must quickly gain customers and stakeholders confidence.

In order to observe these factors, 200 students, specifically students who enrolled in accounting field from few of the private universities in Malaysia were surveyed. The data collection is tested using IBM SPSS Statistics software. The research findings showed that three factors, which are starting salary, employer reputation and working environment, have significant relationship with job selection preferences while gender variable are not significantly related to the dependent variable. The findings of this study has implication on the employers and educators by providing guidance to them of what a fresh graduate prefers when selecting job or career. Besides, the findings will assist universities to have better knowledge about career preferences to come out with curriculum for the accounting program which can boost accounting students to choose accountant as their profession.

Communication is the most visible and audible component of the marketing mix, which used wisely, may bring many advantages. Further, organizations include descriptive elements in their communication messages such as the nature of their activities, the benefits consumers would have and other elements which help consumers tangibilize the services provided. Many businesses moved from the offline environment to the online, becoming more consumer oriented. For an organization to both succeed and survive, it is essential to find the balance, the ideal mix between the services it offers in the real world and its online communications. For example, in health care services consumers are hooked by traditional communication tools, experience the service and afterwards use the internet to deliver indirect feedback on their lived experiences.

The bi-dimensional model of IPA is used for measuring the importance and the output of individual variables that have an influence on service evaluation. This analysis helps identify the prior or less important service attributes and also determine the critical areas that require more attention. The paper demonstrates the practical application of IPA for TIC in the Czech Republic. The input data were gained by means of field research that used a quantitative questionnaire survey. Graphically processed results show rather a positive situation when the most of important quality factors are found in the quadrant of optimal situation, i.e. the items characterized by high importance as well as high output. The highest importance was assigned to the item of helpful/obliging approach to a customer and the highest output to the overall impression of IC.

This paper describes a new survey method to collect longitudinal data, called the life course calendar. We discuss the need for and the uses of this instrument with reference to specific case study material and explore to what extent the life course calendar is suitable for the study of individual life courses and travel behaviour. In the first part of this article we give an overview of current research on the causal relationships between certain life events and travel behaviour. Based on the outcomes of the literature review we analyse life course calendars of 646 respondents. Considering the explorative character of our case study material the results are quite promising. Most notably information on car purchases, on relocations, and changes of the work place has been well recorded which indicates that the life course calendar is suited for the study of changes of spatial contexts and accessibility. The data analysis has provided initial results on the distribution of key events over the life course and on the relation of such events to changes in travel behaviour. Significant effects were found for key events such as relocation, change of job, birth of first child, separation/divorce, moving in with partner and retirement. The life course calendar can be advantageous, especially if it is employed to supplement extensive panel studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using 12 different Dow Jones indexes that cover 16 years of daily data, we compare the time-varying non-linear predictability patterns of conventional market indexes and their Islamic counterparts at country and continent level by using permutation entropy. Accordingly, we find that all indexes in our analysis have different degrees of time-varying predictability and all conventional markets are found to be more efficient compared to their Islamic counterparts. However, in some of the cases, this difference in efficiency is almost indistinguishable. Our findings reveal that compared to their conventional counterparts, Islamic markets do not necessarily need to carry a more deterministic or predictable structure since efficiency in these markets depends mostly on liquidity, market quality, institutional characteristics and the country/continent specific investment behavior.

It is expected that companies (banks) in Eastern Europe will more often estimate fair values by using valuation techniques (i.e. mark-to-model) than companies (banks) in market developed countries, due to lack of market data. This gives opportunity to managers to manipulate with estimation values and therefore could lead to lower quality of reported earnings. Six earnings quality approximations are examined: persistence, predictability, smoothness, accruals quality, value relevance and conservatism. Furthermore, an aggregate earnings quality measure is formed based on six earnings attributes. Exposure to fair value accounting is measured by income statement approach. First, for both banks and companies in the selected sample, two alternative measures of reported income are compared: net income and comprehensive income, because other comprehensive income consists mainly of fair value adjustments. Second, reported net gains (losses) on assets at fair value through income statement are used to capture the extent to which fair values are used in banks' income statements. Preliminary empirical findings suggest that both firms and banks with increased exposure to fair value accounting in financial reporting have lower level of aggregate earnings quality.

In this field, there exists a long-term disharmony between a rate of economic growth that is measured by the outputs and a rate of GDP growth and life quality and life conditions of citizens that are measured by different indices. There exist many factors that influence the objective life quality. The fundamental life conditions that may be compared are for instance availability of health care services and education, average wages, quality of natural environment, etc. The use of some indicators is often connected with methodological issues, such as in case of a corruption rate, setting of a legal system, functioning of democratic principles in a country, etc. In the social science, there prevails an opinion that a level of GDP is not automatically reflected into daily lives of people or that a rise of GDP is not linearly connected with a rise of a living standard and a better life of individuals. This article reflects on these aspects. The theoretical part presents a description of the most well-know indices that are used to evaluate life quality at the macro-regional level. The analytical part focuses on quantification of life quality by means of a composite index of a human development (Human Development Index), which is annually published in Human Development Report within the United Nations Development Programme(UNDP) since 1990. There was evaluated a development of values of the HDI index in Slovakia over the last ten years and compared with a development in the countries of the EU on the basis of available data. The conclusion of the paper is devoted to a specification of methodological issues that are related to the HDI index application. These issues are partially eliminated by a complementary use of other indices to assess an objective life quality, which are recommended by the OSN initiatives that will conclude a complex of solved issues in the article.

This paper will look at a construction project in Norway - considering evaluation of the project in connection with learning and knowledge sharing. In this regard, the paper describes different approaches to evaluation and learning, and proposes a model. The model distinguishes between an internal and external perspective when it comes to evaluation of projects, and between a structured and an informal perspective when it comes to learning. With the focus on this model, the paper also presents enablers and barriers of learning and knowledge sharing. The model provides a structured illustration of the connection between project evaluation and learning. And thus, the model would be useful for, for instance, determining and applying learning mechanisms for both internal and external evaluation of projects. Based on our model, traditional project evaluations can be categorized as external-structured. This type of evaluations appears to not necessarily be an important tool for learning. Internal structured approaches, such as an experience report, have been in high demand. We found that external informal learning was of importance. One example was when consultants shared experiences in their home organization. This paper is based on qualitative case study approach. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.

First, we involve the Sortino ratio. Secondly we propose an alternative method to the Sortino ratio for calculating the risk adjusted return using a multipliers method to determine a global measure of risk. The Sortino ratio is used to score a portfolio's risk-adjusted returns relative to an investment target using downside risk and it measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment asset, portfolio or strategy. Our proposed alternative method is using the same logic and frame structure as Sortino ratio. However instead of downside risk we use the global risk calculated using multipliers. This is due to the fact that Sortino ratio does not distinguish between sub-cases possible - unrealized return area and loss area (negative return). Because of these we believe that it would be necessary a new method which to refine the results and take and into account the three areas. Our dataset includes 5 emerging markets: Romania (BET), Hungary(BUX), Czech Republic(PX), Bulgaria(SOFIX) and Poland(WIG). For each of them we estimate the Sortino ratio of length windows 7, 14, 42 and 10, 21, 60. We used two variants for each target return, namely 2% and 5%. We consider Germany as a benchmark. After estimating the Sortino ratio and global risk calculated using multipliers method, we conducted a parallel analysis between Sortino ratio and the proposed alternative method. We split the analysis time span in two sub-periods, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013. As known, the higher the Sortino ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-adjusted return is influenced by the used target return and the used window. Analyzed data reveals that in case of Sortino ratio, Hungary has the best results and on the other side, Bulgaria has the worst results - regardless the window size or target return. In case of the alternative method, the best results are obtained on Hungary capital market and the worst results on Bulgaria and Poland capital market. Also, the analysis performed on the two sub-periods, 2008-2010 and 2011-2013, highlights the fact that Central and Eastern Europe emerging markets have experienced the crisis of 2008 with a delay.

In particular, it aims to examine whether companies with higher level of IC are more likely to place importance on more contemporary management accounting (MA) approaches. The premise of fit as mediation of contingency theory is borrowed to explore the potential association between the level of IC and the use of specific MA perspectives in terms of performance measurement and budgetary control techniques. This model brings more useful insight in linking IC to MAPs and those techniques which tend towards strategic-oriented approaches within Iranian context, thereby suggesting that some evolution in MAPs stems from focusing too intently on IC and intangibles. The Iranian public listed companies from Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) are selected as the ideal setting to examine the relationship between IC and MAPs since most of them are medium to large-sized companies that plausibly enjoy greater resource available for investment in knowledge-based resources and also actively engaged in more innovative and strategic MAPs. This study provides insights into the way practitioners and organizations adopt appropriate MA approaches, to be aligned with the level of IC in a company, with the ultimate purpose of taking full advantage of those knowledge related resources.

As the 2008 global financial crisis turned to sovereign debt crisis in the EU, the vulnerable economies of the SEE periphery became recipients of IMF loans (granted to a total of sixteen European countries) to tackle the impact of the downturn. In the Balkan region, Greece - a member of the Eurozone - has been receiving financial support from the IMF/EC/ECB troika since May 2010; Serbia and Romania have also borrowed from the IMF; while Bulgaria, also as vulnerable but poorer than Romania, postponed such a deal due to its smaller budget deficit. The loans - either by the IMF or in collaboration with European institutions - were granted under conditional terms of austerity and structural adjustment policies, which imposed public expenditures cuts, anti-protectionism reforms, more labor market flexibilization and national assets' privatization. Those conditional policies of restructuring towards liberalization 'promised' more FDI-favorable conditions, higher employability and thus, growth. However, the suppression of welfare and social security expenditures, the reduction of public and private sector wages, and the promoted labor market reforms have so far deepened recession, accentuated unemployment and decreased social and living standards in all loan-recipient countries. The anticipated recovery from the crisis appears to be uneven and underlines the fragility of the EU. In this context, there is growing concern for the effectiveness of the implemented structural reforms, especially in the vulnerable SEE periphery of Europe. We focus on the Balkan EU-member states of Greece, Romania and Bulgaria, to explore the effect of the memoranda-imposed labor market re/deregulation on their economies. We find that despite the different characteristics of the crisis in these countries, high unemployment is persisting, employment precariousness and risk of in-work poverty is increasing, and their capacity for economic recovery is deteriorating.

Analyzing the ED presentations during the last few years we have observed a constant increasing of presentation numbers. For each ED it is a challenge to decrease the patients' waiting time, to provide timely care and to improve the patient's satisfaction. Long waiting times is the most important complaint in patient's satisfaction surveys. We have evaluated 2195 questionnaires for a period of three years (2010-2012). The general satisfaction rate is 84, 63% and the most frequent complaints are about the waiting time which is too long, the waiting room which is small and the personnel which is insufficient. To manage these situations in a proper way we proposed, for our analysis, to use queuing models which can provide reasonably accurate evaluations of our system's performance. The data used in the case study includes detailed information's over the period January 1 - December 31, 2012, when totally 51.458 patients were registered. The results of this study can help us to understand the magnitude of the broader problem, the relationship between resources and waiting times, and to provide a method for understanding and monitoring performance, to find solutions for a better understanding and for alleviating the daily crisis.

The social-democratic pension regime originally relied on universal pensions; however, it currently accentuates a combination of universal social insurance and generally conceived solidary pillars. Simple rationalization of the Czech public pensions may be carried out by dividing today's first pillar into two conceptual pillars. The Czech private pension saving is significantly different from standard third pillars, as it features high number of participants, great diversity of the terms for the providers and even of the fiscal incentives. With regard to a potential reform, it is mainly useful to consider the liberal and social-democratic approach, based on the elimination of fiscal incentives, up to a transition to the Swedish premium pension.","[Vostatek, Jaroslav] Univ Finance & Adm, Ctr Econ Studies & Anal, Estonska 500, Prague 10, Czech Republic",,"Vostatek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Ctr Econ Studies & Anal, Estonska 500, Prague 10, Czech Republic.",jaroslav.vostatek@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,1,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,284,289,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500049,0

Marginalized groups overwhelmingly report a lack of confidence that police will apply the law fairly. Although sex work research reports a wide range of negative experiences with the police, it is not known how common these experiences are because most research focuses solely on street-based sex workers and does not include quantitative measures. We report on confidence in the police through the analysis of relevant data gathered from in-person interviews with sex workers from six census metropolitan areas of Canada. Under the pre-2014 legal regime, our non-random sample of sex workers had lower confidence in police than estimated for other Canadians by the General Social Survey and were particularly unlikely to see police as treating sex workers fairly. Thematic analysis suggests this is primarily driven by stigma and discrimination. We also found a significant minority who reported the police to be a source of aid, suggesting that appropriate policy and program regimes could be developed to improve sex worker police relations.","[Benoit, Cecilia; Smith, Michaela; Jansson, Mikael; Magnus, Samantha; Ouellet, Nadia; Casey, Lauren; Phillips, Rachel; Reist, Dan] Univ Victoria, Ctr Addict Res BC, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Benoit, Cecilia; Atchison, Chris] Univ Victoria, Dept Sociol, Victoria, BC, Canada; [Reimer, Bill; Shaver, Frances M.] Concordia Univ, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, Montreal, PQ, Canada",University of Victoria; University of Victoria; Concordia University - Canada,"Benoit, C (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Ctr Addict Res BC, Victoria, BC, Canada.;Benoit, C (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Sociol, Victoria, BC, Canada.",,"Jansson, Mikael/E-6092-2019; Benoit, Cecilia/JVO-6214-2024","Atchison, Chris/0000-0001-9616-4509",Canadian Institutes of Health Research,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),"This research was funded by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

If arbitrageurs find it more difficult to correct the mispricing of stocks with high idiosyncratic risk, there should be a positive (negative) relation between expected return and idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. We combine several well-known anomalies to measure stock mispricing and proxy stock idiosyncratic risk using an exponential GARCH model for stock returns. We confirm that average stock returns monotonically increase (decrease) with idiosyncratic risk for undervalued (overvalued) stocks. Overall, our results support the importance of idiosyncratic risk as an arbitrage cost. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a longitudinal analysis of this question by exploiting rich variation across firms in the timing of federal contracting to identify affirmative action effects over the course of three decades spanning 1973 to 2003. It constitutes the first study to comprehensively document the long-term and dynamic effects of affirmative action in federal contracting on employment composition within firms in the United States. I use a new panel of over 100,000 large private-sector firms from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, including both firms that obtain federal contracts and are therefore mandated to implement affirmative action and firms that are noncontractors, across all industries and regions. The paper's key results indicate that the primary beneficiaries of affirmative action in federal contracting over 1973 to 2003 were black and Native American women and men. Dynamic event study analysis of workforce composition around the time of contracting reveals that a large part of the effect of affirmative action on increasing protected group shares occurred within the first four years of gaining a contract, and that these increased shares persisted even after a firm was no longer a federal contractor. The paper also uncovers important results on how the impact of affirmative action evolved over 1973 to 2003, in particular that the fastest growth in the employment shares of minorities and women at federal contractors relative to noncontracting firms occurred during the 1970s and early 1980s, decelerating substantially in ensuing years.

J,"Warburton, E",,,,"Warburton, Eve",,,Jokowi and the New Developmentalism,BULLETIN OF INDONESIAN ECONOMIC STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,politics; developmentalism; political parties; cabinet; presidency,,"Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo (Jokowi), made a remarkable political recovery in 2016. During his first year in office, Jokowi had been overwhelmed by a combative and divided parliament, disunity in cabinet, tensions with his own party, and declining approval ratings. In 2016, however, Jokowi expanded his ruling coalition and consolidated his power, and his approval rating rose to almost 70%. By mid-2016, the president had achieved stable government for the first time since winning office. Political stability gave us greater clarity on Jokowi's agenda and the kind of Indonesia he wants to shape. I suggest that in 2016 a Jokowi-styled new developmentalism began to emerge. Jokowi's administration focused narrowly on infrastructure and deregulation; other problems of government were subordinated to these developmentalist goals. There are uncanny echoes of the past in the new developmentalism, and its conservative and nationalist features reflect political trends that pre-date Jokowi's presidency. Indeed, Jokowi's developmental strategy is neither unique nor coherent; his decision-making is defined by ad hocery. Instead, I argue, deeper structural features of Indonesia's socio-political landscape are making their mark on the president and returning Indonesia to its developmentalist moorings. Presiden Indonesia Joko Widodo (Jokowi) melakukan pemulihan politis yang signifikan pada 2016. Dalam tahun pertamanya menjadi presiden, Jokowi disibukkan oleh persoalan-persoalan yang muncul dari badan legislatif yang agresif dan terpecah, kabinet yang tidak bersatu, tekanan dengan partainya sendiri, serta dukungan publik yang menurun. Namun demikian, pada 2016, Jokowi memperlebar koalisi partai berkuasa dan berhasil mengkonsolidasikan kekuatannya - dukungan publik naik menjadi hampir 70%. Pada pertengahan 2016, presiden Jokowi telah berhasil menciptakan pemerintahan yang stabil untuk pertama kalinya sejak resmi berkuasa. Stabilitas politis memberikan gambaran yang lebih jelas akan agenda Jokowi dan bentuk Indonesia seperti apa yang ingin dicapainya. Penulis melihat bahwa di tahun 2016, model pembangunan baru (new developmentalism) a la Jokowi mulai muncul. Pemerintahan Jokowi berfokus pada infrastruktur dan deregulasi; dan persoalan-persoalan pemerintahan yang lain diletakkan di bawah kedua tujuan pembangunan ini. Terdapat nuansa masa lampau dalam pola developmentalis Jokowi ini, sementara ciri konservatis dan nasionalis-nya mencerminkan tren politis yang sudah ada sebelum kepemimpinan Jokowi. Sesungguhnya strategi pembangunan Jokowi tidak unik dan tidak koheren; serta pengambilan keputusannya lebih bersifat ad hoc. Meski demikian, penulis berpendapat bahwa ciri struktural yang lebih dalam dari situasi sosial-politis Indonesia telah menandai masa kepresidenan Jokowi dan mengembalikan Indonesia kepada gaya developmentalisnya.","[Warburton, Eve] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Warburton, E (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,"Warburton, Eve/0000-0001-7922-2404",,,,,40,96,103,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Long tenure is generally associated with poor performance and high discounts. Our findings suggest substantial managerial power in capturing CEF rents.

This approach is able to consider simultaneously different factors affecting the firms' solvency level. The results obtained in terms of classification into homogeneous rating classes, scoring and migration probabilities show that the proposed approach is able to unveil early signal of recession in the Italian SMEs sector. Furthermore, some comparisons between our approach and a couple of known methodologies for creditworthiness assessment show the goodness of our method. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In particular, we model the interaction between the LIBOR-OIS spread, euro fixed float OIS swap rate and the three-month US-German bond spread and discover strong evidence of structural innovations affecting the interbank market. We find that when the short-term interbank market is affected by a liquidity shock, the LIBOR-OIS spread is a leader in moving back to equilibrium, while the euro-dollar currency swap rate and the US-German bond spreads are followers. Moreover, we find long-run cointegrating relationships and bi-directional causality between the spreads. However, structural breaks identified as prospective financial crises affect the long-run relationships and liquidity shocks drive interbank rates and spread fluctuations. Therefore, liquidity shocks propagating within the interbank market can forecast benchmark interest movements, and ultimately this has significant implications for policy-makers and market players alike.

In contrast to the existing literature, we formally model an airport's non-aeronautical services by taking into account the endogenous determination of the size of the airport's non-aeronautical services. First, we characterize the results for welfare maximization, and find that the self-financing property does not hold. Apart from carriers' market power as a source of the failure for the self-financing property, we identify the presence of non-aeronautical services as a new source. Further, we show that the common practice of cross-subsidizing from the non-aeronautical to aeronautical services is incompatible with welfare maximization because welfare maximization requires exact self-financing within the non-aeronautical sector. Second, we derive the results for profit maximization by a monopolistic airport, and demonstrate that the imposition of two taxes, one on the airport's aeronautical services and the other on its capacity investment can recover the welfare-maximization results. Third, we analyze the two types of regulation, single till and dual till, which are often used in practice, and show that dual-till regulation yields higher welfare than single-till regulation, as long as the profit from non-aeronautical services is positive. This result is in contrast to the prevailing wisdom in the literature, which in general favors single-till regulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we argue that the use of incomplete retrospective information on household composition may lead to substantial downward biases in the estimates of the grandfather's effect. To illustrate our argument, we study the effects of the introduction of a non-contributory universal pension scheme on infant mortality in Nepal. We use cross-sectional data from the 1996 and 2001 Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys and implement a flexible difference-in-differences approach using as treatment indicator the presence in the household of an elderly person eligible for the pension benefits. Our results confirm the importance of the income of the elderly for infant welfare. In households that include an eligible elderly person, the pension scheme resulted in survival benefits of approximately 7-8 percentage points 12 months after birth from a baseline probability of approximately 89%. Importantly, these results do not depend on the gender of the elderly person. Moreover, we show that ignoring the lack of retrospective information on household composition leads to underestimates of the true effects when the elderly person is a male. These results are qualitatively similar across alternative definitions of the control group and do not depend on the gender of the infant. In addition, we explore potential channels through which these survival benefits are produced, and our results suggest that the pension scheme benefited infants only after their birth and mostly during the first month of life.

Emergent countries, such as China and Russia, recorded not only an increase in the number of tourists but also in the revenues from tourism activities. One of the reasons is the opening of these countries frontiers in order to reaffirm their power on international level (Golubchikov, 2016). Besides the relaxation, business and religious tourism, the sport tourism becomes more and more important. It also comprises the tourism for mega sport events, such as the Summer and Winter Olympics or the World Championships in different sports. For the organising countries, there is a real challenge to ensure the investments for the infrastructure, although it supports their economic development, being used after the sport events conclusion. Considering the available data from the World Bank and the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the authors make a quantitative investigation regarding the impact of the mega sport events on the tourism phenomenon in the BRICS countries. The article also researches a small and specific group of countries (BRICS), considering a niche tourism phenomenon. The article aims to emphasize the role of the mega sport events in the BRICS countries, directly connected with their capacity to economically support the organization of these events and also with the desire to internationally promote their national values.","[Pop, Iuliana; Kanovici, Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Ghic, Gratiela] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Bucharest, Romania; [Andrei, Madalina] Spiru Haret Univ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Spiru Haret University,"Pop, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",ipop2008@gmail.com,"Kanovici, Adrian Lucian/AAG-9485-2021; Andrei, Madalina/AAB-3007-2021; Pop, Iuliana/ABH-1317-2021; Pop, Iuliana/ABG-5136-2021","Pop, Iuliana/0000-0002-9853-6748; Pop, Iuliana/0000-0002-9853-6748",,,,,61,8,8,0,49,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,960,975,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700017,0

It analyses the asymmetries in the variation of the rate of GDP growth of these fifteen countries and estimates endogenously a threshold of growth from which the political instabilities or war enhance two levels of impact on GDP growth. In this paper, we show that the economies of the fifteen countries go quickly from recession regime to growth regime and that the threshold of growth is seen to be high. This phenomenon concerns Lebanon specially that records also a certain resilience since its GDP evolution, which is very erratic notably during the civil war of 1975-1990, returns towards its long-run value rapidly after an exogenous shock.","[Verne, Jean.

We extend the conventional spatial voting model to incorporate identity issues. Identity is tied to the race, language, religion or culture of the voters and both voters and political parties may belong to different identity groups. By identity voting we show that voters, who are otherwise centrist, move toward the parties that align with their identities. To illustrate the mechanics of identity voting, we provide an empirical analysis of parliamentary elections to the Basque Autonomous Community. Besides the two positional issues in the region-left-right ideology and nationalism-we show that language and Basque sentiment have significant effects on voting. Our analysis suggests that identity voting polarizes voters and can sustain stable multi-party systems. This finding is of immediate importance to other regions and countries where the electorate is divided by strong ties to different religions, languages or cultures.","[Ansolabehere, Stephen] Harvard Univ, Dept Govt, 1737 Cambridge St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Socorro Puy, M.] Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Harvard University; Universidad de Malaga,"Puy, MS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",sda@gov.harvard.edu; mps@uma.es,"Puy, M.

We first examine the impact of economic policy uncertainty on aggregate bank credit growth. Then we analyze commercial bank entity level data to gauge the effects of policy uncertainty on financial intermediaries' lending. We exploit the cross-sectional heterogeneity to back out indirect evidence of its effects on businesses and households. We ask (i) whether, conditional on standard macroeconomic controls, economic policy uncertainty affected bank level credit growth, and (ii) whether there is variation in the impact related to banks' balance sheet conditions; that is, whether the effects are attributable to loan demand or, if impact varies with bank level financial constraints, loan supply. We find that policy uncertainty has a significant negative effect on bank credit growth. Since this impact varies meaningfully with some bank characteristics-particularly the overall capital-to-assets ratio and bank asset liquidity-loan supply factors at least partially (and significantly) help determine the influence of policy uncertainty. Because other studies have found important macroeconomic effects of bank lending growth on the macroeconomy, our findings are consistent with the possibility that high economic policy uncertainty may have slowed the U.S. economic recovery from the Great Recession by restraining overall credit growth through the bank lending channel.

In this paper, we examine the impact of these laws on the types of mortgages originated. The empirical identification is based on state-level variations in foreclosure and bankruptcy laws and a border estimation strategy. We find that higher-risk loans (FHA and subprime loans) are more likely to be originated in states with lender-friendly foreclosure laws. Also, higher-risk loans are less likely to be originated in states with a more generous bankruptcy homestead exemption. In addition, our results are consistent with the idea that FHA and subprime loans share a similar clientele and are close substitutes. These results are robust without the ordering assumption among conventional prime, FHA, and subprime loans.","[Cao, Qianqian] UnionPay Int Co Ltd, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China; [Liu, Shimeng] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Jinan University,"Cao, QQ (通讯作者)，UnionPay Int Co Ltd, Shanghai 200120, Peoples R China.",caoqq6@gmail.com; shimengliu.econ@gmail.com,"Cao, Qianqian/IAQ-5629-2023",,,,,,25,4,7,0,5,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

Based on two different business conceptions, during each period an agrarian elite led the revolutionary' process, offering a technological response as the means of guaranteeing agriculture's survival' after various crises. For each period, we can identify a correspondence between the status given to technology, the conception of business and the type of government regulation. This paper analyses how the proposition of a technological revolution' corresponds to the construction of the ideological leadership through which the agrarian bourgeoisie managed to orientate agrarian development.","[Gras, Carla] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ave 25 Mayo 1021, RA-1650 San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Gras, Carla] Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, Ave 25 Mayo 1021, RA-1650 San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Hernandez, Valeria] Inst Rech & Dev, Paris 13, France; [Hernandez, Valeria] 8 Rue Albert Einstein, Paris 13, France",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Gras, C (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, Ave 25 Mayo 1021, RA-1650 San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina.;Gras, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl San Martin UNSAM, Ave 25 Mayo 1021, RA-1650 San Martin, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",carlagras@arnet.com.ar; valeria.hernandez@ird.fr,,,,,,,32,17,23,1,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

Thanks to the experimental design, changes of an individual's decision can be attributed to the content of the team partner's message. The results for knowledge-related and strategic problems show that individuals' decisions change upon receiving more informative and sophisticated arguments and remain the same otherwise.

This paper examines the associations between the intensity and performance of knowledge exchange activities undertaken in UK universities with non-academic actors. Drawing on data concerning the structural factors of interactions of universities in the UK with external partners, the paper sheds further light on the nature of these activities through a prism of competitive and uncompetitive regions in order to better understand how universities may be able to leverage both their knowledge and partnerships more effectively as competitive assets. On the one hand, it is found that academics in uncompetitive regions are more intensively engaged in entrepreneurial activities but generate less income from them than their counterparts in competitive regions, suggesting that there are differences in the income-generating capacity of academics across regions. On the other hand, academic knowledge is found to be more strongly bounded within a certain distance in uncompetitive regions whilst geographical distance seems less of a hindrance to academics in competitive regions.","[Zhang, Qiantao] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Dublin 2, Ireland; [MacKenzie, Niall G.] Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland; [Jones-Evans, Dylan] Univ West England, Bristol Business Sch, Frenchay Campus,Coldharbour Lane, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Glamorgan Bldg,King Edward VII Ave, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales",Trinity College Dublin; University of Strathclyde; University of West England; Cardiff University,"MacKenzie, NG (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Strathclyde Business Sch, Hunter Ctr Entrepreneurship, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",qizhang@tcd.ie; niall.mackenzie@strath.ac.uk; Dylan.Jones-Evans@uwe.ac.uk; HugginsR@cardiff.ac.uk,"Zhang, Qiantao/H-3206-2018; Zhang, Qiantao/L-4270-2019","Zhang, Qiantao/0000-0003-4450-5775; MacKenzie, Niall/0000-0003-3769-7086","National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts (Nesta)","National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts (Nesta)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC))","The authors are grateful to the National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts (Nesta) for partly funding the research upon which this article is based.",,105,33,38,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We use a proprietary data set that has the investments of banks at the security level for 2005-2012 in conjunction with the credit register from Germany. We find that-during the crisis-banks with higher trading expertise (trading banks) increase their investments in securities, especially in those that had a larger price drop, with the strongest impact in low-rated and long-term securities. Moreover, trading banks reduce their credit supply, and the credit crunch is binding at the firm level. All of the effects are more pronounced for trading banks with higher capital levels. Finally, banks use central bank liquidity and government subsidies like public recapitalization and implicit guarantees mainly to support trading of securities.

This study examines this question in a unique setting: local school districts where the policy outcome, property taxes, has unusually high visibility and salience. We exploit the sharp discontinuity created by the annual majority-rule school-budget elections in New Jersey's school districts. Using panel data from over 3,600 district-by-year elections, we find that local politicians are responsive to a modest change in support for a budget (around the 50 percent threshold) resulting in a reduction in contemporaneous property taxes (by $180 per pupil or 1.7 percent) as well as the proposed tax bill for the following year. However, these tax reductions do not generally persist because budget rejections also trigger subsequent increases in both voter turnout and support for school spending, suggesting the stability of Tiebout equilibria.","[Barr, Andrew C.] Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Dee, Thomas S.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Educ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Dee, Thomas S.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Stanford University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Barr, AC (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",abarr@tamu.edu; tdee@stanford.edu,,"Dee, Thomas/0000-0001-7524-768X",,,,,37,0,3,0,11,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Empirical Evidence on Ghana Based on National Survey,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,fuels; cooking; households; development; energy poverty; Ghana,INDOOR AIR-POLLUTION; BIOMASS COMBUSTION; ENERGY; PREFERENCES; CONSUMPTION,"The aim of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the probability of adopting LPG as the main cooking fuel in Ghana using household level data gleaned from last two nationwide household surveys (GLSS 5 & GLSS 6). Using a flexible semi parametric specification, the following were uncovered. First, we find socioeconomic and demographic factors such as income, education, access to urban infrastructure, and location of household, as key drivers of households' choice of LPG as main cooking energy source. Again the influences of these factors are stable across time, and with a strong price effect. The evidence shows that urban households with better socioeconomic and demographic factors are likely to adopt LPG as the main cooking fuel relative to households in rural areas and also urban households with poor socioeconomic and demographic factors. Finally, we observe that the imposition of fully parametric structure (functional form) prior to estimation on factors such as age of household head, income, and household size as done in the literature is inappropriate, at least in the case of Ghana and tend to bias the marginal effects. There is strong evidence of variations in the response rate of LPG adoption over the domains of income, household size, and the age of the household head. The results suggest a policy dichotomy between rural and urban dwellers for it to be effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, empirical studies do not fully support such a conventional view. This paper points out a drawback of the conventional view, that is, it ignores the role played by the owners of immobile factors. Within a standard tax competition model, we amend the conventional view by incorporating the lobbying of the immobile factor owners, and show that fiscal decentralization can aggravate corruption. We also demonstrate that social welfare can be higher under decentralization than under centralization in some cases, whereas the immobile factor owners' lobbying will prevent such a superiority of decentralization from being the outcome. Moreover, we provide an example to show that a better policy outcome and a higher level of corruption can co-exist, which contrasts with the general belief.","[Lai, Yu-Bong] Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan",National Chengchi University,"Lai, YB (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",,,"Lai, Yu-Bong/0000-0001-7032-8245",Ministry of Science and Technology [NSC 100-2410-H-004-076-MY2],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The author is grateful to the two reviewers for the useful comments and suggestions.

The short run deviations from the fundamental value of the J-REIT price occur during the 2008 crisis and the 2011 earthquake because the trading volume by foreigners exceeded 50%. The deviations from the fundamental value were less persistent during 2008 and 2011 because the 2011 earthquake caused Japanese investors to focus on earthquake risk while foreigners departed from investing in the J-REIT market.

Despite this, accounting research has provided little understanding of how economic forces affect a firm's level of accruals and limited guidance for forming expectations of accruals based on ex ante firm characteristics. We consider accruals as a form of investment and examine whether theoretical predictions from a real options-based investment framework provide insight into the relation between accruals and the ex ante expected volatility faced by the firm. Specifically, the theory predicts that higher volatility dampens investment because firms prefer to 'wait and see' instead of investing immediately. Consistent with this theory, we document a robust negative relation between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility. We also predict and find that the negative association between year-ahead net working capital accruals and expected volatility is less pronounced for distressed firms and more pronounced for firms with a longer operating cycle, and that current asset accruals are more sensitive to volatility than current liability accruals. Finally, we find that the residuals from an investment-based expected accrual model outperform those from the widely-used performance-adjusted modified Jones model in identifying companies that just meet or beat analysts' earnings forecasts. Collectively, our findings suggest that the investment perspective of accruals, and in particular the real options-based investment framework, provide useful insights for forming expectations of accruals.

There are great hopes that this innovative instrument will focus attention on ultimate outcomes and lead to greater aid effectiveness by passing the delivery risk on to recipients. However, there is very little related empirical evidence, and previous attempts to place it on a sure conceptual footing are rare and incomplete. This article collates and synthesises relevant insights from a wide range of subfields in economics, providing a rich framework with which to analyze Payment by Results. I argue that the domain in which it dominates more traditional forms is relatively small and if it is used too broadly, many of the results it claims are likely to be misleading. The likelihood of illusory gains stems from the difficulty of using a single indicator to simultaneously measure and reward performance: 'once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.' This does not mean PbR should not be used (indeed it will be optimal in some settings), but it does mean that claims of success should be treated with caution.","[Clist, Paul] Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Dev Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Clist, P (通讯作者)，Univ East Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Dev Econ, Norwich, Norfolk, England.",paul.clist@uea.ac.uk,,"Clist, Paul/0000-0001-9338-9446",Department for International Development (DFID UK); Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Department for International Development (DFID UK); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Paul Clist is a Lecturer in Development Economics in the School of International Development, University of East Anglia; email: paul.clist@uea.ac.uk.

To do that, we use shipment-level customs data on Thai imports, which identify not only firms, source country, and commodity but also tariff schemes. We propose several measures as a proxy for FTA utilization costs. The example includes the minimum amount of firm-level savings on tariff payments, i.e., trade values under FTA schemes multiplied by the tariff margin, in all transactions. Consequently, the median costs for FTA utilization in 2008, for example, are estimated to be approximately US$2000 for exports from China, US$300 for exports from Australia, and US$1000 for exports from Japan.

Each participant first filled up a first bag for her/himself, and then, a second one for the other person of the dyad. A simple nutritional message on vitamins and sugar contents of foods was then provided, and subsequently each participant filled up a third bag for her/himself and a fourth one for the other person of the dyad. The results show that before revealing the nutritional message, mothers are, on average, indulgent, which means that they choose a lower number of relatively healthy foods for their child than the one they choose for themselves. Children tend to be rather paternalistic, which means that they choose a higher number of relatively healthy foods for their mothers than they choose for themselves. The nutritional message leads many mothers and children to significantly increase the number of relatively healthy foods selected for themselves and for the other person. The mothers' indulgence versus the children's paternalism, along with the children's reactivity to the message, suggest that mothers underestimate the children's acceptance of healthy food.

The findings reveal specific data, transitional justice, and governance challenges in war-affected states as policy actors press for heightened attention to issues such as the effects on women of war-induced poverty, human rights violations, and women's empowerment in state reconstruction and peace-building. The analysis shows the aftermath of war accentuates frame misalignment between civil society and governing elites. In order to address this a Transformative Model (TM) of Participative Mainstreaming in Post-conflict States is proposed. Building on conflict theory it argues for the engendering of transitional justice in order to secure equality in public policy and law-making. In particular, it details how future attempts to apply the PDM need to be adapted across four Transformational Domains: actors, issues, rules, and structures. Each is populated by post-conflict issues/actions. When CSOs successfully advance claims for modifying policy and practice frame-alignment occurs and the implementation of PDM may be adapted to the specificities of war-affected states.

Some major findings emerge from our analysis. First, an increase in monopoly power has a detrimental effect on the balanced growth rate. Second, a vertical integration structure leads to a more balanced economic growth rate than a vertical separation structure. Third, the first-best subsidy rates on labor income and capital income under a vertical separation regime are higher than those under a vertical integration regime. Finally, with the additional externality from productive government spending, the government may levy positive taxes on both labor income and capital income if the extent of the productive public spending externality is sufficiently high.

All contracts under consideration are fairly priced such that the net profit of the provider is zero. Without the rider, an expected utility maximizing CRRA investor does not want an investment cap. Here, she commits herself to a strategy a priori. With the flexibility rider, the optimization problem changes and the optimal strategy is a response to an exogenously set price. A fair pricing then anticipates the optimal response of the investor. We show that the maximum expected utility of the investor can, for anticipated fairly priced products, be obtained for a finite cap. Thus, a capped product design can give a Pareto improvement to the otherwise uncapped contract version.","[Mahayni, Antje] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management Insurance & Risk Manageme, Duisburg, Germany; [Schneider, Judith C.] Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Muenster, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; University of Munster,"Schneider, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Finance Ctr Muenster, Univ Str 14-16, D-48143 Munster, Germany.",amahayni@uni-due.de; judith.schneider@wiwi.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,32,7,7,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We show that margin requirements can have opposite effects on market volatility when they constrain different investors and thus can help explain why empirical results have been mixed. Contrary to one of the main regulatory goals, we find that even though margin requirements restrict borrowing and shorting, they can significantly increase market volatility. In addition, margin requirements can make margin constrained investors better off and can lead to a greater return reversal. Our analysis also provides new empirically testable implications.","[Wang, Yajun] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Wang, YJ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,47,9,10,0,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

This effect is quite uniform across the subjective well-being distribution, and thus exists also for those who are already happy. Shadow prices peg this effect at around 22,000 GBP p.a., the average amount of equivalent net household income in the sample analyzed (which is roughly 27,000 GBP p.a.).

This study examines the former using a unique but confidential database. We find evidence that: (i) banks increase provisions in anticipation of future lending growth, (ii) banks allocate part of surplus capital above regulatory requirements to pre-fund future credit losses through provisions, and (iii) banks allocate part of higher earnings for the same purpose. These results suggest that bank managers use their discretion in setting provisions to dampen the impact of fluctuations in credit market conditions on their lending activities. For internal ratings-based banks, results suggest that the revised Basel framework allowing these banks to estimate expected losses using their own credit risk models may come at a cost of reduced general provisions.

Poznanski Szybki Tramwaj, PST) in the year 1997 symbolically marked the beginning of a new era in the development of urban transportation systems in Poland. In this paper we would like to address the following question: more than one decade after the opening of the PST, what are its effects in terms of travel behaviours, housing choices and satisfaction, and apartment prices? In order to answer this question, we combined data on travel behaviours and housing choices from a survey based on a sample of nearly 300 households with data on housing prices from over 1400 real estate transaction records from the period between 2010 and 2013. Our results show that the proximity to PST affects travel behaviours, as respondents living close to PST stops confirmed that they use this form of transportation more often. There also seems to be some effect on housing choices; in locations close to PST stops we found many households living in rental housing, particularly university students. Also, about 20% of interviewees declared that they would pay more for apartments located closer to the rapid tram. However, that effect was only partly confirmed through the analysis of transaction prices. Using standard and spatial econometric regressions including variables like apartment size, floor number, amenities, and type of building we found a weak correlation between the proximity to PST and apartment prices. In conclusion, we argue that treating property price effects as the main justification for public transportation projects might be a doubtful choice, because in some cases the principal impacts of such projects might be visible in terms of residents' satisfaction and travel behaviours.

Analysis of a newly compiled bond-level data set for 2000-2010 finds that diversification with corporate bonds can significantly reduce volatility and increase risk-adjusted returns for U.S. investors. Unlike diversification with equities, corporate bonds offer significant out-of-sample risk reduction, particularly during the recent financial crisis. Risk-reduction gains are large even when the benchmark includes international equities or when longer samples of equities and sovereign bonds are used to inform corporate bond returns. Finally, significant risk-reduction gains remain after accounting for bond characteristics, liquidity, and informational costs.","[Liu, Edith X.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Cornell University,"Liu, EX (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",edith.liu@cornell.edu,,,,,,,33,22,23,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-1090,1756-6916,,J FINANC QUANT ANAL,J.

We assume that a cognitive focus accounts for the inaction inertia effect. Individuals focus more on losses (the association between the current opportunity and missed opportunity) than gains (the association between the current opportunity and original states), therefore showing the inaction inertia effect. We also propose a self-other difference in inaction inertia: agents exhibit less inaction inertia than personal decision makers as they focus more on gains than losses compared to personal decision makers. In Study 1, agents were less trapped in inaction inertia than personal decision makers. Cognitive focus was measured with eye-tracking techniques in Study 2 and a self-reported item in Study 3.

Results show that the presence of dependent children in the household increased the probability of having any medical debt by 8 % for high'' financial burden households, 4 % for households at the 50th percentile of the income distribution and 3 % for privately insured households. The amount of medical debt by households at the 75th percentile of the income distribution was also increased. These findings show that the number of dependent children in the household was associated with medical debt for households in the middle of the income distribution. These results may be explained by the fact that those households at the lower tail of the income distribution are more likely to have public coverage, which tends to have lower cost sharing compared to those with private insurance.","[Richard, Patrick] Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA",Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences - USA,"Richard, P (通讯作者)，Uniformed Serv Univ Hlth Sci, Dept Prevent Med & Biostat, 4301 Jones Bridge Rd, Bethesda, MD 20814 USA.",patrick.richard@usuhs.edu,,,USU/PMB Incoming Faculty Research Support Start-up Package [C087328915],USU/PMB Incoming Faculty Research Support Start-up Package,This study was funded by the USU/PMB Incoming Faculty Research Support Start-up Package (Grant #C087328915).,,60,8,8,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We use an asset-based approach to define vulnerability and apply propensity score matching analysis to assess the impact of contract farming. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2010 of 245 oil palm smallholder households, 126 of which were contract smallholders. The study finds that approximately 40 per cent of oil palm smallholders can be classified as stochastic-transient poor. We also show that while contract participation reduces the negative impact of oil palm price shocks, this is not the case for production shocks. The study concludes that despite positive income effects, contract smallholders also remain vulnerable to poverty.","[Cahyadi, Eko Ruddy; Waibel, Hermann] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Sch Econ & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Waibel, H (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Dev & Agr Econ, Sch Econ & Management, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",waibel@ifgb.uni-hannover.de,"Cahyadi, Eko Ruddy/GQO-8888-2022","Cahyadi, Eko Ruddy/0000-0001-8163-6649",,,,,41,59,62,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In China, capital markets are under developed and the poor may not be able to borrow from the rich.

As job opportunities in middle-skill occupations disappeared, employment opportunities concentrated in the highest and lowest wage occupations. A two-country stochastic growth model that incorporates trade in tasks, rather than in goods, accounts for this evidence. This polarization did not result from a steady process: the relative employment share of each skill group significantly fluctuated over short to medium horizons. The aggregate shocks estimated within this framework can rationalize the observed skill-based employment dynamics, while providing a good fit to the macroeconomic data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the cross-section, firms' idiosyncratic return volatility is V-shaped with respect to their lagged asset growth rates: the volatility is higher for firms with extreme (either high or low) asset growth rates than for firms with moderate growth rates. In the time series, a higher dispersion across firms in asset growth rates predicts a higher average idiosyncratic return volatility. Moreover, the dispersion in asset growth rates has the strongest time series predictive power among alternative explanations of the average idiosyncratic return volatility, such as cash flow volatility and growth options. These findings indicate the importance of nonlinearity in studying the cross-sectional return volatility and provide a new explanation of the idiosyncratic return volatility that is significant in both the cross-section and the time series.","[Song, Zhongzhi] Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China",,"Song, ZZ (通讯作者)，Cheung Kong Grad Sch Business, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,37,2,3,1,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

The study presents the conditions under which migrants participate in the labour market of their home countries. Though transnationalism describes return migration as a circular movement, there is still evidence of permanent return prompting the question of how returnees utilise their transnational links after return. This paper presents an analysis of pre- and post-return experiences of Ghanaian international migrants, focusing on their strategies, assets and labour market participation. The study finds that return migrants keep ties with host countries for the sake of businesses and other benefits which may not be readily available in the home country.

Transportation planners have identified coordination and collaboration as fundamental steps in addressing issues related to transportation network planning and sustainability initiatives. This research explores multi-jurisdictional collaboration between agencies using a case study on Pennsylvania Metropolitan/Rural Planning Organizations (MPOs/RPOs) and non-designated areas. The agencies are surveyed and the results are analyzed using a network analysis software, Gephi. In order to compare the collaboration network analysis (survey results) to influential factors, such as geographic adjacency and geographic proximity (reflective of transportation networks), GIS is used in combination with Gephi to complete geographical network analyses. The three analyses are compared using average degree, density, and average path length. The results indicate that the MPOs, RPOs, and non-designated areas within the state of Pennsylvania are collaborating, on average, beyond the geographical adjacency but below the level of geographical proximity network. In addition, email and phone communication forms are the most widely used for high frequency connection while face-to-face meetings are more likely for biannual and annual collaboration. The results of this study serve as a foundation for measuring and monitoring multi jurisdictional collaboration to promote sustainable organizational planning in transportation.

A focal point in the review is on the design features of these policy mechanisms. Key developments in policy design were originally established in controlling externalities arising from pollution and have since been extended to policy design tailored towards biodiversity conservation. Special emphasis is given to the spatial characteristics of the environmental problems underlying both pollution control and biodiversity conservation. The paper concludes by drawing some lessons and setting out elements of a future research agenda in both policy domains.","[de Vries, Frans P.] Univ Stirling, Management Sch, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland; [Hanley, Nick] Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Dept Geog & Sustainable Dev, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland",University of Stirling; University of St Andrews,"de Vries, FP (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Management Sch, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",f.p.devries@stir.ac.uk; ndh3@st-andrews.ac.uk,"Hanley, Nick/C-1759-2012","Hanley, Nick/0000-0002-1362-3499; de Vries, Frans P/0000-0003-0462-5035",European Investment Bank (EIB),European Investment Bank (EIB),"The research reported here is derived from work conducted under the Eco-Delivery project (http://www.eco-delivery.stir.ac.uk/).

However, it is possible that the seemingly positive link between age and preferences stems from confounds in experimental procedure. In a dictator game study we find that elderly participants do indeed transfer higher shares of their endowments to their peers than a standard sample of student participants. This result holds good even in treatments accounting for wealth differences and experimenter demand effects. However, we observe no difference in behavior when we compare elderly participants and students who have not previously participated in economic experiments. Accordingly, it is possible that the seemingly stronger social preferences of the elderly are due to confounds associated with lack of experience with economic experiments.

We use stock price delay as an inverse measure of price efficiency, and consider the speed of adjustment to local and global common factor information. The results show that foreign investors accelerate the incorporation of both types of common information into the prices of Malaysian stocks, mainly due to their superior skills in processing systematic market-wide factors. However, we find evidence of optimality in foreign shareholding, suggesting that the efficiency benefit disappears after foreign ownership exceeds a certain threshold level. Further analyses shed lights on the channels and moderating variables driving this non-monotonic relationship. Our disaggregate analysis on foreign investor heterogeneity shows that foreign investors who trade through nominee accounts are elite processors of public market wide and firm-specific news in the Malaysian stock market.

Incentive mechanisms can help mitigate the threat of habitat fragmentation by aggregating landowner conservation decisions across the landscape. The optimal conservation strategy for endangered species can target the most connected habitat cluster as an initial starting point, and then expand the conservation patch to maximize connectivity. Herein we present an incentive mechanism, the tradable set-aside requirements (TSARs), designed to target the low cost contiguous conservation landscape and share the burden of conservation among landowners. In the lab, we examine the performance of two land use conservation policies: TSARs, and the TSARs combined with an agglomeration bonus. Evaluated by economic and biological measures of efficiency, we find that TSARs, relative to a command and control policy, increases patch size and habitat connectivity within the landscape. Additionally, combining TSARS with the agglomeration bonus increases biological efficiency (habitat connectivity and patch size within the landscape) but at a price-higher opportunity cost. TSARs with the agglomeration bonus can be more cost-effective than a TSARs only policy for species sensitive to large core habitat requirements and landscape connectivity.","[Parkhurst, Gregory M.] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Shogren, Jason F.; Crocker, Thomas] Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University; University of Wyoming,"Shogren, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Wyoming, Dept Econ & Finance, Laramie, WY 82071 USA.",gregoryparkhurst@weber.edu; jramses@uwyo.edu; tcrocker@uwyo.edu,"Shogren, Jason/N-8193-2019","Shogren, Jason/0000-0003-3757-959X",Royal Society of Edinburgh; US Department of Agriculture; University of Wyoming Stroock and Bugas funds; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,Royal Society of Edinburgh; US Department of Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)); University of Wyoming Stroock and Bugas funds; Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Thanks to participants at workshop on Mechanism Design and the Environment at the Royal Society of Edinburgh for their helpful comments and funding.

These are certain index levels (usually in multiples of 100) at which the market tends to stick before breaking out either up or down. Extant behavioural finance literature has attributed this to investors' subjective perception of 'something special' about certain index levels where in fact no rational economic basis exists for such a perception.

The credit has the potential to affect the health of children in recipient families through three channels: family income, maternal employment, and health insurance coverage patterns. We exploit variation in state-level EITCs to estimate the effects of the credit on health insurance coverage, utilization of medical care, and health status. We find that the EITC is associated with significant changes in health insurance coverage patterns for children age 6-14, increasing rates of private health insurance but producing offsetting decreases in public coverage.

Moreover, systematic factors move average distress rates and small SMEs are more vulnerable to these factors compared to large SMEs. By including many very small companies in the sample, our models offer unique insights into the European small business sector. By exploring distress in a multi-country setting, the models uncover regional vulnerabilities. Finally, by incorporating systematic dependencies, the models capture distress co-movements.

This finding is consistent with results from other countries but in contrast to these studies, the present analysis also incorporates buyer characteristics which provide further information on the sources of demand for eco-labelled real, estate. A separate estimation by subgroups reveals that the price premium is primarily driven by wealthier households that exhibit a higher willingness-to-pay for eco-labelled condominiums, both as a total amount and as a fraction of the total sales price. Less affluent households are also shown to pay higher prices for the eco label but the effect is less pronounced. The results indicate that capitalised utility bill savings are likely to account for a large proportion of the observed premium but the higher premium paid by affluent households suggests that more intangible benefits of living in a green building may also play a role.

It concluded that such inference is possible with a proper prior, if some of the properties of a pivotal statistic are satisfied by the moment functions. Our discussion focuses on the application to the Habit model. We use rolling windows of half the original sample size. This captures the many booms and recessions better than the original sample, covering a rather long period, and it explores the performance of the method with smaller samples. The results demonstrate that when the prior is proper, the approach gives decent performance even with relatively small samples, as the estimations of the curvature parameter with the sub-samples are rather stable among different rolling windows, and are close to those with the original sample. Results also show that an informative prior considerably supplements the decreased amount of information contained in the data, as the posterior standard deviations with sub-samples are similar to those with the original one.","[Linton, Oliver; Wu, Ruochen] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England",University of Cambridge,"Linton, O (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Austin Robinson Bldg,Sidgwick Ave, Cambridge CB3 9DD, England.",obl20@cam.ac.uk,,,"ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,3,0,0,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Our models take into account the time-varying property of the models' parameters and the volatility of realized volatility. A dynamic model averaging (DMA) approach is used to combine the forecasts of the individual models. Our empirical results suggest that DMA can generate more accurate forecasts than individual model in both statistical and economic senses. Models that use time-varying parameters have greater forecasting accuracy than models that use the constant coefficients. The superiority of time-varying parameter models is also found in volatility density forecasting. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This argument relies on the assumption that the association among high-tech status, innovativeness, and growth is actually positive. We examine this assumption by studying the industry distribution of high-growth firms (HGFs) across all four-digit NACE industries, using data covering all limited liability firms in Sweden during the period 1997-2008. The results of fractional logit regressions indicate that industries with high R&D intensity, ceteris paribus, can be expected to have a lower share of HGFs than can industries with lower R&D intensity. The findings cast doubt on the wisdom of targeting R&D industries or subsidizing R&D to promote firm growth. In contrast, we find that HGFs are overrepresented in knowledge-intensive service industries, i.e., service industries with a high share of human capital.","[Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov; Johansson, Dan] HUI Res, Regeringsgatan 60, SE-10329 Stockholm, Sweden; [Elert, Niklas] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN),"Elert, N (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Box 55665, SE-10215 Stockholm, Sweden.",sven-olov.daunfeldt@hui.se; nikla-s.elert@ifn.se; dan.johansson@hui.se,"Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/N-5386-2019","Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/0000-0002-1013-8623",R&D Fund of the Swedish Tourism and Hospitality Industry (BFUF),R&D Fund of the Swedish Tourism and Hospitality Industry (BFUF),"We would like to thank Daniel Halvarsson, Johan Klaesson, and Erik Stam for their comments and suggestions on a previous version.

First, it provides a new theory of wealth inequality that merges two empirically relevant forces generating inequality: bequest motives and inheritance of ability across generations; and an earnings process that allows for more earnings risk for the richest. Second, it uses the resulting calibrated framework to study the effects of changing estate taxation. Increasing the estate tax reduces the wealth concentration in the hands of the richest few and the economic advantage of being born to a rich and super-rich family at the cost of reduced aggregate capital and output. However, all of these effects are quite small. In contrast, increasing estate taxation can generate a significant welfare gain to a newborn under the veil of ignorance, but this comes at a large welfare cost for the super-rich.

I argue that researchers have overlooked institutional context's critical role in the formation of private markets when designing insurance contracts. Using micro-level evidence from Ethiopia, I show that recipients of a preexisting effective, large-scale public safety net fail to take-up a new highly subsidized private insurance offer. Government safety net programs can decrease demand for private index insurance, forming an additional barrier to index insurance take-up. A direct implication of this research is that policymakers should design private and public insurance products that account for, or even complement, each other. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A major field of study is the automatic identification of travel modes from passively collected GPS data. In previous work, the authors have developed a robust modal classification system using an optimized combination of statistical inference techniques. One problem that remains very difficult is the correct identification of transit travel, particularly when the system is operating in mixed traffic. This type of operation generates a wide range of values for many travel parameters (average speed, maximum speed, and acceleration for example) which have similar characteristics to other urban modes. In this paper, we supplement the previous research to improve the identification of transit trips. The method employed evaluates the likelihood that GPS travel data belong to transit by comparing the location and pattern of zero-travel speeds (stopping) to the presence of transit stops and signalized intersections. These comparisons are done in a GIS. The consideration of the spatial attributes of GPS data vastly improves the accuracy of transit travel prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Thirty-eight participants made choices between three 4-product packages, in which the frequency of each of the products varied. Greater relative left frontal activation and high peak skin conductance level (SCL) elicited by a previously selected choice option predicted a stronger endowment effect, suggesting that approach motivation and emotional attachment mediate the endowment effect. Not selecting a choice option with high emotional attachment elicited relatively greater right hemisphere activation, supporting also the role of loss aversion in the endowment effect. In addition, high trade-off difficulty was associated with increased withdrawal motivation (or less approach motivation) and negatively valenced arousal.

The models utilize panel data from districts in Wisconsin along with fixed effects estimations. We find that once time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity of a district is accounted for, preschool programs have small but significant impacts on a cohort's future math scores, particularly in less-educated communities.

Moreover, different combinations of these factors, such as demand, supply and macroeconomic indicators are responsible for the price volatility at different times. Big Data presents opportunities to collect and integrate datasets from several sources for the purpose of discovering useful patterns and extracting actionable insights that can be used to gain competitive advantage or improve decision making. Neural Networks presents research opportunities for training computer algorithms to model linear and non-linear patterns that might exist in datasets for the purpose of extracting actionable insights such as making predictions. This article proposes a Big Data and Neural Networks approach for predicting prices of grain commodities in South Africa. It was identified that disparate data that influence the grain commodities market can be acquired, integrated and analysed in real-time to predict future prices of grain commodities. By utilising SAP HANA as the enabling Big Data technology, data acquired from several sources was used to create an integrated dataset, and a predictive model was developed using Backpropagation Neural Network algorithms. This model was used to predict the daily spot prices of white maize on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) at the end of each trading day. The initial results indicate that the approach can be scientifically used to predict future prices of grain commodities in a real-time environment.","[Ayankoya, Kayode; Calitz, Andre P.; Greyling, Jean H.] Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa",Nelson Mandela University,"Ayankoya, K (通讯作者)，Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.",s212400096@nmmu.ac.za; andre.calitz@nmmu.ac.za; jean.greyling@nmmu.ac.za,"Calitz, Andre P./V-3180-2018",,,,,,47,9,10,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,,2016,55.0,4,,,,,483,508,,10.1080/03031853.2016.1243060,0.0,,,26,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EI7SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392703200008,0

The results indicated that the largest gap between employee expectations and perceptions pertained to the tangibility of service quality, followed by reliability, empathy, responsiveness, and assurance. In addition, the results suggested that perceived responsiveness could influence expected tangibility, and that expected empathy could influence perceived assurance and empathy.

This research directly addresses the lacuna of studies on entrepreneurship in emerging economies and contributes to our understanding of the critical role informal capital plays in the Chinese entrepreneurial process.

The optimal rules are compared with the cooperative case. Although the model is simple, it is complex enough so that the distortion introduced by incomplete financial markets matters. The complete markets case serves as a benchmark. Under complete markets, it is shown that the policy response in one state of the world influences outcomes in all other states through the effect on asset prices. It is noted that monetary policy cannot replicate an optimal tariff, so that the absence of a tariff instrument is a distortion even in the complete-markets economy. We show that optimal policy, even under complete markets and cooperation, does not try to minimize spillovers.","[Engel, Charles] Univ Wisconsin, Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Engel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,"NSF [1226007]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1226007] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","The author acknowledges research support from NSF grant # 1226007.

We investigate whether spinoffs are more likely to survive than other startups, and whether spinoff survival depends on the quality and size of their parent companies, as suggested in some of the theoretical and empirical literature. Our estimated survival models confirm that spinoffs are generally less likely to exit than other startups. We also distinguish between pulled spinoffs, where the parent company continues after they are founded, and pushed spinoffs, where the parent company stops operations. Our results indicate that in western and eastern Germany and in all sectors investigated, pulled spinoffs have a higher probability of survival than pushed spinoffs.

The results of this study show that Argentina has no major problems simultaneously serving as a local food provider and exporter-from a food availability perspective. However, Argentina has problems ensuring food access to all its population. In order to improve food access while exploiting the food export opportunity, the authors propose eliminating the export tax and its substitution for a food consumption subsidy in the form of a conditional income transfer to the population under food insecurity. This would also open new opportunities for agribusiness companies selling products in local and external markets.","[Feeney, Roberto; MacClay, Pablo] Austral Univ, Ctr Food & Agribusiness, 1950 Paraguay St, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina",Austral University,"Feeney, R (通讯作者)，Austral Univ, Ctr Food & Agribusiness, 1950 Paraguay St, Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina.",rfeeney@austral.edu.ar; pmacclay@austral.edu.ar,"Clay, Pablo Mac/AAP-4919-2020; Feeney, Roberto/AAY-4710-2020","Clay, Pablo Mac/0000-0003-0718-8002; Feeney, Roberto/0000-0002-3885-3055",,,,,48,5,6,0,13,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

There is a critical moment when the firms must surpass it using suitable internationalization and partnership choices without affecting the choices of the partner firms involved in the model. Among the firms' internationalization options, I lay emphasis on three models of internationalization: the progressive model focusing on the Uppsala model and the product's life cycle, the dependent model known as the eclectic model and the international business network model. When the firm surpasses its condition on the domestic market, its own needs will determine it to capitalize new opportunities in other markets. If we take into consideration the costs of an international approach, firms would prefer to take their first steps on a foreign market alongside a partner. Prospecting a new market involves costs and time, therefore the guidance of a local partner could prove to be of great use especially because the partner firm is able to offer sources of information and knowledge regarding the political environment and the market conditions. If the partners' decisions are set on a common point of view, then the first step in establishing a partnership has already been made. As mentioned in the methodology of the model, the firms will assign values according to the benefits that each type of partnership can offer to them. Each firm will measure its table values through its own calculation strategies keeping into account all of the vectors that would have an impact on the development of the firm at an international level. Whether the firms are interested in forecasting the sales of a future partnership, exchanging know-how or identifying restriction barriers imposed by the host state, the values will be assigned according to the interests of the firms involved in the analysis.","[Giurea, Ana-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Giurea, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, 6 Piata Romana, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",ana.giurea@yahoo.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,679,690,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300056,0

In particular, we estimate how the effects vary depending on the size of both entrants and incumbents and whether the effects of new entry differ across sectors. We find that while new entry increases the probability that incumbents will exit, the effect depends on the size of both entrants and incumbents. We also find that the effect differs significantly across sectors: It is largest in nontradable services, but fairly limited in the case of manufacturing and tradable services. Furthermore, in the case of the tradable services sector, very large-scale entries are less likely to drive out incumbents than medium-or small-scale entries. On the other hand, new entry is most likely to affect incumbents in the nontradable services sector, probably because it is difficult for incumbents in this sector to expand their customer base outside the region. Although small establishments are the most likely to be driven out by new entries in all sectors, very large incumbents are not always the most competitive and, in the case of the tradable services sector, medium-sized establishments are the least likely to be affected by new entry.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan; [Kato, Masatoshi] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Sch Econ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Kawasaki, Kanagawa, Japan.",keiko-i@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp; mkato@kwansei.ac.jp,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517; Kato, Masatoshi/0000-0001-6087-5253","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [KAKENHI 23243050, 26780161]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H03355, 15H03342, 26780161] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research is conducted as part of the East Asian Firm-Level Productivity Project at the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry (RIETI).

The study sheds light on the regime-dependent interconnectedness between the risk of investing in banking and public sector bonds and provides novel evidence that a rise in sovereign debt, due to the countercyclical fiscal policy measures, is perceived by stock market investors as a burden on growth prospects. We also document that government interventions in the banking sector deteriorate the credit risk of sovereign debt. Higher risk premium required by investors for holding riskier government bonds depresses the sovereign debt market, it impairs banks' balance sheets, and it depresses the collateral value of loans leading to bank retrenchment. The ensuing two-way banking-fiscal feedback loop indicates that government interventions do not necessarily stabilize the banking sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This effect of geographical proximity is not biased by the fact that DAX30 companies are headquartered in Germany. Shedding light on how influence takes place, I show that influence through communication and the exchange of opinion within small groups of analysts plays a vital role. This mainly applies during a bullish market environment. When markets are bearish, analysts' incentives induce them not to deviate too much from the overall average, such that then observational learning has a greater impact.","[Koenig, Frederik] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"König, F (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Fac Econ & Business Adm, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",Frederik.koenig@googlemail.com,,,,,,,34,2,2,2,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1542-7560,1542-7579,,J BEHAV FINANC,J.

The export trends for the Italian firms during the last years show a slow development, due to systemic problems related to the slow GDP increase, the euro currency appreciation and the lack of competiveness towards Asiatic enterprises. On the other hand, internal management problems related to the lack of capacity to attract foreign investments or to effectuate them, due to a short vision management have sorted out. These difficulties are translated practically in a weak contractual power and capacity to assist foreign clients after the selling process. (ICE-ISTAT, 2015) Also, during the last years the importance of an efficient credit risk valuation and management sensibly increased, because of the increased globalisation regarding commercial relationships between countries and the recent financial crisis. The selling process becomes more complex, passing from the simple export to the realisation of contracts as project finance or investing in conglomerates. In the commercial sector it becomes difficult to realise secure payment transactions. The Italian firms operating in foreign trade basically have the needs to eliminate or transfer sensibly part of the buyer's credit risk and to finance their supply of goods. Thus, to secure the credit risk, the seller should be able to choose the right insurance company, considering the particularity of the commercial operation. The financial form of the transaction regulation is important to be chosen based on the commercialised products, buyer's characteristics, the period or the delay of payment, which do sensibly affect the credit risk. In this context it is absolutely important to have a set of commercial contracts which can help the Italian enterprises increase their competiveness and presence on the international markets. In this work, we will see different financial contracts in exports used by Italian firms and their characteristics and abilities to accomplish in the better way the needs of the sellers and buyers in the most secure way.","[Madhi, Doris] Univ Aleksander Xhuvani, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Law, Rruga Kozma Naska 66, Elbasan 3001, Albania",,"Madhi, D (通讯作者)，Univ Aleksander Xhuvani, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Law, Rruga Kozma Naska 66, Elbasan 3001, Albania.",doris.madhi@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"UNIV ECONOMICS, EKONOMICKA UNIVERZITA & BRATISLAVE, DOLNOZEMSKA CESTA 1, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4261-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,205,215,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392433400025,0

Therefore, this paper develops a dynamic general equilibrium growth model with endogenous skill-biased technological change to study the contributions of environmental policies in producing more ecological goods. By solving the transitional dynamics, it is shown that when green firms and green research are supported by policy and/or dirty activities are taxed, technological progress leads to more ecological goods production and environmental quality improvements. Furthermore, a positive change in green environmental quality fosters R&D on ecological goods, increasing their production.

US prices for cheddar and butter are impacted by price shocks in Oceania and the EU. However, US price shocks also spread into the Oceania market and may reflect potential arbitrage opportunities.

This is the first non-market valuation study of a typical Mediterranean habitat, the Coralligenous, which is characterized by high biodiversity, geomorphologic complexity and iconic species like gorgonians. This habitat is not only very attractive for scuba diving, but is also threatened by climate change and ocean acidification, which is our motivation for undertaking this valuation study. Choice attributes include the number of divers on a diving trip, underwater landscape, presence of jellyfish species, expected state of gorgonians, and price of a dive. Results of multinomial and random parameter logit models indicate a decrease in the attractiveness of Coralligenous areas for scuba diving as a result of both environmental pressures. Estimates of welfare values show that the local extinction of gorgonians had the highest negative effect on utility equivalent to a cost of a,not sign60 per dive, followed by abundance of stinging jellyfish with a cost of a,not sign26 per dive. Choice probabilities for the selection of different dive experiences indicate the highest rejection rates for the combined sea warming and acidification scenarios.","[Rodrigues, Luis C.; van den Bergh, Jeroen C.

The foresight research projects use both the quantitative and qualitative methods. Despite their broad spectrum, they still lack methods focused on identifying the actions designed to achieve the developed vision of development of the research area. The scientific problem is therefore to determine how and with the use of what tools it is possible to identify priority actions ultimately enabling the implementation of scenarios of development of the studied area. Scientific aim The scientific goal is the development and verification of a new research method allowing for the identification and classification of activities making it possible to achieve the desired visions of the future of the research area. The verification the new method of research will be conducted on the example of the most probable scenario of the development of tourism in the Podlaskie voivodship in the perspective of the year 2030, developed by a wide circle of experts and stakeholders within the framework of the implementation of the research project Foresight as a tool for improving the management of tourism in the region. Methodology/methods The methods used to achieve the scientific objective involve desk research and the method of logic structure and analysis. The pilot study using the new method - NCRR, also used the method of a panel of experts and surveys. Findings As a result of the undertaken research work, a new research method (NCRR) was developed and characterized. Within the framework of the pilot study, conducted with its use, the experts and stakeholders have designated the catalogue of 21 priority actions enabling the achievement of an established vision of tourism development in the perspective up to the year 2030. These activities are contained in six research areas: innovative tourism products and services; tourist entrepreneurship in the region; cultural and natural heritage; tourist infrastructure of the region; regional tourism policy; science, research and development in the region. Conclusions The developed NCRR method represents a new tool of qualitative nature, enriching the catalogue of methods used in foresight research. Its use in the foresight research process not only allows to determine the vision of the future as before, but also makes it possible to determine real actions enabling their achievement in a specific period of time.","[Szpilko, Danuta] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Szpilko, D (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",danutaszpilko@gmail.com,"Szpilko, Danuta/AAL-1138-2021","Szpilko, Danuta/0000-0002-2866-8059",National Science Centre [DEC-2012/05/N/HS4/02055],"National Science Centre(National Science Centre, Poland)",The project was funded by the National Science Centre on the basis of the contract No. DEC-2012/05/N/HS4/02055.,,25,2,2,0,7,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,612,620,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200076,0

Our results show that during the child's first 2 years, Swedish female self-employed use on average 46 fewer days of parental leave (15 %) than female wage earners, while male self-employed use on average 27 fewer days of parental leave (71 %) than their wage earner counterparts. We argue that the shorter average duration of parental leave among male self-employed is due both to relatively higher costs of absence and to a parental leave participation effect where some male self-employed with high performance-related income do not take parental leave at all. Given that all mothers take parental leave independently of employment status, we do not find any significant parental leave participation effect for female self-employed. Instead, we find a significant employment selection effect where women with high performance-related income choose self-employment explaining the shorter average duration of parental leave among female self-employed.","[Anxo, Dominique; Ericson, Thomas] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden",Linnaeus University,"Ericson, T (通讯作者)，Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, S-35195 Vaxjo, Sweden.",thomas.ericson@lnu.se,"Anxo, Dominique/AAC-1109-2021",,Swedish Social Insurance Agency [25214-2010],Swedish Social Insurance Agency,"This Study was funded by The Swedish Social Insurance Agency, grant number 25214-2010.",,15,9,10,0,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

These include agriculture, food, money, life chances, and attitudes toward domestic violence. The picture portrayed is encouraging, showing the social sophistication of a group often marginalized: This group shows considerable female involvement in decision-making and strongly democratic elements. We identify three issues that need greater attention for equitable landscape management to result: women's spheres of decision-making must be ascertained and taken into account, men's involvement in care needs to expand, and women's agency requires enhancement and external support.

A key assumption in this prototypical framework is that voters discount their memories about unemployment and inflation at a constant rate. Yet starting with Ebbinghaus (1885) and Jost (1897), a large body of research in psychology documents an empirical regularity that has come to be known as Jost's Second Law of Forgetting individuals discount recent memories at a higher rate compared to the rate at which they discount older memories. I find that incorporating this insight from psychology (i.e., hyperbolic memory discounting) into the benchmark framework moderates the amplitude of the predicted political business cycle.

This practice aligns price more closely with instructional costs and students' ability to pay postgraduation. Exploiting the staggered adoption of these policies across universities, this paper finds that differential pricing does alter the share of students studying engineering and possibly business. There is some evidence that student groups already underrepresented in certain fields are particularly affected by the new pricing policies. Price does appear to be a policy lever through which state governments can alter the allocation of students to majors and thus the field composition of the workforce.

I calibrate the model for a reference U.S. citizen and exploit the fact that the association between health deficits and mortality has been estimated with great precision in gerontology. This allows me to use the model for quantitative experiments. I compare health expenditure, health deficits, and the value of life for richer and poorer individuals. The model motivates a strong socioeconomic gradient of health. It explains how income growth and advances in medical technology and the induced increase in health care demand led to large reductions in health deficits and roughly a doubling of the value of life at all ages.

One such innovative instrument is the participating mortgage, in which the lender gains part of the net operating income and/or future appreciation. In this paper, we establish a financing model for participating mortgages, incorporating early termination options such as default and two prepayment clauses, defeasance and prepayment penalty. Later, we illustrate a detailed sensitivity analysis of the model. The values of early termination options depend on the choice of parameters in the model, as well as the term structure of short term rates.

We also develop a GMM framework to estimate key model parameters. An empirical application using corn futures and option prices is used to illustrate the methodology and demonstrate differences between our approach and the standard model-free implied volatility.

We create new text-based indicators of both general economic and policy specific uncertainty from New York Times and use them first, to chart changes in the level of uncertainty in the US for the period 1985-2007, second, to determine the role of policy in these swings, and, third to assess their impact on the economy, equity markets, and business cycles. Overall, our results indicate that uncertainty shocks - both general and policy related - depress the level of economic activity, significantly increase stock market volatility, and decrease market returns.

While most papers within this framework consider a fiscal deficit that occurs with certainty, in reality an increase in the government's fiscal burden may be an uncertain outcome. This paper introduces a model where there is uncertainty about the occurrence of a fiscal deficit for a finite number of periods, and studies the effects of such uncertainty on the evolution of currency crises. If the fiscal deficit materializes, the government has to abandon the fixed exchange rate regime, as in the standard case. However, the paper shows that the peg becomes unsustainable even if the fiscal deficit never materializes. Therefore, a speculative attack occurs and the fixed exchange rate regime collapses with the mere possibility of a deficit, independently of whether this outcome actually occurs or not.","Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey",Sabanci University,"Gumus, I (通讯作者)，Sabanci Univ, Fac Arts & Social Sci, TR-34956 Istanbul, Turkey.",incigumus@sabanciuniv.edu,"Gumus, Inci/AAY-8597-2020","Gumus, Inci/0000-0003-4667-0109",,,,,12,1,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Specifically, we examine the impact of changes in funding conditions on U.K.-resident banks' domestic and external lending from 2006 to 2012. The results suggest that, following a rise in the funding shock measure, U.K.-resident banks that grew their balance sheets quicker relative to their peers precrisis decreased their external lending by more relative to other banks, and increased their domestic lending. When the paper accounts for country of ownership, it finds that the same pattern was true for both U.K.-owned and foreign-owned banks, but more pronounced for U.K.-owned banks' domestic and foreign-owned banks' external lending. These results are robust to splitting the data into real and financial sector lending, the use of more granular bilateral country loan data and controlling for government interventions.","[Hills, Robert] Bank England, European Econ Team, London, England; [Hooley, John] Bank England, IMFs African Dept, London, England; [Korniyenko, Yevgeniya] IMF, Strategy Policy & Review Dept, Bretton Woods, NH USA; [Korniyenko, Yevgeniya] Bank England, London, England; [Wieladek, Tomasz] Bank England, Res Interact Monetary & Macroprudential Policy, Res Hub, London, England",Bank of England; Bank of England; Bank of England; Bank of England,"Hills, R (通讯作者)，Bank England, European Econ Team, London, England.",,,,,,,,14,2,2,3,12,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

This raises the question of any interconnectivity between the anticipated sovereign credit risks of these economies and the market expectations of their exchange rates. Using a bivariate vector error-correction model with random coefficients, this paper finds evidence of cointegration and time varying conditional correlation between the prices in the sovereign CDS and currency option markets. This suggests that the relative sovereign credit risk of these developed economies impacts the market expectations of their exchange rates in the long run, but in the short run the impact changes drastically in times of crisis, resulting in drastic and persistent price deviations from their long-run equilibrium amid central banks' monetary measures and market turbulence.

This is manifest in our data sample by a growth in exporter-importer-product combinations from about 430 thousand in 1995 to almost 620 thousand in 2005. Most of this growth has occurred because more and more developing or emerging market countries are entering the market as exporters. To study this growth in trade at the extensive margin, we develop a firm level model based on the work of Helpman et al. (Q J Econ 123(2):441-487, 2008) of the decision to enter the export market. Using data from 129 countries and 144 industrial sectors, we then estimate this model for the years 1995 and 2005. We report evidence that rising firm-level productivity levels in our sample countries, either in overcoming the costs of direct exports or of engaging trade intermediates, provides the best explanation for the observed pattern of the growth in exporter-importer-product pairs.","[Husted, Steven] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA; [Nishioka, Shuichiro] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; West Virginia University,"Husted, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4508 WW Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15216 USA.",husted1@pitt.edu; Shuichiro.Nishioka@mail.wvu.edu,,,,,,,27,0,0,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

This has reduced the overload in the sub rank 1, enabled a better fluidity from the sub rank 2 to the sub rank 3, population of which has more than doubled, creating an stranglehold when going up to the sub rank 4. To understand the effects at the individual level, we offer two measures of net gains obtained from each promoted professors.

This view is influential both in moral philosophy, and in theoretical work on social choice-where it is captured by a social welfare function (SWF) summing a concave transformation of individual well-being numbers. However, prioritarianism has largely been ignored by scholarship on climate change. This Article compares utilitarianism and prioritarianism as frameworks for evaluating climate policy. It reviews the distinctive normative choices that are required for the prioritarian approach: specifying a ratio scale for well-being (if the prioritarian SWF takes the standard Atkinson form); determining the degree of concavity of the transformation function (i.e., the degree of social inequality aversion); and choosing between ex ante and ex post prioritarianism under conditions of risk. The Article also sketches some of salient implications of a prioritarian SWF for climate policy-with respect to the social cost of carbon, the social discount rate, optimal mitigation, and the dismal theorem. Finally, it discusses the issue of variable population.","[Adler, Matthew D.] Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Treich, Nicolas] INRA, Toulouse Sch Econ LERNA, F-31931 Toulouse, France",Duke University; INRAE; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Adler, MD (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sch Law, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",adler@law.duke.edu,"Treich, Nicolas/AAX-2608-2020","Treich, Nicolas/0000-0001-5840-4735",chair Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable (FDIR),chair Finance Durable et Investissement Responsable (FDIR),"This article grows out of presentations by the authors at conferences on climate change held at Duke University, Goteborg University, and Princeton University; at the conference of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (EAERE); and at the Snowmass modelling workshop.

Intergenerational human capital transmissions from mothers are stronger than those from fathers; maternal education is the parental capital most strongly associated with IGE. While nave IGE estimates are indistinguishable for sons and daughters, the pathways that generate these results differ strikingly. For sons, IGE is entirely explained by parent-to-child capital transmission.

While the single-sort momentum strategies returns 11.14% per annum, on average, a consistent reversal pattern of momentum profits is pronounced from 12 to 30 months after portfolio formation. Combining the observed reversal pattern with the momentum signal, our double-sort strategy returns 20.24% per annum, which significantly outperforms single-sort strategies. The proposed strategy is robust to seasonality effects and sample adjustments in commodity futures. The profitability of the double-sort strategy cannot be explained by standard risk factors, term structure, market volatility, investor sentiment, data-mining or transaction costs, but appears to be related to global funding liquidity. As a consequence, the double-sort strategy in commodity.futures may be employed as a portfolio diversification tool. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While both ABS and covered bonds were hit by the crisis, the former were hit more severely. Employing a disequilibrium model to identify credit rationing, we find that firms with banks that were more involved in securitization see their credit constraints more relaxed in normal periods. In contrast, only greater covered bonds issuance reduces credit rationing during crisis periods whereas ABS aggravates these firms' credit rationing in crisis periods. Our results are in line with the theoretical predictions that a securitization instrument that retains risk (covered bond) may induce a more prudent risk behavior of banks than an instrument that provides risk transferring (ABS).

We study this question in an open economy model in which imported food has a larger weight in domestic consumption than abroad and international risk sharing can be imperfect. A key novelty is that the real exchange rate and the terms of trade can move in opposite directions in response to world food price shocks. This exacerbates the policy trade-off between stabilizing output prices vis a vis the real exchange rate, to an extent that depends on risk sharing and the price elasticity of exports. We characterize implications for dynamics, optimal monetary policy, and the relative performance of practical monetary rules. While CPI targeting and expected CPI targeting can dominate PPI targeting if international risk sharing is perfect, even seemingly mild departures from the latter make PPI targeting a winner.

We find that on average WTP decreases by nearly one-fourth when allocating respondents time to think but markedly increases when we use a ballot box' approach allowing respondents to state their willingness privately. Our results suggest that on average households are willing to pay US$0.42 per month (0.2 per cent of household annual income).

This study contributes to this line of inquiry by proposing a methodology for identifying public transit gaps, a mismatch between the socially driven demand for transit and the supply provided by transit agencies. The methodology draws on the latest accomplishments in the field of modeling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport accessibility. Accessibility levels to key destinations are calculated at regular time intervals, and synoptic metrics of these levels over various peak and off-peak time windows are computed for weekdays and weekends. As a result a temporally reliable picture of accessibility by public transport is constructed. The obtained index of public transport provision is compared to a public transport needs index based on the spatial distribution of various socio-demographics, in order to highlight spatial mismatches between these two indices. The study area consists of Flanders, which is the northern, Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The results indicate that mainly suburban areas are characterized by high public transport gaps. Due to the time-variability of public transport frequencies, these gaps differ over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Hyperbolic discounting affects saving and portfolio decisions through at least two channels: (1) it lowers desired saving, which decreases financial wealth relative to future earnings; and (2) it lowers the incentive to pay a fixed cost to enter the stock market. We find that hyperbolic discounters accumulate less wealth relative to their geometric counterparts and that they participate in the stock market at a later age. Because they have lower levels of financial wealth relative to future earnings, hyperbolic discounters who do participate in the stock market tend to hold a higher share of equities, particularly in the retirement years. We find that increasing the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, holding risk aversion constant, greatly magnifies the impact of hyperbolic discounting on all of the model's decision rules and simulated levels of participation, allocation, and wealth. Finally, we introduce endogenous financial knowledge accumulation and find that hyperbolic discounting leads to lower financial literacy and inefficient stock market investment.","[Love, David; Phelan, Gregory] Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Love, D (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",david.love@williams.edu; gregory.phelan@williams.edu,,,,,,,52,5,6,1,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

Yet Jokowi has since placed greater value on realpolitik than on reform, as evidenced by his choice of cabinet members, his response to the controversy surrounding senior police officer Budi Gunawan, and his handling of attempts by the police and others to weaken Indonesia's respected Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). This article shows that Jokowi failed to deliver on his promises of reform largely owing to a combination of personal and external factors. He failed to show leadership on anticorruption and human-rights issues, for examplein part because he prefers economic development over democratic reform, but also because he is not immune to the oligarchic politics that dominate Indonesia's political life and promote the interests of Indonesia's elite.","[Muhtadi, Burhanuddin] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Muhtadi, B (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,"Muhtadi, Burhanuddin/GMW-6776-2022","Muhtadi, Burhanuddin/0000-0002-6043-6856",,,,,14,37,36,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Using the 2007 to 2009 Thai Labor Force Survey, this paper quantifies the incidence of overeducation and estimates overeducation wage penalties among male university graduates. The results show that the incidence of overeducation is greatest among younger cohorts. Quantile wage regression results suggest that overeducation wage penalties for older workers capture the impact of unobserved low ability on wages. In contrast, persistent wage penalties of 11-26% across the wage/ability distributions for younger workers are consistent with structural imbalances in the Thai labor market. These imbalances make it difficult for university graduates to find jobs commensurate with their level of formal education and to achieve their full earning power. The wage penalties are especially large for new entrants into the labor market.","[Paweenawat, Sasiwimon Warunsiri] Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Vechbanyongratana, Jessica] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",University Thai Chamber Commerce; Chulalongkorn University,"Paweenawat, SW (通讯作者)，Univ Thai Chamber Commerce, Sch Econ, 126-1 Vibhavadee Rangsit Rd, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.",sasiwimon_war@utcc.ac.th,"Paweenawat, Sasiwimon/AAE-3200-2022","Paweenawat, Sasiwimon/0000-0003-2636-0584; Vechbanyongratana, Jessica/0000-0003-2345-7962",University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,"We would like to thank the National Statistical Office of Thailand and the University of Chicago-UTCC Research Center at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce, Thailand, for access to the data used in this paper, and participants of the Chulalongkorn University-Nanyang Technological University Applied Economics Workshop for their helpful comments.

How individual consumers value such amenities, therefore, depends critically on the discount rate. The usual assumption is that agents discount future values using constant, exponential rate, but there is some evidence from the lab suggesting that discount functions are more likely quasi-hyperbolic. We compare estimates of subjects' rate of intertemporal time preference for financial rewards and environmental goods using multiple price-list and a new matrix multiple price list approaches. Our objective is to determine if discount functions for environmental and monetary goods differ, and to estimate the structure of discounting in both contexts. We find that financial discount functions are not hyperbolic, but those for environmental goods are. Discount rates for environmental goods are generally lower than for financial rewards, but are still above zero.

If the penalty for an incorrect forecast is greater than the reward for being right, the forecast cannot be informative because there is no investment in private information. Otherwise, costly private information is acquired as long as the information quality is moderate. Hence, the payoff structure under which the reward is greater than the penalty is a necessary condition for the investment in costly private information. Moreover, the acquired information is always revealed truthfully without herding or anti-herding. That is, the introduction of endogenous costly information raises the issue of free-riding rather than the issue of herding or anti-herding. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Additionally, they gave information about their real debts. It was observed that self-control was negatively related to debts while compulsive buying was positively related to debts. Detailed analyses revealed that the link between self-control and debts was fully mediated by compulsive buying. Finally, there was a gender effect on compulsive buying: women were more prone to compulsive buying than men.

Furthermore, financial risk has declined over the last 3 decades, indicating that any upward trend in equity volatility was driven entirely by economic risk factors.

Little is known about how these preferences are formed. It is hypothesised that parents may transmit their preferences to their offspring. This paper examines the correlation in offspring and parental time and risk preferences using data from an annual household survey in Australia (the HILDA survey). Both time and risk preferences are examined and we explored whether the correlation in time and risk preferences varies across the distribution of preferences and across the across the four parent-child dyads (mother/daughter, mother/son, father/daughter, father/son). The results show that there is a significant relationship between parents and their young adult offspring risk and time preference measures. The correlation varies across the distribution of time preferences. The correlation was largest for longer planning horizons. Risk averse parents are more likely to have risk averse children. Except for the father/daughter dyad risk seeking parents are more likely to have risk seeking offspring. Some gender differences were found. The association in parental and offspring time preference was larger for mothers than fathers. Daughters are more likely to be influenced by their mother's risk preferences, however, sons are equally influenced by both parents. The results of this study suggest that the transmission in preferences is more nuanced than previously thought and parental gender may be important. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We examine the role of exchange rates vs macroeconomic policies as determinants of current accounts for a set of 86 mainly emerging market economies between 1990 and 2013 to identify adjustment channels for global imbalances. We find that nominal exchange rates are not the main determinant of current account positions. Instead, depending on the region, monetary and/or fiscal policies are identified as the main driving force of current accounts. For East Asia and the oil exporting countries sterilization policies, i.e. relatively tight monetary policies, are the main determinants. In contrast for many European periphery countries fiscal policy stances are at the core of current account positions. Only for the Latin American countries does the exchange rate play a significant role as determinant of current account positions.","[Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Duarte, Pablo] Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University; Leipzig University,"Schnabl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimma Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,27,6,6,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Using survey data collected from 200 franchise operators of a single large hybrid organization, our results demonstrate how knowledge sharing and organizational learning are associated with the motivation, opportunity, and ability to act within the corporate entrepreneurial context. Moreover, this motivation, opportunity, and ability framework was observed to provide a complementary tool to traditional measures of CE (e.g., CEAI from Hornsby et al. in J Bus Ventur 17(3):253-273, 2002) as it provided insights into functional and process variables affecting corporate entrepreneurial activity.

To address these weaknesses, we propose collective individual DC plans that are actuarially fair. These schemes maintain important strengths of collective schemes, such as mandatory saving, collective procurement, and pooling of biometric risks. At the same time, they eliminate intergenerational conflicts about risk management and distribution through transparent individual property rights on financial assets and tailor-made risk profiles in individual accounts. We show how the transitional burden due to phasing out the back-loading of pension benefits can be addressed without a substantial increase in contributions.","[Bovenberg, Lans] Tilburg Univ, Econ & Management, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Gradus, Raymond] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Econ & Business Adm, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Gradus, R (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Econ & Business Adm, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",r.h.j.m.gradus@vu.nl,"GRADUS, RAYMOND/HLW-0327-2023","GRADUS, RAYMOND/0000-0002-4519-4633; Bovenberg, Lans/0000-0002-6933-0687",,,,,20,4,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1748-7870,1748-7889,,J ECON POLICY REFORM,J.

To this end, we construct a model in which government debt plays a key role in exchange, and can bear a liquidity premium. If asset market constraints bind, then there need not be deflation under an indefinite zero interest rate policy (ZIRP). Further, ZIRP may not be optimal under these circumstances. A Taylor-rule central banker could be subject to a ZIRP trap and persistently undershoot target inflation. As well, a liquidity premium on government debt creates additional Taylor rule perils, because of a persistently low real interest rate. We make a case that this is the key policy predicament currently faced by many central banks in the world. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Examining a WTI crude oil sample for the 2007-2013 period, which includes the global financial crisis and the Arab Spring, strong evidence is found of converse jump dynamics during periods of demand and supply side weakness.

Due to the housing reform and rapid suburbanization in China, various types of residential communities and diverse built environments coexist in the suburbs. Comparing how people's space-time fixity/flexibility varies among different community types and built environments can thus enhance our understanding of the transition process in Chinese cities. This study investigates how space-time fixity/flexibility and their relationships with the built environment vary among different types of residential communities in Beijing suburbs. Activity-travel diary and 7-day GPS tracking data of 709 respondents in Shangdi-Qinghe area of Beijing collected in 2012 were used. We investigate how variations in space-time flexibility are associated with built environment factors and four different community types: danwei communities, commodity housing communities, affordable housing communities and relocated housing communities, controlling for personal, household and activity attributes. The results suggest the influences of the built environments at residential place and activity place are different, and the relationships between space-time fixity and the built environments of different community types are different. Space-time fixity is not so sensitive to the built environment for residents in danwei communities and affordable housing communities. Gender and age differences in space-time fixity are not consistent with what was observed in Western countries. This seems to reflect the influence of unique social, cultural and family norms in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The index ETFs provide individual investors easy access to international stock markets and US sectors for asset allocations. Using cross-sectional momentum strategies, in contrast to prior research, I find that momentum profits are insignificant for the late 1990s-2014 period. Few country and industry ETFs yield positive results using time series momentum, and the overall performance is worse than the buy-and-hold strategy.

This strategy has two elements. First, for low-leverage values, the firm fully hedges its operating cash flow exposure, due to the convexity of its cost of capital. When leverage exceeds a very high threshold, the firm gambles for resurrection and stops hedging. Second, the firm manages its capital structure through dividend distributions and investment. When leverage is low, the firm replaces depreciated assets, fully invests in opportunities if they arise, and distribute dividends, all of these together to achieve its optimal capital structure. As leverage increases, the firm stops paying dividends, while fully investing. After a certain leverage, the firm also reduces investment until it stops investing completely.

Three components are identified: tax policy, labour supply responses to tax policy changes and other population effects. The methods are used to decompose inequality changes in Australia between 2001 and 2006. Inequality is first defined in non-welfarist terms as a function of disposable income: the independent judge places no value on leisure. Then, this is modified to allow for evaluations using a weighted geometric mean of disposable income and leisure. This is seen to modify the evaluation of changes in important ways. The results are found to differ from those obtained using a welfarist' evaluation in terms of money metric utility, where separate labour supply effects cannot be isolated.","[Creedy, John] Victoria Univ, Wellington Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia; [Creedy, John] New Zealand Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand; [Herault, Nicolas] Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Victoria University,"Creedy, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ, Wellington Business Sch, Melbourne, Vic 8001, Australia.",john.creedy@vuw.ac.nz; nherault@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390","Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI","Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","Nicolas Herault acknowledges the support of a Faculty Research Grant from the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne.

Current models of management succession focus on elements such as personal development of potential successors and decision-making processes by incumbents and governance bodies, but do not account for interactions among actors. This paper addresses this weakness using a game-theoretic approach applied to the setting of family businesses. We model a tournament-style game in which two siblings pursue the CEO position of a family business. In the course of our analysis, we consider a variety of factors, such as the predispositions of the founder to choose one sibling over the other, the value placed on winning the top job by each sibling, the cost for the siblings of pursuing the job, and the possibility of first-mover advantages. We close the paper by discussing implications of our work for both family businesses and corporations.","[Mathews, Timothy; Blumentritt, Tim] Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA",University System of Georgia; Kennesaw State University,"Mathews, T (通讯作者)，Kennesaw State Univ, Coles Coll Business, 1000 Chastain Rd, Kennesaw, GA 30144 USA.",tmmathews@gmail.com; tblument@kennesaw.edu,"Placido, Ivonete Telles Medei/P-6018-2016",,,,,,54,18,28,7,89,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Finally, we propose an extension of the corrected Dynamic Conditional Correlation (cDCC) model, which allows for structural breaks in the correlation dynamics. The suggested cDCC specification provides a natural testing framework for the correlation contagion hypothesis. Compared with other similar approaches, the proposed structural break cDCC approach allows for consistent inferences.

In particular, it investigated the cognitive and emotional processes that underpin utilitarian approaches to health care rationing such as Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Participants viewed hypothetical medical and nonmedical resource allocation scenarios which described equal or unequal allocation of resources to different groups. In addition, participants were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in which they either did or did not receive advanced instructions about the principles of utilitarianism. In all cases, participants were asked to judge the proposed allocations as fair or unfair. More brain activity was observed within the superior parietal lobe, angular gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and bilateral caudate nucleus when participants viewed scenarios depicting equal divisions of resources. Conversely, unequal resource divisions were associated with more activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and insula cortex. Furthermore, instructions about the principles of utilitarianism led to significant activation differences within the inferior frontal gyrus and the middle frontal gyrus. Significant differences in activity were also found within the inferior frontal cortex and anterior insula between medical and nonmedical scenarios. The implications for cognitive control mechanisms and the cognitive and neural bases of utilitarian ethical judgment are discussed.","[Smith, Lisa J.] Flinders Univ S Australia, Sch Psychol, Bedford Pk, SA, Australia; [Anand, Paul] Open Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Econ, Milton Keynes, Bucks, England; [Anand, Paul] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Publ Hlth, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Benattayallah, Abdelmalek] Univ Exeter, Exeter Magnet Resonance Imaging Res Ctr, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England; [Hodgson, Timothy L.] Lincoln Univ, Sch Psychol, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England",Flinders University South Australia; Open University - UK; University of Oxford; University of Exeter; University of Lincoln,"Hodgson, TL (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Psychol, Brayford Campus, Lincoln LN6 7TS, England.",tlhodgson@lincoln.ac.uk,,"Hodgson, Timothy/0000-0002-0860-8892; Benattayallah, Abdelmalek/0000-0001-8310-0434",,,,,59,5,6,0,19,EDUCATIONAL PUBLISHING FOUNDATION-AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"750 FIRST ST, NE, WASHINGTON, DC 20002-4242 USA",1937-321X,2151-318X,,J NEUROSCI PSYCHOL E,J.

But, when confidence becomes high, inefficient managers exerting low risk-prevention effort also enter. This stimulates growth, while reducing risk prevention. The longer the boom, the larger the losses if a shock occurs. Although these dynamics arise in the first-best, asymmetric information generates excessive entry of inefficient managers, earning informational rents, inflating the innovative sector, and increasing its vulnerability.","[Biais, Bruno] Toulouse Sch Econ CNRS CRM, Toulouse, France; [Biais, Bruno] IDEI PWRI, Rome, Italy; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Woolley, Paul] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Zurich; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Biais, B (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",bruno.biais@univ-tlse1.fr,,,,,,,32,13,15,2,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

We show that the volatility respectively, of output, of the growth rate of output and of real interest rates in Hong Kong are higher than the corresponding average volatility among developed economies. Furthermore, interest rates are countercyclical. We build a stochastic neoclassical small open-economy model estimated with a Bayesian likelihood approach that seeks to replicate the main business cycle characteristics of Hong Kong, and through which we try to quantify the role played by exogenous total factor productivity (TFP) shocks (transitory and permanent), real interest rate shocks and financial frictions. The main finding is that financial frictions, jointly with the assumption that the country spread is endogenous, seem important in explaining the countercyclicality of the real interest rates.","[Etxeberria-Garaigorta, Paulina; Iza, Amaia] Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Iza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, UPV EHU, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",amaia.iza@ehu.es,"Iza, Amaia/H-1971-2015","Iza, Amaia/0000-0002-3142-0038","Basque Government (DEUI) [IT-793-13]; Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad, MEC [ECO2012-35820]; UPV/EHU [UFI 11/46 BETS]","Basque Government (DEUI)(Basque Government); Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad, MEC; UPV/EHU","The authors thank Cruz Angel Echevarra and Stefano Siviero for useful comments.

Econometric results suggest that there is little evidence that the U.S. manufacturing firms facing antidumping actions abroad are beneficiaries of a home market sanctuary during the 1994-2007 time period.

Buchanan's anti-hierarchy stance owes something to the rural populist background of his early years. That stance also explains something about his professional and individual personality: his contentment to remain at non-elitist institutions; his preparedness to challenge establishment thinking on the nature and role of government; his antagonism to inherited wealth and the privileges of dynasty; and his life-long affection for elements of the simple rural life.

The gap in average wages between men and women decreased by 31% over this period. This paper shows that a key driver of this change was an improvement in female educational qualifications. It also demonstrates that the gender wage gap across the wage distribution narrowed much more at the lower end of the wage distribution than at the upper end. It attributes this mainly to a decline in discrimination against women. Implications for policies aimed at more equal access to education and enforcement of equal pay legislation in Bangladesh are also identified. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Uninsured depositors can exert market discipline over a bank and potentially reduce its agency cost of debt through informed monitoring. We use a sample of public bond issues by U.S. bank holding companies from 1994 to 2013 and find statistically strong evidence that banks with more uninsured deposits relative to their assets issue bonds with a lower interest rate. Findings suggest a one standard deviation increase in uninsured deposits is associated with a 46-64 basis point decrease in bond yield. In addition, we find that bonds issued by banks with higher default risk or lower reputation benefit more from uninsured savers. Our paper contributes to the literature that explores market discipline and provides evidence that banks can benefit from it through a lower borrowing cost. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is unlikely, however, that this rate-hike cycle will feature a predictable 25 basis-point rise at each and every meeting once it begins. Instead, the Fed will, I believe, opt to deliver a path of policy normalization even more gradual than the path it delivered in 2004-06. This will be owed, at least in part, to the difficulty it will confront in estimating the neutral policy rate with any precision, as well as to the fact that this cycle is likely to begin with an inflation rate that will have been running below its 2% target since that target was first announced in 2012. The Fed will nonetheless begin to hike because it is forecasting that inflation will rise as unemployment falls to - or even below - its estimate of the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). Because of the slowdown in the United States and global potential growth, however, as well as a persistent excess of global saving relative to desired investment opportunities, I expect that, for at least the next couple of years and likely for some time beyond, the neutral Fed policy rate consistent with mandate-implied levels of unemployment and inflation will lie in the range of 2-3% in nominal terms, well below the pre-crisis estimates of 4%.","[Clarida, Richard] Columbia Univ, C Lowell Harriss Prof Econ & Int Affairs, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Clarida, Richard] US Treasury, Econ Policy, Washington, DC USA",Columbia University; United States Department of the Treasury,"Clarida, R (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, C Lowell Harriss Prof Econ & Int Affairs, 116th St & Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",Rhc2@columbia.edu,,,,,,,16,6,7,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

We use a probit framework to predict recessions, as defined by the NBER between 1959Q1 and 2011Q4. We find that combining the yield curve parameter with the stock market liquidity deviation significantly improves our ability to predict the onset of a US recession, based both on in-sample and out-of-sample tests. In addition, changes in stock market depth further increase the accuracy of the model. We suggest that economic forecasters and those charged with conducting economic stabilization policy more generally would benefit from monitoring not only the yield curve but also stock market depth and liquidity, and their deviation from one another.","[Erdogan, Oral] Piri Reis Univ, Istanbul, Turkey; [Bennett, Paul] Fordham Univ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA; [Ozyildirim, Cenktan] Istanbul Bilgi Univ, Beyoglu, Turkey",Piri Reis University; Fordham University; Istanbul Bilgi University,"Erdogan, O (通讯作者)，Piri Reis Univ, Istanbul, Turkey.",,"Erdogan, Oral/AAL-3208-2020; ERDOGAN, ORAL/G-2900-2018","ERDOGAN, ORAL/0000-0002-9508-5777; OZYILDIRIM, CENKTAN/0000-0002-0641-8630",,,,,35,19,21,1,27,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

Nevertheless, theoretical insights into the agency problems inherent when hiring PMSCs and how to optimally incentivize them are scarce. We study the complex relationship between intervening state, host state, and PMSC, taking into account the diverging interests of all involved parties as well as potential agency problems. We develop a theoretical model to characterize a state's optimal choice whether to perform a task associated with an intervening mission itself, or hire a PMSC and optimally design the contract We find that it might be optimal to hire PMSCs even if they are expected to do a worse job than the intervening state would do itself. Furthermore, the government's reputation in rewarding PMSCs for a good performance is crucial and might render it optimal to only deal with a limited number of PMSCs who are not necessarily always the most efficient providers.

We used event-related functional MRI to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying intertemporal preference for symmetric monetary gains and losses, by asking subjects to choose between 2 gains or 2 losses available at different time delays. We also explored how neural networks are modulated by time delay and by the monetary difference between the 2 alternatives. Our findings indicate that a common widespread neural network involving occipital, parietal, and prefrontal cortex is activated in the processing of both gains and losses, thus suggesting that the same brain structures support different economically relevant behaviors, independently of the sign of the outcome. Two different neural circuits were found to be engaged in processing immediate and delayed monetary outcomes. Regions of the emotional system, namely, posterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortex, were recruited when an immediate option (gain/loss) was chosen.

Our analysis of Korea's 1997-98 crisis suggests an answer: No. Despite a general no bailout policy during the crisis, the largest Korean corporate groups-facing severe financial and governance problems-could still borrow heavily from households by issuing bonds at prices implying very low expected default risk. The evidence suggests too big to fail beliefs were not eliminated by government promises because investors believed that this policy was not time consistent.

However, they are also 'foes,' because at the later stage the venture capitalists no longer need the angels. Using a costly search model we derive the equilibrium deal flows across the two markets, endogenously deriving market sizes, competitive structures, valuation levels, and exit rates.

CDS trading initiation is associated with a 30-150 basis point reduction in sovereign bond yields, with greater yield reductions accruing to higher default risk economies. For countries with high default risk, rated B or lower by Standard and Poor's, CDS initiation is also associated with significant price efficiency benefits in the underlying market. CDS trading initiation is more likely following increases in local equity index volatility, index spreads for regional and global CDS markets, or depreciation of the local currency relative to the US dollar, and decreases in a country's ability to service foreign debt.

Multi-measurements of the 'distress intensity of default-corpus' (DIDC) using linguistic analysis are constructed, whilst also examining the explanatory power of the DIDC on financial distress events. The DIDC related to the distressed firms rises significantly prior to the distressed event and the volatility of the DIDC for them exhibits more fluctuations than for the non-distressed companies. Besides, we propose a systematic process for the evaluation of default ratings, with the results for all listed stocks in the Taiwan Stock Market showing that the accuracy of the model with the incorporation of the DIDC outperforms other candidate models. Financial institutions and credit rating agencies could effectively adjust firms' ratings by referring to both the general default rating model and financial media reports.

The novelties of our contribution lie in the use of annual panel data, whereas most of the existing evidence is cross-sectional, and more importantly in the thorough investigation of how fiscal rules affect the policy-macroeconomic stability relationship. We find that the aggressive use of discretionary fiscal policy, particularly of government consumption items, leads to higher volatility of output and, to a lesser extent, inflation. However, when strict fiscal rules are introduced, discretionary policy becomes output-stabilising rather than destabilising. This result can be more easily achieved by rules on balanced budgets, rather than on expenditures, revenues, or debt. On the other hand, fiscal rules are unable to affect the inflationd-estabilising nature of discretionary policy, if any, probably because of the higher importance of central banks in that respect.

We use different network measures to capture underwriter centrality in the global network, cohesion and diversity within network, and prior industry experience of network partners. Our results show that IPOs underwritten by book managers with more central and cohesive networks and partners with previous industry experience are associated with a higher likelihood of an offer price revision and larger price revisions. We also find book managers with more central networks and partners with previous industry experience are associated with higher short-run stock returns, while book managers that maintain more reciprocated peer relationships tend to underprice more. These results indicate that underwriters use peer networks to produce infotmation and place securities, and network structure and characteristics have implications for the quantity and quality of information and the level of cooperative efforts shared among underwriters.

Due to large initial capital costs for renewable energy projects, investment cost reduction policies are often employed by policy makers as complementary support measures. In this note, we study some implications of the use of investment cost reduction policies in an energy market operated under a green certificate system. We demonstrate that, paradoxically, use of (or intensification of) investment cost reduction policies results in increased emissions from fossil fuel (black) producers. Welfare effects depend on the distribution of costs and benefits to the relevant interest groups. However, if the policy objective requires maintaining a constant level of emissions, investment cost mitigation must be accompanied by a simultaneous upward adjustment in the renewables target.","Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA",Oklahoma State University System; Oklahoma State University - Stillwater,"Currier, KM (通讯作者)，Oklahoma State Univ, Spears Sch Business, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA.",kevin.currier@okstate.edu,,,,,,,12,7,8,2,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The model is intended to be applied to decisions related to tactical planning over a time span of one year. The major spatial and temporal components of the soybean complex, including transportation mode decisions, are incorporated into the model. The mathematical model is described in detail. Several stochastic parameters are used with fixed values in the deterministic model to construct various scenarios. These parameters are the purchase and sale prices of the grain on the market, the crop failure rate and the volumes of demand.

J,"Baglioni, A",,,,"Baglioni, Angelo",,,LEVERAGED BUYBACKS OF SOVEREIGN DEBT: A MODEL AND AN APPLICATION TO GREECE,CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,OVERHANG,"The model presented in this article shows that the outcome of a leveraged buyback of sovereign debt depends on the priority structure of the deal. If the institution lending the funds needed for the buyback is senior, the debtor country benefits from the deal: the government debt is reduced, implying a lower probability of default; at the same time, the deal makes the price of outstanding bonds go down, since their recovery rate declines. The opposite holds if the lending institution is junior. If the loan is underpriced, the implied subsidy is shared between the borrowing country and its bondholders, who can benefit from a price increase of their bonds.

The study examines a cross section of farm-level data gathered from 556 randomly selected livestock producers to investigate the profit efficiency and competitiveness of three farm size categories of small holder livestock farmers. Results found a considerable capacity to improve beef profitability. Scale effects on profit efficiency are generally positive, but the results indicate a number of interactions between scale and other variables such as off-farm income and the use of credit.

Extending Panzar and Rosse's (1987) model to the case of a multi-product banking firm, we show that higher economies of scope in multi-product banking are associated with lower Panzar-Rosse measures of competition in the banking sector. To test this empirical implication and determine the impact of multi-production on market power, we use a new dataset on the Brazilian banking industry. Consistent with our theoretical prediction, we find that banks that offer classic banking products (i.e., loans and credit cards) and other banking products (i.e., brokerage services, insurance and capitalization bonds) have substantially higher market power than banks that offer only classic products. These results suggest a positive bias in the traditional estimates of competition in which multi-output actions are not considered. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This development is referred to as New Public Management, and has resulted in more competition, the need for adaptions to the market, and several new organizational forms. Purpose of Study: To discuss effective use of resources in the public management sector in Norway. Sources of Evidence: One key aspect in the public sector is that in addition to emphasizing good service, the public sector also has an additional responsibility to provide an additional service or an extended product to its customers. A problem in this context may be to measure the effectiveness of this due to vague and unclear goals. Another important aspect when it comes to efficient use of resources in the public sector is that it may be difficult to observe or verify what the quality of a product or service really is. It could therefore be problematic to draw conclusions about what effective use of resources really is. Main Argument: Regardless of how one chooses to define efficient use of resources in the public sector, it will be up to the politicians to decide whether the services provided by the public sector have a high enough value in relation to the actual use of resources. Conclusions: We conclude that there exist several major challenges regarding how to measure the creation of value in the public sector within the domain of New Public Management.

Taken together, the results are broadly consistent with theories of investor sentiment.","[Da, Zhi; Gao, Pengjie] Univ Notre Dame, Mendoza Coll Business, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Engelberg, Joseph] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Engelberg, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, Dept Finance, 9500 Gilman Dr 0553, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jengelberg@ucsd.edu,,"Gao, Pengjie/0009-0005-1758-2259","TrimTabs, Inc.","TrimTabs, Inc.","We thank Nick Barberis, Shane Corwin, Jennifer Conrad, David Hirshleifer (the editor), Bob Jennings, Shimon Kogan, Ralph Koijen, Owen Lamont, Paul Schultz, Andrei Shleifer, Paul Tetlock, Dick Thaler, Jeff Wurgler, Yu Yuan, two anonymous referees and seminar participants at University of Notre Dame, State of Indiana Annual Conference, the 2010 NBER Behavioral Economics meeting and the WFA 2010 meeting for helpful comments and discussions.

From this perspective, the internal audit, which is an objective and independent function, through its formulated opinions and recommendations, it supplies reasonable insurances to the management, which gives it an essential role in the frame of the analysed relationship.

The eurozone has always been criticized for its strange architecture - i. e. for creating a monetary union without centralized fiscal policy. Despite the criticism of economists a political approach prevailed - the leaders of the EU, especially Helmut Kohl and Francois Mitterrand declared the Euro to be a question of future peace in Europe and hoped that a deeper fiscal and political integration will follow. The current situation in the eurozone, especially debates about a possible Grexit, revived the discussion about the necessity of further fiscal integration. The economic logic of a centralized fiscal policy stands against the political unwillingness of the majority of member states of the EU. A transfer union where some countries will permanently finance the lack of competitiveness of others is currently an unacceptable notion. Besides of its economic implications, the loss of national sovereignty can also promote a strong populist and right wing reaction. Euroskeptic forces in European governments would lead to a less dynamic Europe and bring the integration process to a halt. Milton Friedman warned already in 1997 that a monetary unity imposed in unfavorable conditions will prove a barrier to the achievement of political unity. These words proved to be prophetic. The question for discussion is whether the management of the debt crisis in the eurozone brought the Fiscal Union closer or made it even less thinkable.","[Dudasova, Marianna] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Dudásová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",marianna.dudasova@euba.sk,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,6,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,147,157,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500017,0

Residuals were determined based on calculated trends in the indicators and through residuals of time series the correlation between the level of education of the population and unemployment came out as indirect and low to moderate. The same result was obtained from correlations between indicators for the set of data from particular EU countries in 2011.

In Romania, throughout the period of transition, there has been a strong tendency towards social polarization. The economic inequalities also had a long term, systematic character. The economic divisions and poverty are, at first sight, purely economic phenomena. The market decides who is rich and who is poor, who will have the desired standard of life and who will experience material deprivation. A deeper analysis will reveal, however, that, at least in a poor country, as Romania, the division of society on poor people and rich people has genetic and functional connections with the social and political order. Why are the rich people rich and the poor people poor? Which is the key to accomplishment which the people seek and treasure? Whom are we to hold responsible for success or failure in getting the desired standard of life: the individual characters or the social contexts? How much of the variance (and hierarchy) of welfare is due to the individual characters and how much to the structural ones? Agent or structure?

An important challenge in assessing the impact of these policies is selection bias with respect to relatively time-invariant country characteristics, as well as time-varying values of outcome variables and other policy choices. This paper addresses this challenge by using propensity-score matching to estimate how major reserve sales, large currency depreciations, substantial changes in policy interest rates, and increased controls on capital outflows affect real GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation during two periods marked by crises, 1997-2001 and 2007-11. We find that none of these policies yield significant improvements in growth, unemployment, and inflation. Instead, a large increase in interest rates and new capital controls are estimated to cause a significant decline in GDP growth. Sharp currency depreciations may raise GDP growth over time, but only with a lagged effect and after an initial contraction.","[Forbes, Kristin J.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Management & Global Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Klein, Michael W.] Tufts Univ, Fletcher Sch, Int Econ Affairs, Medford, MA 02155 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Tufts University,"Forbes, KJ (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Management & Global Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,36,22,27,0,9,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

It is found that in the Great Inflation (GI) period-though not quite in the Great Moderation (GM)-the two estimations imply a significantly different covariance structure. Regarding the parameters, special emphasis is placed on the degree of backward-looking behaviour in the Phillips curve. While, in line with much of the literature, it plays a minor role in the Bayesian estimations, MM yields values of the price indexation parameter close to or even at its maximal value of unity. For both GI and GM, these results are worth noticing since in (strong or, respectively, weak) contrast to the Bayesian parameters, the covariance matching thus achieved appears rather satisfactory.

The aim of this paper, is to give an idea of the most appropriate valuation method that has to be used for a company, taking under consideration its unique characteristics. We focus on valuing companies that belong to the food sector. We chose to study the valuation procedures that are being used by a public and a private company, while also identifying the differences between them. Particular emphasis was shed on the valuation using the Three Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity (3st-FCFE) method. Methods used, were chosen taking under consideration the characteristics of each company, previous testing and the possibility to attain superior estimates towards a company's prospects. After the application of each method, in each company, we proceeded with the interpretation of the results, and we noted the difficulties and problems that were faced during the application of each method, both for the public and the private Company. In the final part of this paper, we compare the valuation methods that were used, and we conclude as to which one is the most appropriate method for each type of firm as well as to some policy recommendations for the food sector in Greece.

In Malaysia, the government spends more than RM150 billion a year in procuring goods and services and this is a sign that the riskiness of public procurement being exposed to corruption and the involvement of lobbyist. Malaysian government has introduced Anti-Corruption Initiatives aims to reduce the corruption practice through lobbyist in the public procurement. The involvement of lobbyists in the public procurement contributes to the leakages of public funds since they offer higher price. They resort to bribery in order to get the information related with the procurement from the officers and then they will sell the information to other interested suppliers at a high price. Hence this study aims to explore how the principles of Anti-Corruption Initiatives which consists of legal and regulatory, transparency, accountability and integrity could reduce lobbyist involvement in the e-procurement system (SPE System). This qualitative single case study interviewed five procurement officers and three suppliers of MARDI who had been using the system since 2011. The study found that these principles were relevant and important in reducing the involvement of lobbyist. The combination of the principles in the system was needed to ensure that the lobbyist involvement remained very minimal. In addition, it helps to build and increase public trust and the people's confidence level on the management of public funds by the procurement officers in the public sector. The participants in the study held the belief that the level of corruption in the public procurement activities would be reduced if such principles were present within the electronic procurement system (C) 2015 The Authors.

This complexity is challenging for the econometrician, who relies either on single-country data to identify challenges for regulation or on cross-country data to assess the overall effects of regulation.

In this study, we report results of two experiments in which a material misstatement occurs intentionally (fraud) or inadvertently (error). Shareholders suffer a loss (or no adverse consequence). Experienced auditors (Certified Public Accountants [CPAs]) and a control group of university students assess the appropriateness of the auditor's conduct and specify a penalty. Experiment 1 results show that CPAs are not influenced by management's intentions or outcomes. Students are responsive to outcomes but not to management's intentions.

A stochastic frontier model with inefficiency effects is fitted to an unbalanced panel dataset of 31 government-linked companies (GLCs) listed at Malaysia's Stock Exchange (Bursa Malaysia) over a period of 12 years (2001-2012). The results of the analysis reveal the government's shareholdings have significantly improve productive efficiency over time, although the link is weak. The insignificant positive link between ownership concentration and inefficiency, and between board ownership and inefficiency, imply high ownership concentration and board ownership are not effective corporate governance mechanism in improving efficiency. Although there is a strong evidence to show government ownership is positively related to productive efficiency, having high ownership concentration tend to influence inefficiency, concurring earlier studies that highly concentrated shareholding with complex pyramidal and cross-holdings ownership can signal underlying performance vulnerability in the long run. The study also observes that gradual but slow improvement in the GLCs efficiency levels, and that output generation has been labour-using and capital-saving over time. (C) 2015 The Authors.

While intelligence refers to our ability to manage information so one can use them for delivering results, emotional intelligence can be defined as the ability of effective observation, expression, understanding and management of one's own and other people's emotions in a positive and productive way. Recent research carried out in developed countries has shown that a good leader, among other things, should express high level of emotional intelligence in order to successfully impact a group of people, which ultimately leads to achieving a common goal. However, in the developing countries, there is a clear lack of empirical studies that tested the relationship of emotional intelligence and leadership styles in different business, social and cultural circumstances. The main objective of this study is to empirically establish the relationship between emotional intelligence and leadership styles in health sector of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The relation of these two concepts is tested using three tests on the sample of 159 managers. The first test, UEK-45, determines the emotional competences or emotional intelligence of the sample. It was developed by Vladimir Taksic, a professor at the Faculty of Philosophy in Rijeka, and its validity was confirmed in his doctoral dissertation in 1998. This test is a customized version of the famous MSCEIT test of emotional intelligence (Mayer, Salovey and Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test). The second test, LBDQ (LeaderBehavior Description Questionnaire), determines respondents' behavior orientation. It was developed by Stogdill in 1963. The third test, PGTQ (Path-Goal Theory Questionnaire), determines respondents' dominant leadership styles. Hypothesized relationship was tested using descriptive statistics and correlation method. As a result, a high degree of correlation between emotional intelligence and leadership styles in the tested sample has been established.","[Husakovic, Dijana] Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zenica,"Husakovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg.",harun.kahvedzic@gmail.com; dijana.husakovic@ef.unze.ba,,,,,,,33,0,0,2,6,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,506,520,,,,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700031,0

It was supposed that shadow economy effects positively on the level of life (as shadow income increased total revenues). But it can impact negatively on the quality of life. The relationship between growth of life level and quality of life depends from the level of the shadow economy. Some of studies demonstrate the link of shadow economy with the separate quality of life indicators. However, in that cases, the quality of life is the casual variable, witch changes leads to the changes in the latent variable (the shadow economy). Our task is to determine the reverse effect - the shadow economy on the quality of life. At the initial stage of our analysis, the original sample of 150 countries was divided into 5 groups, according to the shadow economy size. Than the average values of each indicator for each cluster was calculated. Next, the determination a regression equation for each cluster and for general sample was done. For this purpose we use averages for each indicator for the period of 1999-2007. As a result of regression analysis, we found that life expectancy at birth and Children in-school rate are significant for each cluster and for the whole sample. The level of life increases according to the shadow economy's growth. In the same time, life quality indicators which reflects a long and healthy life and access to knowledge - decreases.The regression coefficient increases with the growth of the shadow economy. Our results demonstrate the correctness of the hypothesis about interrelationship between shadow economy and life quality. (C)2015 The Authors.

This article first describes the volatility of the Czech koruna and euro interest rates using the GARCH model. Based on this description, relationships between levels of koruna and euro swaptions volatilities are determined. After obtaining estimates of koruna swaptions implied volatilities, the BGM interest rate model is applied to Czech koruna and euro interest rate simulations. They are then compared with the real development of given interest rates. It turns out that although the BGM model was developed for the purpose financial derivatives valuation in the environment of developed and liquid financial markets without significant distortions, resulting simulations are relatively good, and their use can improve interest rate risk management even in the Czech environment.","[Kralova, Dana Cichova] Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Králová, DC (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, W Churchill Sq 4, CZ-13067 Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xkrad900@vse.cz,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

This prominent Muslim endowment mechanism was reported to have successfully created pools of fund and properties which were administered and managed by the appointed authorities (trustees) for the purpose of syariah compliance charitable activities. Despite of its proven capability and character in assisting the development of Muslim nation, today, waqf institutions are reported to have merely mild contribution particularly to the improvement of Muslim community in Malaysia. Based on scholarly reviews, several explanations and suggestions for improvement were discussed and offered to rectify the polemical situation. One of the issues highlighted was on the low level of understanding among the local Muslim on the concept of waqf. The main objective of the present paper is to propose a small scale waqf project named as Mikro-Waqaf: PayungTeduhan Ilmu (MWPTI). The aim of this innovative project is to rejuvenate waqf as well as to improve the awareness on the concept of waqf among Muslim community in an academic institution in Malaysia.

Despite the fact that no crucial changes in the world labour division are expected, the globalization character can be modified.","[Neumann, Pavel] Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Neumann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",neumann@vse.cz,,,,,,,20,9,9,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-145-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,498,504,,,,,,7,Economics; International Relations,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations,BE3SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371199400066,0

This research argues that the usage of the blended learning web tools could address the concern of the Halatuju 2 on student-centered learning in the Malaysian Institute of Accountants (MIA) accredited universities. However, in Malaysia, little is known on how has blended learning web tool been used in the accounting courses. Therefore, this research presented a qualitative study on a blended learning web tool, known as Blendspace, utilised in the Public Sector Accounting course, offered at the MIA accredited university. The first objective of this research was to report how frequent the 124 accounting students used the Blendspace. Secondly, it explained the influencing factors of the Blendspace usage from the experience of five accounting students. Thirdly, it recommended how the usage of Blendspace can be improved. Data were collected through multiple data sources namely from the documents' review, phone interviews and observation. The findings reported the usage frequency, factors of Blendspace usage (ease of use, usefulness and accounting students' attitude). In the perspective of theoretical contribution, this research extends the concepts in the student involvement theory using the blended learning. For this case, since the Blendspace was utilised for the first time in the public sector accounting course, the findings from this research would enhance the usability of the Blendspace in the current and other accounting courses.

Within this framework, many CEE companies have started to implement the principles of corporate governance. The present paper aims to comparatively analyze the progress reported in the implementation of corporate governance principles in the CEE states, having as a starting point the most significant study conducted by World Bank. The results have shown that in this region the stage of the implementation of corporate governance differs significantly from one country to another. Thus, in the case of companies from Poland and Lithuania, the application of corporate governance principles reaches its highest level, while the companies from Czech Republic and Bosnia-Herzegovina register the weakest performances. At the same time, our study highlights that the progress made in the implementation of corporate governance is weak and concerted efforts of public authorities and market actors are needed. In this context, we have made certain proposals of public policy.","[Onofrei, Mihaela; Oprea, Florin; Anton, Sorin Gabriel] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Onofrei, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Iasi, Romania.",onofrei@uaic.ro; foprea@uaic.ro; sorin.anton@uaic.ro,"Onofrei, Mihaela/K-3668-2015; Anton, Sorin/P-5613-2014","Anton, Sorin/0000-0001-7124-9274",,,,,7,1,1,0,38,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,728,741,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600072,0

Internet domain names as an IS-IT representative have a significance for the EU business par excellence, the Agribusiness. They can perform a myriad of functions and impact Agribusiness. How real is this potential and to what extent and with which intensity is it realized to increase the efficiency of Czech and Austrian Agribusinesses? A study of this IS-IT economic and legal sphere is completed by the investigation and comparison of the employment of domain names registered and used by rather homogenous Czech and Austrian Agribusiness subjects, organic farmers. Three sets of data were researched and explored. Secondary data about domain names and Agribusiness were scrutinized, a search of TLDs databases of Registry Operators, Whois, etc. was performed, and the inconsistencies between these data were addressed by inquiries. The potential functions and importance of domain names for Agribusiness was confirmed and a forensic and target quantitative assessment of Czech and Austrian Agribusiness domain names was conducted along with partial qualitative multi-disciplinary remarks from areas linguistic, economics, etc. Their comparison and evaluation relied on induction and on feedback earned based on direct inquiries of selected subjects. A new perspective regarding the underestimated potential of domain names and Agribusiness is offered. EU, Czech and Austrian policies share the same conceptual tenor, but the contextual and multidisciplinary analysis with a complementary inquiry and ad hoc investigations suggests an information gap, and especially Czech farmer's reduced awareness about the significance of domain names for Agribusiness allowing speculation. Further study needs to be done to reverse this trend.","[Pelikanova, Radka MacGregor] CULS Prague, Dept Law, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Pelikánová, RM (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Law, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",radkamacgregor@yahoo.com,"MacGregor, Robert/E-9858-2019; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/G-2601-2018","MacGregor, Robert/0000-0003-2888-3880; MacGregor Pelikanova, Radka/0000-0001-9628-7146",,,,,21,0,0,0,0,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,248,255,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600027,0

This is a current problem in the face of the financial crisis, where diversification of household savings portfolio that provides security to households under changing economic conditions gains significance. The aim of this research is to present one of the constituents of this portfolio - unit-linked life insurances where the investment risk is borne by the policy holder - compared to other savings products available on the Polish market in the years 2004-2013. In order to set the mathematical model that describes the variable, i.e. a provision in unit-linked life insurances where the investment risk is borne by the policy holder, the analysis of multiple regression has been carried out.

In addition to including common explanatory variables, we focus on the effects of different indicators of soil characteristics when explaining land rental prices. The analysis is based on data from the official farm census 1999, weather data from the German National Meteorological Service and different soil data-bases at the county level. Different classifications of soil quality do not influence the results of our Ricardian analysis. The results of spatial error models indicate higher land rental prices for locations with more productive soils and higher mean annual temperatures. Also a lower land slope, a smaller share of rented land and (in some cases) less spring precipitation increase land rental prices. To estimate the effects of changing climatic conditions on future land rents, we draw on data from the regional climate model REMO for 2011-2040. Our models show an average land rent increase of 10-17% resulting from the expected changes in temperature and spring precipitation. According to our results future climate change will have an overall positive but spatially heterogeneous impact on the agricultural income in Germany.","[Schmidtner, Eva; Dabbert, Stephan; Lippert, Christian] Univ Hohenheim, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Schmidtner, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Landwirtschaftliche Betriebslehre 410a, Sch Osthof Sud, D-70593 Stuttgart, Germany.",eva.schmidtner@uni-hohenheim.de,,,"German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)","German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG))","This research was funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG).",,42,1,1,1,17,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The first step could be that appropriate data transfer interfaces are developed between the existing ICT systems, VEETI and MIS systems of the utility.

Information and data saved in the information system have become one of the most important corporate assets, especially when used in connection with relevant experience and knowledge. Farmers need to make their decisions on the basis of quality data and information. Primary data are typically recorded while their content is not exploited at all - unless they are further processed and used for analyses, modelling and simulations. Agriculture is a very specific sector - it is therefore very hard to use modules of the management information systems made primarily for other industries. Farm management information systems allow users to perform analyses, simulations and modelling. In the Czech Republic, information and data mining for managerial purposes in the agrarian sector has been on a very low level in the long-term. The survey showed that only 7% of companies use Business Intelligence software while almost 80% of companies struggle with the lack of information which they cannot retrieve from their information system. Moreover, 8% of the companies make their decision intuitively, without having their decisions justified. In order to enhance the support for decision- making processes, a structure suitable for data processing and use (reports) has been designed. Proposing a convenient model that would allow simultaneous access to data from all units of the company should result in a significant competitiveness increase during the entire decision-making process. The managers have to define - based on their knowledge and experience - the data and information to be converted into a consolidated and integrated database for the Business Intelligence.","[Silerova, Edita; Junek, Pavel] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Hennyeyova, Klara] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Informat, FEM, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Vogeltanzova, Tereza] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Silerová, E (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Informat Technol, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",silerova@pef.czu.cz; klara.hennyeyova@uniag.sk; vogeltanzova@pef.czu.cz; junek@pef.czu.cz,,,,,,,13,4,4,0,14,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,425,432,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600048,0

The tests confirmed positive correlation between company performance and its reinvestment rate but failed to find any correlation between company performance and the aggressive financing strategy.","[Strnadova, Michala; Reznakova, Maria; Karas, Michal] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Finance, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Strnadová, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Finance, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",strnadova@fbm.vutbr.cz; reznakova@fbm.vutbr.cz; karas@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Karas, Michal/HDN-2653-2022; Karas, Michal/C-1261-2018; Reznakova, Maria/AAQ-6282-2020","Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Karas, Michal/0000-0001-8824-1594; Reznakova, Maria/0000-0002-7261-607X",,,,,31,1,1,0,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,552,560,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200073,0

Important factors like work performance and motivation for fulfilling the company goals are present in companies where the private life is in line with the professional one. The main goal of the European policy Europe 2020 - which has replaced the Strategy of Lisbon - is the improvement of work conditions and job quality, increase of gender equality on the job market as well as reduction of structural unemployment.

Field interviews were conducted in a randomly selected sample consisting of 265 people in REMTh in summer 2013. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the main factors that affect tourists to make vacation in REMTh. These factors were: (a) Travel connections and tourist infrastructures (b) natural environment (c) vacation activities, (d) entertainment, (e) culture and (f) value for money. Hierarchical and non hierarchical cluster techniques were employed to classify tourists with similar behaviour. Three groups of tourists were identified: (a) those interested in the vacation activities, entertainment and culture (b) opportunists, (c) those interested in natural environment and (d) those interested in travel connections, tourist infrastructures and value for money. Discriminant Analysis was performed to assess how the identified main factors affecting tourists to have holidays in REMTh through PCA, could predict cluster membership.

On that basis, the computer rendering reinforces the display of the artistic charms of the ceramic textures so that it can compose more ornamental artistic works and improve the public's understanding of traditional ceramics, provides new ideas for the digitalized communication of Chinese intangible cultural heritages.","[Wang, Dong; Zheng, Chunhui] Harbin Inst Technol, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Wang, D (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, 92 West Dazhi St, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",wd_tju_hit@163.com; chunhuizheng@hit.edu.cn,,,,,,,10,2,2,5,16,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,615,619,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700122,0

Structural changes in this industry, under different economic and regulatory conditions, matters a great deal to the shareholders, top managers, and employees of the banks involved. But it also matters due to the fact that its performance affects all economic sectors and the fate of global economies. In the last two decades, banks have expanded their business to serve global customers. It is vital to know how banks are now reevaluating their M&A strategies based on the current global economic situation. The banking M&As experiences and practices that have been well proven in the traditional economic conditions are hitting their limitations in the global world. This paper contributes to the management literature by analyzing the underlying drivers of the M&As process, the economic concepts and strategic precepts used to justify M&A deals, and the synergy potential of M&As.","[Warter, Liviu; Warter, Iulian] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Warter, L (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",liviu@warter.ro; iulian@warter.ro,,,,,,,33,3,3,1,10,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,377,386,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600036,0

After offering some brief theoretical considerations, I estimate the effects of economic freedom on crisis risk in the post-Cold War period 1993-2010. I further estimate the effects on the duration, peak-to-trough GDP ratios and recovery times of 212 crises across 175 countries within this period. Estimates suggest that economic freedom is robustly associated with smaller peak to-trough ratios and shorter recovery time. These effects are driven by regulatory components of the economic freedom index. (C) 2016 The Author.

Our findings indicate that the difference between the investor and the allocator's initial endowments determines the effect of punishment on trust and trustworthiness. Punishment fosters trust only when the investor is wealthier than the allocator. Otherwise, punishment fails to promote trusting behavior. As for trustworthiness, the effect is just the opposite. The higher the difference between the investor and the allocator's initial endowments, the less willing allocators are to pay back. We discuss the consistency of our findings with social preference models (like inequality aversion, reciprocity), the capacity of punishment (i.e., the deterrence hypothesis) and hidden costs of punishment (i.e., models of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation). Our results are hardly coherent with the first two (inequality aversion and deterrence), but roughly consistent with the latter.

If the loan contract contains equity-like features such as indexation to aggregate conditions, then there is little role for cyclical taxation.

Five couple work/financial patterns existed; the most prominent was where husbands worked and wives managed the money.

A set of future scenarios is developed spanning the uncertainties related to global warming, the parameters of semi-empirical SLR estimates, and coastal developments (cropland, urban areas and population). The importance of incorporating uncertainties regarding coastal development is highlighted. The simulation results suggest that the potential development of future coastal areas is a greater source of uncertainty than the parameters of SLR itself in terms of the economic consequences of SLR. At global level, the economic impact of SLR could be significant when loss of productive land along with loss of capital and forced displacement of populations are considered. Furthermore, highly urbanised and densely populated coastal areas of South East Asia, Australia and New Zealand are likely to suffer significantly if no protective measures are taken. Hence, it is suggested that coastal areas needs to be protected to ameliorate the overall welfare cost across various regions.","[Joshi, Santosh R.] Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, Biblioteksgrand 6, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Joshi, Santosh R.] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Biblioteksgrand 6, S-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Vielle, Marc; Babonneau, Frederic] Ecole Polytech Fed Lausanne, Lab Environm & Urban Econ LEURE, EPFL ENAC INTER REME, BP 2140,Stn 16, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Babonneau, Frederic] ORDECSYS SARL, Pl Etrier 4, CH-1224 Chene Bougeries, Switzerland; [Edwards, Neil R.; Holden, Philip B.] Open Univ, Environm Earth & Ecosyst, Walton Hall, Milton Keynes MK7 6AA, Bucks, England",Umea University; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne; Open University - UK,"Joshi, SR (通讯作者)，Ctr Environm & Resource Econ, Biblioteksgrand 6, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.;Joshi, SR (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Biblioteksgrand 6, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",santosh.joshi@econ.umu.se,"Holden, Philip/K-6152-2013; Babonneau, Florence/A-6318-2009; Vielle, Marc/A-5788-2016","Holden, Philip/0000-0002-2369-0062; Babonneau, Frederic/0000-0002-3430-0314; Edwards, Neil/0000-0001-6045-8804; Vielle, Marc/0000-0002-0810-8281",EU Seventh Framework Programme (ERMITAGE FP7) [265170]; Qatar National Research Fund [6-1035-5-126],EU Seventh Framework Programme (ERMITAGE FP7); Qatar National Research Fund(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),The research leading to these results has received funding from the EU Seventh Framework Programme (ERMITAGE FP7/2007-2013) under Grant Agreement no265170.

The first is the effect of the well-known distinction between gains and losses, the second is the effect of changing the reference value on willingness to pay (WTP) and willingness to accept (WTA). The latter has to our knowledge not been studied before. We hypothesize that there are differences between WTA and WTP, and that both value functions and their disparity are affected by the absolute value of the reference point. We test our hypotheses using a choice experiment with trade-offs between changes in flood probabilities and costs. The choice experiments elicit WTP and WTA, using two flood probability reference values, yielding four separate value functions. Our findings show that a substantial WTA-WTP disparity exists, and that this disparity increases when moving away from the reference point. Also, both WTA and WTP value functions are affected by the flood probability reference value, and the WTA-WTP disparity increases when the flood probability reference point increases. Both findings suggest that welfare effects caused by changes in public good provision depend not only on the direction of change (loss aversion), but also the reference value. Moreover, our results show that the latter effect is larger for losses than for gains. We introduce the concept of reference point updating as a possible explanation for these findings.","[Koetse, Mark J.; Brouwer, Roy] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koetse, MJ (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies, Dept Environm Econ, De Boelelaan 1087, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",mark.koetse@vu.nl; roy.brouwer@vu.nl,"Brouwer, Roy/M-9437-2013; Koetse, Mark J/K-9483-2013",,PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme; NWO; European Commission [FP7-ENV-2012-308393-2],PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency; ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme; NWO(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors acknowledge funding from the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (www.pbl.nl), from the ERA-Net BiodivERsA programme, with the national funder NWO, part of the 2011 BiodivERsA call for research proposals (www.connect-biodiversa.eu/), and from the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme under Grant Agreement No. FP7-ENV-2012-308393-2 (OPERAs).

This article posits reinsurance usage as a new endogenous decision variable and analyzes its effect on this decision mix from a sample of U.S. property-liability insurance firms. Empirical results obtained from a simultaneous equation model confirm the mutual interactions among capital, reinsurance and risk taking. Risk taking is positively related to capital, which highlights the effectiveness of regulatory mechanisms and the relevance of the capital buffer hypothesis. Reinsurance is negatively associated with capital, for which it displays a substitutive effect. These results seem to vary with the insurers' level of capitalization, affiliation with a group, size, and organizational form. Unlike other decision variables, the capital ratio is adjusted to its target level.","[Mankai, Selim] IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France; [Belgacem, Aymen] Univ Orleans, Technol Inst Bourges, Lab Econ Orleans, Orleans, France",IPAG Business School; Universite de Orleans,"Mankaï, S (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, Paris, France.",selim.mankai@udamail.fr,,"MANKAI, Selim/0000-0002-6610-8407",,,,,65,29,35,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Using data from the World Values Surveys (WVS) and the Economic Freedom of the World (EFW) index, we find that people living in more economically free countries are more likely to perceive greater control over their lives. This effect is not diminishing at higher levels of economic freedom. One possible channel that explains this relationship is the perception of procedural fairness and social mobility.

Several studies have examined the causes of the increasing unhappiness that accompanied the transition process, including deteriorating public goods, rising inequality, income volatility, stagnating labor market conditions and changing norms. However, few papers have sought explanations for the life satisfaction differentials between transition and non-transition economies. In this paper, I specifically examine the life satisfaction gap between post-socialist and advanced countries and the role of political institutions for explaining this gap. My results imply that both macro-economic factors and the rule of law explain the overall life satisfaction differential between the advanced and transition societies. The rule of law played an additional role in reducing the happiness gap in the 1990s and may have even reversed it in the post-crisis years. As institutions and macroeconomic conditions continue to improve, post-socialist countries may complete their transformation processes and achieve quality-of-life levels comparable with those in the West.

Beyond the increase in data availability and precision, the transition from firm-centric to system-wide supervision imposes vast data needs. Moreover, in addition to internal communication as in any organization, broad and effective external communication of timely information related to systemic risks is a key mandate of macroprudential supervisors. This further stresses the importance of simple representations of complex data. The present paper focuses on the background and theory of information visualization and visual analytics, as well as techniques within these fields, as potential means for risk communication. We define the task of visualization in risk communication, discuss the structure of macroprudential data, and review visualization techniques applied to systemic risk. We conclude that two essential, yet rare, features for supporting the analysis of big data and communication of risks are analytical visualizations and interactive interfaces. For visualizing the so-called macroprudential data cube, we provide the VisRisk platform with three modules: plots, maps and networks. While VisRisk is herein illustrated with five web-based interactive visualizations of systemic risk indicators and models, the platform enables and is open to the visualization of any data from the macroprudential data cube.

This paper introduces a behavioral proxy of the 52-week high and low momentum that explains a significant proportion of the variation of conventional momentum returns after controlling for commodity specific risk factors. Our findings show that the 52-week high strategy generates significant profits after accounting for transaction costs. We report that the 52-week high strategy is a better predictor of returns than conventional momentum. Our findings suggest that term structure and hedging pressure risk factors provide only a partial explanation of the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A credible privatization builds investors' confidence through a reduction in political risk. In particular, a privatization program that is maintained over time signals credibility, which reduces political risk and in turn volatility. We further show that privatization is associated with lower idiosyncratic volatility mainly among developed markets, while it is associated with lower systematic volatility in developing markets.

We develop a theoretical model incorporated with the hazard function for resource management under alternative conditions, and derive the corrective tax. Applying the model to the case of Argentinean hake fishery, we obtain insights for fishery management in the presence of risk for a regime shift. Based on three value functions, our model simulation indicates that the higher the relative loss from the fishery collapse, the more important the risk management would be with the resilience value taken into account. A higher level of fish stock leads to a higher optimized value and a lower corrective tax rate. When the stock level is lower, we need to introduce a higher tax rate to best avoid the fishery collapse. Decomposing the marginal value of the fish stock into a stock service value for fish production and a resilience value for flip risk reduction, we find that a higher fish stock leads to a lower tax rate because of the higher resilience of the fish stock, and hence the corrective tax rate as an instrument for managing fishery becomes less important.","[Li, Chuan-Zhong] Uppsala Univ, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden; [Villasante, Sebastian] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Do Mar,Int Campus Excellence, La Coruna, Spain; [Zhu, Xueqin] Wageningen Univ, Environm Econ & Nat Resources Grp, Wageningen, Netherlands; [Villasante, Sebastian] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Polit Sci, Ave Angel Echevarry S-N, Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain; [Li, Chuan-Zhong] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Li, Chuan-Zhong] Ningbo Univ, Sch Business, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Uppsala University; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Wageningen University & Research; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Ningbo University,"Villasante, S (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Do Mar,Int Campus Excellence, La Coruna, Spain.;Villasante, S (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Polit Sci, Ave Angel Echevarry S-N, Santiago De Compostela, A Coruna, Spain.",sebastian.villasante@usc.es,"Zhu, Xueqin/K-9471-2013","Zhu, Xueqin/0000-0002-5772-1090","Latin American and the Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP); Galician Government (Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria, Xunta de Galicia) [R2014/023]","Latin American and the Caribbean Environmental Economics Program (LACEEP); Galician Government (Conselleria de Cultura, Educacion e Ordenacion Universitaria, Xunta de Galicia)(Xunta de Galicia)","The authors acknowledge the valuable comments from the two anonymous reviewers, which have greatly improved this paper.

We develop a model that suggests that this assumption may be appropriate when markets are rising but can be far from reality on the bust side of a bubble. During a housing boom, new construction and related supply adjustments by developers ensure stable relative prices between low- and high-quality segments of the housing market. On the bust side of a bubble, however, reduced housing starts allow demand-side forces and mortgage default to create pressure for relative prices to diverge across market segments. Absent a change in technology, as markets recover and new construction rebounds, relative prices should revert back to pre-crash levels. Evidence based on 2000-2013 single-family home sales in Phoenix, Arizona supports this modeling framework. Additional evidence also suggests that high rates of mortgage default contributed to divergence in relative prices when markets crashed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The total initial value increase around the announcement amounts to epsilon 5.59bln at a realized taxpayers' cost of epsilon 4.23bln. While the value increase depends on somewhat generous assumptions, it further increases by epsilon 2.8bln up to Ireland's exit in December 2013.

Growth in spatial of technologies, such as GIS, and reliable georeferenced databases can support new approaches to analyzing those indicators that shed light on infrastructure and service availability frameworks. This paper synthesizes and expands the former Roadway Coverage Index (RCI) as a Transport Spatial Coverage Index (TSCI) based on the concepts and characteristics of specific indicators, using the currently available tools, and taking into account network spatial behavior. Based on its structure, the TSCI is more robust and reliable than other approaches (network extension, spatial density, and population density), and it also has sound and convenient features for planners and derision makers towards national and regional infrastructure planning.

Using a panel data analysis for 97 developing countries from the period 1984 to 2004, this study finds evidence that controlling for economic, social, and demographical factors, political institutional and governance variables significantly influence the consumption expenditure in developing countries. Political institutional variables such as the type of political ruling and political power in the parliament positively influence consumption expenditure; on the contrary, governance variables such as corruption influence negatively. Furthermore, we find that autocratic governments with military ruling are not particularly accommodative toward consumption expenditures as the public spending significantly shrinks under military dictatorship compared with other forms of governance. In order to check consistency of our findings, we ran alternative specifications as well as conducted extreme bound tests.

Affine models find it hard to deal with periods of exceptionally high or low default risk given their assumption of a constant rate of mean reversion in the hazard rate. In contrast, first passage time models are specified in terms of the distance to default rather than the hazard rate. The persistence of shocks varies with the distance to default, allowing the default curve to invert sharply (compress) when the distance to default is low (high). I use an empirical version of the Collin-Dufresne et al. (2003) model, which contains a smoothing parameter that allows it to control the relative effect of these shocks on the short spreads and can be interpreted as an information lag.

Continuities of the agrarian expansion from the neoliberal to post-neoliberal model highlight the state's role in supporting a neoliberal food regime. Neoregulation in the post-neoliberal agenda continues to favour increased production of transgenic food over ecological and human-health considerations. Moreover, the emergence of new corporate and transnational actors has contributed to a new form of corporate-agrarian governance premised on biotechnology. First, a food regime lens is used to describe the expansion of transgenic soybeans in Argentina, followed by an analysis of planning documents to show the state's position in reproducing neoliberal discourses and policies favouring the expansion of agriculture. The conclusion discusses the utility of food regime analysis for explaining the new forms of agricultural governance in Argentina.","[Torrado, Marla] Univ Texas Austin, Community & Reg Planning Program, Sch Architecture, 310 Inner Campus Dr B7500, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Torrado, M (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Austin, Community & Reg Planning Program, Sch Architecture, 310 Inner Campus Dr B7500, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",mjtorrad@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,11,18,0,18,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

These benefits increase the demand for real estate in bust times and reduce fragility of the financial system thereby preventing foreclosures. We evaluate APMs in a stochastic control framework and provide solutions for an optimal amortization schedule.

Using a sample of listed firms for six Latin American countries, we analyze the relation between banking competition and financial constraints. We find evidence in line with prior research that banking competition increases financial constraints. This result is robust and heterogeneous. We include other country-specific variables and check the robustness of our findings; the main results hold. Our results show that the effect of competition differs across firms and industries. Specifically, consistent with the information hypothesis, the negative impact of competition is higher for small quoted firms and for low-assets tangibility industries. Also, as expected, we find evidence that firms are more affected by financial constraints during the last crisis. This negative effect is larger for firms in more competitive banking industries.

The conventional theoretical view is that fixed regimes bring about more fiscal discipline, while the recent literature argues that flexible regimes are more disciplinary. Empirical studies have provided mixed evidence. Using a panel dataset for a large number of developing and developed countries, as well as pooled panel OLS and instrumental variables (IV) estimation techniques, we find support for both views. We document that a fixed ERR is disciplinary at low levels of trade openness, while a flexible regime produces a greater fiscal discipline above a certain level of trade openness. Moreover, this relationship applies to only developing countries. These findings remain robust across different measures of fiscal outcomes, a number of controls, across different sub-samples, and are supported by both annual and five-year averaged panel data.

Thus, a labeling policy that accounts only for consumer responses may not achieve its intended outcome. This study uses a vertical differentiation model in which three firms compete in a market to examine the changes in consumers' quality perceptions caused by prescriptive labeling and to identify how these policies impact market share, prices and welfare. We examine two cases faced by the public regulator. When the regulator wants to reinforce the valorization of the dominant quality attribute, we find that a rewarding labeling strategy yields more weighted quality in the market than a penalizing strategy. Furthermore, a mildly stringent rewarding strategy generates the highest results. In the case where the regulator wants to weaken this quality perception, a penalizing labeling strategy is the best scenario.","[Duvaleix-Treguer, Sabine] INRA, AGROCAMPUS OUEST, Sabine DuvaleixTreguer SMART, 65 Rue St Brieuc,CS 84215, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Soler, Louis-Georges] INRA, ALISS, F-94205 Ivry, France",Institut Agro; Agrocampus Ouest; INRAE; Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE,"Duvaleix-Tréguer, S (通讯作者)，INRA, AGROCAMPUS OUEST, Sabine DuvaleixTreguer SMART, 65 Rue St Brieuc,CS 84215, F-35042 Rennes, France.",sabine.treguer@agrocampus-ouest.fr,,"Duvaleix, Sabine/0000-0002-2663-5659",,,,,36,0,0,0,6,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Using meta-regression analysis combined with Bayesian model averaging, I find support for some of the context-conditional theories in the literature.

Men are more likely to die of AIDS than women, and multiple studies in Africa find that wealthier men are more likely to be infected with HIV than are poor men. We draw on survey and ethnographic data from rural Malawi, a country in southeastern Africa that has experienced a major AIDS epidemic, to examine this puzzle of the missing men. Using longitudinal survey data collected at the height of Malawi's epidemic, we find that not only are wealthy urban men more likely to be HIV positive, but so too are rural men who are wealthy by rural standards. We further advance our argument using ethnographic data to show that rural Malawians understand that men with money are a risk, both to themselves and others. We then systematically analyze HIV policies and documents from the World Health Organization (WHO), UNAIDS, and the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-large international organizations at the forefront of responding to AIDS-to identify the extent to which women and men and poverty and wealth appear as targets. We present evidence showing that women, who appear in these documents more than twice than do men, are framed as unquestionably vulnerable and in need of aid, whereas men are overlooked. We argue that the international discourse on AIDS in Africa cannot be conceived of as separate from the broader discourses of economic development. The campaigns by international donors and NGOs to protect poor women while sidelining men with money gives an incomplete picture of AIDS epidemics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, we evaluate the impact of Pennsylvania's Act 61, which provided additional state aid to districts spending below state-determined adequacy targets (spending shortfall districts), on district tax effort in support of education. We find that high-tax shortfall districts reduced their property tax rates significantly more than districts without spending shortfalls and, as a consequence, did not increase educational spending compared with their no-shorffall counterparts. Our results suggest that state equalization aid for high-taxing districts with spending shortfalls was used for property tax relief rather than for supplementing education spending.","[Steinberg, Matthew P.; Quinn, Rand; Anglum, J.

We do so by analyzing data from a randomized controlled trial involving 70 junior high schools and 7,495 students in rural China. After eight months, the SEL program reduces dropout by 1.6 percentage points and decreases learning anxiety by 2.3 percentage points. Effects are no longer statistically different from zero after 15 months, perhaps due to decreasing student interest in the program. However, we do find that the program reduces dropout among students at high risk of dropping out (older students and students with friends who have already dropped out), both after eight and 15 months of exposure to the SEL program.

This paper explores the institutional determinants for financial development in the countries of the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. Institutional conditions are from the International Country Risk Guide. Panel-econometric techniques are applied to assess the development in the banking sector and the stock market. As a main finding, institutional conditions are important in both financial segments, even after controlling for standard macroeconomic determinants and fixed effects. For the banking sector, corruption seems to be most decisive. For the stock market, the impact of corruption and law and order appear to be relevant. While per capita income and inflation do not seem to play a vital role, openness to foreign trade is quite important for all areas of financial development. Hence, overall, faster real economic integration is of key policy priority to improve financial development as a condition for higher GDP growth. Better law and enforcement practices and anti-corruption policies are strategies to accompany this process.","[Dreger, Christian] DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Cherif, Mondher] Univ Reims, UFR Sci Econ Sociales & Gest, Lab REGARDS, 57 Bis,Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne,"Cherif, M (通讯作者)，Univ Reims, UFR Sci Econ Sociales & Gest, Lab REGARDS, 57 Bis,Rue Pierre Taittinger, F-51096 Reims, France.",,"Dreger, Christian/AAF-6719-2020",,,,,,36,59,61,0,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

In this context, using a public good game with a climate change framing, the experiment reported here examines whether groups of heterogeneous individuals can meet a collective emission-reduction target through individual contributions. In terms of the framing, participants differ in terms of their marginal costs of abatement. The experiment consists of two games: a counterfactual baseline scenario examining the scope for voluntary cooperation and a communication game examining the role of stakeholder participation in facilitating cooperation. During the communication game, subjects are able to communicate with one another in order to coordinate contribution strategies. The results suggest that relying on the voluntary cooperation of individuals will not be sufficient to meet the mitigation target. Furthermore, while communication plays a role in promoting cooperation, even when heterogeneity is present, the non-binding nature of communication results in significant levels of free-riding. In particular, with the introduction of communication, two dominant contribution norms of free-riding and perfect-cooperation emerge. This outcome emphasizes the importance of sanctioning opportunities in ensuring compliance with mitigation obligations.","[Brick, Kerri; Visser, Martine; Van der Hoven, Zoe] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Brick, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",Kerri.Brick@alumni.uct.ac.za; Martine.Visser@uct.ac.za; zvdhoven@gmail.com,,"VISSER, MARTINE/0000-0003-0889-2667","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative; FORMAS program COMMONS; African Climate & Development Initiative (ACDI)","Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative; FORMAS program COMMONS(Swedish Research Council Formas); African Climate & Development Initiative (ACDI)","Financial support from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), through the Environment for Development (EfD) initiative, from the FORMAS program COMMONS and from the African Climate & Development Initiative (ACDI) is gratefully acknowledged.

The essays - by major scholars in the field of agrarian political economy - engage with different aspects of Bernstein's oeuvre: from direct critical reflections on his approach to the peasantry and the agrarian question through to arguments developed in connection to his work on commercial capitalism, landed property and the relationship between petty production and accumulation. This introduction briefly sets out some of the major aspects of Bernstein's distinctive editorial, pedagogical and theoretical contributions. It suggests that his most crucial and lasting contribution is in his absorption and ability to apply Marx's theory and method as a living theoretical and analytical approach to the study of agrarian political economy.","[Campling, Liam] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Lerche, Jens] Sch Oriental & African Studies, Dept Dev Studies, Thornhaugh St, London WC1H 0XG, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Campling, L (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",l.campling@qmul.ac.uk; jl2@soas.ac.uk,,,ESRC [ES/K002341/1] Funding Source: UKRI,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,29,3,3,1,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

However, causal explanations of such relationships are either absent or lacking evidence. To address this knowledge gap, this paper presents a qualitative study which enabled the development of a new conceptual framework to explain the process through which the number of cars owned by households changes over time. The framework emerged through an inductive analysis of 15 in-depth biographical interviews and was validated through a mixed methods survey of 184 households located in Bristol (UK). The following mechanisms of the process are identified: Life events alter roles, relationships, spatial contexts and lifestyle preferences. This can lead to a condition of stress which relates to a discrepancy between satisfaction with the current car ownership level and a more desirable alternative. Attempts to adjust to the new situation are made through processes of travel behaviour adaptation and consideration of whether the car ownership level ought to be altered. A propensity to change car ownership level can emerge from this. However, given the effort involved in taking action, households tend to resist making changes to their car ownership level in the short term. Action to change car ownership level is found to often be prompted by another external stimulus such as the receipt of a maintenance bill. A key message from the analysis is that changes in household car ownership level should be considered as the outcome of a continuous process of development over the life course, rather than as discrete decisions.

If resources are important for student performance, education expenditure studies suggest that being part of a large cohort is a disadvantage. Using a 24-year panel of Norwegian municipalities, I find a small positive effect of cohort size on the probability of graduation, suggesting that being part of a large cohort is actually beneficial. These results are robust to several checks, including accounting for possible Tiebout sorting across school districts and using birth cohort size as an instrument for cohort size in an IV approach. While the analyses conducted in this paper are unable to shed light on whether reduced spending per student actually hurts student outcomes, they indicate that a potential adverse effect of cohort size, working through educational resources, is not strong enough to offset the beneficial effect of larger cohorts on student performance.

Here, a simple small-area estimation method is used to pair travel survey with land use and census data to estimate cyclist and pedestrian activity for census tracts in the state of California. This method is an improvement on fixed per-capita estimates of activity based only on regional or statewide averages. These activity estimates are then used to calculate the intensity of road use by cyclists and pedestrians, and crash rates for these road users. For California, the intensity of pedestrian and cyclist road use in urban census tracts is double that found in suburban tracts, while use in suburban tracts is an order of magnitude greater than that found in rural tracts. Per-capita estimates would suggest substantially smaller differences between neighborhood types. On the safety side, although non-severe crashes involving cyclists and pedestrians are much more likely in more urban areas, severe crash rates for the non-motorized modes exhibit no clear spatial pattern. The method used is simple and easily replicable, potentially filling a critical need for bicycle and pedestrian planners.

Alternatively, when observing the behavior of a maven (real estate expert), borrowers still consider the social aspect of the decision (although to a lesser extent), but ultimately follow the maven who presumably possesses a greater information set.

One hypothesis that may explain the variation in outcomes among farmers is differential access to information through peers. Using a household, survey from India containing detailed information about personal relationships, we estimate peer effects on cash crop revenue using a novel spatial econometric technique to control for reflection. Our results show that 60% of farmers' revenue is explained by peers. Peer effects are particularly large in pesticide use and in the cultivation of a new crop. However, peer effects in input expenditures and land allocation cannot fully explain the variation in revenue, implying peers may also associate with management, negotiation, and marketing. We find that peer effects are significant among farmers' self-reported peers, especially among those peers who are farmers' main advisors for agricultural matters. Although caste-based networks (both within the same and in adjacent villages) are important, their effect is smaller than that of self-reported peer networks. We empirically rule out that our effects are driven by other factors such as geographically correlated unobservables, farmers following a lead farmer or economies of scale. Our findings speak to both the potential and the limitations of peers as sources of agricultural information, and highlight the need for future research about how to best integrate peers into agricultural extension.

Similar to many other developing countries seeking to attract foreign direct investments, Turkey has experienced a great increase in the number of foreign owned banks in the sector following the 2000 and 2001 economic and financial crises. Using panel data regression analysis for a sample of 31 deposit banks operating in Turkey, for the period 2002-2012, we find that foreign ownership has a negative and statistically significant impact on accounting profits, proxied by the ratio of earnings before taxes to total assets. However, contrary to expectations, three other dependent variables representing interest rate spreads, non-lending activities and short term risk, were not found to be significantly associated with foreign ownership.

Under this policy, financially troubled districts are labeled and required to implement financial recovery plans. In response to these plans, districts increase local tax revenues and decrease capital and operating expenditures. Although these recovery plans lead to better long-term financial health for school districts, there appear to be some negative impacts on welfare in these districts during the duration of the label. I find that residential home sale prices fall following fiscal stress label receipt, but rise again once the label is removed. These districts also undergo substantial restructuring, including reductions in enrollments, teachers, and schools, which coincide with a transitory reduction in math proficiency rates following label receipt.

While greater access to abortion has the first-order effect of reducing childbearing among pregnant women, it could nonetheless lead to unintended consequences through effects on marriage market norms. Single motherhood could rise if low-cost abortion makes it easier for men to avoid marriage. This study estimated the effect of abortion costs on separation, cohabitation and marriage following a birth by exploiting miscarriage and changes in state abortion laws. There is evidence that norms responded to abortion laws as women who gave birth under abortion restrictions experienced sizable decreases in single motherhood and increased cohabitation rates. The results underscore the importance of norms regulating relationship dynamics in explaining high levels of non-marital childbearing and single motherhood.","[Beauchamp, Andrew] Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, 3640 Colonel Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45435 USA",University System of Ohio; Wright State University Dayton,"Beauchamp, A (通讯作者)，Wright State Univ, Dept Econ, 3640 Colonel Glenn Hwy, Dayton, OH 45435 USA.",andrew.beauchamp@wright.edu,,,,,,,29,7,7,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

We conduct a meta-regression analysis based on the existing multivariate empirical literature to explore what factors explain divergence in results in the existing empirical studies. We find strong evidence that fiscal constraints, spatial, and organizational factors are significant drivers of cooperation. Our meta-regressions do not yield results to explain divergence in results on community wealth, economies of scale, or racial homogeneity. More studies on these factors are needed to understand how these factors might affect cooperation. Future theoretical and empirical research should give more attention to spatial and organizational factors to develop a better understanding of factors driving cooperation, and how they differ across local government structures and regions.","[Bel, Germa] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ UB, Fac Econ & Empresa, Barcelona, Spain; [Bel, Germa] GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain; [Warner, Mildred E.] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY USA",University of Barcelona; Cornell University,"Bel, G (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ UB, Fac Econ & Empresa, Barcelona, Spain.;Bel, G (通讯作者)，GiM IREA, Barcelona, Spain.",gbel@ub.edu,"Bel, Germà/A-1388-2008","Bel, Germà/0000-0002-1330-8085; Warner, Mildred/0000-0002-0109-338X","Spanish Government [ECO2012-38004]; Catalan Government [SGR2014-325]; ICREA-Academia program of the Catalan Government; Hatch grant program; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) [2011-68006-30793]; NIFA [579173, 2011-68006-30793] Funding Source: Federal RePORTER",Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Catalan Government; ICREA-Academia program of the Catalan Government(ICREA); Hatch grant program; Agricultural and Food Research Initiative Competitive Program of the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA); NIFA(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)National Institute of Food and Agriculture),This work was supported by the Spanish Government [project ECO2012-38004]; the Catalan Government [project SGR2014-325]; the ICREA-Academia program of the Catalan Government.

We construct a new dataset from primary sources and we find strong evidence of pre-electoral manipulation through increased expenditures and excessive borrowing. We use a dynamic panel data approach producing evidence of opportunistic behavior in local government finances. Our results are robust in the face of a series of controls including mayors running for reelection, their political alignment with the central government, and prolonged terms. Moreover, the results are robust to the exclusion of small sized municipalities and to the restriction of the time range of our investigation to the post-Maastricht period. We also consider whether opportunistic policies influence incumbents' reelection prospects finding that increased expenditures and election year opportunistic excesses are electorally rewarding. Our findings provide a characterization of opportunistic public finance management in Greek municipalities where electorally motivated budgetary decisions appear impervious to the various municipal reform attempts.

Using a longitudinal study of 339 UK-based small businesses accounting for almost 7000 patents between 1990 and 2006, this study constitutes the first empirical examination of technological diversification among SMEs in the literature. Results demonstrate that technological diversification is not solely a large firm activity, challenging the dominant view that innovative SMEs are extremely focused and specialised players with little technological diversification. Our findings suggest a nonlinear (i.e. inverse-U-shaped) relationship between the level of technological opportunities in the environment and the SSIs' degree of technological diversification. This points to a trade-off between processes of exploration and exploitation across increasingly volatile technology regimes. The paper also demonstrates that small firms with impactful innovations focus their innovative activity around similar technological capabilities while firms that have introduced platform technologies in the past are more likely to engage in technological diversification.","[Corradini, Carlo] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Demirel, Pelin] Southampton Business Sch, Univ Rd, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England; [Battisti, Giuliana] Warwick Business Sch, Scarman Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Aston University; Solent University; University of Warwick,"Corradini, C (通讯作者)，Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England.",c.corradini@aston.ac.uk; P.Demirel@soton.ac.uk; giuliana.battisti@wbs.ac.uk,,"Demirel, Pelin/0000-0003-3223-6723; Corradini, Carlo/0000-0001-9164-4108",,,,,80,16,21,2,67,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The portions of an aquifer where water moves rapidly, those with high hydraulic conductivity, as well as those that receive less yearly recharge, face a more costly common-pool problem and therefore receive higher benefits from management. The introduction of management districts in Kansas is used to test the effect of underlying aquifer characteristics on changes in agricultural land value, farm size, and crop choice. A landowner in a county with hydraulic conductivity one standard deviation higher sees a relative land value increase of 5%-8% when management is implemented. Counties with lower recharge also see relative increases in land value. Changes in farm size and percentage of cropland in corn are also consistent with the proposition that the effect of management is unequal and depends on properties of the physical system.","[Edwards, Eric C.] Utah State Univ, Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Edwards, EC (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Appl Econ, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",eric.edwards@usu.edu,,"Edwards, Eric/0000-0002-0433-0635","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1357162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))",,,65,36,47,0,15,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2333-5955,2333-5963,,J ASSOC ENVIRON RESO,J.

Our findings suggest that when monetary incentives are provided, the behavioral response may have been exaggerated by previous studies that have relied on survey methods. Furthermore, mitigation steps successfully reduce the stigma behavior. In fact, the results suggest that stigma is primarily reduced not by a specific mitigation step taken but by how many steps are taken consecutively. These results have important implications for policies addressing issues such as the global shortage of drinking water. Some efforts to resolve the shortage have involved recycled water that is completely safe to drink but is often rejected because of reactions of disgust.

This paper investigates such claims by looking at various measures of correlation, and assesses what are the implications of this for asset allocation. We develop a time-varying Bayesian Dynamic Conditional Correlation model and find that joint modelling commodity and equity prices produces accurate forecasts, which lead to benefits in portfolio allocation. This, however, comes at the price of higher volatility. Therefore, the popular view that commodities are to be included in investment portfolio as hedging device is not grounded.

One explanation is that firms shifted their inventory behavior toward a greater emphasis on production smoothing. We investigate the role of inventories in the Great Moderation by estimating an unobserved components model that identifies inventory and sales shocks and their propagation in the aggregate data. Our estimates provide no support for increased production smoothing. Instead, smaller transitory inventory shocks are responsible for the excess volatility reduction in output compared to sales. These shocks behave like informational errors related to production that must be set in advance and their reduction also helps explain the changed forecasting role of inventories since the mid-1980s. Our findings provide an optimistic prognosis for a continuation of the Great Moderation, despite the dramatic movements in output during the recent economic crisis.","[Morley, James] Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Singh, Aarti] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Sydney,"Morley, J (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Econ, UNSW Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",james.morley@unsw.edu.au; aarti.singh@sydney.edu.au,"Morley, James C/J-9166-2012","Morley, James/0000-0003-2380-6747",,,,,36,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

I modify Exposure CoVaR to allow for forecasting, and estimate the ability of each measure to forecast the performance of financial institutions during systemic crisis periods in 1998 (LTCM) and 2008 (Lehman Brothers). I find that Exposure CoVaR forecasts the within-crisis performance of financial institutions, and provides useful forecasts of future systemic risk exposures. Systemic expected shortfall and Granger causality do not forecast the performance of financial institutions reliably during crises. I also find, using cross-sectional regressions, that foreign equity exposure and securitization income determine systemic risk exposure during the 1998 and 2008 crises, respectively; financial institution size determines systemic risk exposure during both crisis periods; and executive compensation does not determine systemic risk exposure.

Over the boom and bust in drilling, housing appreciation closely followed the oil and gas property tax base, which expanded the total tax base by 23 percent at its height. The expansion led to a decline in property tax rates while maintaining or increasing revenues to schools. Overall, each $1 per student increase in the oil and gas property tax base increased the value of the typical home by $0.15. Some evidence suggests that the cumulative density of wells nearby may lower housing values, indicating that drilling could reduce local welfare without policies to increase local public revenues.","[Weber, Jeremy G.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ & Int Affairs, 3601 Wesley W Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; [Burnett, J.

Effective allocation of energy-saving targets is key to achieving China's reduction targets for energy intensity. Despite growing research interest in the energy saving target allocation system, details regarding the logic and rationale behind the modifications to the system since the 11th FYP period remain unclear. This paper contributes to the previous literature by applying the concept of policy learning to an analysis of how and from what sources the Chinese government has learned to improve its energy-saving target allocation system over the 2006-13 period. Our study finds that the Chinese government has developed a distinct policy style of learning from multiple sources that involves three primary sources: previous experience, local practice, and expert knowledge. Although the extant literature has previously identified these three sources of learning, most of this literature has focused on only one or at most two sources of learning at any given time. The uniqueness of policy learning in the energy-saving target allocation system consists of the co-existence of these three sources of learning in one case. This learning-oriented policy style is characterized by reflexivity, which allows current policies to be adjusted in a timely manner in order to alleviate prospective risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a sample of 85,560 cross-border mergers and acquisitions in 57 countries over the period 1990 to 2010, we find that firms with higher leverage are less likely to acquire foreign targets, whereas firms with lower leverage tend to be targets acquired by foreign firms. These effects are more pronounced in Asian countries than North America. Acquisition premium, the likelihood of all-cash offer and the percentage of cash in the acquisition offer decrease with leverage in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Foreign targets gain positive abnormal returns in the both short run and long run, while acquirers earn positive abnormal returns in the short-run, but negative returns in the long run. We also find that firms adjust their capital structure after the acquisition by issuing more equity if they were overleveraged, or issuing more debt if they were underleveraged before the acquisition. Our results provide international evidence on how leverage affects managerial decision to acquire foreign targets, payment method and acquisition premium in cross border mergers and acquisitions. This study shows that the interdependent relationship between investment decision and financing decision exists worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We use G-Cubed, an intertemporal CGE model, to carry out a sensitivity and factor decomposition analysis. The decomposition analysis determines the contributions of changes in average abatement costs and changes in baseline emissions to the change in total mitigation costs. The latter has not previously been considered. Average abatement cost rises non-linearly as elasticities are reduced. Changes in the substitution elasticities between capital, labor, energy, and materials have a greater impact on mitigation costs than do inter-fuel elasticities of substitution. The former have more effect on business as usual emissions and the latter on average abatement costs. As elasticities are reduced, business as usual emissions and GDP growth also decrease so that there is not much variation in the total costs of reaching a given target across the parameter space. Our results confirm that the cost of climate mitigation policy is at most a few percent of global GDP.","[Lu, Yingying] Shanghai Univ, Sch Econ, Room 555,Bldg Econ & Management,99 Shangda Rd, Shanghai 200444, Peoples R China; [Stern, David I.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia",Shanghai University; Australian National University,"Stern, DI (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, 132 Lennox Crossing, Acton, ACT 2601, Australia.",yingying_lu@shu.edu.cn; david.stern@anu.edu.au,"Stern, David I/B-4700-2009; Lu, Yingying/M-8460-2019","Stern, David I/0000-0001-6595-4268; Lu, Yingying/0000-0002-0199-0662",Australian Research Council [DP120101088],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the Australian Research Council for providing funding under grant DP120101088 'Energy Transitions: Past, Present, and Future and Warwick McKibbin and Peter Wilcoxen for allowing us to use the G-Cubed model in this project.

ProSAVANA is a joint Japan Brazil Mozambique initiative in the savannah zone of Mozambique's Nacala Corridor region that was initially inspired by the Japan Brazil PRODECER program in Brazil's Cerrado region. ProSAVANA subsequently became the focus of fears about land-grabbing in the Nacala Corridor, attracting strong civil society contestation. We show how distinct imaginaries of agricultural development in Mozambique and Brazil were used to mobilize for and against ProSAVANA, thus revealing the contentious nature of the similarity claims underpinning South South cooperation. In particular, we focus on the role of landscape imaginaries associated with the savannah and the Cerrado. We examine the use in the promotion and contestation of ProSAVANA of visual representations that draw on these imaginaries, including GIS maps of Mozambique's savannah region made by Brazilian agribusiness consultants and an advocacy video of Brazil's Cerrado region filmed by Mozambican land rights activists. Noting that the latest ProSAVANA planning documents differ significantly from those expressing its initial vision, we argue that the contestation of ProSAVANA has had a series of productive effects even before the program has moved to full implementation. These productive effects are visible not only in the program itself but also in the wider context of state-society relations shaping debates on South South cooperation in Mozambique, Brazil, and beyond.

Outside the United States, there are several countries that have money market mutual funds with and without constant NAVs. Using daily data on individual fund flows from these countries, this paper evaluates whether the reliance on a constant NAV is associated with higher fund redemptions. The data suggest that funds with a constant NAV experienced more negative net flows during the period of the run on the Reserve Primary Fund, even after controlling for measures of fund risk and risk aversion. However, I do not find convincing support for the hypothesis that the effect of sponsor strength on fund flows was stronger for constant NAV money market funds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

With a rise in time sensitive accessibility measures, choosing the appropriate measure is increasingly challenging for engineers, planners and policy-makers. This research presents a comparative analysis of three accessibility measures, two of which are time-sensitive. Relative accessibility measures are generated for five time periods based on a) constant transit service and number of jobs (constant); b) variable transit service and constant number of jobs (static) and c) variable transit service and variable number of jobs available (dynamic). The measures are first assessed by incorporating them into a transit mode share model. Interestingly, findings show that all three measures behaved similarly in the three regression models. Furthermore, all accessibility measures are found to be highly correlated. The study suggests that the most commonly used accessibility measure (constant measure at 8 am) is representative of the relative accessibility (static or dynamic) over the course of the day and is thus appropriate and meaningful to be used by policy-makers, engineers and planners.

With differential transport costs between a higher and a lower quality product, firms in both countries may gain by implicitly coordinating in an increasingly segmented market and choosing a high-price strategy for both products. Home-country producers clearly gain. Through product differentiation in an oligopolistic market, the foreign producers may also gain when the home producers exploit the transport cost advantage. The international orange juice market, with significant trade volumes in both lower quality frozen concentrated juice and higher quality not-from-concentrate juice, provides compelling evidence supporting this model.

This paper examines what drives these differences, specifically whether the loss probability and the wealth of the insured affect the size of the premium discount in automobile insurance. To describe a bargain between a client and an insurer over premiums and coverage, we first develop a sequential insurance bargaining game where the client has an outside option to bargain with another insurer. We find that the equilibrium involves full coverage and, based on the results of comparative statics, we propose hypotheses regarding the effects of the loss probability and the wealth of the insured on the size of the premium discount. We then use a unique data set of 85,806 observations of Taiwanese automobile liability insurance for property damage to empirically test the predictions. After controlling for underwriting and macroeconomic variables, we find that both (1) the insured with a lower claim probability (as a proxy for the insured with a lower loss probability) and (2) the insured with a higher salvage value car (as a proxy for the wealthier insured) receive a greater premium discount. These results support our theoretical results.","[Chan, Linus F. -S.] Soochow Univ, Dept Financial Engn & Actuarial Math, 56,Sect 1,Kuei Yang St, Taipei 10048, Taiwan; [Huang, Yi-Chieh] Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 100 Wenhwa Rd, Taichung 40724, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept & Grad Inst Finance, 8F,50,Ln 144,Sect 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei 10673, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Larry Y.] Natl Chengchi Univ, RIRC, 64,Sect 2,Zhinan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan",Soochow University; Feng Chia University; National Taiwan University; National Chengchi University,"Chan, LFS (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Dept Financial Engn & Actuarial Math, 56,Sect 1,Kuei Yang St, Taipei 10048, Taiwan.;Huang, YC (通讯作者)，Feng Chia Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 100 Wenhwa Rd, Taichung 40724, Taiwan.;Tzeng, LY (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept & Grad Inst Finance, 8F,50,Ln 144,Sect 4,Keelung Rd, Taipei 10673, Taiwan.;Tzeng, LY (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, RIRC, 64,Sect 2,Zhinan Rd, Taipei 11605, Taiwan.",linuschan@scu.edu.tw; huangyic@fcu.edu.tw; tzeng@ntu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) [103-2410-H-031-032, 102-2410-H-002-028-MY3]","Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST)(Ministry of Science and Technology, China)","The authors express their deep appreciation to the editor, Michael Hoy, and two anonymous referees for detailed and valuable comments and suggestions.

Exogenous shocks (Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 123R) provide additional support for the findings.

This severely limited married women's ability to engage in formal business ventures, collect rents, administer estates, and manage bequests through wills. By the dawn of the twentieth century, legal reform in nearly every state had removed these restrictions by extending formal legal and economic rights to married women. Legal reform being by nature a public good with dispersed benefits, what forces impelled legislators to undertake the costs of action? In this paper, I argue that interjurisdictional competition between states and territories in the nineteenth century was instrumental in motivating these reforms. Two conditions are necessary for interjurisdictional competition to function: (1) law-makers must hold a vested interest in attracting population to their jurisdictions, and (2) residents must be able to actively choose between the products of different jurisdictions. Using evidence from the passage of the Married Women's Property Acts, I find that legal reforms were adopted first and in the greatest strength in those regions in which there was active interjurisdictional competition.","[Lemke, Jayme S.] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1A1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",George Mason University,"Lemke, JS (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, 4400 Univ Dr,MSN 1A1, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",jlemke@mercatus.gmu.edu,,,Mercatus Center; Institute for Humane Studies,Mercatus Center; Institute for Humane Studies,"Thank you to Chris Coyne, Pete Boettke, Pete Leeson, Tyler Cowen, Adam Martin, Michael Thomas, Katherine Fidler, Rachel Coyne, Bill Shughart, Virgil Storr, and the participants in the Mercatus Center's Graduate Student Paper Workshop for many valuable comments and conversations.

This is among the first studies to investigate the effect of a dynamic distribution in a partition function game framework, i.e., including externalities. The special feature of NSS herring is that it comes under the sole ownership of Norway when the stock size is sufficiently low. The three players in our game are differentiated by stock ownership, cost per unit effort and stock elasticity of harvest. We find that cost asymmetry improves the likelihood of forming a stable grand coalition as harvesting load can be assigned to each fishing zone according to a player's relative cost level and the density of fish. A dynamic distribution increases the bargaining power of Norway because of her ability to control both the total stock and the stock shares in different zones, especially during the stock transition years. However, the bargaining power of Norway may disappear if her cost of harvesting exceeds that of the other players. This loss of bargaining power can take on two forms: first, a dynamic distribution may encourage a minor player to free ride because Norway, needing a coalition partner to improve her cost-effectiveness, would be less inclined to retaliate as retaliation hurts her ally as much as the free-rider; second, in a stable grand coalition, Norway is not guaranteed to receive an allocation of benefit shares in proportion to (not to say in excess of) her stock ownership. At the current stock condition, the strategy where Norway reduces stock abundance below the level where the stock becomes non-migratory is found attractive only if the discounting rate is sufficiently high.","[Liu, Xiaozi] Norwegian Sch Econ, Ctr Appl Res, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Lindroos, Marko] Univ Helsinki, Dept Econ & Management, POB 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Sandal, Leif] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); University of Helsinki; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Liu, XZ (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Ctr Appl Res, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",xiaoziliu@yahoo.com,"Lindroos, Marko/B-7966-2015; Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/W-3702-2019","Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/0000-0002-5384-0316; Liu, Xiaozi/0000-0002-2299-8612; Lindroos, Marko/0000-0002-9351-6115","Nordic network on 'Climate impacts on fish, fishery industry and management in the Nordic seas'; Academy of Finland AKVA programme's project 'Economics of Aquatic Foodwebs'","Nordic network on 'Climate impacts on fish, fishery industry and management in the Nordic seas'; Academy of Finland AKVA programme's project 'Economics of Aquatic Foodwebs'","would like to thank Mikko Heino, Stein Ivar Steinshamn, Rognvaldur Hannesson, and Sturla F.

Indirect exporting can save export taxes by 14.5% compared to direct exporting even if no intentional price under-reporting occurs, and even more when domestic purchasing price paid by a trading firm to a production firm is under-reported purposely.

The public opinion survey (N=2,700) oversainples residents living in counties of six states where UGD is technically feasible or underway: New York, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. We found that proposing a hypothetical UGD site about two miles from where the resident lives decreases support for local UGD, but this effect is attenuated when residents are informed that their community or state will receive benefits from reinvestment of a portion of the revenues generated by a developer. Further, the level of government receiving the reinvestment funds influences the level of local public support for UGD, such that reinvestment in local government is a much stronger predictor of public support than reinvestment in state government. Our findings have implications for understanding the social feasibility of UGD and can have implications for how reinvestment policies should be designed to influence local community attitudes.","[Paydar, Naveed; Schenk, Olga; Clark, Ashley; Carley, Sanya; Rupp, John; Graham, John D.] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 East Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Paydar, N (通讯作者)，1315 East Tenth St,Room 452, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",npaydar@indiana.edu,,,,,,,57,11,13,0,16,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

We show that the neural processing of monetary losses is modulated by the effort one has put into earning the money at stake. In particular, we find that the loss of earned monetary endowment leads to a decreasing activity in the brain's reward system. Our results suggest that the exertion of one's own effort to gain ownership increases the neurally measured value of ownership rights. Our results and method may prove useful in developing the first steps toward a biologically informed valuation of property rights. Neural methods may help in the future to design efficient and just compensation schemes for property taken by eminent domain.","[Saaksvuori, Lauri] Univ Hamburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Social Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Saaksvuori, Lauri] Natl Inst Hlth & Welf, Ctr Hlth & Social Econ, POB 30, FI-00271 Helsinki, Finland; [Hewig, Johannes] Univ Wurzburg, Dept Psychol, Wurzburg, Germany; [Hecht, Holger; Miltner, Wolfgang H.

Theoretically, the effect of CDS trading is ambiguous: on the one hand, CDS can improve risk-sharing and hence be a more flexible risk management tool than loan syndication; on the other hand, CDS trading can reduce bank monitoring incentives. We document that banks are less likely to syndicate loans and retain a larger loan fraction once CDS are actively traded on the borrower's debt. We then discern the risk management and the moral hazard channel. We find no evidence that the reduced likelihood to syndicate loans is a result of increased moral hazard problems.","[Streitz, Daniel] Humboldt Univ, Inst Corp Finance, Berlin, Germany",Humboldt University of Berlin,"Streitz, D (通讯作者)，Humboldt Univ, Inst Corp Finance, Berlin, Germany.",,,"Streitz, Daniel/0000-0001-8585-7457","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 649, SFB-TR15]",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The author would like to thank Tim Adam, Tobias Berg, Valentin Burg, Sudipto Dasgupta, Hermann Elendner, Xavier Giroud, Laurenz Klipper, Augustin Landier, Christian Laux, Gustavo Manso, Martin Oehmke, Steven Ongena (the editor), Gordon Phillips, Tobias Scheinert, Sascha Steffen, Alex Stomper, Gunter Strobl, and an anonymous referee for helpful comments and suggestions.

However, little is known about the effect of these approaches in developing countries, which account for most of the growth in energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Using a randomized experiment conducted in 17 favelas (shantytowns) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, this paper investigates the interplay between three levels of monetary incentives and an environmental persuasion communication on the take-up of an energy-efficient lightbulb (a light-emitting diode or, LED). On average, the persuasive communication significantly increases LED take-up by 6 percentage points (a 13% increase). This effect is driven by a 13 percentage point (20%) increase in take-up at the middle price.

Costs for cash transfers and vouchers tend to be significantly lower relative to in-kind food.

However, a large literature in psychology theory suggests that initial exertions of self-control affect one's ability to deploy self-control subsequently. As savings decisions require individuals to make trade-offs between immediate gratification and future rewards, the self-control literature suggests that expression of time preference is susceptible to environmental influences, a contradiction of the neoclassical stability assumption. Empirical evidence is mixed. This paper proposes that self-control use has heterogeneous effects on the expression of economic time preference. Using a Stroop task to experimentally induce self-control fatigue in university students in Northern Ethiopia, we find that treated subjects with below median finances behave more impatiently in an incentivized time preference task than do untreated subjects. By contrast, treated relatively wealthy students do not behave differently than their untreated counterparts. Our results suggest that the psychological environment does affect the expression of time preference, but self-control use does not uniformly deplete patience for all subjects. Our results are most consistent with the process model of self-control. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Optimally chosen tertiary education subsidies mitigate these distortions. We highlight the quantitative importance of general equilibrium feedback effects from policies to relative wages of skilled and unskilled workers: subsidizing higher education increases the share of workers with a college degree thereby reducing the college wage premium which has important redistributive benefits. We also argue that a full characterization of the transition path is crucial for policy evaluation. We find that optimal education policies are always characterized by generous tuition subsidies, but the optimal degree of income tax progressivity depends crucially on whether transitional costs of policies are explicitly taken into account and how strongly the college premium responds to policy changes in general equilibrium.

We document that business models in the European banking sector are characterized by a continuum, rather than a discrete set, of possible strategies. Using factor analysis to identify business models, we can account for this continuity. To estimate the impact of business models on performance, we use a methodology that is able to separate short-run effects from the longer-term impact of business model choices. Our findings show that retail-oriented banks perform better in terms of both profitability and stability and that diversification is associated with higher profitability. We report substantial variation of business model effects over different bank types. Our results lend support to the new capital regulations proposed in the Basel III framework, but we also argue that business model considerations should be more fundamentally integrated in the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory practice.

Building on the evolutionary theory of organizations, we link three established coordination mechanisms (centralization, formalization, and socialization) to the time-to-market of SMEs' product innovations. We also argue that the complexity of the internationalized R&D tasks moderates the relationship between the three coordination mechanisms and time-to-market. Survey data from 103 SMEs with international innovation activities broadly support our theoretical account. With respect to the main effects, our findings suggest that a high degree of centralization tends to prolong the time-to-market, whereas formalization tends to shorten it. The moderation results further indicate that centralization can become more beneficial when a firm internationalizes highly complex R&D tasks, while formalization tends to become less beneficial with increasing task complexity. Main and moderation effects with respect to socialization are inconclusive.

This paper analyses the intersection of two clear trends in the evolution of port systems, decentralisation of port governance and deconcentration of port traffic. The goal is to identify how the institutional setting governing the spatial diversification of container port activity has changed as a result of this intersection and whether it is suitable to deal with new challenges as they arise. An additional question is whether the new institutional settings created by port reform in developing countries are suitable to support the successful application of port devolution policies imported from developed countries with different political and institutional histories. Based on four national case studies of port reform in Latin America, the paper discusses how the interplay between structure and agency in the reform of port governance has in some cases created merely a new path dependency. Findings show that short-term gains in technical efficiency in individual ports contrast with a long-term loss of power from the public to the private sector and the lack of integrated transport and logistics policies necessary to support ongoing port development.

Our results provide quantitative evidence of a substantial shift in Indonesia's political economy over the last decade and a half: the simultaneous rise of the private sector and decline of the military and the state as avenues to political influence at the national level.

Design/methodology/approach - This study is based on a relatively large sample of 5,779 enterprises with total 48,280 numbers of observations over the period from 2006 to 2013 and the regression model is performed by applying two-step system general method of moment estimator methodology. Findings - This study finds a positive and significant relationship between banking concentration and firm leverage. Therefore, the overall results follow the information-based theory which indicates lower firms financing obstacles as banks are more concentrated. Research limitations/implications - Bank-level data of all the countries to measure banking concentration is until 2013, which restrict the empirical analysis until 2013. Also, the study conducts the analysis. Practical implications - The study enables policymakers, society, and academics to have better understanding on the beneficial effects of alternative banking market structure on firms' access to credit and therefore, in determining the level of firm leverage in emerging countries.

Therefore, this study constructs a larger sample consisting of foreign exchange (forex) markets of 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by testing for martingale difference hypothesis with structural breaks. It uses data on the average official exchange rate of currencies of the concerned countries to the US dollar from November 1995 to October 2015(i.e. 1995M11-2015M10). The study accounts for the break period/point in each return series to determine when the structural change occurred in the forex market by employing the Perron's unit root test that endogenously determines the most significant break period in the return series in an Innovative Outlier (10) model. Due to the tendency for structural breaks to make the test for martingale difference hypothesis misleading, the study divides the full sample period into before structural break (pre-break period) and after the structural break (post-break period). The pre-break period spans from November 1995 to the month before the structural break while the post-break period extends from the month after the structural break to October 2015. The empirical results reveal that the forex markets of the selected countries are not weak form efficient in the full sample period except for Burundi and Ghana. Dividing the full sample period into pre-break and post-break periods, it discovers that the forex markets of Burundi, Ghana, Mauritius, and Mozambique are weak form efficient in both periods while the forex markets of Gambia and Madagascar are weak form inefficient in both periods. However, the forex markets of Mauritania, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Zambia show inconsistent results in the pre-break period compared to the post-break period.","[Adeyeye, Patrick Olufemi] Univ KwaZulu Natal, King George V Ave, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa; [Aluko, Olufemi Adewale] Univ Ilorin, Ilorin 240003, Kwara State, Nigeria",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Ilorin,"Adeyeye, PO (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, King George V Ave, ZA-4041 Durban, South Africa.",adeyeyeo@ukzn.ac.za; olufemiadewale6@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,205,216,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300016,0

The company faces challen,qes every day as inte,qrity, cash, borrowin,q, and resource management, increased selection and competition, uncertainty, regulation, globalization, among others. Therefore, that is the reason companies must be prepared because the right path yesterday may not work today and could be a disaster by tomorrow according to Neal Jensen. The methodology used is a combination of extensive literature survey and analysis of data. In addition, the paper presents liquidity risk and credit risk management for banks. The financing from financial institutions plays an important role in contemporary companies, in the development and sustainability of projections, innovations, and development. Nonetheless, financial institutions must be solvent and solid, in which, the funds required by enterprises are very useful and allow them to minimize the risk and face the uncertainty of the future. Whereby, it is important to know some principles that help financial institutions to manage their liquidity risk, especially decreasing their risk management. Funding to contemporary business is vulnerable to several factors that occur in the economy of a country, among which are mentioned: diversifiable risks as non-diversifiable, transaction costs and loan guarantees. The financial problems in Media Industry are analyzed. Financial institutions whether small, medium or large, play a role very important in an economy because they take advantage of market opportunities in their favor and constantly moving the flow of money, being an engine for developing economies and developed countries because a liquidity financial shows solvency for investment. Liquidity financial should also be emphasized that financial institutions in an economy allow increasing lending to companies.","[Alvarado Vera, Martha Paola; Manrique Pincay, Ruben Bernardo] Univ Espiritu Santo, 2-5 Via Puntilla, Samborondon Ecuador, Guayas, Ecuador",Universidad de Especialidades Espiritu Santo,"Vera, MPA (通讯作者)，Univ Espiritu Santo, 2-5 Via Puntilla, Samborondon Ecuador, Guayas, Ecuador.",malvarve@uees.edu.ec; rumanrique@uees.edu.ec,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,739,755,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300061,0

We conclude that the approach in the law to financial regulatory reform is best described as a Band-Aid approach to financial regulation. A better approach in our view is one that strengthens market discipline on bank risk-taking and enhances competition so as to reduce the regulatory burden and enhance the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Dodd-Frank pays lip service to this objective with the creation of an Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), with the effectiveness of both these new bodies being very much in doubt.","[Barth, J.

In this regard, the severe financial problems that have affected some electric utilities in different countries from time to time, have made it increasingly clear that exposure to financial risk can compromise a utility's ability to maintain service quality and continuity, and therefore that regulatory authorities should pay attention to the identification and control of utilities' financial risk exposure.

Conflict culture development has resulted in a scientific research methodology that allows an individual to explore, through the diversification of science, the different nature and correlations of intellectual capital, interaction of management theory and methodology. The problem becomes more topical due to the tendency of the dominant majority of the society toward apathy and complacency against conflicts. The aim of the research is the methodological systematization of the conflict factors in the intellectual capital formation process, taking into account the personality, the intellectual capital and the public culture development factors as well as the cross-cultural differences in the environment and time. In the research the nature of the concepts of conflict, conflictology and intellectual capital are explained and the overlaps and differences in research methodology are disclosed. Knowledge of conflict and its research methodology have been acquired and evaluated on the basis of humanitarian, social and exact sciences, religion, art, culture, public relations, as well as the practical experience in human sciences. The authors indicate that conflict is based on social objectives, intellectual capital capacity and personality interrelations. From a positive standpoint, conflict can prevent stagnation in the system, open the way for innovation; help to gather and mobilize the will of the people and resolve key issues. Conflict is defined as an ideological phenomenon, which shows that individuals and social groups often struggle for power, status, and value orientation (Coser 1979). Conflict is the norm of human life, thinking and evolving. Conflict is a socialization stimulus (Spenser 1903). The term conflictology consists of two parts conflict- and -logy. Logy (Greek logos) means teaching about knowledge and its diversification by approximating in order to resolve joint cognitive tasks. Conflictology explains human interrelations and interests; it is the applied science dealing with the harmony of an individual and the society, based on theoretical justification. Conflictology can determine the direction of development of society and the needs of the social system, changes in culturology, environment, action goals and synchronisation of strategy, innovations. The cognitive theoretical framework of conflictology consists of a broad science base and interdisciplinary explanation and study using theoretical knowledge of real conflict situations, empirical data, social experience and methodology. It provides the resulting evaluation of research results and recommendations regarding the methodology of conflictology and analysis in connection with the practical implementation of conflict situations. In order to raise the intellectual capital capacity, it is necessary to analyze the causes and consequences of the conflict in accordance with the conflictology methodology. This article by utilizing generalizations provides positive problem solving potential action strategies of the conflict situation.","[Brenca, Airita] Univ Latvia, Fac Educ Psychol & Art, Dept Educ Sci, Riga, Latvia; [Garleja, Rasma] Univ Latvia, Dept Dev & Planning, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia; University of Latvia,"Brenca, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Fac Educ Psychol & Art, Dept Educ Sci, Riga, Latvia.",airita.brenca@gmail.com; rasma.garleja@lu.lv,,,,,,,17,2,2,1,7,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,38,44,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300005,0

Similar to Aiyagari (1995), they find that the long-run optimal capital tax rate should not be zero as long as the competitive equilibrium risk-free interest rate differs from the subjective time discount rate. The authors first argue that this result holds in a wide range of economic environments and is not limited to only the standard incomplete market model with heterogeneous agents. As an example, a decentralized economy with limited commitment is considered. Second, they show that this result critically depends on the assumption of endogenous government spending. Within the same limited commitment environment, they show that the long-run capital taxation becomes zero with exogenous government spending. The authors conclude that the optimal Ramsey taxation in heterogeneous agent economies with exogenous government spending and various frictions is still an open question.","[Chien, YiLi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO USA; [Lee, Junsang] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Lee, J (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",,"Chien, Yili/I-5741-2016","Chien, Yili/0000-0002-6820-1197",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A5A8017935],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)","YiLi Chien is a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

In order to test the hypothesis that cognitive load increases with the use of analog clocks, I examine the cognitive load induced by analog and digital clocks, and by typical and atypical start times, to determine whether cognitive load is increased primarily by analog clock faces, or if atypical start times increase cognitive load through some other mechanism. Methodology/methods The present study asked respondents to calculate the amount of time left for a task in five examples of each of eight possible combinations of digital clock faces, analog clock faces, and prototypical and atypical times. Responses were timed and checked for accuracy. Response time was presumed to provide a proxy for the respondent's cognitive load. Scientific aim Since time-remaining calculations are an important component of task performance, an accurate description of the causes of increased cognitive load will enable effective load-reduction mechanisms. Prior researchers did not test their assumption that childhood training with prototypical times on analog clocks left workers ill-equipped to make time-remaining calculations in atypical start time scenarios; thus, this study aims to pinpoint the causes of the increased cognitive load. Findings Cognitive load increased in all atypical cases, whether using analog or digital clocks. However, in this initial study, analog clocks were not better than digital clocks. Cognitive load was clearly related to how atypical the start time was: the more atypical the times were, the higher the cognitive load rose. Conclusions Because the cognitive load was similar between analog and digital clocks, another explanation for the cognitive load increase must be found.","[Conway, Christopher M.] IESEG Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-79000 Lille, France",IESEG School of Management,"Conway, CM (通讯作者)，IESEG Sch Management, 3 Rue Digue, F-79000 Lille, France.",c.conway@ieseg.fr,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,9,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,86,93,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200010,0

When analyzing the effectiveness of agricultural policy it is essential to assess the economic situation of organic farms in Poland. In order to analyze the economic position of analyzed farms, reference was made to the situation of conventional farms. A comparative analysis of organic and conventional farms shown that organic farms generated lower revenue than conventional farms.

The tourism industry was among the first ones to signal a prompt adjustment to this concept of sustainable development, mainly due to its significant social and human component and the critical importance of the environmental factor for its success. Tourism cannot exist without high quality, a clean and attractive natural environment - the raw material used by this industry. A healthy natural environment, beautiful and eye-catching landscapes and the conservation of the travel resources and destinations make up the foundation the long-term, sustainable tourism activities. The correlation between the economic performance of tourism companies and the environmental protection efforts, in addition to the strategic measures of limiting travel flows, is the starting point of the analysis covered in this paper. Romania is joining the ranks of the countries with real opportunities for enhancing the performance of their tourism industries and this is the key reason why identifying how the current needs of the entrepreneurs in the tourism industry correlate with their customers' needs is a critical issue that can be examined and evaluated as part of immediately applicable strategies, put together both by the local authorities from the travel destinations (with, or without, particularly intense tourist flows) and by the companies active in the tourism industry. This paper aims to analyze a set of specific metrics that quantify the pressure level generated by tourism activities and the maximum pressure levels from such activities that can be tolerated by travel destinations that include protected undeveloped beaches. The findings of this analysis could provide input into the strategies for sustainable management of the protected areas with tourism potential, such as the Vadu, Corbu, Gura Portitei, Sulina undeveloped beaches.","[Dodu, Silvia Patricia; Patrichi, Ioana Cristiana; Firoiu, Daniela] Romanian Amer Univ, 1B Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania",,"Dodu, SP (通讯作者)，Romanian Amer Univ, 1B Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest, Romania.",patricia_dodu@yahoo.com; ioanapatrichi@yahoo.com; danafiroiu@yahoo.com,"Firoiu, Daniela/ABE-1940-2020","Firoiu, Daniela/0000-0003-2498-457X",,,,,31,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,96,109,,,,,,14,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300008,0

When entrepreneurship policy is being implemented in the Swedish educational system, the main effect on entrepreneurship education seems to be growth in an alternative view on entrepreneurship as foremost a means for accomplishing learning through action and practice. The implementation tends to favour the entrepreneurial learning concept over the entrepreneurship concept, where entrepreneurial learning encompasses a multitude of educational practices for developing internal entrepreneurship and enterprising abilities. External entrepreneurship for business venturing is not given priority. The thought tradition withheld in Business schools thus has had little influence on the implementation in Swedish primary and secondary school. Instead, new ideas on entrepreneurship are created outside the business context through experimentation in school teaching practices, where one also can spot an emerging research interest from pedagogy scholars.","[Hoppe, Magnus] Malardalen Univ, Sch Business Soc & Engn, POB 883, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden",Malardalen University,"Hoppe, M (通讯作者)，Malardalen Univ, Sch Business Soc & Engn, POB 883, S-72123 Vasteras, Sweden.",magnus.hoppe@mdh.se,,"Hoppe, Magnus/0000-0002-6823-4925",Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth for implementing entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial learning at Malardalen University,Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth for implementing entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial learning at Malardalen University,Magnus Hoppe has participated in a project funded by The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth for implementing entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial learning at Malardalen University.

This article deals with the reflection on the roots of the present political and economical problems and how to solve them. It demonstrates some theoretical conclusions of the articles published in the Political Economy in the previous ten years. Successively, the attention is paid to the most important works which illustrate the possibilities of a radical societal transformation from the different perspectives. To be concrete there are presented works of R. Richta (the 50th anniversary of his well - known work will be commemorated in 2016), of Francis Fukuyama (whose very optimistic original visions had to be reviewed later) and of S. Huntington (who focused on searching the causes of global conflicts in a broader context). Finally, it is proposed a new concept of solving problems - a transition to the society whose economy is based on the productive services which means on the services linked to the human capital in its three phases: gaining, preservation and realization. At the same time the barriers of this transition and possibilities how to overcome them are identified.","[Jurasek, Miroslav; Leinweber, Vaclav; Valencik, Radim] Vysoka Skola Financni Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Jurásek, M; Leinweber, V; Valencík, R (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Financni Spravni, Prague, Czech Republic.",miroslavjurasek@mail.vsfs.cz; 5980@mail.vsfs.cz; radim.valencik@vsfs.cz,,,,,,,35,1,1,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

It is not only a slogan. The SMEs have more change projects at the same time. The classic change management models always contain some cyclical processes, as Want's model does as well. The basic characteristic of change management has shifted. The SMEs face the so-called Change Flow that requires different management technics and project management methods. The model also helps to find out which elements of the developing process are left out. This paper presents an interesting phenomenon through two case studies of Hungarian SMEs. The leading idea of the research has come from the observation and cooperation with two Hungarian SMEs. The intensive growth of the machinery company observed in 2012-2013 and the analysis of the management's daily challenges stressed out the need of change management on a daily basis. A number of lessons are emerging through an IT company we have been observing since January 2014 about the development of strategic thinking and the behavior of an SME in change (perhaps crisis) situation. SMEs change management concept is examined by Want's change model show that companies predominantly face changes in operations and in several cases, they decide about basic changes. The well-structured process of changes can be ensured by a complex model that is close to the practice. Therefore, Want's change model has been selected for the research. Overall, SMEs- usually in an unconscious way support their long-term business operations by managing changes, however, the management of changes influencing strategy remain out of consideration. In other words, in SMEs' lives strategic management and change management do not consciously co-relate. According to our assumption about the new characteristics of changes, the SMEs need to find out new methods, and behavioral patterns. The strategy is not enough itself.","[Kurucz, Attila] Szechenyi Istvan Univ, 1 Egyet Ter, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary",University of Istvan Szechenyi,"Kurucz, A (通讯作者)，Szechenyi Istvan Univ, 1 Egyet Ter, H-9026 Gyor, Hungary.",kurucz.attila@sze.hu,"Kurucz Dr., Attila/HZK-5945-2023","Kurucz Dr., Attila/0000-0003-3122-8174",,,,,12,1,1,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,417,428,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300034,0

Design/methodology/approach - A firm-level Ministry of Commerce (MofCom) database of greenfield and non-greenfield Chinese investments abroad is used. A six fixed-effects logit analysis is performed. Findings - Chinese firms tend to invest in EU countries with reduced rule of law; market affluence is an attraction factor for them, but they do not seem to be human capital asset-seekers. Countries with politically stable environment are most attractive to sales/services subsidiaries; while countries with good control of corruption, low trade barriers and encouraging foreign ownership are most attractive to manufacturing subsidiaries. A large market is the most attractive factor for R&D subsidiaries, and a rich market is the most attractive factor for manufacturing subsidiaries. Manufacturing subsidiaries are more technological asset-seekers. R&D subsidiaries are the most non-human capital asset-seekers. Research limitations/implications - The study extends the state of the art of the literature by developing a theoretical framework, grounded on the influence of host country institutional factors and on endowment of resources on the location choice of Chinese investors. Further variables should be included in the future (industrial specialization of host country, cultural distance, bilateral ties). Practical implications - Policy implications are relevant. They are related both to outward foreign direct investment attraction policies and to Europe-China cooperation dialogue. With reference to attraction policies, as Chinese green firms are technological asset-seekers, more than human capital asset-seekers, EU countries interested in partnering with Chinese investors should develop specific measures targeting encouraging technology spillover. Even R&D subsidiaries should be tempted with technology-oriented measures. With reference to Europe-China cooperation, the paper findings support suggestions for a more active European position on foreign investments in key European energy sectors. Originality/value - The paper is grounded on an improved theoretical model, tested through a unique Mofcom firm-level database. Originality lies in the fact that the authors provide a sectoral insight.

That is a very important and relevant issue for developing countries, including Georgia, the study of this issue should contribute to assessing risks and possibilities in commercial diplomacy. In the work, WTO's statistical data on tariff and non-tariff barriers is studied and its analytical review is presented. To what extent the trade liberalization measures taken within the framework of WTO contributed to increasing of neo-protectionism; whether they really promoted the expansion of international trade flows or not. The paper outlines the extent to which neo-protectionist measures would be important and useful for the development or promotion of local entrepreneurship; whether it is really better to apply them in comparison with tariff barriers. Non-tariff barriers are mainly applied by developed countries against developing ones, the reason for which is an aggravation of competition on the world market, and the country is striving for the protection of national producers' results from that. Oftentimes unilaterally introduced non-tariff regulation measures give rise to a whole chain of mutually restrictive actions. At the current stage, antidumping measures through increasing duties are the main legal import limitation instrument for WTO member countries. The number of antidumping investigations has been constantly increasing in the recent years. Transfer of non-tariff protectionism to the level of trade economic groupings appears as another trend of its development. Within the framework of numerous regional integration structures and inside bilateral trade agreements non tariff barriers are effectively applied both with respect to third countries and in member countries' mutual trade, and this takes place in conditions of significant liberalization of customs taxation. The conclusions made in the work deal with what should be taken into account by the countries in selecting a trade policy; how a concrete government should make a decision in the process of establishing of trade barriers and what measure it should opt for in a certain situation. It is a very important issue for the national governments of developing countries, especially from the viewpoint of protection of infant industries.","[Mikaberidze, Tamta] Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 3 Univ St, Tbilisi, Georgia",Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State University,"Mikaberidze, T (通讯作者)，Ivane Javakhishvili Tbilisi State Univ, 3 Univ St, Tbilisi, Georgia.",mikaberidzetamta@gmail.com,"Mikaberidze, Tamta/ABD-4241-2020",,,,,,16,0,0,0,4,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,30,41,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300002,0

The author explores the optimal design of student loans when young college graduates can be unemployed and reaches three main conclusions. First, the optimal student loan program must incorporate an unemployment compensation mechanism as a key element, even if unemployment probabilities are endogenous and subject to moral hazard. Second, despite the presence of moral hazard, a well-designed student loan program can deliver efficient levels of investments. Dispersion in consumption should be introduced so the labor market potential of any individual, regardless of the family's financial background, is not impaired as long as the individual is willing to put forth the effort, both during school and afterward, when seeking a job. Third, the amounts of unemployment benefits and the debt repayment schedule should be adjusted with the length of the unemployment spell. As unemployment persists, benefits should decline and repayments should increase to provide the right incentives for young college graduates to seek employment.","[Monge-Naranjo, Alexander] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Monge-Naranjo, A (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63166 USA.",,"Monge-Naranjo, Alexander/H-9949-2016","Monge-Naranjo, Alexander/0000-0002-6068-7620",,,,,9,2,2,0,13,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

We apply a series of tests such as dynamic OLS and strict exogeneity test to prove that this relationship is dynamic in nature and the application of static estimators such as the traditional OLS and fixed-effects can potentially generate biased results. This study uses dynamic panel data estimation to overcome the problem of endogeneity in analysing the relationship between IC and financial performance of the firms. We use two-step system generalized methods of moments estimator which can incorporate this dynamic relationship to provide valid instruments in order to overcome unobserved heterogeneity and simultaneity issues. Our study includes 774 publically listed firms from the London Stock Exchange for the period of 2005 to 2014 to measure the relationship between IC efficiency (measured in terms of VAIC) and firm performance (in terms of ROA, ROE, ATO and P/B). Our results reveal that IC efficiency (VAIC) is positively and significantly related to firm performance particularly with ROA and weekly with ROE but insignificant with assets turnover and P/B ratio. We extend our analysis to individual components of VAIC i.e. human, structural and physical capital and find that structural capital and physical capital are significantly related with firm performance. Human capital is not significantly correlated with firm performance whereas this relationship is significant when we apply static OLS and fixed-effects in our study. The interaction terms of IC and financial crisis 2008 report that IC efficiency is generally unchanged during the financial turmoil. We also find that current IC efficiency is related with past firm performance up to three years which means that investments in IC resources take some time to payback. These findings are useful for policy makers who decide about investments in IC resources.","[Nadeem, Muhammad; Gan, Christopher; Nguyen, Cuong] Lincoln Univ, Christchurch, New Zealand",,"Nadeem, M (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Christchurch, New Zealand.",Muhammad.Nadeem@lincolnuni.ac.nz; Christopher.Gan@lincoln.ac.nz; Cuong.Nguyen@lincoln.ac.nz,"gan, cc/JSL-2036-2023; Nadeem, Muhammad/AAD-2362-2019; Nguyen, Cuong Cao/E-7332-2018; Gan, Christopher/D-6635-2018","Nadeem, Muhammad/0000-0002-8877-4400; Nguyen, Cuong Cao/0000-0002-7563-2374; Gan, Christopher/0000-0002-5618-1651",,,,,35,6,6,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,178,185,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300023,0

Changes in GDP per capita highly influence changes in milk imports for the three countries and for Jamaica also the price of imported powdered milk.

The Fed's crisis communications strategies are evaluated; the author believes the Fed needs to put more effort into communicating its policies to the general public, and needs to be more sensitive to the dangers of providing forward guidance that ultra-low interest rates will prevail in the future, even after significant economic improvements have occurred.

In this context, sugar beets gain more and more importance for the production of biogas. To date, there have not been any studies on the attitude of farmers towards the alternative use of sugar beets in biogas plants. We, therefore, investigated how substrate supply contracts should be designed that farmers agree to cultivate sugar beets for biogas. Due to the lack of farm-level data, we conducted an online-survey including a Discrete Choice Experiment with 118 German farmers. Our results show that the participating farmers react with restraint to contract sugar beets for biogas. If farmers opt for a supply contract of beet as biogas substrate, they prefer a short contract period and small-scale cultivation. A spring harvest of sugar beets is generally rejected.","[Sauthoff, Saramena; Anastassiadis, Friederike; Musshoff, Oliver] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Sauthoff, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Fac Agr Sci, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Pl Goettinger Sieben, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",saramena.sauthoff@agr.uni-goettingen.de,"Mußhoff, Oliver/AAZ-1868-2021","Mußhoff, Oliver/0000-0002-3746-623X",,,,,74,1,1,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

The exploratory analysis draws on interviews with local and federal officials as well as beneficiaries of the Bolsa Familia in order to identify the ways monitoring and accountability have evolved in practise and on the ground. Field research highlights that citizen- and community-driven participatory mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and accountability are relatively weak. Top-down administrative regulations, such as programmatic transparency and random audits, have largely worked to protect the integrity of the programme.

However, linguistic approximation remains an under-researched area and best practices in management, economics, decision support, social science and behavioural research are missing. The paper explores the performance of two selected distance measures of fuzzy numbers and two different fuzzy similarity measures in the context of linguistic approximation. Triangular fuzzy numbers are considered as the approximated entities, their symmetry is not required.

Namely, what the actual economic condition of these banks was on the date of completion of the privatization, as well as the transfer of graded loans, or rather low performing assets, which the state took over and reimbursed to the banks through consolidation institutions (hereinafter Cl), and all this obviously in relation to the purchase price obtained within the scope of privatization. The aim of this article, within the possibilities stipulated by its scope, is: 1) To analyse the development of the banks' economic condition in the time interval of 1990-2010; 2) To identify factors that determine the volume of income from the sale of the state's investments in privatized banks; 3) To confirm or refute the hypothesis that the bank rescues before the completion of the privatization process were excessive; 4) To analyse the overall balance of the privatization process, or rather the efficiency of the sale of the banks; 5) To test the practical applicability of the economic theories connected to the issue in question. With regard to the above, the article is structured in the following manner. Firstly, literary research of articles on the theme of The Privatization Of Commercial Banking in reputable economic impact magazines is processed. This is followed by the actual economic analysis of the privatized banks in the Czech Republic, where economic parameters are examined in an interval of approximately 20 years total assets, costs, revenue, profit, capital adequacy, etc. The conclusion firstly evaluates the development of the economic condition, then identifies factors that determine the volume of income from privatization, the excessiveness of the banks' rescue, the overall balance of the privatization process, and the practical applicability of the economic theories in question.","[Zeman, Karel] Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospoddiska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Zeman, K (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon Praze, Narodohospoddiska Fak, Prague, Czech Republic.",karelzeman@email.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Based on a panel of Amazon municipalities from 2002 through 2009, we first show that deforestation responded to agricultural output prices. After controlling for price effects, we find that conservation policies implemented beginning in 2004 and 2008 significantly contributed to the curbing of deforestation. Counterfactual simulations suggest that conservation policies avoided approximately 73,000 km(2) of deforestation, or 56 per cent of total forest clearings that would have occurred from 2005 through 2009 had the policies adopted beginning in 2004 and 2008 not been introduced.

However, the evidence regarding the link between smoking behavior and cognitive function in old age is mixed. While nicotine has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in some medical studies, current smokers typically perform worse than non-smokers on cognitive tests in population based studies. We use the Health and Retirement Study to evaluate the role of unobserved factors in explaining these conflicting findings. Results from individual fixed effects models show that much of the lower cognitive function of current and former smokers relative to never smokers can be attributed to unobserved differences between these groups.

As a consequence, the public finances were only moderately affected and not many policy reforms had to be enacted. This paper presents the German experience of the financial crisis. We start by presenting the macroeconomic situation and how the crisis unfolded in Germany, before focusing on the situation of the public finances.

The results show that the tax code reduces income inequality considerably in all states. All of this income compression is attributable to federal taxes, as state taxes, on average, widen the after-tax income distribution slightly Nevertheless, there is very substantial cross-state variation in the impact of state tax policies. The paper further documents that the mitigating influence of taxes on income inequality has risen since the early 1980s, with the increase at the state level due mostly to changes to the tax code.","[Cooper, Daniel H.] Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Res Dept, Boston, MA 02210 USA; [Lutz, Byron F.; Palumbo, Michael G.] Fed Reserve Board, Div Res & Stat, Washington, DC USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Boston; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors,"Cooper, DH (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Boston, Res Dept, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",daniel.cooper@bos.fed.org; byron.flutz@frb.gov; michael.g.palumbo@frb.gov,"Palumbo, Michael G/H-6212-2012",,,,,,53,7,8,2,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

The new lottery choices have the same expected payoffs and standard deviation as the original set of choices, but with positive skewness. We find that subjects are skewness-seekers and more importantly, positive skewness in the payoff structure increases the riskiness of subjects' preferred lottery choices.

These models convey two main messages. On one hand, they suggest that the prospects for effective climate cooperation are bleak: The standard view is that stable coalitions are small and that renegotiation-proof equilibria require that only a few countries participate. On the other hand, there might be light at the end of the tunnel after all. First, more recent work suggests that larger coalitions can be made stable. Second, other recent work suggests that it may be possible to design a renegotiation-proof climate agreement with broad or even full participation. Third, deposit-refund systems might help solve some of the obstacles for effective climate cooperation. Fourth, although the law of the least ambitious program pinpoints severe constraints on effective cooperation, this law has its limits. Fifth, countries may use cooperative probes to build trust. Sixth, cooperation might emerge in a completely decentralized fashion. Finally, experiments indicate that some of the conditions for effective cooperation that are taken for granted in most formal models might in fact be overly strict.","[Hovi, Jon] Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, POB 1097, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Ward, Hugh] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Grundig, Frank] Univ Kent, Rutherford Coll, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Canterbury CT2 7NX, Kent, England",University of Oslo; University of Essex; University of Kent,"Hovi, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Polit Sci, POB 1097, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",jon.hovi@stv.uio.no; hugh@essex.ac.uk; F.Grundig@kent.ac.uk,,,,,,,125,38,38,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This gas revolution came from an earlier revolution in the regulation of gas pipelines, which ended the obstruction of gas markets by pipeline interests. Neither revolution has spread to Europe, where increasingly protectionist EU legislation has effectively blocked competitive pipeline entry and related gas markets. As a result, unconventional gas is untapped, coal displaces gas for power generation, and oil-linked gas prices have cost EU consumers a staggering $425 billion more than their US counterparts have paid since 2009 for about the same quantity of gas. Europe faces a serious institutional challenge to adopting the kind of pipeline regulation that facilitates the competitive flow of natural gas supplies and the accompanying lower carbon emissions.

Despite the wide-spread use of this mechanism, little is known about its effectiveness at facilitating cooperation. We analyze an agreement formation game that includes an endogenously determined minimum participation constraint and then test the predictions using economic experiments. We demonstrate theoretically that players will vote to implement an efficient coalition size as the membership requirement and this coalition will form. Experimental tests of the theory demonstrate that the minimum participation mechanism is highly effective at facilitating cooperation when efficiency requires the participation of all players. However, when efficiency requires only a subset of players to participate, profitable coalitions are often deliberately blocked. In light of our results it is possible that equity concerns can impede the formation of international agreements when membership requirements allow free riders.","[McEvoy, David M.; Cherry, Todd L.] Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA; [Cherry, Todd L.] Ctr Int Climate & Environm Res Oslo, POB 1129, N-0318 Oslo, Norway; [Stranlund, John K.] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Resource Econ, 222 Stockbridge Hall, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of North Carolina; Appalachian State University; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"McEvoy, DM (通讯作者)，Appalachian State Univ, Dept Econ, Boone, NC 28608 USA.",mcevoydm@appstate.edu; cherrytl@appstate.edu; stranlund@resecon.umass.edu,,,,,,,33,10,10,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Shane (Small Bus Econ 33(2):141-149, 2009) has argued that designing public policies which encourage more people to become entrepreneurs is counterproductive, and the exclusive focus should be high-growth ventures, or gazelles. As a counter to Shane's position, four types of start-up ventures are considered, with each having differing needs and making unique contributions to the economic welfare of a nation, region, or locality. Based on this typology, seven counter-arguments to Shane's position are presented, addressing issues related to the cost of entry and exit, rates of efficiency and failure, employment levels, sector differences, ecosystems, and venture emergence. Based on these counter-arguments, a portfolio perspective is advocated, where societal risks and a variety of returns are balanced across all four types of new ventures. An example of a portfolio approach to policy design is provided, and implications are drawn.","[Morris, Michael H.; Neumeyer, Xaver] Univ Florida, Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Morris, Michael H.] Univ Western Cape, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa; [Kuratko, Donald F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of the Western Cape; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Kuratko, DF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",michael.morris@warrington.ufl.edu; xaver.neumeyer@warrington.ufl.edu; dkuratko@indiana.edu,"Pereira, Fernanda/AID-4926-2022; Neumeyer, Xaver/AAG-9416-2021","Neumeyer, Xaver/0000-0001-7662-5830; Morris, Michael/0000-0003-2784-410X",,,,,110,85,99,0,90,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Key experimental results are reported to investigate the extent that bandwagon behavior can be explained by other-regarding preferences in contrast to a psychological desire to simply support a winner. We find support for purely psychological non-other-regarding bandwagon behavior but primarily when subjects have information about the distribution of voter choices in previous elections but individual choices are private. Interestingly, when voting is public this type of bandwagon behavior disappears and bandwagon behavior that could be other-regrading is much higher. Given that observability increases other-regarding behavior in other contexts, our results suggest that some of the observed bandwagon behavior may be explained by other-regarding preferences as well.

Using a panel dataset of 26 agricultural districts (distributed across six agro-ecological regions) for the period 2004 to 2012, we estimate technical efficiency (TE) indices using a standard stochastic production frontier and meta-technological gap ratios (MTR) with a meta-frontier approach. The study finds that farmers use available technology suboptimally and produce far less than potential output. The average TE indices range from as low as 0.40 for Maun, 0.71 for Western and to 0.79 for the Southern region. The mean MTR also varies substantially across regions; high for Western (0.83), Southern (0.80) and Francistown (0.79) regions and low for the Maun region (0.39). A low MTR for the Maun region is attributed to the re-occurrence of FMD and human and wildlife conflict in this region, restricting the ability of farmers to fully reach their potential output. The results of this study have important implications for policy targeting. The study results allow us to identify the differences in productive performance between beef producers in each region of Botswana, and hence where policies to improve production technologies could be focused.","[Temoso, Omphile; Hadley, David; Villano, Renato] Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia",University of New England,"Temoso, O (通讯作者)，Univ New England, UNE Sch Business, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",otemoso@myune.edu.au; dhadley@une.edu.au; rvillan2@une.edu.au,"Temoso, Omphile/R-2392-2017; Villano, Renato Andrin/I-3680-2017; Hadley, David/C-5924-2008","Temoso, Omphile/0000-0002-3327-0467; Villano, Renato Andrin/0000-0003-2581-6623; Hadley, David/0000-0001-8634-2586",,,,,53,7,9,0,4,AGRICULTURAL ECON ASSOC SOUTH AFRICA,MATIELAND,"DEPT AGRICULTURAL ECON, PRIVATE BAG X1, MATIELAND, 7602, SOUTH AFRICA",0303-1853,2078-0400,,AGREKON,Agrekon,DEC,2015,54.0,4,,,,,87,112,,10.1080/03031853.2015.1116399,0.0,,,26,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DG8ZH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372371600005,0

The origin of the crisis matters,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Reform; Crisis; Sudden stop; Financial flows; Ordered logit,ECONOMIC-POLICY REFORM; SUDDEN STOPS; GROWTH; FLIGHT,"The empirical literature assessing whether crisis begets reform has paid little attention to the role of the origin of crises. This paper considers seven dimensions of financial reform, as well as an aggregate index of these dimensions, and focuses on crises defined as sudden stops in financial flows. Recent work on gross financial flows provides a suitable strategy to distinguish between domestic crises (sudden flight) and external crises (true sudden stops). While the origin of the crisis plays no role in explaining the likelihood of reform in the case of the aggregate index of financial reform, different origins of crises affect different individual dimensions of financial reform. Thus, the origin of the crisis matters when assessing the nexus between financial crisis and financial reform. The evidence is particularly compelling for the case of sudden flight and reform of capital account restrictions, and more tentative for the case of true sudden stops and reform of banking regulation and supervision. These findings underscore the need to pay greater attention to the origin of crises in empirical work focusing on the relationship between financial crisis and financial reform, and also in theoretical models of the political economy of financial reform.

The authors attempt to determine whether having a quality job helps to preserve mental health among workers, especially among immigrants. The literature emphasizes that it is difficult for immigrants to integrate into the Canadian job market and that unemployment is one of the primary stressors on the mental health of newcomers. Our results obtained from data in the Quebec Survey on Working and Employment Conditions and Occupational Health and Safety (QSWECOHS) show that having a quality job reduces psychological distress more among immigrants than among the native population. This suggests that quality of work has a greater impact on preserving the mental health of immigrants than that of the native population. Accordingly, investing in immigrant integration would be more than cost-effective for the host society.","[Boulet, Maude] McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Boudarbat, Brahim] Univ Montreal, Ecole Relat Ind, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; Universite de Montreal,"Boulet, M (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Sociol, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",,,,,,,,38,2,2,0,13,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

Fontaine and Garcia (2012) propose a price-based funding liquidity factor from mispricing of bonds of similar characteristics but different ages. However, their arbitrage-free Nelson-Siegel framework requires the use of a non-linear Kalman filter, which is computationally intensive in practice. The novelty of this paper is to suggest an easier method for constructing an alternative liquidity factor that retains much of the same properties. Our proposed method for constructing this proxy liquidity factor relaxes the arbitrage-free assumption in the specification of the term structure model and bases it on a simple and flexible term structure specification. We demonstrate that this parsimonious liquidity factor fits the data well. The constructed factor is highly correlated with the Fontaine and Garcia (2012) liquidity factor and other funding liquidity measures, such as a liquidity factor by Hu etal.

These effects are mitigated when public liquidity is accessed, thus confirming that public liquidity provision was conducive to maintaining lending growth.

Procurement, Construction. Commissioning (EPCC) investment types. The objective of this study was to improve the project portfolio management. The methodology used in the research presented in this paper is focused on the analysis of the authors related to the approaches debated in literature and theirs applicability in EPCC type investment programs. In this sense were analyzed 11 international projects in petrochemical and refinery field and also 7 investments in other different areas of chemical industry. The research highlighted that the management process of these investments can be improved trough the correct project integration, being able to provide a performing working environment able to sustain the management team in identifying the investment program criticalities and congestion points in order to be able to manage them in an efficient manner in order to assure the reach of the investment goal. Having as consequence the possibility to significant reduction of execution period, up to 16% and in the mean time also the delays related risks through a more efficient investment managerial act.","[Sandru, Mircea; Pirnea, Ionela Carmen; Surugiu, Ioana; Schmid, Jochen] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Purcarea, Anca] Constantin Brancoveanu Univ, Valcea, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Constantin Brancoveanu University,"Sandru, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",mircea_sandru@yahoo.com,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,28,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2015,17.0,,,,9,,1314,1330,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW9KT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365318300015,0

We construct a stochastic growth multi-country model in which heterogeneous agents face the following restrictions on asset trade. First, the degree of US equity market participation is higher than that of the rest of the world. Second, a fraction of households in each country maintains a fixed share of equity in its portfolios. In our calibrated model, which matches the US net foreign asset position and the equity premium, the average US household loads up more aggregate risk than the average foreign household by investing in risky assets abroad and issuing risk-free assets. As a result, the US is compensated by a high risk premium and runs trade deficits even as a debtor country. The long-run average trade deficit in our model accounts for 50% of the observed US trade deficit. (C) 2015 Elsevier BV.

It analyzes stock price responses for 3,045 nonfinancial firms in 16 countries to four key policy events during 2010-11. Using precrisis benchmarks, it separates financial effects from trade effects and examines how bank and trade linkages propagated shocks. It finds that policy measures affected financially dependent firms more, particularly in creditor countries with greater bank exposure to peripheral euro countries, in statistically and economically significant ways. Trade linkages with peripheral countries played little role, although euro movements meant some differential effects.","[Claessens, Stijn] Univ Amsterdam, Div Int Finance, Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Claessens, Stijn] CEPR, London, England; [Tong, Hui] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Zuccardi, Igor] World Bank, Washington, DC USA",University of Amsterdam; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; International Monetary Fund; The World Bank,"Claessens, S (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Div Int Finance, Board Governors Fed Reserve Syst, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands.",stijn.claessens@frb.gov; htong@imf.org; izuccardi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,39,6,6,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

In spite of the developments in better identifying transportation disadvantaged groups, the lack of effective policies resulted in the continuum of the issue as a significant problem. This paper undertakes a pilot case investigation as test bed for a new approach developed to reduce transportation policy shortcomings. The approach, 'disadvantage-impedance index', aims to ease transportation disadvantages by employing representative parameters to measure the differences between policy alternatives run in a simulation environment. Implemented in the Japanese town of Arao, the index uses trip-making behaviour and resident stated preference data. The results of the index reveal that even a slight improvement in accessibility and travel quality indicators makes a significant difference in easing disadvantages. The index, integrated into a four-step model, proves to be highly robust and useful in terms of quick diagnosis in capturing effective actions, and developing potentially efficient policies.
