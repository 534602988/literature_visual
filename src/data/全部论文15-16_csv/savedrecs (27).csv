Middle-aged and middle-income workers, particularly those with young children at home, showed the strongest negative relationship between health insurance and job satisfaction. The most plausible explanation is that these workers were in suboptimal labor market situations because of their familial responsibilities to provide health insurance for their family relative to workers who were free to choose a better job match or not work at all. This is confirmed by workers with options to obtain health insurance from a source other than their own jobs, namely those likely eligible for parental insurance, Medicaid, or Medicare, who showed no such negative relationship between health insurance and job satisfaction.","[Adams, Scott] Univ Wisconsin, Econ Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53706 USA; [Artz, Benjamin] Univ Wisconsin, Econ Dept, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Wisconsin System,"Adams, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Econ Dept, Milwaukee, WI 53706 USA.",sjadams@uwm.edu,,,,,,,34,4,6,2,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

This paper focuses on how much curbside to allocate to parking when the private sector provides garage parking. In the first-best optimum, no cruising for parking occurs, and only curbside parking is provided when demand is low relative to street capacity, both curbside parking and garage parking are provided when demand in intermediate, and only garage parking is provided when demand is high. In the second-best optimum where curbside parking is underpriced, cruising for parking occurs only when both curbside and garage parking are both present. As the fee differential between garage and curbside parking increases, cruising for parking becomes more severe, and the range of demand levels over which curbside and garage parking are both present shrinks and eventually disappears.

We study the effect of a net neutrality regulation on capacity investments in the market for Internet access, and on innovation in the market for content. Under the alternative discriminatory regime, platforms charge a priority fee to those CP's which are willing to deliver their content on a fast lane. We find that under discrimination, investments in broadband capacity and content innovation are both higher than under net neutrality. Total welfare increases, though the discriminatory regime is not always beneficial to the platforms as it can intensify competition for subscribers. As platforms have a unilateral incentive to switch to the discriminatory regime, a prisoner's dilemma can arise.

Previous studies have examined the determinants of bank liquidity. However, excess lending is neglected, especially the role of different lending channels. We consider a theoretical measure of liquidity, liquidity creation, and compare the results with an officially recommended measure suggested by the Basel III Committee. Excessive lending is captured in three dimensions, namely, relative lending, non-performing loan ratio, and diversification in lending channel. We find that the results of non-performing loan ratio support the trade-off hypothesis, whereas the results of lending channel diversification are consistent with our liquidity spiral hypothesis, especially for state-owned banks. Moreover, the interactions between capital and liquidity are negative for joint-stock commercial banks and state-owned banks rather than city commercial banks. Finally, the ownership structures significantly affect banks' liquidity preferences. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Delegation does not appear to be monolithic; instead, our results show that it varies across corporate policies and also varies with the personal characteristics of the CEO. We find that CEOs delegate financial decisions for which they need the most input, when they are overloaded, and when they are distracted by recent acquisitions. CEOs delegate less when they are knowledgeable (long-tenured or with a finance background). Capital is allocated based on gut feel and the personal reputation of the manager running a given division.

The impact persisted because exports to the EU did not revive and the local shrimp demand could not fully compensate for the loss of the EU market.

Because aid provides additional resources to recipient governments, it reduces the importance aid-recipient governments attach to the preferences of their export partners. Consequently, aid inadvertently moderates the leverage exercised by importing countries on the governments of exporting, developing countries. Our analysis of a panel of 91 aid recipient countries for the period 1985-2002 lends support to the revenue substitution hypothesis. When aid levels are low, bilateral trade-based pressures are associated with improved labor rights. As aid levels rise, however, the effect loses significance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we analyse whether interest rate volatility contains information on agent expectations which are directly measured by confidence indicators. For the sake of robustness, we use several different expectation indicators for the two countries we analyse, the US and Germany. We propose using a forward-looking measure of volatility: the implied volatility of one year cap options. We find that implied volatility adds explanatory power to the yield spread and to changes in the short rate, which are typical predictors of the business cycle, and outperforms realized volatility.","[Martinez-Serna, Maria-Isabel] Univ Murcia, Dept Management & Finance, Murcia, Spain; [Navarro, Eliseo] Univ Alcala de Henares, Dept Econ & Management, Madrid, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad de Alcala,"Martínez-Serna, MI (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Management & Finance, Murcia, Spain.",marisams@um.es,"; Martinez-Serna, Maria-Isabel/L-2726-2014","NAVARRO, ELISEO/0000-0002-0077-7106; Martinez-Serna, Maria-Isabel/0000-0003-2422-3383",Fundacion Cajamurcia; [MEC ECO2011-28134],Fundacion Cajamurcia;,The authors acknowledge financial support from the grant MEC ECO2011-28134.

This regulatory model could simply be extended to offshore (i.e. Germany), but the connection of offshore wind farms to shore is also an opportunity to test alternatives, i.e. the third party model (i.e. the UK) or the generator model (i.e. Sweden). In this paper, we argue that the third party and generator models are indeed better suited to support the evolution towards larger scale offshore wind farms that are increasingly developed farther out to sea, while the TSO model is better suited to support the evolution towards cross-border offshore grid projects. In other words, an important trade-off needs to be made because none of the existing regulatory models can fulfill all the expectations in the current context in Europe. And, the trade-off has to be made at the regional or EU level because the different national regulatory frameworks are incompatible when applied to a cross-border offshore grid project.","[Meeus, Leonardo] Vlerick Business Sch, Brussels, Belgium; [Meeus, Leonardo] European Univ Inst, Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy",Vlerick Business School; European University Institute,"Meeus, L (通讯作者)，Vlerick Business Sch, Bolwerklaan 21, Brussels, Belgium.",Leonardo.Meeus@vlerick.com,"Meeus, Leonardo/GPP-4042-2022","Meeus, Leonardo/0000-0003-1490-816X",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"The research for this article was conducted with Francois Leveque, Marcelo Saguan, Isabel Azevedo and Jean-Michel Glachant in the context of the EU FP7 funded project THINK.

Here, efforts to decentralize control over mineral resource wealth have resulted in a highly ambiguous institutional arena, wherein heterogeneous actor coalitions are attempting to influence trajectories of institutional change, and the associated distribution of mineral wealth. On the ground, this institutional renegotiation produces a diverse range of conflicts. Emerging on top of these institutional struggles are local elected politicians, which raises important concerns over elite capture of the decentralization process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, we demonstrate that a higher second-division prize induces a lower investment level, but higher profits in the top division, while higher club efficiency in the second division leads to both a lower investment level and lower profits in the top division.

Such temptation is even stronger when people decide for the distant future as compared with the near future. In Experiments I and 2 we showed that increasing temporal distance makes people more likely to choose a high risk $-bet ((sic)400, 0.02;0) over a low risk p-bet ((sic)14, 0.60;0). Furthermore, the risk aversion shift increased proportionally to the time delay and persisted even for long delays (6 months). In Experiment 3, we showed that this temporal effect is associated with a decrease in positive feelings towards the p-bet, and with a decrease in the positive evaluation of the high-probability (60%) of the p-bet, but not with an increase of the positive evaluation of the high-payoff (400 euro) of the p-bet. In Experiment 4, we showed that increasing the salience of the probability feature tended to decrease the temporal effect, while increasing the salience of the prize did not vary the strength of the effect. Results are in line with an affect-based explanation of the temporal effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As the scale of projects increases, the severity of risks intensifies. This study sets out to highlight a particular set of risks associated with strategic decision making in public construction projects. Of particular importance stands the client organizations' capacity to properly manage risks rooted in poor decision making that leads to many types of project failure. To curb the negative effects of poor decision making, varying organisational configurations have been adopted by clients. This paper investigates the six Swedish public client organizations' risk management procedures, the risk types and the frequency by which they reference risk management in their internal documents. The purpose is to explore how organisational measures influence a client's ability to undertake major construction projects in a manner that is conducive to effective project delivery.

Eight quantitative case studies using the SC method clarify that the effects of NPF establishment on per capita taxable income levels are highly heterogeneous. The estimated effects are often economically meaningful and in some cases huge: the income level was 11% higher on average and 62% higher in one municipality in 2002 when compared with counterfactual units. On the other hand a few of the NPF municipalities have received only weak or negligible effects from NPF establishment.

The financial crisis that began in the second half of the last decade created imbalances in all the fields of the economic and social life and provoked very interesting mutations. The international real estate marked was confronted with important changes of rhythm, as dimensions and structures, as well as intervention levers. Some effects of the generalized economic crisis such as: the growth of the unemployment rate, the reduction of the purchasing power or the intensification of the migration process of the active population have deepen the gaps between the rhythms of the dynamics of the real estate investments at a national level and they led to the most unexpected decisions. In the last several years, the imbalances between the financial market and the monetary market generated instabilities at a world scale and speculative policies, that in some countries accentuated the uncertainties and they delayed the start towards economic revival, and in other countries they constituted strong points in redefining future strategies for development. From a geographical point of view, the new map of the real estate markets will offer a completely different from the one that existed until 2007. A new generation of Asian tigers looks to dominate the real estate market and countries like Qatar, Chile or India will define themselves as area of maximum interest for the real estate investors.

The calculation of indicators from different domains and decomposition approaches is presented as part of post-processing of model results. We review user roles with regard to the application of complex economic models in agricultural IA, concluding that the GUIs will be mostly used by experienced analysts. The article stresses the role of GUIs in separating the code implementation of the economic model from the presentation of their results for analytical purposes. It highlights core functionalities of GUIs based on a detailed comparison between the GUIs and post-model analysis tools of three large economic models: AglinkCosimo, CAPRI and GTAP (Global Trade Analysis Project). Whereas the Aglink-Cosimo and CAPRI (Common Agricultural Policy Regionalised Impact Modelling System) models follow a strict separation between model and data analysis software tools, the GTAP model follows a model integrated approach using GEMPACK (General Equilibrium Modelling Package) tools. Moreover, the CAPRI GUI is technically and formally detached from the data generation process. Aglink-Cosimo and GTAP models use tools specifically developed to serve mainly their own needs (and tailored to communicate with their model drivers). One specific characteristic of Aglink-Cosimo relates to the need of interactive documentation for users due to the declarative nature of the code, which relies upon the obligation of the OECD and FAO to deliver a transparent and well-documented model and data-base to a formalized group of users. The CAPRI and GTAP models are much more research-driven and therefore have invested more resources in building bridges with other model consortia. We conclude that an integrated GUI would benefit from combining the best features of the different approaches presented.","[Britz, Wolfgang] Univ Bonn, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Perez-Dominguez, Ignacio] European Commiss, Seville, Spain; [Narayanan, Gopalakrishnan Badri] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",University of Bonn; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Britz, W (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Nussallee 21, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",wolfgang.britz@ilr.uni-bonn.de,"Britz, Wolfgang/I-3046-2014; Perez, Ignacio/B-3718-2018","Britz, Wolfgang/0000-0002-8532-3823; Perez, Ignacio/0000-0002-0279-6263",,,,,57,2,2,0,7,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

In a survey experiment, five pictures from a 40,000 broiler barn were shown to citizens. The pictures were taken in the same barn but vary in age of the animals and stocking densities. The sample was split to avoid the five pictures from influencing the perception and each participant was shown only one picture. Overall, the evaluation of the pictures was very negative. Only the picture showing day-old-chicks was perceived as favorable (stocking density: 0.8 kg/m(2)). This is a challenge for the communication of animal welfare standards because the reductions, inter alia currently being discussed in science and politics of stocking densities were not perceived as an animal welfare advantage from a citizen perspective.","[Busch, Gesa; Schwetje, Carolin; Spiller, Achim] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen,"Busch, G (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",,"Busch, Gesa/JHT-5738-2023; Busch, Gesa/AAI-1529-2020; Spiller, Achim/CAJ-5518-2022",,,,,,0,11,11,0,8,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Methods: Patients were randomized to control group (cervical manipulation) and experimental group (combining cervical manipulation with Baduangong exercise). The two groups received manipulation of the cervical spine alone every other day for 2 weeks, and the experimental group performed Baduangong also. VAS scale and NDI were all completed. Results: There were 21 patients, 12 in control group and 9 in experimental group. The mean age of the patients is 39.1 +/- 5.2years.

For the border region as a whole, we find that a 10 percent increase in maquiladora wages (a proxy for maquiladora activity) leads to a 1.1 to 1.5 percent increase in employment in the corresponding US border city. We also find that the average can be misleading, with differences across border cities and sectors.

Our findings largely corroborate expectations suggested by the theoretical literature, albeit with one notable exception: the relative size of a partisan constituency reduces, rather than enhances, the likelihood of a party having an extreme optimal position. We then compare derived equilibrium positions with actual party positions, with the aim of understanding the nature of electoral incentives and offering insights about party-system competition. In particular, we show that the age of a party, the party family to which it belongs, post-election expectations, and internal rules for candidate and leader selection, are all factors that increase the probability of a party approaching the position predicted by pure vote-maximizing considerations.","Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, I-20122 Milan, Italy",University of Milan,"Curini, L (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dept Social & Polit Sci, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, Italy.",luigi.curini@unimi.it,"Curini, Luigi/D-9441-2017","Curini, Luigi/0000-0003-1974-9815",,,,,47,4,4,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0048-5829,1573-7101,,PUBLIC CHOICE,Public Choice,JAN,2015,162.0,1-2,,,,,79,96,,10.1007/s11127-014-0199-6,0.0,,,18,Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Government & Law,AW6ZK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000346414000005,0

This paper focuses on a novel capital flow management tool, the reserve option mechanism (ROM) introduced by the Central Bank of Turkey, that allows banks to hold a certain fraction of their domestic-currency required reserves in foreign currency. The results suggest that, after the introduction the ROM (i) market expectations leaned towards a significantly lower volatility or skewness in the U.S. dollar/Turkish lira (USD/TL) relative to other emerging market exchange rates; (ii) controlling for a set of domestic and common external factors, the USD/TL expectations have exhibited lower levels of volatility, skewness and kurtosis; (iii) the higher the intensity of ROM (the fraction of ROM-based reserves in total international reserves) the stronger the effect of ROM on exchange rate expectations. Last, we provide evidence that the mechanism acts as an automatic stabilizer of expectations about excessive movements in the exchange rate; the mechanism decreases the sensitivity of expected USD/TL kurtosis to the common external factor (by an estimated decrease of about 85%). In sum, the results provide evidence that the mechanism contains market expectations about excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate, decreasing expected likelihood of an abrupt reversal of capital flows.

Instead, we take the insufficiently discussed paradigm of world's risk society as a starting point. The cognitive scopes of this paradigm are compared to the cognitive scopes of narration of the global knowledge society. Recent research into world's risk society indicate that the negative consequences of globalization have long been here, not only in the field of economics, ecology, conflicts between different world views or value orientations but also in the field of dramatic increase in insecurity. Insecurity most often occurs due to unbalanced development or unbalanced approach to resources. The rise of the world's risk society as the disaster capitalism is related to the increased gap between the extremely rich and the extremely poor. However, poverty does not only signal the material deprivation or the lack of possession of certain goods. Poverty can be ideational or cognitive. It concerns our cognitive and educational systems of knowledge, and is primarily related to the orientation or epistemic crisis of the western paradigm of the global knowledge society. The aim of this paper is to point to the cognitive weaknesses of the global knowledge society paradigm, with regard to the real socio-economic indicators in Bosnia and Herzegovina and its surrounding countries as well as in the context of the new risks we face. The qualitative methodology in the field of socio-economic research is used precisely due to the fact that this methodology is often unjustifiably neglected. The result of the paper is evident in the fact that the methodological assumptions used by holistically oriented researchers such as D. Cohen, E. O. Wilson, and B. Flyvbjerg can be qualitatively improved, if analyzed in the context of the world's risk society paradigm.","[Delic, Zlatan] Univ Tuzla, Fac Philosophy, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Delic, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Philosophy, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",zlatan.delic@untz.ba,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,614,627,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700038,0

We find that stock returns of oil producers are affected positively by oil price changes regardless of whether oil price is increasing or decreasing. For oil consumers, oil price changes do not affect all consumer sub-sectors and where it does, this effect is heterogeneous. We find that oil price returns have an asymmetric effect on stock returns for most sub-sectors. We devise simple trading strategies and find that while both consumers and producers of oil can make statistically significant profits, investors in oil producer sectors make relatively more profits than investors in oil consumer sectors.

The analysis is performed on a sample of 27 OECD countries in the period 1997-2011. It is based on the neoclassic growth model extended with the level of human capital and fiscal variables. Those include particular types of government spending (according to the COFOG classification) and taxes (according to the OECD classification), and state budget deficit. From a methodological point of view, panel data estimation is used. We support the view that only some types of government spending are growth-enhancing, and only if they are financed through indirect taxes. However, the results show that only. expenditure on defense, education and health, and general public services may be labeled as productive. In addition, we show that direct taxes, especially corporate taxes, negatively affect the growth, also in case they are used to finance productive spending.","[Drobiszova, Agata; Machova, Zuzana] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, CZ-70121 Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Drobiszová, A (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, CZ-70121 Ostrava, Czech Republic.",agata.drobiszova@vsb.cz; zuzana.machova@vsb.cz,"Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,57,12,12,4,29,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,2336-8225,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Realtime crowdsourcing ensures that solutions to a given problem are obtained in the shortest possible time using collective intelligence. In order to be ready to carry out any requested task in realtime, crowdworkers must be available at any time. Here we focus on the payment of crowdworkers and on the trade-off between the expected waiting time for a task to be carried out and the number of workers in the pool that should not become too large otherwise the total cost increases. In particular we consider the, so called, Retainer Model in which crowdworkers are paid in order to be ready to carry out any requested task in realtime. The Retainer Model considers an expected total cost which takes into account both the amount paid to a crowdworker to be in idle-state and the loss when the task is not completed in realtime. After checking the existence of a minimum cost we characterize the optimal number of crowdworkers, and suggest a practical and quick way to obtain it. Moreover, we analyse the sensitivity of the optimal number of crowdworkers with respect to different task intensities. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Although Valldal Gront has successfully branded its products, in these times of diminishing production and profitability, the brand equity is under siege. Farmers now seek a leaner organization. Simultaneously, pricing issues are subject to scrutiny and souring business relationships with customers. Valldal Gront continues to use information technology to better coordinate the supply chain with the daily variations in supply and fluctuating demand. The case illustrates how branding is embedded in an end-to-end supply network and its natural environment.

We address in particular how the state responded to and engaged with civil-society actors in the organic cocoa network and to what extent state involvement reshaped state-business-civil society relations? While most of the literature argues that globalization and liberalization processes weakened the state's position as key player in the development and management of agro-food networks, the case of the (organic) cocoa sector in Ghana is often depicted as an exception because of the strong position the state still occupies in it. Employing a global commodity network perspective to analyse the Ghanaian organic cocoa case, this paper demonstrates that although the state is still a major player in the contemporary (organic) cocoa network, some hybrid governance arrangements, involving state, transnational and national NGO networks, and businesses, are emerging. The organic cocoa network also prompted a double process of dis- and re-embedding' at the local level that helped shape and strengthen the organic cocoa network.","[Glin, Laurent C.; Oosterveer, Peter; Mol, Arthur P.

We used the Unrestricted Error Correction Model Pesaran Bounds test to analyze the interaction between the Malaysian and US interest rates during three different sub periods. Our empirical results showed that there is no cointegration evidence during the managed floating exchange rate periods. However, we found that there was a level relationship between the Malaysian and US interest rates during the period when Malaysia had a fixed exchange rate and an open capital account regime. In contrast with other existing studies, we conclude that Malaysia is not exempted from the impossible trinity.

Many authors argue that it is a breach of the no bail-out principle (prohibition of the financial aid). The paper deals first with the question what is the content of the no bail-out principle? Another question is whether the ESM assistance is a violation of this principle? The no bail-out principle is interpreted according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. This principle means a prohibition of the liability for commitments or a prohibition of assumption of commitments by the Union or a Member State. A comparison of this interpretation with forms of assistance provided by the ESM leads to the conclusion that the no bail-out principle is not violated. The paper also discusses this conclusion in the context with the prospects of the euro's introduction in the Czech Republic.","[Helisek, Mojmir] Univ Finance & Adm, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic",University of Finance & Administration - Czech Republic,"Helísek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Finance & Adm, Estonska 500, Prague 10100 10, Czech Republic.",mojmir.helisek@vsfs.cz,"Helisek, Mojmir/AAA-9165-2021","Helisek, Mojmir/0000-0001-5839-8240",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,198,204,,,,,,7,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300021,0

Availability of low-priced, high-quality feeds is critical in order for domestic poultry production to remain competitive and meet growing consumer demand. Production of maize, which is a predominant feed component in poultry industry, has surged in India. With average Indian maize yields lagging world and Asian averages, there are significant maize intensification opportunities to produce even more and cheaper feed, including increased use of higher-yielding ( and higher-quality) maize hybrids and associated private-and public-sector investments. Given the size of the India's poultry sector, its price competiveness and Indian entrepreneurship, India is set to take a more active role in the global poultry trade especially with respect to exports to the Middle East.","[Hellin, Jon; Erenstein, Olaf] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Mexico City 066000, DF, Mexico; [Krishna, Vijesh V.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Agr Econ & Rural Dev, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Boeber, Christian] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, New Delhi, India",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); University of Gottingen; CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT),"Hellin, J (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Socioecon Program, Apartado Postal 6-641, Mexico City 066000, DF, Mexico.",j.hellin@cgiar.org; vijeshkrishna@gmail.com; o.erenstein@cgiar.org; c.boeber@cgiar.org,"Krishna, Vijesh/AAD-3431-2022; Boeber, Christian/AAN-1133-2021","Erenstein, Olaf/0000-0002-7491-5786; Hellin, Jon/0000-0002-2686-8065; Krishna, Vijesh/0000-0003-2191-4736",,,,,43,12,13,0,6,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

However, research still shows a lot of uncertainty about what sustainability certifications imply for the livelihood of smallholder farmers. Given these uncertainties, this paper explores the potential of certifications to improve the livelihood of smallholder farmers. To achieve this objective we developed an amended livelihood framework applied to an exploratory study of Indonesian smallholders who participate in the Roundtable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Although access to markets and vulnerability are not improved through certification, indirect effects through organizational changes increase productivity. If certification schemes are weakly institutionalized, farmers will easily shift to a more profitable way of production. Further analysis is needed to discover the balance between the ethical aspects of certification while improving economic profitability for participating smallholders.","[Hidayat, Nia Kurniawati; Glasbergen, Pieter; Offermans, Astrid] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hidayat, Nia Kurniawati; Glasbergen, Pieter; Offermans, Astrid] Int Ctr Integrated Assessment & Sustainable Dev I, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Hidayat, Nia Kurniawati] Bogor Agr Univ, Bogor 16880, Indonesia; [Hidayat, Nia Kurniawati] Fac Econ & Management, Dept Resource & Environm Econ, Bogor 16880, Indonesia",Maastricht University; Maastricht University; Bogor Agricultural University,"Hidayat, NK (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Kapoenstr 2 POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",nia.hidayat@maastrichtuniversity.nl; pieter.glasbergen@maastrichtuniversity.nl; a.offermans@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Offermans, Astrid/0000-0001-5253-6593",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Republic Indonesia,Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW); Directorate General of Higher Education (DIKTI) of the Ministry of Education and Culture of Republic Indonesia,"This research was conducted as part of the joint research project on Social and Economic Effects of Partnering for Sustainable Change in Agricultural Commodity Chains in Indonesia.

Moreover, the interconnection between the regulated MFIs and unregulated OFIs has increased.

In this article we focus on developing a modeling approach towards reputational risk quantification for banking institutions using Value at Risk model. The model is based on the assumption that primary impact of a reputational event, bank run, is materialized in primary deposit outflow and related refinancing costs. Results of this study are aimed to discuss the minimal capital requirement, which should be held by financial institution in order to cover potential losses caused by reputational events. Modeling approach in the contribution aims to propose an approach to be used for internal risk management purposes. Results can be further assessed taking into account effects that are caused by a bank run in the context of institution portfolio erosion, worse liquidity profile, higher contracting and legal costs or opportunity costs.

A smaller amount of information available on small and medium-sized enterprises compared to information on large entities results in an increase in the cost of external capital. This phenomenon is called information asymmetry. It occurs when the various parties to the transaction (e.g., debtor and creditor) have different information on the subject relevant to the transaction (e.g. on the risk associated with the company). Agency conflict can also be more noticeable in companies where the owners are liable with all their assets for the actions of partners. At the end, such conflict is present between owner of the company and supplier of capital. If a small or medium-sized enterprise is financed by capital from friends, the cost of agency conflicts are lower and thus the cost of financing is lower. In paper such moderating influence is analyzed in wood industry firms with full operating cycle and cash levels. Analysis is illustrated by empirical data collected from firms operating in Slovakia, Poland and in surrounding countries. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We consider a discrete time insurance model in which any surplus available at the beginning of a year is reinvested with an interest rate that is modeled by a fuzzy number. In addition, a discount is given to policy holders in any year in which no claims are recorded. In this setup, we also analyze the ruin probability of the insurance company.

As competition increased marketers started to focus on new approaches and product innovations to attract consumers' perception and attention. One of the most effective ways of differentiating is using aesthetics. Visual aesthetics of products creates value for consumers. Visual aesthetics create significant value for product and makes it more special. Also, level of price sensitivity of consumer decreases when the product is more unique and prestigious. This study aims to investigate the relationship between visual aesthetics of products and consumers' price sensitivity. The data of the study is collected via a survey form from 510 respondents from Eskisehir, Turkey. The results revealed that visual aesthetics of products and also its sub-dimensions including value, acumen, and response are negatively associated with consumers' price sensitivity. Explanatory power of response dimension was higher than its counterparts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this chapter, we analyze the topological properties of the network of the Euro Area banking sector with the primary aim of assessing the importance of a bank in the financial system with respect to ownership and control of other credit institutions. The network displays power law distributions in both binary and weighted degree metrics indicating a robust yet fragile structure and a direct nexus between an increase of control diversification and a rise in the market power. Therefore, while in good time the network is seemingly robust, in bad times many banks can go into distress simultaneously. This behavior opens a narrow for Central bank's actions. In particular, we investigate whether the Single Supervisory Mechanism introduced by the European Central Banks and based on banks' total asset is a good proxy to quantify their systemic importance. Results indicate that not all the financial institutions with high value of total asset are systemically important but only few of them.","[Pecora, Nicolo] Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy; [Spelta, Alessandro] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, I-20100 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Pecora, N (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ, Dept Econ & Social Sci, Via Emilia Parmense 84, I-29100 Piacenza, Italy.",nicolo.pecora@unicatt.it; alessandro.spelta@unicatt.it,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,497,516,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024026,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900015,0

Our main focus is on correlations in the time interval from January 2010 until December 2014 which allows a meaningful and representative analysis. Our results indicate weak comovements between money growth and HICP inflation. Viewed from this perspective, money growth exhibited limited, if any, information for future inflationary developments in the euro area, which is in contrast to most of the previous literature using more conventional techniques. The evidence presented in this paper does not support the ECB's view on the importance of money growth for inflation and casts serious doubts concerning the rationale of monetary aggregates in the monetary strategy of the ECB.","[Slahor, L'udomir; Bartekova, Maria] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia; [Stanko, Peter] Vgeobecna Uverova Banka As, Bratislava 82990, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Slahor, L (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",ludomir.slahor@fm.uniba.sk; pstanko@vub.sk; maria.bartekova@st.fm.uniba.sk,"Kmety Bartekova, Maria/AAW-5743-2021",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-7962-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,626,632,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE3FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000370679200082,0

Strengthening the financial regulation and the issue of financial stability have become a key public policy issue for economies with a significant role in reaching agreements between countries toward this direction. It is the G-20 economies and the IMF that are committed to maintaining financial stability and the transparency of the financial sector, which is likely to remain the source of economic crises. Nevertheless the trade-off between safety and economic growth has to be taken into account. This paper examines what has been achieved in the field of implementing regulatory reform steps and whether they provide protection to consumers and taxpayers as well as the preparedness of financial institutions when it comes to facing potential shocks.

The analysis uses data taken from OECD Fiscal Decentralisation Database and OECD. Since fiscal decentralization has many dimensions, the following indicators are used in the empirical analysis: expenditure decentralization, revenue decentralization and tax revenue decentralization. The empirical tests relating decentralization and economic performance are based on cross correlation and linear regression. Across the analyzed countries, decentralization appears to be positively associated with GDP per capita levels but negatively associated with GDP growth. The relationship is stronger for revenue decentralization than for expenditure decentralization.","[Szarowska, Irena] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Szarowská, I (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",szarowska@opf.slu.cz,"Szarowská, Irena/J-6391-2012","Szarowská, Irena/0000-0002-5197-6455",,,,,20,4,4,0,13,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,766,775,,,,,,10,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300081,0

They are considered among the root causes of the economical crisis we are experiencing nowadays. Any efforts proved futile to control and effectively address these thorny problems. On the other hand, nowadays, with the rapid growth of Information and Communications Technology (ICT), there is an increasing integration in both the public and private sectors. The use of the Internet and the integration of IT systems is a revolution for the enterprises and organizations. Also, with the development of e-government, the public agencies serve citizens and businesses from a distance and thus they offer better service and satisfaction to citizens and businesses, and easier and more effective management of the work of public services. Given the change in both the organization and the functioning of businesses and public sector organizations on one side and the state control mechanisms on the other, it is now easier and more efficient to address the problems of the shadow economy, tax evasion and tax avoidance. The purpose of this paper is that the ELENXIS may prove an effective tool to address the aforementioned problems through the accounting information systems and e-government. Initially, the usefulness and the objectives of the accounting information systems and the e-government are presented. Then, the genesis and evolution of TAXISNET, as a platform for citizens, enterprises and public sector organizations, is described. Subsequently, an analysis of the pathogens of the economy with the major problems of the hidden economy, tax evasion and avoidance, and how the specialized for auditing, information system ELENXIS, aims at fighting these weaknesses. Finally, a research is presented. It consists of the analysis of 80 questionnaires, listing the views of tax consultants in the areas of Evros and Kavala about combating tax avoidance and evasion.

The main hypothesis revolves around decision making under rationality. Any(financial) decision is taken as if a person(investor) is maximizing a certain expected utility (welfare).This has been contradicted repeatedly through experiments within the behavioral finance field, whose development took place specifically in order to integrate irrationality in economic decision making. Moreover, there have also been theoretical studies that have shown that investors do not act as if they are rational, but on the contrary, exhibit many biases that lead to poor investment decisions in specific contexts. This paper wishes to analyze the investment decisions and behavior of investors from Bucharest's Stock Exchange, Romania. Using financial transaction data, we wish to study some of the most prominent behavioral biases investors have shown to be prone to. Thus, we wish to see if traders exhibit overconfidence in their trading positions, whether they have a representativeness bias and a disposition effect. The paper is structured as follows: the first section introduces the literature that has been done on similar studies. In section 2, the data is analyzed both from a normative and behavioral point of view. In section 3, we undergo our empirical analysis and test the main hypotheses. Section 4 concludes.

These risks are very rarely completely independent from each other, particularly when measured in terms of their impact on the income variability. Concern on increasing farm income volatility in the EU has induced wide range of research in this area. Only a few studies paid attention to the issue of risk in agriculture in Slovakia, therefore we decided to focus our research on this area. The main objective of the paper is to estimate the development of market risk and return of Slovak farms in the period of years 2000-2013. The data set of the analysis consists of information from financial statements obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural development of SR. The paper uses the alternative Markowitz portfolio theory approach, by replacing the stock return with return on equity (ROE), to estimate the riskiness of unquoted agricultural farms. For calculation are used 5-years moving averages, in order to avoid trend of data. The portfolios are created for two legal forms in Slovak agriculture: cooperatives and companies (JSC., Ltd.), as well as for two types of production orientations: crop farms and animal farms. The results show that the companies (Ltd, JSC) are more effective legal form with higher level of return and lower risk. Therefore, it is expected that the amount of low profitable cooperatives will continue to decrease in the future in the favour of companies.

The research is conducted among the integrated reports issued by companies belonging to various industries, coming from France, Germany and United Kingdom.

Globalization has multiple forms, social, political, economic and cultural ones. It cannot be calculated efficiently as a condition and process as it is not a concept which is complete in its content as well as the way it works as a whole. Its key feature is connectivity, followed by expansion, growth, acceleration and intensity of interconnectivity beyond political and geographical boundaries. Proceedings in a region are becoming increasingly important for individuals and societies regardless of their geographical distance. The current form of globalization exhibits dense and multiple weaves of connectivity characterized by an unprecedented institutionalization. A significant role in the process of organizing the global system is being played by international institutions such as the IMF and the WB. Their decisions shape and promote the core principles of globalization, attaching to it legitimacy and ideological orientation. The new models which emerge through the institutions are boosted and disseminated through the dominant position they are holding in the organization system of globalization. Despite the extent and intensity of institutionalization, there is no supreme authority which can take political decisions directly applicable globally. That is, there is no global political governance of the international system. It seems, however, that a global economic governance system is looming in the horizon, which may not be strictly demarcated and consolidated but it is gradually becoming gigantic. This paper will attempt to investigate the limits and the basic features of the emerging global economic governance and the role played by the Bretton Woods institutions in it. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Taxes are categorized in several ways, most often in terms of related taxes for the taxpayer, on direct and indirect taxes. Tax systems are made up of elements which include: tax quota, tax mix, tax structure and others. One of the most important macroeconomic indicators of the tax, is tax quota. This indicator represents the share of taxes in GDP and it is used in international comparation. An important and often discussed topic is tax harmonization in the European Union, which aims to bring together member states and creating a strong, economically, politically and culturally unified group of countries.

Our descriptive and exploratory econometric analyses exploit a database of the population of Tunisian firms; the results support the idea that small firms in a developing country, such as Tunisia, play a key role in the creation of new jobs. We also explore the role in these dynamics of a specific tax regulation, the re 'gime forfaitaire, which has been designed to benefit only small firms. We find that small firms benefiting from this taxation scheme account for most of the job creation effects for this firm size group. This effect is persistent across sectors. However, despite their dynamism, small firms show very weak economic performance. Thus, this preliminary analysis suggests that small firms in Tunisia have a strong social impact in the form of new job creation, but a weak economic impact in terms of wealth creation. A possible interpretation of these findings and one which requires further investigation, is that small firms' entry rates are driven mostly by necessity entrepreneurs, while the skilled workforce, which currently is largely unemployed, does not contribute to this process through the creation of innovative start-ups.","[Arouri, Hassan] Natl Inst Stat, Tunis, Tunisia; [Ben Youssef, Adel] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, Nice, France; [Quatraro, Francesco] Univ Turin, Turin, Italy; [Quatraro, Francesco] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Turin, Italy.;Quatraro, F (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.",francesco.quatraro@unito.it; Hassen.arouri@gmail.com; adel.ben-youssef@unice.fr,"Quatraro, Francesco/S-3012-2017","Quatraro, Francesco/0000-0001-5746-2239; BEN YOUSSEF, Adel/0000-0003-1905-2663",,,,,26,6,6,1,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1309-4297,2147-4281,,EURASIAN BUS REV,Eurasian Bus.

The model consists of a bank with a leverage target and an unleveraged fundamentalist investor subject to exogenous noise with clustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable region, where the system has a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a locally unstable region, characterized by cycles with chaotic behavior; and (iii) a globally unstable region. A calibration of parameters to data puts the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price bubble, resembling the period prior to the Global Financial Crisis, followed by a crash resembling the crisis, with a period of approximately 10-15 years. We dub this the Basel leverage cycle. To search for an optimal leverage control policy we propose a criterion based on the ability to minimize risk for a given average leverage. Our model allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of Basel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to countercyclical policies,in which leverage increases when volatility increases. We find the best policy depends on the market impact of the bank. Basel II is optimal when the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the opposite limit where the bank is large and leverage is high the optimal policy is closer to constant leverage. In the latter regime systemic risk can be dramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the banks. While our model does not show that the financial crisis and the period leading up to it were due to VaR risk management policies, it does suggest that it could have been caused by VaR risk management, and that the housing bubble may have just been the spark that triggered the crisis.

With symmetric shocks, the federal fiscal policy can improve welfare by playing a coordinating role. With asymmetric shocks, the federal policy allows both countries to reach a higher productive efficiency, provided the federal government is endowed with a federal budget.","[Baglioni, Angelo; Boitani, Andrea; Bordignon, Massimo] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Baglioni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Largo Gemelli 1, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",angelo.baglioni@unicatt.it; andrea.boitani@unicatt.it; mas-simo.bordignon@unicatt.it,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,8,MOHR SIEBECK,TUBINGEN,"PO BOX 2040, TUBINGEN, 72010, GERMANY",0015-2218,1614-0974,,FINANZARCHIV,FinanzArchiv,DEC,2016,72.0,4,,,,,371,406,,10.1628/001522116X14739287071698,0.0,,,36,"Business, Finance; Economics",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EH3DO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391650300002,0

These changes are concentrated in firms with high excess pay and shareholder dissent, long CEO tenure, and less independent boards. Further, the portion of top management pay captured by CEOs is lower in the post-SoP period, which is associated with higher firm valuations. Overall, these results suggest that SoP laws are associated with significant changes in CEO pay policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I show that Sakernas and the IFLS depict different levels of and changes in labour-market indicators. My estimates of the labour-force participation model, the sector-choice model, and the Mincer model are all statistically different between the two surveys, although the magnitudes are similar for labour-force participation and sector choice. The IFLS shows a much higher return to education than Sakernas, according to the Mincer model. In addition, I find that the cross-sectional sample of the IFLS and the panel sample of the IFLS corrected for attrition yield similar coefficient estimates from all equations. The findings in this article provide an important reference for researchers interested in using Sakernas and the IFLSeither individually or combinedto analyse labour-market issues in Indonesia. Tulisan ini menelaah konsistensi antara Survei Tenaga Kerja Nasional (Sakernas) dan Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) sebagai dasar berbagai analisis terhadap pasar tenaga kerja Indonesia. Penulis menunjukkan bahwa Sakernas dan IFLS menggambarkan perubahan dan perbedaan tingkat dalam indikator pasar tenaga kerja. Estimasi atas model partisipasi angkatan kerja, model pilihan sektor, dan model Mincer menghasilkan perbedaan statistik yang signifikan di antara kedua survei, meski besarannya serupa untuk dua model, yakni model partisipasi angkatan kerja dan model pilihan sektor. IFLS menunjukkan tingkat pengembalian yang lebih tinggi bagi pendidikan dibandingkan Sakernas, menurut model Mincer. Selain itu, penulis juga menemukan sampel lintas-bagian (cross section) dari IFLS dan sampel panel dari IFLS yang dikoreksi menghasilkan koefisien estimasi yang serupa untuk semua persamaan.

The reform was one of the government's flagship reforms to boost employment, but its actual effects have been widely debated. We exploit the fact that the size of the tax credit is a function of the municipality of residence and income if working, which yields two sources of quasi-experimental variation. The identifying variation, however, turns out to be small and potentially endogenous, which means that the question of whether the reform has delivered the hoped-for effects cannot be credibly answered.","[Edmark, Karin] Stockholm Univ, CESIfo, IFAU, IFN, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Edmark, Karin] UCLS, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden; [Liang, Che-Yuan] Uppsala Univ UCFS, POB 514, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Liang, Che-Yuan] IBF, POB 514, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Mork, Eva] Uppsala Univ, UCFS, UCLS, CESifo,IZA, POB 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Mork, Eva] IEB, POB 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Selin, Hakan] UCLS, UCFS, Inst Evaluat Labour Market & EducPolicy, POB 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Selin, Hakan] CESifo, POB 513, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Stockholm University; Uppsala University,"Edmark, K (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, CESIfo, IFAU, IFN, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.;Edmark, K (通讯作者)，UCLS, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",karin.edmark@sofi.su.se; Che-Yuan.Liang@nek.uu.se; eva.mork@nek.uu.se; hakan.selin@ifau.uu.se,"Mörk, Eva/ITV-6744-2023; Liang, Che-Yuan/IUN-0503-2023","Mörk, Eva/0000-0002-3944-603X; Liang, Che-Yuan/0000-0002-6016-0546",UCFS; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,UCFS; Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,"We thank Mike Brewer, Anders Forslund, Olof Aslund, and conference participants at the 1st National Conference of Swedish Economists in Lund, the IIPF conference in Uppsala, and the Post-doc Workshop in Labor and Public Economics in Oregrund, as well as seminar participants at the IFAU, SOFI, University of Gothenburg, the Linnnaeus University, and the UCFS scientific advisory board.

Economic literature has tended to explain inertia in monetary pollcymaking in terms of frictions and delays, or has stressed the role of governance rules. We introduce.a new driver of inertia, independent from frictions and central bank governance settings. While the degree of conservatism doesn't necessarily produce monetary inertia, we show that introducing loss aversion in individual behavior influences the stance of monetary policy under three different but convergent perspectives. First of all, a Moderation Effect can emerge, i.e. the number of pigeons increases. At the same time also a Hysteresis Effect can become relevant, whereby both doves and hawks soften their attitudes. Finally a SmoothingEffect tends to stabilize the number of pigeons. Together, the three effects consistently cause higher monetary policy inertia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

No consensus answer, however, has yet emerged, with approximately 40% of empirical papers finding a negative effect, 40% finding no effect, and 20% finding a positive effect. Does the literature taken together imply the existence of the so-called natural resource curse? In a quantitative survey of 605 estimates reported in 43 studies, we find that overall support for the resource curse hypothesis is weak when potential publication bias and method heterogeneity are taken into account. Our results also suggest that four aspects of study design are especially effective in explaining the differences in results across studies: (1) controlling for institutional quality, (2) controlling for the level of investment activity, (3) distinguishing between different types of natural resources, and (4) differentiating between resource dependence and abundance.

We then attempt to draw lessons for China's renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Our data on the shares of the three major currencies in export invoicing show that the dollar was unequivocally a global invoicing currency, and that the DM was the most important regional currency in Europe while the yen was never a global or a regional currency. DM invoicing was driven by European countries' trade ties with Germany. In contrast, the yen was not widely used for trade invoicing by Asia-Oceania countries despite the latter's strong trade ties with Japan. Our regression analysis on the determinants of the major currency share in trade invoicing (also including UK pound sterling, the French franc, the Italian lira, and the Swiss franc) in the 1970-1998 period shows that the invoicing share of a major currency tended to be positively affected by the degree of other economies' trade ties with the major currency country and negatively affected by the degree of their financial development or openness. Also, the major currency share in trade invoicing was affected by both other economies' assigned weights of the major currency in their implicit currency baskets and these economies' trade shares with major-currency zone countries. Economies belonging to the U.S. dollar (or DM) zone tended to invoice their trade more in the dollar (or DM) and less in the DM (or dollar). The use of yen for trade invoicing was not much affected by these factors. European countries largely belonged to the DM zone and tended to use the DM for trade invoicing, whereas Asia-Oceania countries belonged mainly to the U.S. dollar zone, leading to a high degree of dollar use. We also find that major currency countries tended to invoice their trade in their own currencies when they had a large presence in international trade, high levels of per capita income, and financial markets that were developed and open. For China, its low level of per capita income, limited financial openness, and the presence of U.S. dollar zone countries in Asia stand as a challenge to the nation's ambition to promote the RMB as a major trade-invoicing currency.

Recently developed panel unit root/stationarity tests cannot reject the stationarity hypothesis. This implies that some countries have been in the process of converging absolutely or relatively. By using a clustering algorithm we statistically detect three absolute convergence clubs in the pre-euro period, which comprise early accession countries. In particular, Luxembourg clusters with Austria and Belgium, while a second sub-group includes Germany and France and the third The Netherlands and Finland. We also detect two separate clusters of early accession countries in the post-1997 period: a sub-group with Germany, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg, and one with France and Finland.

Discretionary grants per capita increased by about 1.4 percent when the vote share of the incumbent party in the state election increased by one percentage point.

Adaptation costs also influence a country's decision to abate and join international environmental agreements (IEAs). In this paper, the authors study how these cost differences affect participation incentives. Their model identifies two channels through which adaptation affects free-riding incentives: carbon leakage and cost asymmetry in adaptation. In contrast with the common view, the authors find that the presence of adaptation is not necessarily an impediment to cooperation on abatement. They also present conditions under which adaptation can strengthen or weaken free-riding incentives. The results serve as a cautionary tale to policy makers and suggest that policies directed at reducing carbon leakage and/or cost differences between developed and developing countries may also affect the success and failure of IEAs.","[Lazkano, Itziar] Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, POB 413,Bolton Hall,Room 840, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Lazkano, Itziar] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 40, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Marrouch, Walid] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Lebanon, NH USA; [Marrouch, Walid] CIRANO, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Nkuiya, Bruno] Univ Alberta, Campus St Jean, Edmonton, AB T6G 2M7, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Lebanese American University; Universite de Montreal; University of Alberta,"Lazkano, I (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin Milwaukee, Dept Econ, POB 413,Bolton Hall,Room 840, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.;Lazkano, I (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Econ, Helleveien 40, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",lazkano@uwm.edu; walid.marrouch@lau.edu.lb; nkuiyamb@ualberta.ca,"Marrouch, Walid/D-5597-2019; Nkuiya, Bruno/AAB-2497-2020; Nkuiya, Bruno/AAE-5896-2022","Marrouch, Walid/0000-0001-8488-6555; Lazkano, Itziar/0000-0002-9432-0616; Nkuiya, Bruno/0000-0001-6268-3001",,,,,33,21,22,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

The economic irreversibility effect is often larger than the effect of irreversible damage. We revisit this result with multiple uncertainties and a tipping point that triggers irreversible damage. An optimal stopping model over dynamic environmental lotteries is developed to characterize the optimal timing and stringency of an environmental policy subject to two kinds of irreversibility (economic and an environmental tipping point), two tipping point mechanisms (critical damage thresholds and random events), and two kinds of uncertainty (uncertain system dynamics and uncertainty in when the tipping point will be crossed).

Specifically, I consider how political institutions in rural sending communities create economic opportunities and constraints for their members, channeling potential migrants into farm or urban jobs. To date, scholars have explained differences in the migration paths of similar communities by looking at features on the receiving end, or at the development of social networks tied to migration. I add to this work by showing how hometown conditions influence out-migration. I compare the histories of two rural villages in Southern Mexico whose members migrated at similar times and volumes, first within Mexico beginning in the 1960s, and then to the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. I find that in the village I call Disposeo, hierarchical power structures dispossessed members, drove them into debt, and limited their access to urban areas. As a result, when agricultural recruiters came to the village, most potential migrants accepted. By contrast, in Igualdad, communal landholding enabled members to reject farm labor. At the same time, rotating political posts helped them build networks into more desirable urban service jobs. As other research underscores, such labor market insertion has long-term consequences: migrants' first job niches shaped their destinations, social networks, patterns of movement, and social mobility. Thus, even as rural villages erode in the face of emigration, they structure migrants' prospects in the contemporary economy. In particular, participatory governance and resource redistribution can insulate members from the worst agricultural jobs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A general model is developed where, consistent with recent literature, growth is non-scale (not increasing in population size) and endogenous (generated by factors within R&D and education). Recent models feature the counterfactual assumption of constant returns to existing knowledge and restrict the substitutability of inputs within R&D and education. We find that non-scale endogenous growth is possible under less stringent conditions. The findings reconcile sustained economic growth with evidence of diminishing marginal returns in education and R&D, which suggests an ambiguous role for R&D policy.","[Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",,,,,,,,36,4,4,1,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

We show that information on location and start data of large farms, combined with existing smallholder farm surveys, allows to complement this with a difference-in-difference approach to systematically assess spillovers from large farm establishment. Illustrative application to Mozambique suggests positive short-term effects from newly established large farms on adoption of agricultural practices and input use by small farms less than 50 km from newly established large operations. Robustness checks for crop farms only also suggest job creation in the proximity of newly established crop, but not livestock farms. Yet, large farm establishment decreased perceived well-being within a 25-km band and, in the time horizon considered here, did not lead to better access to output markets, cultivation of larger areas or, once other factors are controlled for, higher yields. This allows us to reject the notion of negative spillovers from large farm establishment but casts doubt on the wisdom of large unconditional subsidies to attract investors. In addition to drawing policy conclusions for Mozambique, we highlight the methodology's wider applicability and scope for expansion. (C) 2016 The World Bank. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We show that in excess, to an increase in the expected present value of marginal damages and an increase in the probability of triggering the event, there also exists a third opposing effect. This effect comes from the fall in value of remaining fossil-fuel reserve, which results from the potential regime shift which may (or may not) occur sometime in the future, and implies that optimal fossil-fuel policy shifts towards using more resources early on. This effect is related to the idea of the green paradox. We prove the existence of this effect and show under which circumstances it can become quantitatively important. Numerically, the green-paradox effect seems to be somewhat smaller than, but comparable in size to, the increase in expected marginal damages. In general, our findings highlight the importance of considering the supply-side impacts on climate policy in response to catastrophic climate events.","[Engstrom, Gustav] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden; [Gars, Johan] Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Global Econ Dynam & Biosphere, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden",Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Beijer Institute of Ecological Economics; Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; Global Economic Dynamics & Biosphere - The Erling-Persson Family Academy Program,"Engström, G (通讯作者)，Royal Swedish Acad Sci, Beijer Inst Ecol Econ, Box 50005, S-10405 Stockholm, Sweden.",johan.gars@kva.se; johan.gars@beijer.kva.se,"Engström, Gustav/F-2240-2016","Gars, Johan/0000-0002-2303-1964",Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Erling-Persson Family Foundation; Ocean of Tomorrow call of the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme,Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; Erling-Persson Family Foundation; Ocean of Tomorrow call of the European Commission Seventh Framework Programme,"We thank John Hassler, Per Krusell, Rick van der Ploeg, Aart de Zeeuw and Torsten Persson for valuable comments on earlier drafts as well as seminar participants at the Complex Systems workshop, Stockholm, The Ulvon Conference on environmental economics, the Department of economics at Gothenburg University and the WCERE conference in Istanbul.

The focus is on the sub-Saharan sovereign bond yields as proxies for the region's ability to raise new funds on international markets. Despite the subcontinent's tour-de-force entrance to the international bond market, this paper reveals that recent (since early 2000s) borrowing in foreign currency is not without macroeconomic risk. Empirically this paper finds that sovereign bond yields are significantly influenced by global volatility, commodity prices and global liquidityall factors that are out of the control of the sub-Saharan economies in question. These findings suggest that portfolio repositioning by institutional investors prompted by improved growth prospects and implicit monetary policy tightening in the advanced economies or heightened risk perceptions, are likely to result in increased borrowing costs for the sub-Saharan bond issuers and affect their ability to raise funds in international markets. Furthermore, a change in borrowing costs might lead to higher debt-service costs and policy uncertainty, which in turn could lead to suboptimal investment levels and, ultimately, hinder economic development.","[Gevorkyan, Aleksandr V.] St Johns Univ, 8000 Utopia Pkwy, Queens, NY 11439 USA; [Kvangraven, Ingrid Harvold] New Sch Social Res, New York, NY 10011 USA",Saint John's University; The New School,"Gevorkyan, AV (通讯作者)，St Johns Univ, 8000 Utopia Pkwy, Queens, NY 11439 USA.",gevorkya@stjohns.edu,"Kvangraven, Ingrid/R-4242-2019; Gevorkyan, Aleksandr/C-3855-2016","Gevorkyan, Aleksandr/0000-0001-5824-927X; Kvangraven, Ingrid Harvold/0000-0001-8606-1717",,,,,33,22,23,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Empirical Evidence,REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CAPITAL STRUCTURE; DEBT; INVESTMENT; INCENTIVES; CHOICE; MODEL,"I empirically test whether firms engage in risk-shifting. Contrary to what risk-shifting theory predicts, I find that firms reduce investment risk when they approach financial distress. To identify the effect of distress on risk-taking, I use a natural experiment with exogenous changes to leverage. Risk reduction is most prevalent among firms that have shorter maturity debt, bank debt, and tighter bank loan financial covenants. These findings suggest that debt composition and financial covenants serve as important mechanisms to mitigate debt-equity agency conflicts, such as risk-shifting, that are not explicitly contracted on.","[Gilje, Erik P.] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Gilje, EP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, 3620 Locust Walk SHDH 2456, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",gilje@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Rodney L.

Local policies are determined by expectations of policy makers about future climate. There are three types of expectations: strong skeptic, weak skeptic and 'science-based'. Strong skeptics deny human-induced climate change and a possibility of a climate catastrophe. Weak skeptics believe that industrial emissions cause global warming, but deny catastrophic climate change. Science-based policy makers, considering the warning of the scientific community, account for both: human influence on climate and possible catastrophic shifts. Aggregate behavior of policy makers determines the total emission level which influences global climate dynamics. The paper argues that even if there are only skeptical policy makers the climate catastrophe can still be avoided.","[Kiseleva, Tatiana] Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Kiseleva, T (通讯作者)，Free Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",kiseleva.t@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We use data for a panel of five euro-area stressed countries. Our findings indicate that a recursive relationship between sovereigns and banks operated during the euro-area crisis. Specifically, for the five crisis countries considered shocks to sovereign spreads fed-through to sovereign ratings, which affected commercial banks' equity-prices. Our results also point to the importance of using levels of equity prices-rather than rates of return- in measuring banks' performance. The use of levels allows us to derive the determinants of long-run equity prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Honey production has great economic importance, given that it represents the main source of income for Mayan rural families. Furthermore, Mexico is the world's fourth-largest exporter of honey. The honey comes from jungle that covers the peninsular territory and forms part of a production system that broadly utilizes forestry resources. Two new situations emerged in 2011 that detonated social mobilization to defend beekeeping: the Mexican government authorized the planting of transgenic soybeans, while the European Union announced that honey that originated from transgenic pollen would have to be labelled (contains transgenics'), whereas honey importers demand transgenic-free honey. The introduction of transgenic soybeans in the Yucatan Peninsula is part of the modern, industrial agricultural impetus in the region, which is entering into conflict with the Mayan peasant agriculture and threatens the survival of the most important Mexican tropical forest. A movement alliance was built among different social actors, including Mayan communities, beekeeper and civil-society organizations, universities and honey-exporting entrepreneurs, who developed an opposition and a resistance strategy to the cultivation of transgenic soybeans. Their repertoire has included collective legal, educational and organizational action, scientific research, mobilization, information, a media presence and lobbying. This mobilization has yielded results, as in 2015 the judiciary power invalidated the authorization of the cultivation of transgenic soybeans.","[Gomez Gonzalez, Irma] Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, Rural Dev, Calzada Hueso 1100, Delegacion Coyoacan 04960, DF, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"González, IG (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Metropolitana Xochimilco, Rural Dev, Calzada Hueso 1100, Delegacion Coyoacan 04960, DF, Mexico.",irmag-g@hotmail.com,,,,,,,19,17,18,3,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

In the case of stock markets, volatility seems to rise when the stock price decreases and fall when the stock price increases. This so-called leverage effect was first described by Black (Proceedings of the 1976 meeting of the business and economic statistics section, pp 177-181, 1976). The concept is not new and has already been comprehensively studied and implemented in many volatility models (GARCH and SV) in the form of an additional parameter in the volatility equation. However, there is no study or a theoretical explanation of the leverage effect in sovereign credit default swap spreads (hereinafter: sCDS). In this article, we discuss the possible behaviour of sCDS volatility and explain it by way of reference to the Prospect Theory by Kahneman and Tversky (Econometrica 47(2):263-292, 1979). We estimate a series of stochastic volatility models with the leverage effect, proposed by Yu (J Econom 127(2):165-178, 2005). In this model, the leverage effect is, in fact, the same as a coefficient of the correlation between the current return of an asset and its expected future volatility. We show that the effect does exist and differs across markets. As far as the safe European markets are concerned, the parameter is negative; in the case of extremely risky economies-it is positive. In markets of medium risk the effect varies depending on the relationship between the perceived risk and the value of the sCDS premium.","[Kliber, Agata] Poznan Univ Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Economics & Business,"Kliber, A (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Econ, Al Niepodleglosci 10, PL-61875 Poznan, Poland.",agata.kliber@ue.poznan.pl,"Kliber, Agata/P-6227-2019","Kliber, Agata/0000-0003-1996-5550",,,,,48,2,2,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

We posit that reputable inside directors (RIDs) can improve the quality of borrowers' financial reporting and reduce agency risk in loan contracting. Based on a regression analysis of 5104 loan facilities during 1999-2007, we find that borrowers with RIDs enjoy lower loan interest rates and fewer restrictive covenants, and are less likely to have loans secured by collateral, than borrowers without RIDs. Our empirical results also show that RIDs help to obtain favorable loan terms mainly through alleviating ex-ante information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders. Further categorizing RIDs into CFO directors and other inside directors, we find that the effects of RIDs on loan spread and collateral requirements are significant for both CFO directors and other inside directors, while other inside directors have a more significant impact on financial covenants than CFO directors.

One of the most important Articles of the Directive is Article 7, which required Member States to implement Energy Efficiency Obligations and/or alternative policy instruments in order to reach a reduction in final energy use of 1.5% per year. This paper assesses how Article 7 has been applied by Member States and what the implications are. Analysing the plans of all 28 Member States we evaluate how Article 7 is implemented across the EU. This includes an analysis of the types of policies used, the distribution of the anticipated savings across the different policy instruments, and whether or not the way Article 7 is applied in reality meets the requirements set by the Directive. Our analysis shows that Member States take very different approaches with some using up to 112 policy measures and others just one. We also identify areas of concern particularly related to the delivery of the energy savings with respect to the Article 7 requirements, the calculation methods, and the monitoring and verification regimes adopted by Member States. We model to what extent the projected savings are likely to materialise and whether or not they will be sufficient to meet the target put forward by Article 7. In our paper we also make suggestions for modifying the Energy Efficiency Directive in order to address some of the problems we encountered.","[Rosenow, Jan] Univ Sussex, SPRU, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Leguijt, Cor] CE Delft, Delft, Netherlands; [Pato, Zsusanna] REKK, Budapest, Hungary; [Eyre, Nick; Fawcett, Tina] Univ Oxford, Environm Change Inst, Oxford OX1 2JD, England",University of Sussex; University of Oxford,"Rosenow, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, SPRU, Ctr Innovat & Energy Demand, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",j.rosenow@sussex.ac.uk,"Rosenow, Jan/GOJ-9750-2022","Pato, Zsuzsanna/0000-0002-8519-6027","European Commission [ENER.C3.dir(2014)3156530, ENER/A2/360/2010]; ENSPOL project [IEE/13/824/SI2.675067]; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K011790/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: researchfish; EPSRC [EP/K011790/1, EP/L024756/1] Funding Source: UKRI",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); ENSPOL project; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),Parts of this paper are based on two studies evaluating the implementation of Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (Rosenow et al. 2015; Forster et al. 2016) funded by the European Commission (contract numbers ENER.C3.dir(2014)3156530 and ENER/A2/360/2010) and a research paper drafted for the European Parliament on Article 7 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EPRS/IMPT/SER/15/229N).

To assess this empirically, we employ a novel test of the unit root null against a mildly explosive alternative to investigate multiple bubbles in the crude oil spot and a range of futures prices along the yield curve employing monthly and weekly data from 1995 to 2013. The results indicate that the series overwhelmingly exhibit significant bubble periods ending in late 2008 even after allowing for an increase in unconditional volatility. Bubbles in the longer-dated contracts emerged as early as 2004 and are longer lasting than those in nearby and spot contracts. The bubble period was characterised by dramatic shifts in the yield curve associated with institutional spread positions that sharply increased futures prices at longer maturities. The results suggest that periods of time series disconnect between the spot and longer dated futures contracts could potentially form an input into early waming systems for macro-prudential policy.

Although the benefits are lower at a fairly imprecise level, there are still major advantages for the actual precision with which the case study is assessed. Moreover, we find that when age-structure is included in the HCR the relative ranking of different policies in terms of variance in biomass and yield does not differ.

We also investigate the role played by the quality of institutional environment in exacerbating or in alleviating such effect. A weak quality of institutional environment strengthens inter-linkages between the formal and the informal sectors, increases the costs and decreases the benefits assumed by formal firms, and reduces the costs attributed to informality. Moreover, it also results in a large informal economy, which influences perceptions about the substitutability between formal and informal goods, and law evasion. Our findings indicate that registered SMEs facing competition from informal firms are more likely to be credit-constrained than other formal SMEs that are not confronted with such competition. This result is consistent with the parasite view and the entrepreneurial perspective of informality, which assert that informal firms are capable of competing against registered SMEs and hurting the latter's profits. Further, we find that such adverse impact manifests only in countries with weak rule of law and high degree of corruption and bureaucracy. Our results also show that registered micro and small firms are more likely to be affected by the presence of informal firm competitors than medium-sized firms. This is because the benefits of formality that include access to credit from financial institutions, increase with firm size. On the whole, our findings suggest that governments must enhance their role in increasing access to credit to smaller firms and in providing incentives for informal firms to be integrated in the formal economy. Moreover, in order to achieve inclusive growth, our results highlight the importance of improving the business environment, which affects all entrepreneurs. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the past decade, therefore, policy makers and economists have increasingly focused on potential mechanisms for expanding risk management strategies available to those families. Commercially provided weather-based index insurance products, perhaps partially funded by subsidies, have been of particular interest because of their apparent potential to provide payments to smallholder families when they are most in need of help. However, the empirical evidence from a wide range of studies indicates that, absent relatively substantial subsidies, small holder farmers will not purchase commercially priced index products or even all risk products where payments are tied to the farm's crop losses. There are three important reasons why this is the case. First, smallholder farmers already have many ways of managing their risks, including informal community-based initiatives, on-farm production decisions and off-farm work. Second, index insurance schemes are subject to considerable basis risk; families often do not receive an index insurance indemnity when they experience a substantial crop loss on their farms. Third, the fixed costs of delivering crop insurance to smallholders make such coverage expensive. The potential market for weather index insurance therefore may be limited to insuring relatively large groups of farmers, either directly or indirectly though providing micro finance and other lending institution with coverage against widespread loan defaults associated with catastrophic events like major droughts. Alternatively, weather indexes could simply be used to more accurately target emergency aid.","[Smith, Vincent H.] Montana State Univ, Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA",Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Smith, VH (通讯作者)，Montana State Univ, Econ, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA.",vsmith@montana.edu,,,,,,,41,11,14,2,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0257-3032,1564-6971,,WORLD BANK RES OBSER,World Bank Res.

Our key question is whether there is evidence for moral hazard in the delegation of asset safe-keeping to sub-custodians. Sub custodian chains can be relatively long and frequently reach across several countries. The risk that securities are lost or the return to their owners delayed is not negligible. Our findings highlight that foreign or better informed banks are associated with shorter sub-custodian chains. Better capitalised banks seem to have longer, but safer sub-custodian chains. Our findings support the view that central securities depositories (CSDs) play a beneficial role in the management of sub-custodian structures. A CSD as the first sub custodian reduces the country risk in sub-custodian structures. When we analyse the choice of a CSD, we find that better capitalised, larger and foreign banks are less likely to rely on CSDs as their first sub custodian. (V) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a methodology novel to empirical finance, we quantify the increase in credit spreads caused by changes in risk pricing and changes in risk factors. The lasting increase in credit spreads is almost exclusively due to time-varying prices of risk. We interpret this as a change in risk perception which provides a possible solution to the credit spread puzzle. Default premia spiked during the crisis and did not return to their pre-crisis levels.

Although there is an extensive and growing body of literature on the economic impact of the adoption of GM crops in both developing and developed economies, there is only scant evidence that the technology has had any specific and distinguishable impact among female and male farmers. In economies where female farmers and female household members have a significant and often differentiated role in agriculture production, it is crucial to be able to answer this question. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative results from a study of the gender-specific adoption and performance effects of insect resistant (Bt) and herbicide-tolerant (HT) maize produced by smallholder farmers in the Kwa Zulu Natal province in South Africa. The findings indicate that women farmers value the labor-saving benefit of HT maize alongside the stacked varieties which offer both insect control and labor saving. Higher yields are the main reason behind male adoption, while female farmers tend to favor other aspects like taste, quality, and the ease of farming herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops. Women farmers (and also children) saved significant time because less weeding is required, an activity that has traditionally been the responsibility of female farmers. The newer stacked varieties were preferred by both male and female farmers and seemed to be in high demand by both groups. However, lack of GM seed availability in the region and poor market access were possible limitations to the adoption and spread of the technology. (C) 2016 The Authors.

With the assistance of the World Bank and at a cost of about (220 billion Naira) US$1.5 billion, when complete, the project will link Lagos with the Republic of Benin and other West African countries as part of the ECOWAS transit Corridor. While the proposed development is intended to potentially improve the business and international status of the city of Lagos, the expansion of the road has had implications for a variety of non-transport activities adjoining locations around the proposed highway. To fulfil the conditions for expanding the road, the government has had to acquire rights of way to adjoining areas of the existing expressway. Through this process, places of worship, residential buildings, motor parks, schools, markets, mechanic workshops, to mention a few activities, have been displaced in order to fulfil the project This study explores the impact of such displacement arising from road construction activities on the livelihood of market and street traders at two markets located along the expressway; the Agboju market and New Alayabiagba market. A qualitative study with traders in the two markets in 2010 and 2012 is used to explore the often ignored implications that large-scale transport development initiatives, albeit well intentioned, can have on the livelihoods of urban residents who may attach varying meanings to a road.

On average, a rise in the project complexity index from the 25th to the 75th percentile of its distribution increases the probability of procuring the project with a negotiated procedure by about 6%-8%. However, our results also suggest that the impact of complexity might be more relevant in the case of projects procured by municipalities located in provinces characterized by low levels of corruption.

A clear message is that interest rate / growth rate differentials were more important than primary budget surpluses for the different outcomes. The debt to GDP ratio fell very rapidly under financial repression following the Second World War but remained stubbornly high despite large budget surpluses with price deflation after the First World War.

Our approach recognizes that the first order conditions of MLE can be used as orthogonality conditions of the generalized method of moments (GMM). While parameter estimates from the different non-overlapping monthly samples that start on different days vary substantively, a formal test does not reject parameter equality and constrained estimation of the risk-return trade-off produces a statistically significant value of 3.35 in post-1955 data.

Asymmetric responses between those whose impacts are above or below the norm are found to be robust across decision settings.

For countries exporting the dirty good, trade liberalization increases its price, thus increasing domestic production and decreasing domestic consumption of dirty goods at the same time. This forces pollution from production and consumption to move in opposite directions, leading us to expect that trade-induced composition effects work differently for tailpipe and smokestack pollution. Our theoretical model predicts that capital abundance reinforces the pollution policy effect for tailpipe pollution, counter to the case with smokestack pollution. Empirical support for this comes from our analysis of an international panel of data on carbon monoxide emissions. We find evidence in support of an effect analogous to the pollution haven hypothesis, which has typically not been observed in previous literature. Thus trade liberalization may affect smokestack and tailpipe pollution differently.","[Hu, Bin] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [McKitrick, Ross] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, 50 Stonerd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Central University of Finance & Economics; University of Guelph,"Hu, B (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Finance & Publ Policy, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",hubin1981@hotmail.com; rmckitri@uoguelph.ca,,"Hu, Bin/0000-0001-8805-553X",,,,,24,11,11,2,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

BSSs studies are typically focused on user's socio-economic characteristics, bike sharing patterns and purpose of use in the city. This paper increases the knowledge of bike station classification due to users' mobility patterns based on data mining tools. For this purpose stations will be identified by a code based on joining three ratios: the load factor or number of available bikes ratio, the cumulative trips ratio, and the turnover station ratio. The latter is the new ratio proposed in this paper, which measures the effectiveness degree of each station. The higher the rate, the more effective the station is. Data mining tools to work with these three ratios are used in the proposed algorithm. Specifically, the perceptually important points (PIP) process to represent and index each rime series of each station, and a rule set to classify the stations, are used. The results could support planning and operations decisions for re-design and management of BSSs in relation to the spatial implications of the stations and the users' mobility patterns, due to the classification reveals imbalances in the distribution of bikes and lead to a better understanding of the system structure. The proposed method is applied to the Dublin Bikes Scheme with good performance results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that geographic location is important for productivity, as are technology (but not product) spillovers, and that both intra and inter-regional (counties) spillovers matter. The geographic location of a firm's researchers is more important than its headquarters.

The model generates heavy subsidies on carbohydrates and heavy taxes on red meats, which would be politically unacceptable.

The seller has private information on the quality of the good, and each participating buyer receives a private signal about his valuation of the good. The choice of auction format determines the allocation of trading surplus between the seller and buyers. This paper shows that when the seller's type is affiliated with the buyers' signals, the platform can charge higher participation fees on both sides by choosing a first-price or descending auction than a second-price or ascending auction.","[Tamura, Wataru] Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan",University of Tokyo,"Tamura, W (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Fac Econ, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo, Japan.",wtamura@e.u-tokyo.ac.jp,,,Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF) at the Graduate School of Economics of the University of Tokyo; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [16K17078] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Center for Advanced Research in Finance (CARF) at the Graduate School of Economics of the University of Tokyo; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am very grateful to the Editor and three anonymous referees for comments and suggestions that have substantially improved this paper.

It views autonomous jurisdictions in a federation as laboratories where new policies can be tested at low risk for the entire system. If successful, these policies will spread out by imitation; otherwise, they will be discarded. Studying this idea in a dynamic setting of fiscal competition, we show that, due to externalities between jurisdictions, policies that appear successful and are therefore mimicked do not necessarily enhance welfare, and vice versa. Specifically, in the classical framework of decentralized, rich-to-poor income redistribution with labor mobility the long-run outcome entails a complete breakdown of redistribution with zero subsidies to the poor everywhere.

We also consider the possibility that input-tariff liberalisation may have different effects depending on the technological content of imported intermediate goods.

This paper demonstrates that short-horizon negative autocorrelation can arise in a tractable model of agents with tournament-type preferences. Intuitively, investors act as if they are averse to missing out on a trend, causing the risk premium to move strongly counter to realized returns. The model features fully rationalizing agents, complete markets, and no exogenous transaction demand. Plausible parameterizations can match the autocorrelation in the data.

But how have workforce dynamics changed? This article offers an ethnographic perspective on agriculture on the transient Zimbabwean border. An 'actor-centred' approach examines the causes and extent of transformation. Who furthers managerial logics? Why? With what effects? White farmers emphasise impersonal, rationalised business for diverse reasons. What looks like part of a single global process of neoliberalisation is an accidental result. At the same time, foreign supermarket-funded development projects become subjected to logics of workforce paternalism. Managerialism itself has limited effect on labour arrangements. Workers' hierarchies and cross-border networks are built on different principles from global supply chains. From within each network, it is as if the other were invisible.","[Bolt, Maxim] Univ Birmingham, Dept African Studies & Anthropol, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Bolt, Maxim] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Inst Social & Econ Res, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Birmingham; University of Witwatersrand,"Bolt, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept African Studies & Anthropol, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.bolt@bham.ac.uk,,"Bolt, Maxim/0000-0003-0739-8018",Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-031-2005-00006],Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (PTA-031-2005-00006) during a PhD at the LSE.,,43,8,9,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

SSA has become a fertile frontier for such systems, as capital sets its sights on the continents' vast 'under-served' informal economies, harnessing the entrepreneurial mettle of youth to create new markets for a range of products, from solar lanterns and shampoo to cook stoves and sanitary pads. Drawing on ethnographic research with youth entrepreneurs, we trace the processes of individual and collective 'transformation' that the mission of (self-) empowerment through entrepreneurship seeks to bring about. We argue that, while such systems are meant to bring those below the poverty line above it, the 'line' is reified and reinforced through a range of discursive and strategic practices that actively construct and embed distinctions between the past and the future, valuable and valueless, and the idle and productive in Africa's informal economies.","[Dolan, Catherine] Univ London, SOAS, Anthropol, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England; [Rajak, Dinah] Univ Sussex, Anthropol & Dev, Sch Global Studies, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS); University of Sussex,"Dolan, C (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Anthropol, Thornhaugh St,Russell Sq, London WC1H 0XG, England.",cd17@soas.ac.uk,,"Dolan, catherine/0000-0003-3939-6607",,,,,63,71,83,2,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Our study investigates the effects of mutual funds, typically the most important and influential type of outside shareholder, on firms' dividend payouts in China during the period from 2003 to 2011. We find that mutual funds influence firms to pay higher cash dividends. The results are consistent with the predictions from exit theory. The effects are more pronounced in firms controlled by state and regional governments and in firms with relatively higher free cash flows. We also find evidence that the mutual funds' effects are stronger when their investment horizon is longer and the ownership interest is larger. Other institutional investors, such as banks, insurance companies, and securities companies have a lower exit threat and do not have an influence on firms' cash dividend payments or financial performances.

In particular, controlling for economic conditions and surprises associated with releases of economic data, we find that the market reacts strongly and negatively to the most unfavourable macroeconomic news, but appears to largely discount the good news. Further, the most-unfavorable news creates price drift, and we document that selling stocks short in the wake of unusually-bad news yields annual abnormal gross returns greater than four percent.

Cross-country tax data offer a striking example, with existing datasets frequently highly incomplete, analytically imprecise, plagued by errors, and sharply lacking in transparency. This paper introduces the new Government Revenue Dataset from the International Centre for Tax and Development, which provides a more reliable, transparent, and comprehensive basis for cross-national research. This new dataset has initially been used to re-examine major questions about the relationships between tax and aid, elections, economic growth, and democratization. The results deepen some previous conclusions and call others seriously into question notably the assertion that aid dependence consistently undermines domestic revenue efforts. Above all, the research demonstrates the value of the new dataset, the broader sensitivity of many results to changes in data quality and coverage, and the consequent importance of expanded attention to, and investments in, data quality.

Unlike the data used in previous work, ours have a higher frequency, minimal measurement error, and a long sample including a period of substantial macroeconomic instability. We find that the monthly frequency of nominal wage changes is 13 percent. Although nominal wage cuts are rare, their frequency rises following a large macroeconomic shock. Timing of wage changes is both time-dependent and state-dependent: we find evidence of synchronization of adjustment and contracts of fixed duration, but also that inflation and unemployment over the wage spell affect the timing of adjustment.

We document a strong 'MAX effect' in Australian equities over 1991-2013 that is robust to risk adjustment, controlling for other influential stock characteristics and, importantly, manifests in a partition of the 500 largest stocks. While there is no evidence that MAX proxies for sensitivity to risk, the findings are highly consistent with a mispricing explanation. Adapting the recent methodological innovation of Stambaugh et al. (2015) to classify stocks by their degree of mispricing, we show that the MAX effect concentrates amongst the most-overpriced stocks but actually reverses amongst the most-underpriced stocks. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the magnitude of the MAX effect amongst overpriced stocks exceeds that amongst underpriced stocks, leading to the overall negative relation that has been well documented.

Considering 247 Metropolitan Statistical Areas, we estimate a simultaneous boom-bust system for house prices, housing supply and subprime lending. The model accounts for regional differences in supply elasticities that are determined by local variations in topographical and regulatory supply restrictions. Our results suggest that tighter supply restrictions lead to both a larger house price boom and bust, and that this is due to supply restricted areas being significantly more exposed to a financial accelerator effect and a price-to-price expectation mechanism. We further find that the presence of endogenous price acceleration mechanisms contribute to dilute the positive relationship between the total quantity response and the supply elasticity during a housing boom.

As home equity turns negative, homeowners default on mortgages and home equity lines of credit at higher rates, whereas they prioritize repaying credit cards and auto loans. Larger unused credit card limits intensify the preservation of credit cards over housing debt. Although mortgage nonrecourse statutes increase default on all types of housing debt, they reduce credit card defaults. Foreclosure delays increase default rates for housing and nonhousing debts.

While historically this seasonal pattern has been linked to exogenous factors, modern birth seasonality patterns can also be explained by purposive choice. If birth month of a child is at least partially chosen by the parents then, by extension, it can also be expected that this can be influenced by anything that changes the costs and benefits associated with that choice, including public policy. This paper explores the effect that the 2001 extension of paid parental leave benefits had on birth seasonality in Canada. Overall we find strong results that the pattern of birth seasonality in Canada changed after 2001, with a notable fall in spring births and an increase in late summer and early fall births. We discuss the potential effects of this unintended consequence, including those related to health and development, educational preparedness and outcomes, and econometric modelling.","[Compton, Janice] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Tedds, Lindsay M.] Univ Victoria, Sch Publ Adm, Victoria, BC, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Victoria,"Compton, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,,Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI); Statistics Canada,Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC); Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR)(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI)(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Statistics Canada,"This research was supported by funds from the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and Statistics Canada.

Evidence From Graduated Driver Licensing,JOURNAL OF POLICY ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NATIONAL EVALUATION; CRASHES; LAWS; PASSENGERS; PROGRAM; IMPACT; YOUTH; RISK,"To date, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have a three-stage Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) system that phases in driving privileges for teenagers. GDL laws effectively impose a statutory driving curfew and a limitation on the number of passengers in motor vehicles. Both the timing of motor vehicle access and a limitation on the peer influences available in a motor vehicle could significantly affect the production of criminal behavior. Using the Uniform Crime Reports 1995 to 2011 and a triple-differences approach, we find that the implementation of GDL decreased criminal participation by 6 percent among teenagers ages 16 and 17, as measured by arrests. These effects are larger in magnitude in states where the nighttime driving curfew is required for a longer period of time.

Our results are as follows. First, in the case of joint implementation, the increase in gross domestic product (GDP) is larger than the sum of GDP increases obtained from implementing reforms separately. Growth-friendly public debt consolidation uses lower interest payments in the long run to permanently reduce tax rates, and competition-friendly reform expands the tax base, allowing for further rate reductions. Second, the medium-term output loss associated with the temporary increase in taxes during the fiscal consolidation is mitigated by its implementation alongside the competition-friendly reform, whose expansionary effects limit the tax rate increase. Third, in the short run (the first two years), all measures imply a macroeconomic cost in terms of output loss, which is smaller than the permanent output gain in the long run.","[Gerali, Andrea; Notarpietro, Alessandro; Pisani, Massimiliano] Bank Italy, Modelling & Forecasting Div, I-00147 Rome, Italy",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy,"Pisani, M (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Res Dept, Via Nazl 91, I-00147 Rome, Italy.",massimiliano.pisani@bancaditalia.it,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1367-0271,1468-2362,,INT FINANC,Int.

If we know the risk preferences of the individual, and subjective beliefs about loss contingencies and likelihood of payout, there is a certainty equivalent of the risky insurance policy that can be compared to the certain insurance premium. This simple logic extends to nonstandard models of risk preferences, such as those in which individuals exhibit optimism or pessimism about loss contingencies in their evaluation of the risky insurance policy. We illustrate the application of these basic ideas about the welfare evaluation of insurance policies in a controlled laboratory experiment. We estimate the risk preferences of individuals from one task, and separately present the individual with a number of insurance policies in which loss contingencies are objective. We then estimate the expected consumer surplus gained or foregone from observed take-up decisions. There is striking evidence of foregone expected consumer surplus from incorrect take-up decisions. Indeed, the metric of take-up itself, widely used in welfare evaluations of insurance products, provides a qualitatively incorrect guide to the expected welfare effects of insurance.","[Harrison, Glenn W.; Jia Min Ng] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Harrison, Glenn W.] Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Jia Min Ng] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Jia Min Ng] IZA Inst Study Labor, Bonn, Germany",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University of Cape Town; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Harrison, GW; Ng, JM (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.;Harrison, GW (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Robinson Coll Business, Ctr Econ Anal Risk, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",gharrison@gsu.edu; jng4@gsu.edu,,,,,,,68,42,45,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

While there is an extensive literature on the consequences of these reforms, very little is known about their determinants. In this study, we investigate the role of party politics in the reform process across U.S. states. In order to test whether any party effect goes beyond voter preferences, we apply the idea behind regression discontinuity studies based on close electoral outcomes to semi-parametric proportional hazards models. We find that in states with close election outcomes, a narrow Republican majority in the lower house is associated with a 50 to 150% higher risk of tort reform enactment compared to a narrow Democratic majority.

Many, if not most, of all biological traits and human artifacts that were developed for particular functions started as something different: feathers were most likely selected for thermal insulation, bones originated as excess calcium repositories, microwave ovens started life as radar magnetrons. Exaptation thus describes a discontinuous evolutionary process resulting from a functional shift of an existing trait or artifact. Despite the importance of the concept, even the term exaptation still remains largely unknown outside the field of evolutionary biology. The main purpose of this special section is to introduce the concept of exaptation to a broader audience, discuss its significance, and expose its contribution to the (possible) solution of long-standing, yet unresolved, questions about the emergence of novelty, particularly radical innovation.","[Andriani, Pierpaolo] Kedge Business Sch, Rue Antoine Bourdelle,Domaine Luminy BP 921, F-13288 Marseille, France; [Cattani, Gino] NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, 40 West 4th St,Tisch Hall,Suite 7-14, New York, NY 10012 USA",Kedge Business School; New York University,"Cattani, G (通讯作者)，NYU, Stern Sch Business, Dept Management & Org, 40 West 4th St,Tisch Hall,Suite 7-14, New York, NY 10012 USA.",pierpaolo.andriani@kedgebs.com; gcattani@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,99,63,66,6,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0960-6491,1464-3650,,IND CORP CHANGE,Ind.

We find that global and/or European Monetary Union (EMU)-wide factors are the main drivers of changes in the sovereign CDS spreads in our sample. However, the impacts of those factors change with market uncertainty. There is a relatively tranquil regime where market uncertainty is low and a relatively turbulent regime where market uncertainty is high. The transition from the tranquil regime to the turbulent regime is driven by changes in the global jump risk, which suggests that contagion from the global financial market significantly affected the pricing of sovereign credit risk in our sample. Domestic economic and financial indicators have little impact on the pricing of sovereign credit risk in all sample countries except Italy. But changes in the sovereign credit risk have significant impacts on domestic economic and financial indicators. Neglecting the financial contagion and feedback effects from sovereign credit risk to domestic economic and financial developments leads to spurious results regarding the determinants of sovereign CDS spreads.

We predict that a common auditor can help merging firms reduce uncertainty throughout the acquisition process, which allows managers to more efficiently allocate their capital, resulting in higher quality M&As. Consistent with our prediction, we find that deals with common auditors have higher acquisition announcement returns than do non-common-auditor deals. Further, we find that the common auditor effect is more pronounced for deals with greater pre-acquisition uncertainty and deals involving acquirers and targets that are audited by the same local office of the common auditor. We also find that there is an increased probability of an M&A for firms with a common auditor.

Examination of public statistics and of data from Norwegian National Travel Surveys indicates that the percentage of young people acquiring a driving licence fell during the 1990s and has been stagnating since the start of the year 2000. Over a 25-year period, we find that young people living outside large cities have a car(s) in the household; they are in paid work and are married/cohabiting. They have a driving licence to a much greater degree than those who live in cities and have good access to public transport; they are students and not married/cohabiting. In the same 25-year period we have seen a higher percentage of young people living in the larger cities, spending longer on education and delaying establishing a family. Our cohort analyses indicate that young cohorts/generations defer from obtaining a driving licence. At age 30 years the proportion of licence holders has been around 90%, but analysis of young cohorts from 2001 to 2009 shows that this figure is declining. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The research is based on a combination of statistical analysis of travel diary data and field work to conduct walkability audits. The approach follows a sequence of logical steps. The first step involves the estimation of a travel behavior model walking by seniors (people 65 years or older). The results of this model, in combination with cluster analysis, are used to identify sites where the model systematically under- or over-predicts walking. Subsequently, sites are targeted for walkability audits. It then becomes possible to assess the presence or absence of attributes of built environments where walking is more or less common than other factors would predict. A walkability audit of 403 street segments was used to proof the concept in this paper. The audited items were summarized in contingency tables and tested with the chi-squared test of independence to identify streetscape elements that correlate with walking for transportation.

Transit services (e.g., public bus service) are a component of the overall park transportation system and are very desirable in park settings as they yield many advantages over personal auto access including reduced congestion in parking areas, a reduced carbon footprint, and an enhanced visitor experience. However, a growing body of research also suggests that the delivery of visitors via transit to destinations within a park or protected area may have unique ecological disturbance implications resulting from increased visitor use, density, and altered spatial and temporal use patterns. In this paper, we examine the relevant literature and present examples from recent research that illustrates the potential range of ecologic impacts from visitor deliveries via park transportation systems. We conclude while transit systems remain very desirable in park settings, depending on a range of situational factors, conventional, demand-driven planning and management approaches may result in unintended impacts to ecological conditions. Overall, this discussion provides a framework for improved management of the potential ecological impacts of protected area transportation systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Accounting for spatial dependence in the formation of bilateral investment treaties and preferential trade agreements that contain investment provisions, we find that the increase in agreements with stricter provisions on investor-to-state dispute settlement and pre-establishment national treatment is a contagious process. Specifically, a developing country is more likely to sign an agreement with weak investment provisions if other developing countries that compete for FDI from the same developed country have previously signed agreements with similarly weak provisions. Conversely, contagion in agreements with strong provisions exclusively derives from agreements with strong provisions that other FDI-competing developing countries have previously signed with a specific developed source country of FDI.","[Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Neumayer, Eric] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Nunnenkamp, P (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany.",peter.nunnenkamp@ifw-kiel.de,"Neumayer, Eric/ABF-3741-2021","Neumayer, Eric/0000-0003-2719-7563",,,,,47,18,19,0,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

It is also a bubble whose current price depends on expectations of what it will buy at future dates. In this article, the author studies how the government must balance the provision of sufficient liquidity against the risk of adverse expectations regarding future debt prices when private liquidity has dried up. The socially optimal balance is captured in a Taylor-like rule that sets a target for real public debt and manages expectations by overreacting to deviations from the target value. Overreaction takes the form of manipulating budget surpluses to absorb excess debt or reverse liquidity shortages. A budget surplus (deficit) is equivalent to an income tax (subsidy) on investors that restrains (raises) their demand for liquid assets.","[Azariadis, Costas] Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Arts & Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; [Azariadis, Costas] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Washington Univ, Dept Econ, Arts & Sci, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.;Azariadis, C (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,4,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

The role of elderly consumers is permanently growing in Poland. This research sheds light on the issues of elderly consumers and their expectancies towards a new and innovative technological product. The study explores two components: performance expectancy and effort expectancy regarding the acceptance and use of mobile phones. Methodology/methods The study employed the PAPI survey for targeting the elderly touch mobile phone 'smartphone' users. The test took part at the turn of 2014-2015. The data were collected from elderly people who took part in lectures at Third Age Universities in the Pomerania Voivodship in Poland. The structural model was employed to test the research hypotheses. Baseline descriptive statistic and confirmatory factor analysis were used for in-depth analysis. Scientific aim The aim of the paper is to present the outcomes of empirical research conducted among the Polish elderly consumers. Findings The research outcomes suggest that consumer innovativeness (CI) affects performance expectancy (PE) and effect expectancy (EE) regarding the acceptance and use of the mobile phone by elderly people. There are significant relationships between consumer innovativeness and performance and effort expectancies but positively between CI and PE and negatively between CI and EE. Furthermore, performance and effort expectancies affect attitudes towards innovation regarding the acceptance and use of the mobile phone by the elderly and in this case both relationships are positive. Conclusions From the theoretical perspective, a research model consisting of CI, PE, EE and ATI was developed and these complex factors which affect purchasing and using innovative technological products by the elderly have been better understood. For practitioners, this study reveals that marketers of new products should stress incorporating the usefulness of the product in the daily life of the elderly. They should communicate that the minimum of experience is needed to be skilled at using technological devices and if consumers are over 60 obtaining the desirable skills will be almost effortless for them.","[Badowska, Sylwia; Zamojska, Anna; Rogala, Anna] Univ Gdansk, Armii Krajowej St 101, PL-81824 Sopot, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; University of Gdansk,"Badowska, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gdansk, Armii Krajowej St 101, PL-81824 Sopot, Poland.",sylwia.badowska@ug.edu.pl,"Zamojska, Anna/AAO-8892-2021","Badowska, Sylwia/0000-0001-6332-1184",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,174,181,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200020,0

There is a debate over the extent to which phytomedicine production can be beneficial for farmers in low- and middle-income countries. More generally, there are varied views about the extent to which small farmers are disadvantaged by stringent public health and private consumer standards in northern markets for agricultural products. This paper proves a comparative analysis of value chains, using case studies of turmeric production in India. It marries a qualitative investigation of turmeric producing sites in India with an investigation into the chemical quality of various turmeric products. The aim of the paper is to understand the way that varied structure and governance of value chains changes the benefits to both producer and consumer. When production is for the organic northern market, we found evidence of a captive value chain, where the lead firm requires strict adherence to conditions of production and processing. Prices for farmers were relatively stable, at a reasonably high level. In contrast, where farmers were producing for local markets, including the major auction at Erode, prices were volatile and farmers bore considerable risk. We found that competition and volatility in the market-based chain can lead to turmeric adulteration and contamination, both intentional and unintentional. Our case study suggests that many small turmeric farmers would find it difficult to meet both public and private health standards, in contrast to some academic literature that argues that public health standards do not discriminate against small farmers. More than this, our study adds to the discussion of the impact of standards, suggesting clear consumer benefits in northern markets. However, there are also indications that only larger and more dynamic farmers can participate in the lucrative phytomedicine trade. As such, our study tentatively supports previous literature suggesting that the application of standards in northern markets lead to increasing farmer differentiation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This strategy has been associated with healthy labor market conditions, moderate economic growth, and inflation-netting out the effects of a major oil price shock-that is close to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC's) 2 percent target. Thus, with the economy returning to normal, it is natural for the FOMC to begin the process of exiting its highly accommodative policy. The FOMC has laid out several well-defined steps for this process. This strategy may be called central bank orthodoxy, since it is a natural extension of the classical view. However, three challenges to this orthodoxy have developed. Although each challenge is interesting and potentially helpful, the orthodox view provides a better basis for devising near-and medium-term monetary policy decisions.","[Bullard, James; Kliesen, Kevin L.] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis,"Bullard, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, St Louis, MO 63102 USA.",,"Kliesen, Kevin L/I-5746-2016; Bullard, James/L-8120-2016","Kliesen, Kevin L/0000-0002-7166-6016; Bullard, James/0000-0002-1142-6803",,,,,18,0,0,0,2,FEDERAL RESERVE BANK ST LOUIS,ST LOUIS,"BOX 442, ST LOUIS, MO 63166 USA",0014-9187,2163-4505,,FED RESERVE BANK ST,Fed.

Methodology/methods For the research purposes the data from European company database Amadeus were used. Concretely the data sample set is covered by 50 companies from the Czech Republic and Switzerland. Environment friendly and sustainability oriented business approach of the selected companies are represented by calculated Environmental Index. Standard financial ratios ROE, ROA and EBIT within last 5 fiscal years of the selected companies were used for evaluation of their financial performance. Correlations of Environmental Index and financial ratios were statistically tested in SPSS programme by using Spearman's corellation coefficient and presented in graphical, verbal and numeric form. Scientific aim The research objective is to find the most relevant financial performance on the basis of correlation in between environment friendly sustainable business orientation measured by Company Environmental Index and financial results of selected companies. Findings The research shows that the return of asset and return of equity indexes do not correlate with the environmental index. On contrary the financial indicator revenue can be seen as the important factor for developing environmental friendly and sustainable business. On the basis of the resuts it is possible to conclude that there is a slight difference between Czech and Swiss companies as the strength of Spearman's coefficient of Swiss companies is close to medium correlation dependence whilst the coefficient of Czech companies is closer to low correlation dependence. Conclusions Research findings show results in accordance with other worldwide research focused on impact of company environmental and sustainability business approach to their economical performance.

We are unique in being able to account for time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity. Like previous researchers, we find results consistent with negative duration dependence in models which ignore unobserved heterogeneity. However, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, we find that duration dependence has an inverted U-shape with exit rates initially increasing (indicating positive duration dependence) and then falling. Exit rates out of both literal homelessness and housing insecurity fall with age. Women are more likely than men to exit housing insecurity for a home of their own, but are less likely to exit literal homelessness. Persons with dependent children have higher exit rates. Finally, education seems to protect people from longer periods of housing insecurity. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, it is important that organizations can measure the quality of their human capital to optimize the investment in people development, and in order to create an internal Talent pool. It is assumed a segmented perspective in which the Talent Management (TM) is a kind of architecture between organizational strategy, shaped in the Business Plan, and Talent that allows achieving it. In order to reach it, with more reliability, it becomes necessary to manage its intrinsic risk, through the acceptance or mitigation of inner uncertainty of the decision process, leveraging the return on investment. The purpose of this paper is to introduce indicators that enable organizations identifying their internal Talent, contributing to its policies, processes and practices in a way that they contribute differentially positive, enhancing the competitive advantage of the Organization, assuring its sustainability, in a more proficient manner, leveraged through the use of Business Intelligence systems (BIS). In this sense, Business Intelligence (BI) emerges as a way to facilitate managerial work, through decision support, executive information and management information systems. Therefore, it is needed to have a knowledge based structure to provide and facilitate the transfer and share of know-how, being an important type of systems for data analysis and reporting, providing timely, relevant and easy use of information, improving the quality of planning, the timeless and quality of inputs to the decision process as well as the outputs, using two human resources management (HRM) core processes: Job Design and Performance Appraisal. For the analysis of concepts/processes mentioned above, it was done an intensive literature review, using an inductive, qualitative, method, with an exploratory goal, that allows presenting a conceptual framework showing the interconnections between them, emerging the life cycle sustainability of Business Talent Fit. Therefore, this paper brings a new perspective on the sustainability of internal organizational Talent pool, in a pragmatic way, coupling human resources (HR) processes with BIS, through the use of important data inputs and the information outputs that allows being more proficient in that task, setting up theoretical and managerial contribution.","[Dias, Ivo; Sousa, Maria Jose] Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal; [Caracol, Carla] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Ciencias Sociais & Polit, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Europeia; Universidade de Lisboa,"Dias, I (通讯作者)，Univ Europeia, Lisbon, Portugal.",ivo.dias@europeia.pt; maria-jose.sousa@europeia.pt; carla.caracol@iscsp.ulisboa.pt,"Sousa, Maria/HCI-9642-2022; Sousa, Maria José/I-1818-2014; Dias, Ivo/CAG-1438-2022","Sousa, Maria José/0000-0001-8633-4199; Dias, Ivo/0000-0001-6387-0722",,,,,44,1,1,0,4,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,70,78,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300009,0

The firm's need to consider and satisfy in a balanced way the needs and interests of all stakeholders had already been amply highlighted by economists belonging to the behaviorist school (Simon, 1961; Cyert & March, 1955). In this sense, and especially with regard to medium- and large-sized enterprises, the creation of value, a typical goal of stockholders, should be considered in the process of optimizing an objective function that is larger and more complex, resulting from a political compromise regarding the aims of the different classes of stakeholders. In particular, this function must be compatible with the needs of the external environment, taking into account the influence of cultural roots in a context of CSR (Melia & Gazzola, 2005). Entrepreneurship is the art of the start, or the ability to start up a profit-seeking venture and then grow it into a business that makes great financial profits for the shareholders. Corporate Responsibility is the art of managing already operating for-profit businesses in ways that are beneficial to others stakeholders beyond the company founders and investors: employees, operating partners, consumers, entire communities and even our natural world, or global environment. Social entrepreneurs embed corporate social responsibility into the start-up business model. They start the companies with a culture based on the building of a team with employees and other stakeholders. They aim to improve the environment by driving net-positive social impact results. They impose a wider shareholder vision from outputs to outcomes that add a mandate beyond shareholder value creation to value creation for stakeholder groups. CSE can drive companies by bringing business, social, and sustainability goals together, making the world a better place, while creating business opportunities at the same time. They see how these two goals are not different, but can be aligned and translated into outcomes for a sustainable impact. This study aims to describe ways of identifying the principles of Corporate Social Entrepreneurship that allow a more meaningful understanding of the behavior of modern corporations. The analysis of the international literature will be accompanied by the results obtained from empirical research extended to Italian companies.","[Gazzola, Patrizia] Univ Insubria, 71 Via Monte Generoso, I-21100 Varese, Italy; [Mella, Nero] Univ Pavia, 5 Via San Felice, I-27100 Pavia, Italy",University of Insubria; University of Pavia,"Gazzola, P (通讯作者)，Univ Insubria, 71 Via Monte Generoso, I-21100 Varese, Italy.",patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it; piero.mella@unipv.it,,,,,,,43,0,0,0,16,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,928,938,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300077,0

The objective of the paper is to identify ways to build trust in luxury goods in social media. For the purpose of the paper, literature studies and empirical research were conducted allowing exemplification of trust-building activities. The study covered three Polish strongest brands of yachts, undoubtedly included in the luxury goods sector with recognized world reputation. Methodology The use of a new research method, which is netnography, allowed analysing the content posted by the monitored companies to social media. On this basis a comparative analysis of the activities of these companies in social networks was performed. The scientific aim is to explore whether the manufacturers of luxury goods, including yachts, are active in social media, and if yes, with what frequency and what content they post, and what reactions their activity in that respect evokes among consumers. The findings confirm that the luxury brands entered the social media by taking trust-building activities targeted at their customers and at the same time preserving their exclusive specificity. The activity of the companies examined in social media is focused on two major platforms: Facebook and YouTube. The frequency of publishing materials is relatively low and their content emphasizes the prestige of the brands and their unique character. The reactions of recipients of the published content are positive in the main, and arouse admiration and recognition among Internet users all over the world. Conclusions The present work deals only with some issues of this extensive interest area. A lot of important issues need further investigation. The elusiveness of the concept of trust implies difficulties in measuring the level of trust among users of social media. This is therefore a major challenge for scientists dealing with this problem.","[Jozefowicz, Barbara; Lapinska, Justyna] Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Gagarina Str 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland",Nicolaus Copernicus University,"Józefowicz, B (通讯作者)，Nicolaus Copernicus Univ Torun, Gagarina Str 13a, PL-87100 Torun, Poland.",barbara.jozefowicz@umk.pl,"Łapińska, Justyna/HMD-4197-2023","Łapińska, Justyna/0000-0003-4134-4750",,,,,35,0,0,0,5,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,190,197,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200022,0

The culprits include central bankers, commercial and investment bankers, credit rating agencies, financial engineers, the government, investors, mortgage borrowers, mortgage brokers, and prudential bank regulators. Among the numerous sins committed by these sinners, the role of the government in encouraging and subsidizing risky home mortgages and the poor performance of the prudential regulators in adequately enforcing the in-place rules are of particular concern. The regulators were poor agents for their healthy bank and taxpayer principals. It follows that prevention of future crisis requires, among other things, the development of better incentives to motivate the regulators to be more faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the legislation requiring the regulations.","[Kaufman, G.

I construct a model in which countries differ according to both GDP and an idiosyncratic damage parameter that links global emissions to damage for an individual country. Allowances are allocated to treaty members according to an allocation rule based on a single allocation parameter. The model can be solved analytically to determine upper and lower bounds on this allocation parameter that ensure that a treaty of any given composition is internally and externally stable. I focus on grand coalition treaties. The first treaty examined uses a simple proportional rule in which allocations are set as some fraction of emissions in the non-cooperative equilibrium. The second treaty adds a coverage-contingent element to the allocation rule such that the emissions reduction required of each treaty member is weighted by the fraction of global emissions that treaty members as a whole emit in the non-cooperative equilibrium. I show that the coverage-contingent treaty outperforms the simpler treaty except when all countries have the same emissions intensity in the non-cooperative equilibrium (in which case neither treaty can reduce emissions).,"[Kennedy, Peter] Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada",University of Victoria,"Kennedy, P (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Econ, Victoria, BC V8W 2Y2, Canada.",pkennedy@uvic.ca,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The analysis of LSTP regressions provides the following new insights into the dynamic features of ERPT: (i) There is strong evidence for the presence of smooth transition type threshold effects in the ERPT. The identified threshold dynamics reveals the existence of two extreme regimes, one with low and another with high pass-through. (ii) Both the short-run and the long-run pass-through estimates exhibit variation across these extreme regimes and in the long-run, pass-through tends to be complete in the high pass-through regime and low, but, incomplete in the low pass-through regime. (iii) Import price elasticities are asymmetric, as such, the same 1% depreciation of the currency is not associated with the same degree of ERPT across regimes. (iv) Temporal behavior of ERPT for a given country is generally similar across local currency appreciation and inflation rate-driven episodes. On the other hand, there is considerable variation across countries in the speed of the transitions and the estimated thresholds under each transition variable. These findings may explain why the linear ERPT literature might have obtained mixed results on the degree of ERPT across countries and sample periods used.

As the world's largest developing country and largest developed country, China and the United States are both important trade and investment partner, which plays an important role to the economic globalization and trade liberalization process, so the economic and trade relations between the two countries have been impressive. After the normalization of Sino-US relations, trade relations between the two countries have come into a period of rapid development. With the growth of international trade, the trade friction between the two countries are developing continuously and steadily.","[Li, Zhen] ZiBo Vocat Inst, Int Sch, Zibo, Shandong, Peoples R China",Zibo Vocational Institute,"Li, Z (通讯作者)，ZiBo Vocat Inst, Int Sch, Zibo, Shandong, Peoples R China.",zblz230@126.com,,,,,,,4,0,0,1,28,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-365-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,207,211,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF8YF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385267100034,0

We find that rural-urban migration leads to a decrease in subjective well-being by 8.3 per cent.

In this context, the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) title can help cities with a lower international visibility gain various cultural, financial, and social opportunities by engaging in a rigorous selection process. In the bid for the ECoC 2021 title, Romanian cities had the chance to develop complex cultural strategies. This paper focuses on the analysis of the ECoC title applications of the four Romanian finalists (Baia Mare, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, and the eventual laureate city of Timisoara). These case studies are centered on the proposed cultural strategies and how the candidate cities envision their position in the European dimension in 2021, in terms of urban development and city branding. By focusing on how the applications aim to reach and implement the ECoC 2020-2033 Specific Objectives (SO), the analysis will emphasize the distinctions and similarities in each city's attempts to gain the title. Though the proposed cultural strategies have significant differentiations in terms of vision and cultural outreach initiatives, all four of them emphasized a strong predilection towards European values. Taking into account the scope of the ECoC program, the Romanian candidate cities' proposals have integrated the European Union values, while also devising projects and activities aimed at celebrating the local culture and heritage. In the present study, we will also explore the way the proposals encompass and highlight the concepts of community and cultural mosaic, important elements throughout the four candidacies and ECoC Guidelines. The case study contributes to the evolving field of city branding in the European context by having an initial contribution to the research area in relation to the Romanian ECoC candidate cities, a complex endeavor that can result in more varied research pertaining to this topic.","[Nicu, Alexandra; Dumitru, Ruxandra] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Nicu, A (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",nicu.alexandra1@gmail.com; ruxandra.dumitru@student.comunicare.ro,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,260,271,,,,,,12,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300020,0

This paper presents partial results of the research on the recognition and preference of the regional food product's brand Genuss Region in this region. The brand Genuss Region is the main regional agricultural and food product brand in Austria. The questionnaire survey was conducted at the end of the year 2014 and beginning of the year 2015 on the sample of 450 respondents from this region. Pearson's chi-squared test is used to test independence between the recognition of the regional brand Genuss Region and demographic factors, such as age of the respondents, gender of the respondents, level of education of the respondents and monthly income of families of the respondents. The results show, that respondents in Lower Austria region mostly prefer Austrian food products, more than half of them recognize the brand Genuss Region and buy products labeled by this brand (64, 9%). The most important target group for coordinator of the brand are woman, middle aged and older consumers and consumers with the lowest and middle net family income. Lower Austria is an example of working regional labeling systems; the importance is particularly for geographically isolates areas, which are based on agricultural production systems such as the Genuss Region so they can bring improvements for the regions also in the field economy. Regional food brands seem like a good opportunity for small and medium sized local or regional producers who produce high quality food products, but their weaknesses (for example due to a lack of knowledge and high costs) is the communication of such information to the potential group of customers.","[Rojik, Stanislav; Pilar, Ladislav; Balcarova, Tereza] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Chalupova, Martina; Prokop, Martin] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Rojík, S (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",rojiks@pef.czu.cz; pilarl@pef.czu.cz; balcarova@pef.czu.cz; martina.chalupova@vspj.cz; martin.prokop@vspj.cz,"Rojík, Stanislav/D-1663-2017; Pilař, Ladislav/C-9172-2017; Balcarova, Tereza/N-4869-2017","Rojík, Stanislav/0000-0002-3506-8799; Pilař, Ladislav/0000-0001-7624-7323; Balcarova, Tereza/0000-0003-0263-0076",,,,,18,5,5,0,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-8-0213-2670-5,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2016,,,,,,,298,303,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7AS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391137000038,0

The selected countries are: Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia. Multivariate analysis of labour market indicators showed how the position of labour markets of the analysed countries differs and how it has changed over eleven years, after entering the EU. Methodology/methods The paper was based on both the desk-research of literature connected with labour market institutions as well as the analysis of labour market indicator through usage of principal components analysis and multivariate analysis. The data was gathered from the databases of Eurostat. The choice of meaningful variables was made by factor analysis. There were identified the key factors, which determined the labour market situation in the selected countries in two years - 2003 and 2014. Scientific aim The conducted research can contribute to fill the loophole of the discipline of labour economics in the area of determining the trajectories of labour markets developments in transition economies. Findings Poland is the example of transition economy which significantly improved its labour market situation in 2014 compared to 2003. On the other hand Slovenia's position in that area among the CEE countries seems to be worse eleven years after joining the EU than before that time. Estonia and Czech Republic have been the leaders in terms of labour market situation both in 2003 and 2014. Conclusions It can be noticed the high level of heterogeneity of the labour markets of the transition CEE countries. However, in 2003 a clear relationship in terms of selected key factors occurred in the case of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. In contrast, in 2014 a cluster of Poland and Hungary emerged. The Baltic States' cluster was left by Estonia as it improved its labour market situation in comparison with Lithuania and Latvia.","[Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Rollnik-Sadowska, E (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45 A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",e.rollnik@pb.edu.pl,"Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/AAV-4280-2020","Rollnik-Sadowska, Ewa/0000-0002-4896-1199",,,,,16,1,1,0,6,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,387,393,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200048,0

Most of the previous studies of mobile payment field focus on consumers' opinions, expectations and concerns to assess their acceptance of mobile payment systems. The financial transactions' complementing party-the merchants-who also needed to accept and, therefore, to implement mobile payment technologies is considered in this study. The purpose of this study is to enhance an existing research framework, which already integrates the constructs user satisfaction and technology acceptance, to fit better the mobile payment domain out of the retailer's perspective. Seizing this, we develop and test a new structural equation model linking between the quality of the environment, economic benefits and application satisfaction with the merchant's use of mobile payment systems. Testing the conceptual framework by fitting a structural equation model builds upon information obtained from 166 merchants spreading all over Germany. We collected the information from the German retail sector, which is indeed one of the most competitive and innovative in Europe, using a quantitative questionnaire. Our findings have a significant impact on retailers' application satisfaction and their system satisfaction of mobile payment technologies. Complementing the results provide evidence that both satisfaction components have a statistically significant and substantial impact on the merchant's behavioral intention to adopt mobile payment technologies. Summarizing, this study identifies antecedents, drivers and barriers of actual mobile payment system use. All of our results are in line with today's state of the art technology acceptance literature but additionally highlight retailers' intention to use mobile payments.

Consequently, smaller organizations tend to downplay diversity issues although recent research findings indicate that managing diversity through integrating diversity practices in organization strategy, making diversity effective throughout the organization, and gaining support for diversity practices from top-management, organizations may improve performance and achieve sustained competitive advantage. Downplaying diversity concerns and the subsequent lack of research on the role and effects of diversity applies also family firms as most of them are small and medium-sized. Importantly, however, research on diversity may be of particular importance as family firms constitute a unique group of organizations due to the involvement of family in the business. Such uniqueness is typically created by pressures to employ family members and involve them in decision-making and management. Consequently, family firms, while ignoring plausible positive effects of a diverse workforce, may jeopardize strategic business opportunities that such workforce is noted to bring along. To gain knowledge about diversity in family firms, this study aims at shedding light on diversity in general, exploring the involvement of diversity in family firms, and finding if family firms might create value through diversity.","[Snellman, Lilian] Helsinki Metropolia Univ Appl Sci, 1 Leiritie, Vantaa 01600, Finland",,"Snellman, L (通讯作者)，Helsinki Metropolia Univ Appl Sci, 1 Leiritie, Vantaa 01600, Finland.",lilian.snellman@gmail.com,,,,,,,63,2,2,0,5,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,844,859,,,,,,16,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300070,0

The public intervention is necessary clearly revealed by recent crisis and justifies the importance of the research. It is also interesting to have a look at different approaches used by Chinese and European authorities under an evolutionary and comparative perspective. It provides us with a good example of sectoral and integrated supervisory system. Credit rating is firstly used for bond investors. Since bond market is less liquid and both Chinese and European stock market represent special characteristics, related to segmentation on one hand and integration: Euronext Paris, for instance, on the other hand, we chose to examine the informative impact of Credit Rating Changes (CRCs) on daily common stock returns of publicly listed companies (issuer ratings) and on the equivalence of the issued senior non guaranteed bonds (issue ratings). The study covers 16 years since the new century where Credit Rating Agencies(CRAs) started to actively perform on both markets (from 01/01/2000 to 01/01/2016), the same methodology of a classic event study with market model enables us to compare and to analyze the results under different institutional environment between mature and emerging market. We found Wealth Redistribution Hypothesis (WRH) from bondholders to shareholders rather evident in Chinese market while in the French market, the results are in the line of theory framework and thus valid the Signaling Hypothesis (SH) in the literature, showing no significant Abnormal Returns (ARs) for upgrades and negative significance for downgrades. Secondly, we found that reactions of Chinese investors evolved into the different direction. They took downgrades as bad news before the crisis (2008) and good new afterward. As for French investors, there were significant positive reactions to upgrades independently to the period while significant negative reactions were observed only before and during the crisis to downgrades. The behavior of CRAs is the third angle to explore the subject. Migration tables showed that Chinese local CRAs, compared to Big Three, are systematically more generous in giving better ratings. Besides, we also witnessed a recent fast increase of market share of CRAs adopting investors-paying models, such as China Credit Rating Co. (CCRC) and Egan Jones Ratings Company (EJR).","[Tong, Xuheng] Univ Lorraine, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Tong, XH (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine, 13 Rue Michel Ney, F-54000 Nancy, France.",tong.xuheng@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,3,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,157,173,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300013,0

The presented research tries to define the position of Information and communication technology sector and its development in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Austria, and Hungary in the period 2005 - 2012 using Gross Value Added data. The analysis of ICT sectoral specialization and concentration in V4+ countries will be made on a regional level based on empirical data from the European statistical office, Eurostat. Standard economic - geographical methods and statistical measures of specialization and concentration are applied and combined. Specialization and concentration are calculated using Herfindahl index for concentration, the Herfindahl index for specialization, Krugman dissimilarity index for concentration and specialization, Specialization index and Localisation index. The text after Introduction is organized subsequently: the second part explains the theoretical approach and methodology. There are introduced generally used methods for calculating sectoral specialization and concentration.

It was hypothesized that the probability of using a list of formal rankings is related to a set of characteristics of the department. This suggests lists may reduce the level of uncertainty regarding the assessment of research quality by providing explicit targets in the department but may also induce faculty members to develop institution-specific human capital, thereby reducing faculty mobility and impeding career development. Whether lists are used, how they are compiled, and the extent to which they are relied upon when making personnel decisions should be viewed in the context of developments and trends in higher education; e.g., the presence of multi-disciplinary departments and the use of clinical and other non-tenure track faculty. Further, the difficulty of revising lists once they have been agreed upon should also be considered, especially when journal quality declines or where changes in personnel evaluations and in bylaws and similar documents are lengthy and arduous processes.","[Van Fleet, David D.; Hutt, Roger W.] Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA",Arizona State University,"Van Fleet, DD (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, WP Carey Sch Business, Morrison Sch Agribusiness, 7271 E Sonoran Arroyo Mall, Mesa, AZ 85212 USA.",ddvf@asu.edu; roger.hutt@asu.edu,"Van Fleet, David/AAQ-7952-2021",,,,,,53,1,1,0,12,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

First, sectors' or firms' external financial dependence appears to be a key determinant of export performance. More vulnerable firms or sectors export less than others. Moreover, insufficient financial development and financial crises harm exports to a greater extent when firms or sectors rely on external finance. Second, trade finance, such as letters of credit or trade insurance, plays a key role in financing trade and provides a powerful transmission channel for financial shocks and banking crisis. Finally, we emphasize the complexity of the relationship between finance and trade. On the one hand, finance is also driven by trade patterns such that the causality between both phenomena is bidirectional. On the other hand, there exist institutional interactions between financial and trade reforms.","[Vaubourg, Anne-Gael] Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France",Universite de Bordeaux,"Vaubourg, AG (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, LAREFI, Campus Pessac,Ave Leon Duguit, F-33608 Pessac, France.",Anne-Gael.Vaubourg@u-bordeaux.fr,,,,,,,100,11,11,4,49,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The analysis uses fixed-effect instrumental variable estimation by first differencing two-round panel data. First, road projects are found to increase the transportation speed. Second, the empirical results from intra-village variations of household endowments and labour-market behaviour show that an increase in transportation speed raised wages in both non-agricultural and agricultural employment, and was associated with a decline in working time in agricultural employment, for the households whose members are relatively educated. The findings support potential complementarity between road quality and education, implying that the government's public investments in roads and education should be coordinated to capture cross-augmenting positive impacts in the long run.","[Yamauchi, Futoshi] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Yamauchi, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",fyamauchi@worldbank.org,,,,,,,15,9,12,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

This commentary asks whether those and other trends in this area can be justified in terms of economic efficiency. It is argued that the marginal benefits of scientific information and research have likely risen relative to production costs and the marginal cost of public funds has fallen, implying that reduced provision cannot be justified on efficiency grounds. An efficiency rationale for increased support for commercializable research is also lacking. Longer-term trends include the rise of open data, which does make sense, and a relative shift from intramural government research and development toward university-based R&D. The latter shift likely responds to underlying economic factors, but does not warrant a sudden sharp reduction in government research, such as seen recently in Canada.","[Davies, James B.; Slivinski, Al] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Davies, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada.",,,,Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction; ICLR,Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction; ICLR,The research on which this commentary builds was supported by a grant from the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction.

These findings are consistent with managerial opportunism or moral hazard related to the insurance purchase decision. We also find that higher premiums are associated with the likelihood of litigation, indicating that insurers price this behavior.

The research on the relationship between imperfections and output dynamics at the macro-level is ample, but the lack of wide coverage micro-data sets for developing countries limits the study of aggregate implications of the micro-level capital market imperfections. This paper presents micro-evidence on the credit market imperfections in Turkey and connects these imperfections to macro-movements. The first part of the paper documents the aggregate boom bust cycles in Turkey and shows that the non-tradable sector is more volatile over the business cycle than the tradable sector. Additionally, this sector based asymmetry is found to be strongly correlated with aggregate credit movements. To establish the connection between the sector based asymmetries and the credit markets further, the second part of the paper constructs two micro-data sets. Using structural estimation, we find that the non-tradable sector is financially more constrained than the tradable sector. With the non-tradable sector being more constrained, credit movements become an important determinant of boom bust cycles. Therefore, we can establish that the asymmetry in the financial constraints of the different sectors at the micro-level can generate the observed asymmetrical aggregate response of sectors over the business cycle.

These failures occurred despite the external and internal regulatory mechanisms imposed upon the financial sector aimed at ensuring confidence and stability in the financial system. This study analyzes the impact of macroeconomic and financial stress on the profitability of financial firms. We utilize data from 1980 to 2010 to model firm profitability and stock returns using a panel regression, fixed-effect methodology. Our results show that the profitability of all firms is negatively affected by increases in macroeconomic and financial stress, measured by the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) and the Adjusted National Financial Conditions Index (ANFCI), respectively; however financial sector firms have exhibited an increased marginal sensitivity to both stress indexes that began in the 1990s and continued through the financial crisis of 2008. In a further analysis of the financial sector and banks, we show that depository institutions are relatively robust to macroeconomic and financial stress, and financial sector instability is driven by non-depository finance, investment, and real estate firms. Additionally, the largest 33 percent of financial firms and banks exhibit increased sensitivity to macroeconomic stress in the most recent sample. Our results coincide with the risks associated with recent trends in the financial services industry, such as deregulation, global market integration, financial product innovation, and the increasing predominance of non-depository intermediation.

I estimate the effect of deposit rate ceilings inscribed in Regulation Q on commercial banks' credit growth using a historical bank level data set starting in 1959. Banks' credit growth contracted sharply when legally fixed deposit rate ceilings were binding. Interaction terms with monetary policy suggest that the policy impact on bank level credit growth was non-linear and significantly larger when rate ceilings were in place. Bank size and capitalization mitigate these effects. At the bank level, short-term interest rates exceeding the legally fixed deposit rate ceilings identify policy induced credit supply shifts that disappeared with deposit rate deregulation and thus weakened the bank lending channel substantially since the early 1980s.

University of Texas at Austin case clarified when and how it is legally permissible for universities to use an applicant's race or ethnicity in its admissions decisions. The court concluded that such use is permissible when no workable race-neutral alternatives would produce the educational benefits of diversity. This paper shows that replacing traditional affirmative action with a system that uses an applicant's predicted likelihood of being an under-represented racial minority as a proxy for the applicant's actual minority status can yield an admitted class that has a lower predicted grade point average and likelihood of graduating than the class that would have been admitted using traditional affirmative action. This result suggests that race-neutral alternatives may not be workable from the university's perspective.

Our method is based on a state space representation of the noise-contaminated RV (NCRV), namely, the realized variance (RV) calculated with observed prices contaminated by MMNs. The main idea of our method is to filter out the bias component, which we call the microstructure noise (MN) component, from the NCRV using the Kalman filter. We apply the proposed method to yen/dollar exchange rate data. We find that about half of the variation in NCRV is because of the MN component.

This contradicts studies stressing self-serving biases. Self-serving biases are often identified by asking people what fairness standards apply in situations with alternative income distributions. Nevertheless, when the response to a question is connected with a distributional decision, only the reply, but not necessarily the fairness standard, is biased. Social preference models envisage decisions as a compromise between self-interest and social concerns (norms). A model-based estimation of social concerns, as provided by this paper, is capable of identifying different sorts of self-serving biases.

The International Banking Research Network (IBRN), established in 2012, brings together researchers from around the world with access to microdata on individual banks to investigate key issues. This paper summarizes the common methodology and results of case studies conducted in 11 countries to analyze the impact of liquidity shocks on bank lending, both domestic and foreign. Four main insights are established. First, liquidity conditions affecting parent banks transmit into both the domestic and foreign lending of these banks. Second, the ex ante balance sheet composition of banks and banks' business models influence their responses to liquidity risk. No single balance sheet characteristic consistently plays a role in liquidity risk transmission. Third, internal liquidity management within multinational banks can alter the domestic lending effects of liquidity risk. Fourth, the availability of official sector liquidity tends to reduce the adverse consequences of private liquidity conditions for bank lending during stress periods and to weaken the impact of bank balance sheet constraints.","[Buch, Claudia M.] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Goldberg, Linda S.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, Financial Intermediat, New York, NY USA",Deutsche Bank; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Buch, CM (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany.",,,,,,,,63,42,45,1,33,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",2041-4161,2041-417X,,IMF ECON REV,IMF Econ.

Technology spillovers are measured by using patent citation data taken from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The main contribution of this paper is to provide new evidence that the size of technology spillovers significantly varies according to bilateral trade patterns. In particular, horizontal intra-industry trade is associated with larger technology spillovers than vertical intra-industry trade, and the size of technology spillovers is smallest when the trade pattern is inter-industry trade. Given the fact that trade between technologically advanced countries has a higher share of horizontal intra-industry trade than trade between other combinations of countries, our findings suggest that trade may enlarge, rather than narrow, the technology gap between technologically advanced and less-advanced countries.","[Jinji, Naoto] Kyoto Univ, Fac Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan; [Zhang, Xingyuan; Haruna, Shoji] Okayama Univ, Fac Econ, Kita Ku, Okayama 7008530, Japan",Kyoto University; Okayama University,"Jinji, N (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Fac Econ, Sakyo Ku, Kyoto 6068501, Japan.",jinji@econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [19330052, 23330081]; Murata Science Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [19330052, 23330081] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Murata Science Foundation; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Lee Branstetter, Akira Hibiki, Shuichiro Nishioka, Nobuhito Suga, Yoichi Sugita, Roberto Venturini, an anonymous referee, and seminar and conference participants at Hokkaido University, Kyoto University, National Institute for Environmental Studies, Otaru University of Commerce, University of Pittsburgh, Yokohama National University, APTS, Midwest International Economics, Korea International Economic Association Meeting, and EARIE 2013 for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of the paper.

The results show that unlike the fixed coefficient approach usually used in the literature, the time varying parameter framework of the paper is needed to aptly unveil the latent dynamics of monetary policy impact on the bond markets. Wide time variation exists in the response of bond yields across all the maturities to the Federal Reserve's policy surprises. While the short-term rates respond more widely even the long-term rates show significant variation. Further, these time varying policy effects on interest rates are inversely related with the level of financial risks and economic uncertainty. These results are robust to several alternative aspects of risk and uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

One third of the tables reported the extra change to the server and returned it. Tips were higher with the higher level of extra change. Returning the extra change was negatively correlated with tips. The interaction between the level of extra change and whether it was returned had no effect. Possible explanations that tips are higher when the excessive change is not returned due to a positive income effect or perceiving paying a tip out of excessive change as less costly because it is a forgone gain and not a loss, are not supported by the data. Subjects may have exhibited moral licensing and moral cleansing effects. These effects, however, were possibly mitigated by a self-selection effect going in the opposite direction: those who are more generous or altruistic by their nature are more likely to return the extra change and also more likely to tip generously. Receiving the larger amount of extra change may result in feelings of good mood, perceived luckiness, or individuation and unconscious fear of being observed, which increase tips. Interestingly, these feelings seem to remain even if the extra change was returned. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the rollback of state protections has rendered small-scale farmers, especially marginalized peasant producers in the Global South, particularly vulnerable to these contemporary stressors. This essay critically evaluates the contemporary roll-out of financial derivatives that purportedly aim to mitigate smallholder vulnerability. It gives particular attention to a novel type of derivative known as index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI) that plays an increasingly prominent role in initiatives to climate proof' agriculture. The creation of IBAI markets has required significant work, including (1) technical interventions to debundle environmental risk from agricultural production and rebundle it in novel ways that support private financial capital and agricultural input suppliers, (2) extensive state support in the creation of risk markets, and (3) the construction of an accommodating insurance culture' among small-scale producers. In addition to mitigating weather-based risk, a primary objective of IBAI is to spur agricultural modernization. In promoting this agenda, IBAI initiatives may have the paradoxical effect of exposing smallholders to new risks while expanding their overall vulnerability to environmental and economic stressors.","[Isakson, S.

We develop a cash-flow-based top-down approach for modeling CDSs from which we can derive the following major contributions: (1) Correlated default factors did not matter for CDS prices prior to the financial crisis in 2008. During and after the crisis, however, their importance increased strongly. (2) We observe that correlated default factors primarily impact on the CDS prices of firms with an overall low CDS level.

A distinction between neo-developmental (Tanzania) and liberal neo-developmental (Uganda and Moldova) political economy preferences explains variation in the presence or absence of effective project developers.

The study revealed that the entrepreneur-related factors, particularly gender, managerial skills, need for achievement, need for autonomy, creative tendency, internal locus of control and managerial foresight; enterprise-related factors, particularly enterprise age, enterprise size and initial financial constraint; and environment-related factor, particularly social network, were the key factors determining the performance of microenterprises in Nepal.","Pokhara Univ, Sch Dev & Social Engn, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Kaski, Nepal",,"Thapa, A (通讯作者)，Pokhara Univ, Sch Dev & Social Engn, Fac Humanities & Social Sci, Kaski, Nepal.",azaythapa@gmail.com,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023",,"Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), UK","Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), UK","The author is grateful for the valuable comments of Prof. Sombat Thamrongthanyawong (Ph.D.), National Institute of Development Administration, Bangkok, Thailand, and gratefully acknowledges the supports from the Center for Economic Policy Research (CEPR), UK.",,57,38,47,0,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Indonesia's request to rejoin OPEC, for example, after having left in 2008, seemed more about international relations than oil prices, while official visits to the Middle East and the United States allowed Jokowi to project his presidency on the international stage. He still faces resistance from within his own party, however.Jokowi's politically bold reshuffle of economic ministers in August soon yielded a range of policy announcements. In September and October, his government introduced its first substantial set of reformsa number of economic policy packages intended, among other things, to attract investment and stimulate domestic demand. If even half of these policies are put in place, the impact on Indonesia's economy should be tangible.Few countries have escaped the effects of falling global commodity prices and China's growth slowdown. At 4.7%, year on year, in the third quarter Indonesia's rate of economic growth again fell short of the government's target. Slowing growth and a negative outlook have lowered market expectations and weakened the rupiah, which is also burdened by the large outstanding external debt held by corporate borrowers. Indonesia's real effective exchange rate has recently begun to depreciate, however, which may stimulate exports. Growth prospects will also improve if the substantial increase in capital and infrastructure spending allocated in the state budget is realised.Against this backdrop, we focus on what has happened to poverty and inequality in Indonesia since Jokowi took office. The distributional impacts of the current macroeconomic climate are likely to be hardest felt by the poor. Indonesia is well known for its record on poverty reduction, but between September 2014 and March 2015 the share of the population in poverty increased, even though economic growth was close to 5.0%. Slowing growth, rising food prices, the falling real wages of farmers, and the delayed disbursement of fuel-price compensation all had an effect. Such impacts may be mitigated in the medium term by Jokowi's budget reallocations to infrastructure, if realised, and his expansion of social spending.","[Yusuf, Arief Anshory] Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung, Indonesia; [Sumner, Andy] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",Universitas Padjadjaran; University of London; King's College London,"Yusuf, AA (通讯作者)，Padjadjaran State Univ, Bandung, Indonesia.",,"Yusuf, Arief Anshory/AAA-5839-2020","Yusuf, Arief Anshory/0000-0002-3126-3853; Sumner, Andy/0000-0002-8995-7065",,,,,25,27,30,3,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

Although US. support for biofuels is large and growing, the associated impact on greenhouse gas emissions remains unclear The effect of biofuel subsidies on emissions is determined by the relative magnitudes of countervailing substitution and price effects. Regulators typically ignore the price effect of biofuel policies, and therefore do not fully account for market and climate impacts. We develop an economic simulation model of US. energy markets to estimate the impact of biofuel subsidies on greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 through 2009. The model represents end-use consumption of oil, natural gas, coal and electricity in four sectors. We find that the subsidies for ethanol increased greenhouse gas emissions, while those for biodiesel have an ambiguous effect. Thus, ethanol subsidies create a green paradox. Although ethanol has lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline, the subsidies lower the market price of blended fuel, which increases overall fuel consumption and increase total greenhouse gas emissions These findings question the suitability of using ethanol subsidies to achieve climate goals and highlight the importance of accounting for the price effect of biofuel policies","[Allaire, Maura] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Brown, Stephen P.

Utilizing stock market data we show that the characterization of log-range series as long memory processes can be a strong assumption. Moreover, we find that all examined series experience a large number of significant breaks. Once the breaks are accounted for, the volatility persistence is eliminated. Overall, the findings suggest that volatility can be adequately represented, at least in-sample, through a multiple breaks process and a short run component. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Teen birth rates were also positively correlated with teen gonorrhea infection rates; and for the older teens (18-19 years old), by a measure of illegal drug use. By contrast, alcohol use was negatively correlated with teen birth rates. Finally, teen female employment rates were positively correlated with teen birth rates in weak labor market areas, suggesting that better job opportunities might increase teen birth rates among disadvantaged youth.

The data indicate outsourcing is less common among bank-managed funds, funds of leading groups, but more common among funds that are distributed through third parties. Moreover, initial subscription fees are lower among funds that outsource non-advisory services, while annual management fees are not different among funds that outsource. The effect of service outsourcing on subscription fees occurs only for funds targeting institutional investors; retail investors enjoy no fee gains. The outsourcing of advisor services is associated with greater fund risk, but also with higher risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio). However, the positive link with performance disappears when controlling for endogeneity, suggesting that fund managers optimally outsource advisory services in response to expected performance gains. Consistent with our predictions, outsourcing of other services does not impact portfolio decisions. Their impact is through lower subscription fees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we consider the long memory stochastic volatility model for the returns, under which, the asymptotic rate of decay of the autocorrelations of powers of absolute returns is governed by their long memory parameter. Although the true long memory parameter of powers of absolute returns is the same across different powers, we show that the local Whittle estimator of the long memory parameter has finite-sample bias that differs across the power transformations chosen. A Monte-Carlo experiment provides evidence in support of our theoretical finding that the reported variation of the estimates of the long memory parameter for power transformations of returns could be due to finite-sample bias of the estimator.

Losses due to idiosyncratic events can have a disproportionate impact on traditional VaR estimates, upwardly biasing these estimates, increasing capital requirements, and unnecessarily reducing the available capital and profitability of financial institutions. We propose new bias-robust conditional variance estimators based on weighted likelihood at heavy-tailed models, as well as VaR estimators based on the latter and on volatility updated historical simulation. The new VaR estimators also use optimally chosen rolling window length and smoothing parameter value. A simulation study illustrates the strong performance of the proposed methodology and highlights the model's ability to mitigate the potentially costly upward bias generated by idiosyncratic shocks. Real data examples and extensive backtesting results illustrate the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on other VaR estimators.","[Dupuis, Debbie J.; Papageorgiou, Nicolas; Remillard, Bruno] HEC Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Dupuis, DJ (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Dept Decis Sci, 3000 Chemin Cote St Catherine, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",debbie.dupuis@hec.ca,"Dupuis, Debbie/ABC-3425-2021","Remillard, Bruno/0000-0003-0254-6712",Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Desjardins Global Asset Management,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR); Desjardins Global Asset Management,"The first and third author acknowledge the support of the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

Piketty promotes the old theme that, under capitalism, the rich tend to become richer and the poor become poorer, at least in relative terms. We consider whether the data really shows that wealth and income are becoming more concentrated; the role of income transfers (Piketty's data is for pre-tax and pre-transfer income) and other influences on inequality such as real estate prices; the implications of social and economic mobility; the role of the state in fostering inequality; and the determination of socially acceptable inequality. We conclude that Piketty has not succeeded in showing that the inequality r > g (the rate of return is greater than the rate of growth) is the principal determinant of inequality. Piketty offers neither an accompanying theory of social justice nor a theoretical framework to support his case. In particular, lacking is a revealed appreciation of the effects of high marginal tax rates on growth and efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Moreoven in early 2013, the Norwegian and Swedish Transmission System Operators (TSOs) cancelled the planned, by many considered critical, Hasle (Westlink) transmission capacity increase. This paper addresses several issues concerning the cross-border transmission planning and its role for successful integration of the electricity markets. We aim at evaluating the impact of different institutional requirements for key entities as well as the changing governance structure to highlight how the infrastructure development paths are dependent on these. The evaluation of the governance structure presented in this paper is based on the historical experiences of the Nordic electricity market. Our findings suggest that the national goals in transmission development contradict the Nordic capacity development targets.","[Makkonen, Mari; Viljainen, Satu] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, LUT Sch Energy Syst, Lab Elect Markets & Power Syst, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland; [Nilsson, Mats] Lulea Univ Technol, Econ, S-97187 Lulea, Sweden",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; Lulea University of Technology,"Makkonen, M (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, LUT Sch Energy Syst, Lab Elect Markets & Power Syst, POB 20, Lappeenranta 53851, Finland.",mari.makkonen@lut.fi,,,,,,,62,5,5,0,12,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",2160-5882,2160-5890,,ECON ENERGY ENV POL,Econ.

Using linear regression analysis, 137,091 firm-year observations from 18 advanced countries worldwide which are categorized into three clusters as per level investor protection based on country classification of Leuz (2010) are used in the sample. The results show that the global financial crisis of 2008 has had positive impact on the cost of equity capital for all clusters and the cost of debt for clusters 1 and 2. The cost of equity is negatively associated with firms that are audited by Big Four auditors and have an audit committee in all clusters, and with firms that switch auditors in cluster 2. Firms that are audited by Big Four auditors in cluster 1, firms with a modified audit report in cluster 2 and firms that have an audit committee in cluster 3 have a negative association with the cost of debt. This study also shows that the association between earnings quality attributes and cost of capital is significantly negative before and during the crisis. Overall, our findings offer crucial insights to post crisis management, auditors, regulators and accounting standard setters in stabilizing investors' confidence and enhancing firm growth after the 2008 financial crisis.

The crisis affected merchant banks that were funded by short-term credit instead of deposits. We use archival data to show that these shadow banks suffered a sudden loss of funding after the failure of a major bank. The central bank at the hub of the crisis, the Bank of Amsterdam, responded by broadening the range of collateral it accepted. The data also show how this emergency liquidity helped to contain the crisis, by preventing the collapse of at least two other major banks.","[Quinn, Stephen] Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA; [Roberds, William] Fed Reserve Bank Atlanta, Res Dept, Atlanta, GA USA",Texas Christian University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Atlanta,"Quinn, S (通讯作者)，Texas Christian Univ, Dept Econ, Ft Worth, TX 76129 USA.",s.quinn@tcu.edu; william.roberds@atl.frb.org,,,,,,,46,8,9,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

This article proposes two new parameterizations of the intraday volatility process that account for both features: the Fractionally Integrated Periodic EGARCH and the Seasonal Fractional Integrated Periodic EGARCH. The analysis of hourly E-mini S&P 500 futures returns shows that the volatility is characterized by a statistically significant long-range dependence coupled with a periodic leverage effect, with negative return shocks having a larger effect on volatility during the US trading period. Long memory estimates obtained with nonperiodic long memory models are greater than those obtained with FI-PEGARCH and SFI-PEGARCH models. A simulation experiment shows that the long memory component can be strongly biased when periodic patterns are not properly modelled at the intraday level. An out-of-sample forecasting comparison with alternative models shows that a constrained version of the FI-PEGARCH provides superior forecasts.","[Rossi, Eduardo] Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; Moscow Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",University of Pavia,"Rossi, E (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dipartimento Sci Econ Aziendali, Via San Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",erossi@eco.unipv.it,,"ROSSI, EDUARDO/0000-0003-3597-8060; Fantazzini, Dean/0000-0002-1481-3382",Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca [2006-13-1140],"Ministero dell'Universita e della Ricerca(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR))","The authors thank Riccardo Lucchetti for stimulating comments on an earlier draft.

We conduct asset-pricing tests that include RD as a potential risk factor and show that low-accrual and low-investment firms have significantly higher exposure to the risk captured by RD. RD significantly explains future returns and the excess returns to accrual and investment hedge portfolios shrink in magnitude and become insignificant during periods of low RD.

Using a large panel of publicly listed firms and innovation-based proxies for RSI, we find strong support for the model's predictions: TC increases in upstream firm's RSI and downstream firm's market power.

Dozens of studies have investigated this linkage over the past decades. Unfortunately, the findings generated to date are inconclusive and contradictory. This study reconciles conflicting perspectives by synthesizing the existing insights and knowledge, and develops a new three-stage S-shaped curve proposition. We target firms' merger and acquisition (M&A) activities to test this argument. The results show a consistent horizontal S-shaped relation between the number of directorships held per director and the wealth creation from corporate M&A investments before the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, the negative relation at the highest directorship level turns insignificant in the post-SOX period, suggesting that the mandatory changes by SOX may mitigate the negative impact of overboarded directors. This study contributes to the ongoing debate on the performance effect of multiple directorships by providing a more complete assessment of the full range of the advantages and disadvantages across different levels of directorships. The different association patterns found in the pre-/post-SOX periods further highlight the importance of factoring in regulative environmental change when making an inference about the effect of multiple directorships.

While institutional differences may explain some of the cross-country differences in corruption, the most consistent relationship is that high levels of regulation are associated with more corruption.

Our results indicate that underwriters do not negotiate their shares of compensation based on their pre-commitment and actual provision of key underwriter services.

If higher volatility in one market leads to higher (lower) reactions in another market, volatility reflects information (uncertainty). We apply a simultaneous time-varying coefficient model, where structural ARCH-type variances serve two purposes: governing the time variation of spillovers and ensuring statistical identification. We analyze data of US and further stock markets. Indeed, we find strong nonlinear, volatility-dependent spillovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To adequately account for this opposite development in public cost-benefit analyses, it has been proposed-based on a two-goods extension of the Ramsey growth model-to apply good-specific discount rates for manufactured consumption goods and for ecosystem services. Using empirical data for ten ecosystem services across five countries and the world at large, we estimated the difference between the discount rates for ecosystem services and for manufactured consumption goods. In a conservative estimate, we found that ecosystem services in all countries should be discounted at rates that are significantly lower than the ones for manufactured consumption goods. On global average, ecosystem services should be discounted at a rate that is 0.9 0.3 %-points lower than the one for manufactured consumption goods. The difference is larger in less developed countries and smaller in more developed countries. This result supports and substantiates the suggestion that public cost-benefit-analyses should use country-specific dual discount rates-one for manufactured consumption goods and one for ecosystem services.","[Baumgaertner, Stefan; Thiel, Denise; Winkler, Klara] Univ Luneburg, Sustainabil Econ Grp, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Klein, Alexandra M.] Univ Luneburg, Inst Ecol, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany; [Klein, Alexandra M.] Univ Freiburg, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany; [Thiel, Denise] Univ Life Sci, Vienna, Austria; [Winkler, Klara] Lund Univ, Lund, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg; Leuphana University Luneburg; University of Freiburg; Lund University,"Baumgärtner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Sustainabil Econ Grp, POB 2440, D-21314 Luneburg, Germany.",baumgaertner@uni.leuphana.de,"Baumgärtner, Stefan/A-9597-2012; Klein, Alexandra/J-5871-2016","Baumgärtner, Stefan/0000-0001-8314-8462; Klein, Alexandra/0000-0003-2139-8575; Winkler, Klara Johanna/0000-0001-7086-5585",,,,,67,34,37,3,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Using a new dataset based on a survey allows us to compare subsidized start-ups out of unemployment with regular business founders, with respect to not only personal characteristics but also business outcomes. The results indicate that previously unemployed entrepreneurs face disadvantages in variables correlated with entrepreneurial ability and access to capital. Nineteen months after start-up, the subsidized businesses experience higher survival, but lag behind regular business founders in terms of income, business growth and innovation.

Since capital and skilled labor are relative complements, this increases the relative demand for skilled labor versus unskilled labor, leading to higher wage inequality. Using aggregate data and exploiting variation in the timing of capital account openings across 20 mainly European countries, I find that opening the capital account increases aggregate wage inequality. In order to identify the mechanism, I use sectoral data and exploit variation in external financial dependence and capital-skill complementarity across industries. I find that capital account opening increases sectoral wage inequality, particularly in industries with both high financial needs and strong complementarity.","Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Larrain, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.",,,,Kauffman Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,Kauffman Foundation; Center for Equitable Growth at UC Berkeley,"I am indebted to Atif Mian, for his invaluable guidance and encouragement.

In a first quarter plagued by external adversity-especially a sharp drop in exports to China-coupled with internal political paralysis and the delayed disbursement of fiscal spending, the economy recorded its lowest rate of growth since 2009. Observing relatively stable inflation, Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank, eased its policy rate in February by 25 basis points, to 7.5%. The bank also adjusted its macroprudential measures to counter declining bank lending. On the fiscal side, the expected stimulus from fuel-subsidy reallocation and aggressive public-capital spending did not arrive. Meanwhile, tax revenue made slow progress towards its ambitious target, which it seems unlikely to attain. Increases in supply costs made it difficult for the government to align domestic fuel prices more closely to the market. Major commodity exports fell significantly, but some manufactured exports showed hints of an upturn. The depreciation of the rupiah, the global strategies of leading investors, and the introduction of taxexemption policies that have been tested in neighbouring countries may have contributed to this trend. To further broaden the base of export diversification, the priorities should be to reduce business costs and enhance competition rather than enforce mandatory regulations. Jokowi has stressed that his focus on maritime development, part of a broader development strategy, includes reducing logistics costs. The second quarter of 2015 saw the start of several projects in Jokowi's flagship 'sea toll' program to improve maritime connectivity. There is a concern, however, that the predominance of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in strategic port operations will continue to limit competition and reduce efficiency. Jokowi's development strategy also focuses on reducing inequality. His government has implemented several distribution and redistribution policies, including the national social-security system initiated by the previous administration. The system suffered financially in its first year from low participation among those in the informal sector.","[Sato, Yuri] Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan; [Damayanti, Arie] Univ Indonesia, Bogor, Indonesia",University of Indonesia,"Sato, Y (通讯作者)，Inst Developing Econ, Chiba, Japan.",,"Damayanti, Arie/N-1924-2018","Damayanti, Arie/0000-0003-2421-4372",Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25101006] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,24,9,9,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0007-4918,1472-7234,,B INDONES ECON STUD,Bull.

DLRs prolong fund life, but impose liquidity costs on investors, creating a potential conflict of interest. Ostensibly, funds establish DLRs to limit performance-driven withdrawals that could force fire sales of illiquid assets. However, after they restrict investor liquidity, DLR funds do not reduce illiquid stock sales and underperform a control sample of non-DLR funds. Consequently, DLRs appear to negatively impact fund family reputation. After the crisis, funds from DLR families faced difficulties raising capital and were more likely to cut their fees.

We probe the role of size, controlling for age, by comparing the cohorts of firms born in 1998 over their first decade of life, using variation across half a dozen northern European countries Austria, Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the UK to pin down size effects. We find that a very small proportion of the smallest firms play a crucial role in accounting for cross-country differences in job growth.

We find that higher third party credit scores, but not the use of accrual accounting, decrease the likelihood of loan denial. However, firms using accrual accounting exhibit statistically lower interest rates after controlling for many factors associated with the cost of debt. Further, the interest rate benefits from accrual accounting are greatest when the borrower's credit score is low and/or the length of its banking relationship with the lender is short. This evidence indicates that accrual accounting can benefit small business borrowers, but that the information contained in third-party credit scores and obtained through ongoing banking relationships can substitute for the incremental information provided by accrual accounting.

We show that trusting decisions become increasingly accurate with age, from a small effect size at age 13 to an effect size 2.5 times larger at age 18.

In this paper, we conduct a convergent validity test assuming equality of underlying preferences, but allow for the possibility that transfer errors arise from differences in the way that respondents process information in the preference elicitation tasks. Using data from an identical survey instrument applied to the population of two river basins in Spain, we obtain marginal and total WTP estimates for ecological improvements of water bodies and the corresponding transfer errors across sites. Results of equality constrained latent class (ECLC) models that infer attribute non-attendance (AN-A) are compared to results from mixed logit (MXL) models in WTP space. We find large absolute and relative differences in marginal and total WTP between sites for the MXL models, and significantly reduced transfer errors for the ECLC models. This paper therefore provides further evidence that AN-A can significantly affect environmental values derived from attribute-based stated preference methods and is the first to investigate the implications for benefit transfer.","[Glenk, Klaus] Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, Land Econ Environm & Soc Grp, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland; [Martin-Ortega, Julia] James Hutton Inst, Social Econ & Geog Sci Grp, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland; [Pulido-Velazquez, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Res Inst Water & Environm Engn IIAMA, E-46022 Valencia, Spain; [Potts, Jacqueline] Biomath & Stat Scotland, Aberdeen AB15 8QH, Scotland",Scotland's Rural College; James Hutton Institute; Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; James Hutton Institute,"Glenk, K (通讯作者)，Scotlands Rural Coll SRUC, Land Econ Environm & Soc Grp, Kings Bldg,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JG, Midlothian, Scotland.",klaus.glenk@sruc.ac.uk,"Potts, Jacqueline M/I-6995-2013; Glenk, Klaus/B-8743-2014; PULIDO-VELAZQUEZ, MANUEL/N-1619-2014","Potts, Jacqueline M/0000-0002-4594-7957; Glenk, Klaus/0000-0002-2472-0235; PULIDO-VELAZQUEZ, MANUEL/0000-0001-7009-6130; Martin-Ortega, Julia/0000-0003-0002-6772",Scottish Government Rural Affairs and the Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programme; EU [SSPI-022723],Scottish Government Rural Affairs and the Environment Portfolio Strategic Research Programme; EU(European Union (EU)),"We like to thank two anonymous reviewers and the editor, Christian Vossler, for their helpful comments and suggestions on earlier versions of the paper.

In the case of pension liabilities, the appropriate discount rate for a pension fund's liabilities is the expected rate of return on a portfolio that would be held under a liability-driven investment policy. The valuation of defined benefit pension obligations involves choices revolving around deciding: (1) what future benefit payments to recognize today (i.e., which liability concept to use); and (2) from whose point of view to value the liabilities. Moving towards modeling, the distribution of future liabilities using a 'risk-neutral' framework, would allow for calculating the present value of the future liabilities more accurately. This would provide policymakers with information more relevant for the decision-making, and it would also permit easier communication of the risks facing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation's PIMS model via a single univariate statistic.","Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester,"Novy-Marx, R (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, 500 Joseph C Wilson Blvd, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",robert.novy-marx@simon.rochester.edu,,,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); Pension Research Council at The Wharton School,"The research reported herein was pursuant to a grant from the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) funded as part of the Retirement Research Consortium (RRC); the author also acknowledges support from The Pension Research Council at The Wharton School.

We calibrate our model to match several long-term features of the U.S. housing market, and analyze the effects of several unexpected and permanent shocks on the house price and the foreclosure rate both across the steady states and along the transition between the steady states. We examine permanent, unexpected shocks to the risk-free interest rate, the minimum down-payment ratio, and unemployment. During the transition, these shocks create large movements in house prices. More importantly, the foreclosure dynamics are quite significant along the transition compared to the steady-state changes, and there are strong feedbacks between foreclosures and house prices. We assess the effects of a temporary reduction in the risk-free interest rate, which has moderate effects on house prices but little effect on foreclosure dynamics. We also study the effects of an ex ante macroprudential policy, which establishes a minimum down-payment requirement at a higher threshold. Such a macroprudential policy helps substantially stabilize both house prices and foreclosures.","[Arslan, Yavuz] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey; [Guler, Bulent] Indiana Univ, Dept Econ, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Taskin, Temel] Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Ankara, Turkey",Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey,"Arslan, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Republ Turkey, Res & Monetary Policy Dept, Ankara, Turkey.",yavuz.arslan@tcmb.gov.tr; bguler@indiana.edu; temel.taskin@tcmb.gov.tr,"arslan, yavuz/JOJ-4564-2023","arslan, yavuz/0000-0002-7664-3999",,,,,27,19,26,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-2879,1538-4616,,J MONEY CREDIT BANK,J.

What takes place is a quality exchange: developing countries export high-quality seafood in exchange for lower quality seafood.","[Asche, Frank; Tveteras, Sigbjorn] Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway; [Bellemare, Marc F.] Univ Minnesota, St Paul, MN 55108 USA; [Roheim, Cathy] Univ Idaho, Moscow, ID 83843 USA; [Smith, Martin D.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Idaho; University of Idaho; Duke University,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Stavanger, Norway.",,"Bellemare, Marc F./HCH-3192-2022; Tveteraas, SIgbjorn/Y-2283-2019; Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020; Smith, Martin/D-9168-2016","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Smith, Martin/0000-0002-4714-463X",,,,,37,184,200,17,177,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0305-750X,1873-5991,,WORLD DEV,World Dev.,MAR,2015,67.0,,,,,,151,160,,10.1016/j.worlddev.2014.10.013,0.0,,,10,Development Studies; Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Development Studies; Business & Economics,CA0PT,,Green Submitted,Y,N,2024-03-09,WOS:000348620000012,0

Both frictions generate countercyclical price markups, rising wages, and ensuing consumption-leisure substitution to overcome the negative wealth effect of the fiscal expansion. I demonstrate that while they independentlysupport the rise of consumption, when used together the two frictions exert opposing pressures on the markup and the wage, weakening consumption-leisure substitution.

The cross-sectional data typically consists of prices for options at various strikes and maturities at market close. The problem has been the formulation of an error model consistent with no arbitrage conditions satisfied by models and possibly also market data. The article presents such requisite error specifications consistent with no arbitrage conditions. The properties of such estimators are then analyzed on simulated data to evaluate biases in parameter estimates and their volatilities. The use of such error specifications coupled with maximum likelihood estimation makes available standard statistical tests for testing hypotheses on model parameter values. The methods proposed are finally illustrated on four popular models from the literature on data for options on the S&P 500 index at market close on April 30, 2013. It is shown that one can then conclude the risk neutral statistical significance of skewness, excess kurtosis, the presence of jump components, the negative correlation between volatility and the stock price, and the presence of volatility of volatility.","[Madan, Dilip B.] Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Madan, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Robert H Smith Sch Business, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",dbm@rhsmith.umd.edu,,,,,,,40,1,1,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1479-8409,1479-8417,,J FINANC ECONOMET,J.

Approximately 83 % of all bankruptcies occur in plants with not more than 10 employees, and 61 % of all bankrupt plants are not older than 5 years. The descriptive statistics and regression analysis indicate substantial negative age dependence with respect to bankruptcy risk but confirm negative size dependence for mature plants only. Our results corroborate hypotheses stressing increasing capabilities and positional advantage, both predicting negative age dependence with respect to bankruptcy risk due to productivity improvements.

Despite this realistic comovement among macro quantities, a negative financial shock generates an equity price boom as the shock tightens firms' financing constraint. This counterfactual response of the equity price is robust to a wide range of variations in how financial frictions are modeled and whether financial shocks affect asset liquidity or firms' collateral constraints.

This paper distinguishes three forms of foreign technology acquisitions based on unique data from Korea, namely, know-how-only licensing, know-how-and-patent licensing, and patent-only licensing. An econometric analysis demonstrates that a firm tends to involve know-how licensing before it starts in-house R&D, whereas patent licensing is not significantly related to conducting R&D. Therefore, a substitution effect is found between foreign patent licensing and conducting in-house R&D, which is in contrast to the inducing effect of know-how licensing for in-house R&D. It is also found that conducting in-house R&D, and know-how licensing by a firm, respectively, is significantly related to a generation of innovations or patent applications in next periods. This study shows that a learning process that involves foreign technology, especially tacit knowledge in the form of know-how, occurs before firms can conduct in-house R&D and innovations.

Yet within conventional literature disagreements persist around the nature of route choice behaviour, and how it should be modelled. In this paper, both the shortest path and anchor-based perspectives on route choice behaviour are explored through an empirical analysis of nearly 700,000 minicab routes across London, United Kingdom. In the first set of analyses, the degree of similarity between observed routes and possible shortest paths is established. Shortest paths demonstrate poor performance in predicting both observed route choice and characteristics. The second stage of analysis explores the influence of specific urban features, named anchors, in route choice. These analyses show that certain features attract more route choices than would be expected were individuals choosing route based on cost minimisation alone. Instead, the results indicate that major urban features form the basis of route choice planning - being selected disproportionately more often, and causing asymmetry in route choice volumes by direction of travel. At a finer scale, decisions made at minor road features are furthermore demonstrated to influence routing patterns. The results indicate a need to revisit the basis of how routes are modelled, shifting from the shortest path perspective to a mechanism structured around urban features. In concluding, the main trends are synthesised within an initial framework for route choice modelling, and presents potential extensions of this research. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In normal times, when the Federal Reserve's policy rate is above the interest paid on reserves, countercyclical monetary policy works in a textbook manner. When a shock drives the policy rate to the zero lower bound, the economy enters a liquidity-trap scenario in which open market purchases of government securities have no real or nominal effects, apart from expanding the supply of excess reserves in the banking sector. In a liquidity trap, the Fed loses all control of inflation, which is now determined entirely by the fiscal authority.

In this article we investigate what this sudden abundance of liquidity implied for the investment-cash flow relationship, the interpretation of which continues to generate controversy in the literature. For financially constrained firms we find that the investment-cash flow sensitivity decreases in the abundance period (2005-2008), suggesting that the financing constraints became less binding in this period. For financially unconstrained firms the investment-cash flow sensitivity instead increases over time, suggesting that this relationship is driven by agency problems related to free cash flow. Our paper is the first in the investment-cash flow literature to bring evidence from a natural experiment in which there was an unexpected, exogenous, substantial, and persistent decrease in the cost of external financing.

Through an empirical study using Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database and Patent Application Database from 2004 to 2007, we found that the expansion of SOEs negatively affected the innovation of private enterprises. Chinese private enterprises usually do not have extensive assets or strong ability to obtain debt financing, and thus are less likely to maintain investments in R&D when SOEs expand. Considering private enterprises are the main contributors of innovation in China, it is important to note the negative effect of the expansion of SOEs on the innovation of private enterprises. We further distinguished the SOEs along two dimensions: holding type and affiliation type. Based on the first dimension, we divided the SOEs into absolutely controlled SOEs and relatively controlled SOEs (RSOEs); based on the second dimension, we divided the SOEs into those belonging to higher level governments (central or provincial) (HSOEs) and those belonging to lower level governments such as municipal governments (LSOEs). We found that only RSOEs and LSOEs expanded rapidly from 2004 to 2007, and that it is the expansion of RSOEs and LSOEs that led to a decrease in innovation of private enterprises.

Central banks are susceptible to losses resulting from double default events where a reverse repo counterparty and the collateral default simultaneously. While there is a broad range of theoretical models for assessing and quantifying portfolio credit risk and double default, this paper aims to propose a practical framework that uses a portfolio of notional CDS contracts with dummy counterparties to represent collateral for loan exposures. A key advantage of this approach is that it can be implemented within CreditManager - a widely used risk IT application. Extensions to enable modelling of additional heterogeneous pools of collateral and to account for the effect of overcollateralisation are also outlined. The preliminary results indicate that applying this framework generates loss distributions that reflect the inherent credit risks associated with collateralised lending. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Important in a rating agency's assessment of overall financial strength is the insurer's ability to meet policyholder obligations. In the first part of this article we will present the context in which the major rating agencies are being analyzed and the market's attitude towards the qualifications awarded by them. During the time period of this study there were four major rating agencies that provided financial strength ratings of insurance companies: Standard & Poor's, Moody's, Fitch and AM Best. Next, we will study the important role of rating agencies in the economic crisis, but also the overreliance of firms, some relying solely on the ratings granted by rating agencies, not having a proper risk assessment system of their own. Despite the fact that the industry encourages insurers to have their private risk assessment methods, investors and policyholders still expect that ratings provide a realistic reflection of the outstanding risks to the market participants. The case of American International Group is presented in the third part of this article, analyzing the reasons which led to the 2008 liquidity crisis and the involvement of rating agencies in the group's affairs. It is important to identify the link between the AIG failure and understanding the systemic risks of financial institutions and to draw the lessons for protecting the financial stability of the insurance sector. Next, according to Moody's model for rating insurance companies, we will present a case study of the applicability of this model for two of the most important Romanian insurance companies, starting with 2006 until the last closed fiscal year, 2012.

This expansion in business activity reflects trade and investment liberalization in many countries. The location decisions on FDI depend on a country's broader set of factors such as market openness and deregulation, competition regimes, development policies and intellectual property rights, that influence not only international foreign direct investment, trade but also the transfer of technology. Patents are one form of the exclusive intellectual property rights conferred by the state in order to promote science and technology. International technology transfer comes through three channels, FDI, joint ventures and licenses. The increase of international technological diffusion has enhanced the importance of intellectual property rights and particularly of patents. This paper aims at providing evidence linking the patent protection to technology transfer and inward foreign direct investment in different industry sectors in Greece. Strengthening Greece's IPR regime is seen as a prerequisite for the attraction of foreign multinationals to transfer technology, increasing the growth and the innovative activity. It also examines the role of other factors in attracting more FDI as the market openness, country risks and so on. A proper understanding of the above relationship will help firms and government to create appropriate intellectual property policy in order to encourage the growth and expansion of FDI in Greece.

Although the regulations, which introduced the accrual accounting principles, have entered into force in 2010, original strategic decision has been made in 2007 and the necessity to do so can be tracked to the New Public Management trend, which is much older. For some types of state organizations, in general smaller semi-budgetary organizations, is accrual accounting definitely way to go, but for bigger budgetary organizations, like ministries, it brings significant administrative cost without noticeable benefits and the framework can be confusing, as shown on audit results.

I find that advisors have a significant impact on the menu of investment options of their clients' plans. Clients of the same advisor tend to hold the same funds and fund families. They also tend to delete and add the same funds. Advisors' plans are similar to their clients' plans in that they tend to hold identical funds, use the same fund families, and fund categories. Thus, to a large extent, advisors take their own advice. However, funds that are in clients' plans but not in their advisors' plans have higher expense ratios than the funds held by advisors. Since advisors' compensation is often tied to the expense ratio of their clients' funds, this pattern is consistent with misaligned incentives on the part of advisors and their clients.","Union Coll, Dept Econ, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA",Union College,"Dvorak, T (通讯作者)，Union Coll, Dept Econ, 807 Union St, Schenectady, NY 12308 USA.",dvorakt@union.edu,"Dvořák, Tomáš/JKI-9583-2023",,,,,,20,6,7,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7472,1475-3022,,J PENSION ECON FINAN,J.

The aim is to offer the required support of sustainability to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are often characterized by considerable instability in their financial behaviour.

Via providing financing for these enterprises PE can boost economic growth. On the other hand the different subsets of PE like Venture Capital (VC) and Buyout (BO) funds appear as an important investment class and the return characteristics of these asset classes is an indicator of the performance of the whole PE industry. The authors in their earlier works focused on the history of the return characteristics of the funds in the US and in Europe found different trends and features in the two regions with regards to the different asset classes. In this paper the authors focus on the current progress of PE industry in Europe and in the US and examine the recovery of the industry from the recession of 2008. The current trends are consistent with our former findings. In average the returns of BO funds exceeded the returns of VC funds in the US as well as in Europe. Not just according to the absolute value of the returns, but also according to its risk-return tradeoff BO seemed to be a preferable investment. The gap between the performances of BO funds was not as significant as the difference of VC funds. While the recession of 2008 affected negatively the returns of PE, the 'dotcom' boom of the millennia had much higher impact on the industry, and our finding is that PE returns are on a recovery course.

It shows that for each answer change that leads to loss of points more than two changes that increase test score are made. Answer switching is beneficial not only for the best students, but also for the majority of students whose final test score is low.

The overall aim of the present paper is to map industry practitioners' view on VDC professionals' role. This includes mapping their perceptions on what characteristics a VDC professional should possess, what roles they play today and what role they should play in the future, and also to what extent they are perceived to contribute to project success. In order to shed light on these questions a questionnaire was sent to respondents working in varying degrees with VDC, in one of Sweden's largest construction companies. The results show that there is little agreement concerning the goals of VDC within the company. Furthermore, opinions also vary considerably with regards to what responsibilities a VDC professional ought to take within projects, and at the same time expectations of the characteristics of a VDC professional are high. Finally, the results show that there is demand for higher involvement of VDC professionals as compared to their current involvement. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

Enactment of this legislation followed lobbying and political pressure from a variety of interest groups. By examining House roll call votes, we identify empirically the sources of political influence that resulted in passage of the internet gambling legislation. We find that party affiliation was of primary importance, with Republicans more likely to vote in favor of the bill. The percentage of constituents who are Evangelical Christians and also the number of gambling establishments in the district were positively associated with votes for the bill. However, contributions from the gaming industry decreased the probability a congressman would vote for the bill.

The research has successfully been carried out at University Kuala Lumpur (UniKL) Strategic Business Unit (SBU) or campuses. The research aims at several areas related to Supplier Performance Management. The focus of the research is on supplier evaluation. The first objective is to analyse Supplier Performance Management practice between the campuses. The second objective is to reveal the criteria used for supplier performance. Based on previous research, there are several popular supplier evaluation criteria that have been used such as Price, Technology, Quality, Service, Responsiveness and Delivery. The third objective is to identify barrier elements in applying supplier performance management. Data collection has been carried out by using questionnaires and interview session. 7 out of 12 UniKL campuses participated in this research. To achieve the objective, the research activities compared the assessment criteria from each SBU. In the next phase a comprehensive table was developed to depict the different practices for each of the campuses. The study revealed significant finding which contributed to the Supply Chain Knowledge and practices. The research found variances of supplier evaluation criteria among the campuses.

The eurozone technically has unlimited financial resources at its disposal to solve its recent financial problems, but the potential threats are rather of a political origin. The most important challenges are the distinct expectations that the strongest European economies harbored before the foundation of the eurozone. The French sought to gain more autonomy in the conduct of their domestic economic policy, which had been impeded by external constraints, particularly exacerbated by German monetary policy. The German goal was to prevent permanent upward pressure on their currency, which had been undermining their export-led economic model. These distinct expectations did partly influence the institutional arrangement of the Economic and Monetary Union. However, the essence of the Franco-German conflict has not been adequately addressed and we hold that the eurozone in its current setting is not able to fully resolve it. That being said, the ECB can employ means that could allow it to postpone the solution for a very long time.","[Hodulak, Vladan; Krpec, Oldrich] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, CZ-60300 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Hodulak, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Int Relat & European Studies, Jostova 10, CZ-60300 Brno, Czech Republic.",vlod@mail.muni.cz; krpec@mail.muni.cz,"Hodulak, Vladan/W-5422-2019; Krpec, Oldrich/C-6670-2013","Hodulak, Vladan/0000-0002-6988-0048; Krpec, Oldrich/0000-0003-4892-7086",,,,,63,0,0,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The experience of some countries can highlight two important steps: harmonization of the structure of the economic model of state-owned companies with those having the private sector and the improvement or development of well-defined structures of state ownership. Our result leads to the hypothesis that most state-owned corporations in Ukraine are unprofitable because of inefficient management and a high level of corruption in society. Political engagement prevents the implementation of effective systems of financial management in such companies. Financial management in the public sector has three cornerstones: financial statements and audit, resource allocation and risk management. It is very important to develop a monitoring system of state-owned corporations, including the development and key targets, both financial and non-financial, with the aim to improve financial and budgetary discipline.","Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Inst Int Relat, Kiev, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv,"Kornieieva, I (通讯作者)，Taras Shevchenko Natl Univ Kyiv, Inst Int Relat, Kiev, Ukraine.",korneevaj@ukr.net,,"Kornieieva, Iuliia (Yuliia)/0000-0002-1823-7618",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,EDITURA UNIV ALEXANDRU IOAN CUZA IASI,IASI,"STR PINULUI NR 1A, IASI, 700109, ROMANIA",,,978-606-714-142-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,682,690,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD6RH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362516600068,0

Current experience clearly shows difficult theoretical integration of these attitudes, heavily attainable quantification of their effectiveness and impossibility to prove their efficiency.

This indicator simply summarises impacts of the tax act (tax base adjustment, various deductions and tax credits, exemptions etc.) on the effective burden of the company, and at the same time it reflects behavioural effects, where companies try to evade taxes. The method of simple regression on the basis of 50 randomly chosen European companies is used to find out, if the total GDP, number of employees, costs on research and development and depreciation time of machinery and buildings have any impact on the effective tax rate. As for GDP, the size of the company according to the number of employees and costs on research and development the correlation with the ETR ratio was confirmed on the 5 % level of the significance, however, depreciation time of machinery and buildings do not have any statistically significant impact on ETR.","[Kubatova, Kveta; Joskova, Renata] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kubátová, K (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",kubatova@vse.cz; renca.joskova@seznam.cz,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,119,124,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500020,0

Interestingly, having such targets, large firms, especially those operating in the financial system, can lead to systemic risks, supporting financial contagion. Classical problems of corporate governance such as top management compensation, board composition, and independence of the director, agent theory or the correct valuation are problems envisaged to be analyzed when assessing how they affect financial stability.

It is argued that one of the persisting problems is a low degree of international competitiveness, as demonstrated, for instance, by rather poor publishing performance of senior academic staff in economic disciplines. Since our last research study (see Machkek and Kolcunova, 2009) the Czech government has made a great effort to improve this unpleasant situation, and that is why we are focusing on publishing performance of 299 associate professors and 116 full professors of economics to find out whether there is a clear recent trend of increasing the number of publications in journals listed in the Web of Science (WoS) database. Our empirical findings show that although this positive trend exists, quite many senior academic economists are still lacking any proof of their research abilities in meeting international/European publishing standards.","[Machacek, Martin; Kolcunova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Machácek, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",martin.machacek@vsb.cz; eva.kolcunova@vsb.cz,"Machacek, Martin/C-6095-2018; Macháček, Martin/AGD-4688-2022","Machacek, Martin/0000-0002-1517-6709;",,,,,31,0,0,0,5,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,521,530,,,,,,10,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300055,0

The OECD authorities realize the importance of tax systems' structure for economic output and social well-being, and thus the tax policy has made one of the OECD policy priorities since the OECD's earliest days. However, the policy has been aimed on giving recommendations to national authorities solely in the area of optimal tax mix structure, while other important aspects of the tax systems have remained omitted. One of such aspects is legal certainty about the development of taxation. If the certainty is low, expectations of economic entities are deformed, which leads to substitution effect, and higher risk occurs. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to validate the hypothesis that higher legal certainty in the area of taxation significantly promotes economic growth. This hypothesis is confirmed within the analysis, and more attention to legal aspects of taxation is suggested.","[Machova, Zuzana] Mendel Univ Brno, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic; VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, CZ-70121 Ostrava, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Technical University of Ostrava,"Machová, Z (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1-1665, CZ-61300 Brno, Czech Republic.",zuzana.machova@vsb.cz; igor.kotlan@mendelu.cz,"Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021; Kotlán, Igor/S-9863-2019; Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020","Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600; Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Kotlan, Igor/0000-0001-9657-0742",,,,,46,2,2,1,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

Skills are formed both by education and social origin which affects them rather indirectly. In the age perspective, skills are rising up to around 32 years of age and slowly evaporate after, with minor differences based on gender and the type of competences.

The current research sought to substantiate its propositions through two (2) research objectives. The first objective was to investigate the extent of SMA information usage amongst E&E companies and the second was to explore the outcomes of SMA information usage. Survey method was employed for the data collection purposes. Ninety-seven (97) usable questionnaires were received out of the 595 mailed questionnaires. The result suggested that E&E companies used SMA information to high extent. The result indicated that companies' extent of SMA information usage found to be significantly related to certain aspects of companies' performance. The current research has revealed some notable development with regards to SMA. The current result implies that, in Malaysia, SMA has made its progress quite extensively that failed to be reported empirically by fellow researchers.

To comply with the increased disclosure requirements, companies have to incur significant costs. However, the benefits from harmonised financial reporting are available only to those entities, which have serious incentives to report transparently (Daske et al., 2013). The benefits and costs following the changeover to IFRS are therefore neither unfolded equally across companies, nor countries. Empirical research (e.g. Lee et al., 2008; Christensen et al., 2013) reveals that the shortcomings in institutional setting may close off all potential benefits from harmonised accounting, which is pertinent mainly for the transition countries. The aim of this paper is to identify absolute and relative winners and losers among the new EU member states in terms of the progression of their capital market. The particular focus is put on the capital market size measured by a simple criterion number of listed companies and its changes in transitional and post-adoption period. The splitting of time-series into two subsets enables to eliminate the influence of different reporting incentives from the effects of change in reporting regime. As an unintended result, the paper's empirical findings raise some doubts about the appropriateness of certain research designs for assessing the economic consequences of mandatory IFRS adoption.

The modern Greek dairy cattle farming is predominantly based in Northern Greece, where more than 80% of Greek cow milk is produced. Since the 2000's the dairy cattle sector is characterized by a rapid increase in the mean size of farms, which permits them to undertake investments in machinery and buildings and to have access to improved genetic material for the achievement of higher productivity. Nevertheless, this development renders dairy farms vulnerable to volatile economic conditions, as they are heavily dependent on capital endowments. The main purpose of this study is to examine the consequences of the economic crisis on the dairy cattle sector and the strategies undertaken by farmers to cope with it. The analysis is based on data from a questionnaire survey of farmers in Northern Greece. Strategies undertaken by dairy farmers in order to face the crisis and to ensure the survival of their businesses are recorded through a set of Likert-scale questions. Technical and economic data are also analyzed in order to examine the economic performance of farms, revealing that the sampled dairy farms are viable, with satisfactory economic results, with capital returns of 6.2% annually. Based on the Likert-scale data, dairy farmers adopt active strategies to face the crisis, by undertaking investments and augmenting their farm sizes, while they deem that the crisis does not have catastrophic results on the profitability of their farms. On the other hand, strategies which entail less expenses and/or diminished productivity are unpopular among dairy farmers. Finally, the vast majority of respondents claim to have seen negative consequences on their farms from the recent measures concerning the prolongation of the duration of fresh milk in retail markets: lower quality, increased vulnerability to international competition, shrinking dairy sector.

The assumption in the method is that neighborhood effects are capitalized into uniform land assessments. Compared to the traditional sales comparison approach, the method has potential to extend the selection of comparable properties. Simulations based on the theoretical and empirical data suggest the method benefits greatly from compensating for assessment errors. Since more sales can be incorporated into the proposed method, it is contended the appraisal result will be more objective and accurate. In practice, the method provides an attractive solution for property valuations in areas where there are limited sales.","[Shi, Song] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Shi, S (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",s.shi@massey.ac.nz,"Shi, Song/ABE-1679-2021","Shi, Song/0000-0003-4188-5151",,,,,34,1,1,0,8,AMER REAL ESTATE SOC,CLEMSON,"CLEMSON UNIV, SCH BUSINESS & BEHAVIORAL SCI, DEPT FINANCE, 314 SIRRINE HALL, CLEMSON, SC 29634 USA",0896-5803,,,J REAL ESTATE RES,J.

However, during last ten years the height of lump sum expenses has significantly increased reaching up to 80 % of income. It raises a question whether such a high lump sum expenses still reflect real expenses and serve as a tool for reducing tax burden of small self-employed instead of being misused to lower tax liability. This paper is analyzing the adequacy of current lump sum expenses by comparison of declared income of selected business activities with average wages in corresponding industries. Results show that expenses which would ensure the same net income of self-employed as if they would be employed are substantially lower than lump-sum expenses. The estimated expenses are even so low that it would probably not cover real business costs. It implies that revenues declared in tax returns may be underreported.","[Stavjanova, Jana] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Publ Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic",,"Stavjanová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Publ Finance, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 3, Czech Republic.",xmorj12@vse.cz,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,5,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA & PRAZE,PRAHA 3,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAHA 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2094-0,,,,2015,,,,,,,233,237,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5NF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389582500040,0

This principle means that, at the balance sheet day the entity takes into account the expected risks and losses related to assets and liabilities; and that are known at the balance sheet date. The expected risks and losses are reflected in the accounting through provisions and adjusting entries. The adjusting entries are created when the transitional impairment of assets takes place. The paper deals with the issue of creation of adjusting entries for receivables in the Slovak enterprises in terms of taxation and accounting. The adjusting entries for receivables must be created if it is reasonable to assume that the debtor is unable to pay the full amount or part of it.

Special attention is given to differences between bachelors and masters. It is found that in many countries, master's degree decreases job satisfaction. Moreover, it never increases the job satisfaction of female employees. Masters are more sensitive than bachelors to career opportunities, variety in work and whether learning is required in the job; while bachelors are more sensitive to the risk of moving to a less interesting job and monetary compensation. Overeducation generally does not affect the job satisfaction of bachelors, but strongly decreases that of masters. The results also show that the most important groups of job-related factors influencing job satisfaction, in the order of importance, are (1) content, (2) risks and (3) compensation. Support activities (help from co-workers and ability to manage own working time) are also important for job satisfaction, as they allow to mitigate stressful situations. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Specifically, agribusiness firms hold cash to quickly execute growth opportunities and limit transaction costs of acquiring capital for growth. Furthermore, a subset of cash-rich agribusiness firms, which concentrates 78.5% of the aggregate cash and 49% of total revenues, is analyzed with a logit model. Results of cash-rich agribusiness deviate from predictions by the precautionary theory.

There is a strong necessity to improve economic performance of farms in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the need for introduction of new ICT in farming and farm management has rapidly increased nowadays. ICT is also one of the key enablers for agribusiness. In farming, ICT directly supports operational agricultural activities and it can also serve as an interactive and flexible tool for monitoring the progress of the farm economic performance. The analysis of current state of ICT and information needs among Czech farms was based on questionnaire survey. We obtained 165 correctly filled answers from agricultural producers. Survey results are presented with descriptive statistics, frequency tables and correlation analysis at the given level of significance alpha=0.05. The results show that with 95 % probability: 1) The level of information needs is related to current state of the art of ICT, new technologies and DSS at the farm, 2) Czech farms on average use advanced ICT and information systems, and 3) The farmer's decision making is not strongly facilitated through ICT.","[Tyrychtr, Jan; Ulman, Milos; Vasilenko, Alexandr] CULS Prague, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; CULS Prague, Dept Syst Engn, Fac Econ & Management, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Tyrychtr, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Dept Informat Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",tyrychtr@pef.czu.cz,", Alexandr/AAG-6944-2019; Goev, Aleksandr/ABC-9399-2021; Ulman, Milos/F-4374-2017; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/H-8249-2018; Tyrychtr, Jan/A-1873-2017",", Alexandr/0000-0002-8108-5637; Ulman, Milos/0000-0001-9556-7672; Vostrovsky, Vaclav/0000-0003-4228-0859; Tyrychtr, Jan/0000-0001-9952-2180",,,,,10,2,2,0,6,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,487,494,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600056,0

How well an actual investment portfolio performs depends on the future evolution of economic and financial variables such as interest rates, asset returns and inflation rates. The future evolution of these risk drivers is traditionally modelled using time series models, and it is assumed that historical data are relevant for assessing future risk and return. However, opinions vary about the extent to which all forward-looking information can be derived from historical data. Consequently, a framework for combining views and model-based (density) forecasts is indispensable. We present a concrete example of how views can consistently be combined with model-based (density) forecasts and how this affects investment decisions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The increase in online shopping also affect the use of digital coupon. To date, there have not been many studies to investigate the influence of digital coupon use in Malaysia. It is the aim of this study to investigate the factors that influence the use of digital coupon among University students in Kuala Lumpur. A survey method was adopted in this study. A structured questionnaire was developed and used in the data collection. The questionnaires were distributed among students of an International University in Kuala Lumpur. A total of 392 respondents participated in this survey. The findings from the regression analysis showed that all the independent variables explained 50 percent of the variance in intention to use digital coupon. Attitude is the strongest predictor and followed by subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. All the relationships were tested significant at 99 percent significant level. Theoretically, this study lends support to the theory of planned behavior in explaining intention to use digital coupon. From the managerial perspectives, marketing managers should device necessary strategies and tactics to create adequate awareness and convey effective messages about the benefits of digital coupon to consumers so that positive attitude could be developed into actual usage of digital coupon. Thus, the resources used for this type of sales promotion will be converted into an actual increase in sales and profitability for the companies. (C) 2015 The Authors.

An adjusted least-squares algorithm is then utilized to determine the optimal exercising strategy.

The research objectives are mainly devoted to quantitative and qualitative assessments of the current and long run challenges of the external debt sustainability faced by Romania. The results of the study highlight inter-conditional ties between short-term and medium long term debt, public and private debt, internal and external public debt. The increase in the long-term external debt stock (more than two times during 2007-2013) led to a significant rise in the related annual service (17.8% of GDP in 2013), deteriorating the financial framework of Romania and the growth perspectives. Excessive levels of the external debt and critical debt-to-GDP ratio are recorded in the case of Romania as compared to international standards. Despite large external borrowings, due to the lack of their efficiency, the results in terms of economic development are much below expectations. The easiness of recursion to external borrowings by the government and the debt rollover year by year contravene to intergenerational ethics.

Our studies have shown that: (1) In Chinese private enterprises, the pyramid structure and the ultimate controller is widespread. The ultimate controller tends to increase the number of levels in the vertical direction and the number of chains in the horizontal direction of the pyramid to promote the complexity of pyramid structure on the spatial structure degree and increase the degree of separation of ownership. (2) Other shareholders can inhibit the the ultimate controller's behavior to reduce the separation of control right and cash flow right. (3) The higher the degree of separation of ownership is, the more easily can the ultimate controller increase encroachment on other shareholders' interests through the complex of pyramid structure and advantages on equity.

In particular, a single industry is divided into a number of market segments, each characterized by a different degree of horizontal product differentiation. Such a setup allows us to explain, within a single theoretical framework, the non-linear relations between firm productivity, size and exporting behavior that have been documented by the empirical literature. The theoretical results are tested empirically by examining the performance of French wine producers operating in market segments characterized by different levels of horizontal product differentiation. Such segments are identified using the official classification of French wines based upon the controlled denomination of origin, i.e., the Appellation d'Origine Controlee (AOC) system.","[Altomonte, Carlo; Colantone, Italo] Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy; [Pennings, Enrico] Erasmus Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Bocconi University; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Altomonte, C (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Dept Policy Anal & Publ Management, Milan, Italy.",carlo.altomonte@unibocconi.it; italo.colantone@unibocconi.it; pennings@ese.eur.nl,,"COLANTONE, ITALO/0000-0001-7609-6131; ALTOMONTE, CARLO/0000-0001-9351-5078; Pennings, Enrico/0000-0003-1403-9857",,,,,46,4,4,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-1821,1467-6451,,J IND ECON,J.

Working with a sample of 67 presidential and parliamentary democracies between 1975 and 2012, we find that the growth rate of nominal public investment is higher at the beginning of electoral cycles and decelerates thereafter. The peak in public investment growth occurs 28 months before elections, and each month closer to the next election the growth rate of public investment declines by 0.7 percentage points. Other political variables, such as cabinet ideology and government fragmentation have less influence on short-term public investment dynamics. Fiscal rules and stronger institutions seem to attenuate the impact of elections on investment, but available information is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. These results are robust to a number of controls, including for fixed elections.","[Gupta, Sanjeev; Liu, Estelle X.; Mulas-Granados, Carlos] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Gupta, S (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",sgupta@imf.org,,,,,,,65,20,23,1,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

We identify the effect of subsidy receipt by exploiting geographic variation in the distance that families must travel from home to reach the nearest social service agency that administers the subsidy application process. Using data from the Kindergarten cohort of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, our instrumental variables estimates suggest that children receiving subsidized child care in the year before kindergarten score lower on tests of cognitive ability and reveal more behavior problems throughout kindergarten. An auxiliary analysis of longer-run outcomes shows that these negative effects largely disappear by the time children finish first grade.

Our empirical results using a dataset that is primarily based on a survey that we designed show that inside bank premiums are economically significant with an average of 68-71 basis points for short-term loans. The subsample regressions show that these premiums are more likely to result from the provision of implicit insurance or flexibility in renegotiation by the inside bank and that they are more significant for firms whose inside banks are larger, those with a lower capital to asset ratio, or those in more concentrated loan markets.

This article examines how provincial tax policies respond to changes in resource revenues. Specifically, it (a) estimates the tax-resource elasticity of Canadian provinces and (b) measures the resource sector's contribution to the volatility of provincial gross domestic product (GDP). Empirical results suggest that a $1,000 decrease in per capita resource revenue leads to a 150 basis point increase in a province's marginal personal income tax rate and a 3 percent increase in excise taxes on gasoline. A variance decomposition demonstrates that resource-induced volatility accounts for 76.2, 50.8, and 42.1 percent of the variance of the first-differenced GDP of, respectively, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, and Saskatchewan.","[Schaufele, Brandon] Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Schaufele, B (通讯作者)，Western Univ, Ivey Business Sch, London, ON, Canada.",,,"Schaufele, Brandon/0000-0003-1281-141X",Ivey Energy Management and Policy Center,Ivey Energy Management and Policy Center,"Helpful comments and suggestions were provided by Paul Boothe, Adam Fremeth, and Isaac Holloway.

A robust estimate of extreme loss is vital, especially for mining companies to mitigate risk and uncertainty in metal price fluctuations. This paper examines the Value-at-Risk and statistical properties in daily price return of precious metals, which include gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, from January 11, 2000 to September 9, 2016. An advanced two stage approach which combines GARCH-type models with extreme value theory is implemented. In the first stage, the conditional variance is modeled by different rolling univariate GARCH-type models (GARCH, EGARCH and TGARCH) under the GED error assumption in the returns of precious metal markets and compare the same with other well-known models. In the second stage, extreme value approach is applied to capture the tail behavior of distribution for the extracted standardized residuals. In comparison with the dynamic VaRs of these precious metals, we find that gold has the most steady and the highest VaRs, followed by platinum and silver; on the other hand our results show that palladium has the most volatile VaRs. The backtesting result confirms that our approach is an adequate method in improving risk management assessments and hedging strategies in the high volatile metal markets.","[Zhang, Zijing; Zhang, Hong-Kun] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Math & Stat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Zhang, ZJ (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Math & Stat, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",zzhang@math.umass.edu; hongkun@math.umass.edu,"Zhang, Hong-Kun/AAQ-4481-2020","Zhang, Hong-Kun/0000-0002-6367-2416",NSF [DMS-1151762]; Simons Foundation [337646]; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien [1151762] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Simons Foundation; Division Of Mathematical Sciences; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"H.Z. is supported in part by NSF grant DMS-1151762, as well as a grant from the Simons Foundation (337646).

The research was performed through a system of tourism indicators applied in the Romanian regions, obtained from the National Institute of Statistics. This comparative analysis was carried out using the statistical method called ANOVA and the Post Hoc - Games-Howell test. In order to achieve the objective, our study implied the analysis of several relevant indicators for tourism: the accommodation capacity, the number of arrivals, the number of overnight stays, the length of stay and the net use of accommodation capacity index. Processing the data related to a period of twenty-five years, the analysis allowed to draw conclusions about the existence of differences between the values of indicators across regions. The comparative analysis of the available data reflected a number of differences between the North East region and the other regions of Romania, the North East region recording lower values for the analyzed indicators, while South East and Central regions hold significantly higher values than the other regions, for the majority of indicators.","[Arionesei, Gabriela; Hapenciuc, Cristian-Valentin; Costea, Mihai] Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania",Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Arionesei, G (通讯作者)，Stefan Cel Mare Univ Suceava, Suceava, Romania.",gabriela.arionesei@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,4,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,798,814,,,,,,17,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700006,0

In the presence of credit-transaction cost shocks, a bank that issues credit can face a liquidity shortfall as its ex-ante reserves fall short of liquidity demand. In equilibrium, credit payments and collections by a bank are balanced with each other and hence bank's ex post reserve holdings crucially depend on the demand for cash. The likelihood of a liquidity shortfall increases with credit-transaction costs due to larger cash withdrawals. When the government increases money growth, both the demand for cash and the likelihood of a liquidity shortfall increase. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thus, in recent years we are witnessing the rise of a cultural trend. Slow Food. Slow Food has become an international movement that advocates for satisfying culinary pleasure, protects biological and cultural diversity, spread taste education, links green producers to consumers and believes that gastronomy intersects with politics, agriculture and ecology. Slow Food proposes a holistic approach to food problem, where the economic, sociocultural and environmental aspects are interlinked, being pursued as part of an overall strategy. In order to highlight the manner in which the principles of this cultural trend are perceived by the representatives of the new generation of consumers in Romania, exploratory research marketing was conducted among the students in the second year of the master's program Quality Management, Expertise and Consumer Protection, from the Faculty of Business and Tourism from the Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The results of this research have shown an insufficient knowledge of Slow Food phenomenon and, especially, the Slow Food network activity in Romania. To show that the Slow Food type of food is a healthier option towards which the future consumer demand should be guided, especially those belonging to the younger generation, an antithetical comparative analysis of the nutritional value of two menus was performed: a suggestive one for the Slow Food feeding style and other one, specific to the fast food style. Slow Food style was considered antithetical to the fast food because many previous studies have shown a preference of the young for the fast-food type products, despite the nutritional imbalance they generate. Comparative analysis of nutrition was produced by using the coverage degree method and the results have shown that the Slow Food type menu is a balanced food option. Given the issues that we highlighted, this paper can be a reference point in our endeavor to increase the awareness of the Romanian young people regarding the need to create a sustainable food system, in economic, environmental and socio-cultural point of view, as well as their orienting towards natural and healthy food options.","[Voinea, Lelia; Atanase, Anca; Schileru, Ion] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Atanase, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",atanase@com.ase.ro,"Voinea, Lelia/AAD-5088-2019; Atanase, Anca/AAP-6027-2021","Voinea, Lelia/0000-0002-6164-426X; Atanase, Anca/0000-0002-4400-9344",,,,,23,7,7,3,55,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",1582-9146,2247-9104,,AMFITEATRU ECON,Amfiteatru Econ.,NOV,2016,18.0,,,,10,,847,861,,,,,,15,Business; Economics; Management,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388624700009,0

For the estimation we combine US bank balance sheet data from the Call reports with macroeconomic aggregates over the period from 1984Q1 to 2007Q3. We find that banks' financing costs mainly respond to monetary policy and aggregate demand shocks. Furthermore, funding costs of undercapitalized and illiquid banks increase more strongly after a contractionary monetary policy shock as compared to better capitalized and more liquid banks. These results provide support for the view that banks' financing costs represent an important element of the bank lending channel. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Employing a regression discontinuity (hereafter RD) design to a primary longitudinal survey, this article overcomes challenges in the literature that households eligible for pension payment might be systematically different from ineligible households and that it is difficult to separate the effect of pension from that of age or cohort heterogeneity.

This article presents a unified picture of mirroring in terms of theory, evidence, and exceptions. First, we formally define mirroring and argue that it is an approach to technical problem-solving that conserves scarce cognitive resources. We then review 142 empirical studies, divided by organizational form into (i) industry studies, (ii) firm studies, and (iii) studies of open collaborative projects. The industry and firm studies indicate that mirroring is a prevalent pattern but not universal. However, in technologically dynamic industries, partial mirroring, where knowledge boundaries are drawn more broadly than operational boundaries, is likely to be a superior strategy. Firms can also strategically 'break the mirror' by implementing modular partitions within their boundaries, or by building relational contracts across their boundaries. Finally, studies of open collaborative projects, most of which focused on software, were not supportive of the hypothesis. We argue that digital technologies make possible new modes of coordination that enable groups to deviate from classical mirroring as seen in firms.","[Colfer, Lyra J.] Broadway Technol, 5000 Plaza Lake, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Baldwin, Carliss Y.] Harvard Sch Business, Baker Lib 341, Boston, MA 02163 USA",Harvard University,"Baldwin, CY (通讯作者)，Harvard Sch Business, Baker Lib 341, Boston, MA 02163 USA.",lcolfer@broadwaytechnology.com; cbaldwin@hbs.edu,,,HBS Division of Research and Doctoral Programs,HBS Division of Research and Doctoral Programs,"An earlier version of this article appeared as a chapter in the first author's doctoral dissertation, Three essays on the structure of technical collaboration.

In recent years, however, the numbers of small-scale growers have declined precipitously. This paper argues that the relationship between the rise and fall of SSG production and the industry's governing regulatory structure is closer than usually appreciated. The emergence of SSG production in the late 1970s and the 1980s can be traced to industry-subsidized initiatives, disguised as small-scale credit, to bring commercially inalienable Bantustan land into cane production with strong miller oversight. From the late 1980s to 1990s, however, the elimination of these subsidies encouraged millers to subcontract support to farmers, while simultaneously instigating an increase in SSG numbers by removing restrictions on grower registration. Although low rainfall is a central proximal factor in the rapid decline of the SSGs in the 2000s, their rapid increase was structurally fragile.","[Dubb, Alex] Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa",University of the Western Cape,"Dubb, A (通讯作者)，Univ Western Cape, Inst Poverty Land & Agr Studies PLAAS, Private Bag X17, ZA-7535 Bellville, South Africa.",adubb@plaas.org.za,"Dubb, Alex/N-7045-2019","Dubb, Alex/0000-0003-3625-1322",,,,,88,9,12,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

We shed further light on the discussion of such behavioral tax perception biases by analyzing intrinsic and extrinsic effects on investment decisions. We study two dimensions: (1) the influence of emotions and perceived risk (individual dimension, intrinsic effects) and (2) the influence of available tax information by varying tax complexity and salience (tax system dimension, extrinsic effects). In our laboratory experiment, we construct the payoff structure such that the subjects are confronted with exactly the same choices in net terms in a situation with or without a capital gains tax. This design allows us to identify pure tax perception biases. We show that both dimensions are able to explain tax perception biases. In particular, we find evidence that perceived risk is lower and consequently willingness to take risk is higher with a capital gains tax (with full loss offset provision) than without taxation. Furthermore, this positive effect on risky investment is higher in a situation with a rather low level of tax information in which tax complexity is high and tax salience is low.

Yet, the entrepreneurial university may not always capture the full gains made by the broader economy due to opportunistic behavior by its faculty scientists. We expand agency theory to address conditions when opportunistic behavior persists in the face of substantial information symmetry and where principals appear to tolerate opportunism despite the authority to sanction their agents. Using a sample of 105 US research universities and 73,603 scientists, we demonstrate that some scientists privately leak discoveries invented while working for their universities. Counter to prior prediction, we find that universities acting as principals often do not retaliate even when having knowledge of such opportunistic behavior and the capability to punish non-complying agents. To extend theory, we examined contexts that exacerbate and alleviate such overt opportunism: High-value discoveries and sizable entrepreneurial activity are associated with greater opportunistic behavior, whereas efforts to empower those who have close professional ties with scientists-their departments and technology commercialization offices-are related to reduced opportunism. To complement our empirical analyses, we provide a stylized mathematical model that shows how agency theory can improve its predictive power once it formally recognizes certain conditions under which agents wield substantial bargaining power over their principals, who in turn seem to tolerate agents' overt opportunistic behavior.","[Gianiodis, Peter T.] Duquesne Univ, Palumbo Donahue Sch Business, 600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA; [Markman, Gideon D.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Management, 218 Rockwell Hall, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Panagopoulos, Andreas] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Gallos Campus, Rethimnon 74100, Crete, Greece",Duquesne University; Colorado State University; University of Crete,"Gianiodis, PT (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Palumbo Donahue Sch Business, 600 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15282 USA.",gianiodis@duq.edu; gideon.markman@colostate.edu; andreas.panagopoulos@gmail.com,"Markman, Gideon/B-7494-2019",,,,,,79,38,38,3,82,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We employ quantile regression to determine whether the effects of personality vary at different levels of the conditional distribution of wealth. Results reveal that the personality characteristics of the financial respondent to the survey are more strongly associated with wealth than those of the non-financial respondent. Specifically, we find that emotional stability and extraversion are positively associated with wealth at the household level among spousal pairs. We also find that conscientiousness is positively associated with wealth, but the relationship is only significant at the lower end of the wealth continuum. In general, agreeableness and openness are negatively associated with wealth although the relationships are non-significant. These findings indicate that personality is an important factor shaping individuals' consumption preferences and financial decision-making behaviour over the life-course. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

An optimal control bioeconomic model is developed and optimized for native oysters in the Chesapeake Bay, US, that incorporates two positive externalities generated by oyster stocks: nutrient removal and provision of habitat for other benthic species. The model incorporates four management regimes that currently exist in the Bay: public grounds that are continuously harvested, aquaculture on leased grounds, sanctuaries that are never harvested, and reserves that are periodically pulse harvested. We find that if harvest effort in public grounds can be controlled, then that management regime unambiguously provides the highest social welfare. However, if harvest effort in public grounds cannot be controlled, then reserves provide the highest social welfare. Sanctuaries are part of the optimal mix of regimes only when harvest effort on public grounds cannot be controlled and a pulsed harvest is not feasible.","[Mykoniatis, Nikolaos] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Maritime Adm, Galveston Campus 200 Seawolf Pkwy,POB 1675, Galveston, TX 77553 USA; [Ready, Richard] Montana State Univ, Dept Agr Econ & Econ, Bozeman, MT 59715 USA",Texas A&M University System; Montana State University System; Montana State University Bozeman,"Mykoniatis, N (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Maritime Adm, Galveston Campus 200 Seawolf Pkwy,POB 1675, Galveston, TX 77553 USA.",mykonian@tamug.edu,,,Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities [1443108] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Office Of The Director; Office of Integrative Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD)NSF - Office of Integrative Activities (OIA)),,,68,6,6,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We focus on the number of analysts following a firm and several properties that characterize analysts' earnings forecasts for the upcoming annual earnings. We find firms that disclose monthly earnings attract more analysts, have more accurate and less dispersed analyst earnings forecasts, and have lower overall uncertainty and less commonality of information in analysts' earnings forecasts. In addition, the effect of monthly earnings disclosure on analyst behavior is more pronounced for the firms that regularly disclose monthly earnings. Our results are consistent with the notion that an important role played by a voluntary increase in reporting frequency is to trigger the generation of idiosyncratic information by financial analysts. In other words, analysts tend to complement rather than substitute for firm-provided voluntary disclosures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, we investigate whether individuals targeted by mandatory air quality warnings respond by reducing time spent in proscribed activities-the most important of which are outdoor activities that raise breathing and heart rates-thereby mitigating the health effects of pollutants on high-pollution days. We find that individuals engage in averting behavior on alert days by reducing the time they spend in vigorous outdoor activities by 18 % or 21 min on average. We find differential responses to alerts, with the largest responses amongst the elderly.","[Ward, Alison L.

We show that the optimal requirements take different forms in the short and long run. In either case, imposing the risk-weighted capital requirement without considering the incentives of the bank to misreport its risk profile is never optimal by itself. In the long run, the optimal requirements take the form of a leverage ratio requirement on top of the risk-weighted capital requirement. The add-on leverage ratio requirement, which serves as a compensation for the limited supervisory power of the regulators, should be set such that the risk-taking behavior of the bank is unchanged from the situation in which the regulator uses the risk-weighted capital requirement alone, and the misreporting incentive of the bank is eliminated by the add-on leverage ratio requirement.","[Wu, Ho-Mou] CEIBS, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wu, Ho-Mou] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yue] China Finance 40 Forum, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Yue] Peoples Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Europe International Business School; Peking University; People's Bank of China,"Wu, HM (通讯作者)，CEIBS, Shanghai, Peoples R China.;Wu, HM (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,"Wu, Homou/HJH-9499-2023",,,,,,35,7,8,0,14,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1572-3097,1573-692X,,REV FINANC,Rev.

We establish the time series properties of the models, including conditions for stationarity and existence of moments. These results are in turn used in the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the maximum likelihood estimators of the models. The PARX class of models is used to analyze the time series properties of monthly corporate defaults in the US in the period 1982-2011 using financial and economic variables as exogenous covariates. Results show that our model is able to capture the time series dynamics of corporate defaults well, including the well-known default counts clustering found in data. Moreover, we find that while in general current defaults do indeed affect the probability of other firms defaulting in the future, in recent years economic and financial factors at the macro level are capable to explain a large portion of the correlation of US firm defaults over time.

We document the life-cycle profile, concentration and persistence of this expenditure using claims data covering both curative and long-term care expenses for the full Dutch population. Spending on health care is strongly concentrated: the 1 per cent of individuals with the highest levels of expenditure account for one-quarter of the aggregate in any one year. Averaged over three years, the top 1 per cent still account for more than a fifth of the total, indicating a very high degree of persistence in the largest expenses. Spending on long-term care, which amounts to one-third of all expenditure on health care, is even more concentrated: the top 1 per cent account for more than half of total spending on this type of care. Average expenditure rises steeply with age and even more so with proximity to death. Spending on individuals in their last year of life absorbs one-tenth of aggregate health care expenditure. In a given year, spending on health care is highly skewed toward individuals with lower incomes. Average expenditure on the poorest fifth is more than three times that on the richest fifth.","[Bakx, Pieter] EUR, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [O'Donnell, Owen] EUR, ESE, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [O'Donnell, Owen; van Doorslaer, Eddy] TI, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [O'Donnell, Owen] Univ Macedonia, Thessaloniki, Greece; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Doorslaer, Eddy] ESE, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; University of Macedonia,"Bakx, P (通讯作者)，EUR, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",bakx@bmg.eur.nl; odonnell@ese.eur.nl; vandoorslaer@ese.eur.nl,"; O'Donnell, Owen/C-1732-2015","van Doorslaer, Eddy/0000-0003-2692-1433; Bakx, Pieter/0000-0001-7749-3091; O'Donnell, Owen/0000-0002-6289-1924",Netspar grant on 'Optimal Saving and Insurance for Old Age: The Role of Public Long-Term Care Insurance',Netspar grant on 'Optimal Saving and Insurance for Old Age: The Role of Public Long-Term Care Insurance',The authors thank two referees and Eric French for helpful comments on a previous version.

We estimate utility-specific price elasticities for use in the welfare analysis, which are derived from a demand estimation based on a panel data set of 37 California water utilities. Welfare losses for an annual disruption range from an average of $1,458 per acre-foot of shortage for a 10% supply disruption to an average of $3,426 per acre-foot of shortage for a 30% supply disruption.

In this paper we develop a theoretical model of property tax reform to decompose potential impacts of property tax reform in China. Then we used the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data to conduct a microsimulation model to examine potential impacts and incidences of alternative property tax designs in China. Our analyses suggest that a uniform property tax policy would bring substantially heterogeneous impacts across different income groups as well as different regions, mainly due to the differences in income distribution, housing prices and the degree of the Housing Demolition program. In terms of property tax incidence, our simulation suggests that utilizing tax revenue on the poor's public housing subsidy may mitigate the regressivity; in some case may even increase the overall social welfare. Finally, we use the cross-sectional information in the Chinese Family Panel Survey (CFPS) data to simulate for optimal tax scenarios for each region. Our microsimulation results provide some initial quantitative analysis in the literature and may shed some light on understanding the impacts of future property tax reform in China.

Using a unique database of quotes, we show this is not the case. Prices are less sensitive to changes in rates than expected, and responses are asymmetric. Prices react more rapidly and with greater sensitivity to an increase than to a decrease in rates. The results are robust, but there is a small degree of heterogeneity in the responses of different insurance companies. When rates increase, larger firms are slightly quicker to improve prices. The opposite is true when rates decline.

One plan eliminates the corporate tax and taxes dividends and the annual change in the value of publicly traded financial assets at ordinary rates. The second integrates corporate and shareholder taxes. The third lowers the corporate tax rate to 15 percent and taxes dividends and capital gains as ordinary income. To prevent large reductions in capital gains realizations and dividend payouts, an interest charge on taxes deferred during the holding period would be imposed when an asset is sold. We conclude that the third alternative is more robust than the other two.","[Grubert, Harry] US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA; [Altshuler, Rosanne] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Econ, New Brunswick, NJ USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Grubert, H (通讯作者)，US Dept Treasury, Off Tax Anal, Washington, DC 20226 USA.",harry.grubert@treasury.gov; altshule@rci.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,24,13,13,5,33,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

Day-ahead auctions are no longer done separately and available interconnector capacity is not always auctioned independently from electricity. Instead, interconnector capacity is implicitly auctioned in the day-ahead auction of electricity such that price differences between market areas are minimized, respectively overall welfare is maximized. The latest cornerstone in this evolution of the European electricity market is the so called North-Western European Market Coupling (NWE) which is online since February 4, 2014. For market participants, such a change in the structure of the market naturally leads to the question of how to model prices in the affected market areas. Particularly, if positions in more than one market area exist, it becomes crucial for risk and portfolio management to model electricity prices in all areas consistently in one integrated framework. In order to construct a model suitable for these tasks, we extend the class of structural or hybrid models, which were introduced by Carmona et. al. (2013) and Aid et. al (2013), to a multi -market framework. We derive analytical formulae for the distribution of spot prices, for futures prices, and for plain vanilla options. We also calibrate the model to the French-German market area and study the effect of market coupling on electricity prices and the value of power plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Historical stock market behavior and recent empirical experience have led economists and policy makers to acknowledge that price bubbles in financial markets do occur and need to be accounted for in risk analysis. New econometric tools for analyzing mildly explosive behavior (Phillips and Magdalinos, 2007; Phillips et al., 2011) have made it possible to detect the presence of bubbles in data and to date stamp their origination and collapse, providing empirical confirmation of such episodes in recent data. The potential for price bubbles and market collapse provides another source of stock market risk and adds to the risk premium. We provide an analytic and empirical investigation of this additional risk factor. The standard present value model is extended to allow for possible price bubbles and the effects of integrating bubble behavior into a consumption-based asset pricing model are analyzed. The theory involves attention to the investor time horizon and a study of the validity of conventional log linear approximations in the presence of nonstationary and mildly explosive data. Finite decision horizons accommodate myopic investors and are a component of speculative behavior that focuses on short run market gains rather than long run effects of fundamentals. An econometric approach to estimate bubble risk effects is developed and the methods are applied to composite stock market index data, giving new model-based equity premium and market volatility estimates that more closely match the data than traditional consumption based asset pricing models.

Tail risk dependencies and systemic risk contributions are estimated using a penalized two-stage fixed-effects quantile approach, which explicitly links time-varying interconnectedness to systemic risk contributions. For the purposes of surveillance and regulation of financial systems, network dependencies in extreme risks are more relevant than simple (mean) correlations. Thus, the framework provides a tool for supervisors, reflecting the market's view of tail dependences and systemic risk contributions. The model is applied to a system of 51 large European banks and 17 sovereigns during the period from 2006 through 2013, utilizing both equity and CDS prices. We provide new evidence on how banking sector fragmentation and sovereign-bank linkages evolved over the European sovereign debt crisis, and how they are reflected in estimated network statistics and systemic risk measures.

Hirschman; The principle of the Hiding Hand; Ignorance; Behavioral economics; Management; Development,PUBLIC-WORKS PROJECTS; APPRAISAL; PROGRAM,"Albert O. Hirschman's principle of the Hiding Hand stands stronger and more celebrated today than ever. The principle states that ignorance is good in planning, because if decision makers knew the real costs and difficulties of projects, few ventures would ever get started. The paper presents the first systematic test of the principle of the Hiding Hand, including a test of whether Hirschman's theory may be replicated with more and better data. This was found not to be the case. First, statistical tests reject the principle of the Hiding Hand at an overwhelmingly high level of significance (p < 0.0001). In reality, the exact opposite happens of what the principle states: instead of project success being secured by creative error and beneficial ignorance where higher-than-estimated costs are outweighed by even higher-than-estimated benefits the average project is in fact undermined by a double whammy of substantial cost overruns compounded by substantial benefit shortfalls. Second, Hirschman was found to have made the error of sampling on the dependent variable, undermining the validity of his findings. Third, Hirschman's sample of projects, on which he built his principle, is too small to support his wide conclusions. Fourth, Hirschman misrepresented his findings and misled his readers. In sum, the data do not support Hirschman's proposition that ignorance is good in planning. Ignorance is bad, if by bad we mean that ignorance leads to starting projects that should not have been started. Finally, the data also do not support an interpretation of Hirschman as an early behavioral economist, as proposed by Sunstein. Hirschman was a victim, not a student, of bias. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The degree of familiarity consumers have with a certain product has recently been suggested as a mediator of these evaluations, influencing both the number and the type of associations consumers hold with food and beverages. In this work, we extend previous results across multiple product categories, hereby generalizing the findings. Four consumer studies were conducted using fruit names (N = 246), white wine images (N = 112), chocolate bar images (N = 192), and kiwifruit images (N = 302) as test stimuli. In each study, consumers rated their perceived familiarity with each stimulus and evaluated the appropriateness of use in a range of situations relevant to the product category. Familiarity was confirmed as a moderator of appropriateness of use evaluations, and was positively linked to product versatility. Since familiarity is related to an individual's exposure to a product, this could indicate that consumers use past experience with a product as a heuristic for their appropriateness evaluations. The variance in appropriateness evaluations explained by familiarity alone was, however, limited, and product-context associations were also contingent upon specific product characteristics. Taken together, the four studies reported here confirm that product familiarity is related to usage versatility, and indicate that consumers may find it challenging to envisage how unfamiliar food products can be incorporated into their existing dietary practices.

Our calibrated dynamic life cycle portfolio choice model can account for such an apparently 'irrational' outcome, by incorporating the fact that investors must forgo acquiring job-specific skills when they spend time managing their money, and their efficiency in financial decision making varies with age. Resulting inertia patterns mesh well with findings from prior studies and our own empirical results from Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data. We also analyze how people optimally choose between actively managing their assets versus delegating the task to financial advisors. Delegation proves valuable to both the young and the old. Our calibrated model quantifies welfare gains from including investment time and money costs as well as delegation in a life cycle setting. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Stochastic viability ranks management strategies according to their probability to sustain economic and ecological outcomes over time. The approach is extended to build stochastic sustainable production possibility frontiers representing the trade-offs between sustainability objectives at any risk level, given the current state of the fishery. This framework is applied to a Chilean fishery faced with El Nio uncertainty. We study the viability of effort and quota strategies when catch and biomass levels have to be sustained. We show that (1) for these sustainability objectives, whatever the level of the outcomes to be sustained, quota-based management results in a better viability probability than effort-based management, and (2) the fishery's historical quota levels were not sustainable given the stock levels in the early 2000s.","[Martinet, Vincent] INRA, Econ Publ UMR210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France; [Pena-Torres, Julio] Pena & Sanchez Consultores Ltda, Peninsula 11296, Santiago, Chile; [De Lara, Michel] Univ Paris Est, Cermics, France; [Ramirez C, Hector] Univ Chile, Dept Ingn Matemat, Ctr Modelamiento Matemat, CNRS UMI 2807,FCFM, Santiago, Chile",Universite Paris Saclay; INRAE; Ecole des Ponts ParisTech; Universidad de Chile; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (INSMI),"Martinet, V (通讯作者)，INRA, Econ Publ UMR210, F-78850 Thiverval Grignon, France.",vincent.martinet@grignon.inra.fr; julioalept@gmail.com; delara@cermics.enpc.fr; hramirez@dim.uchile.cl,"Ramirez, Hector/A-2577-2010; Martinet, Vincent/X-4953-2019","Ramirez, Hector/0000-0002-6239-1890; Martinet, Vincent/0000-0002-7135-8849","CNRS; Conicyt-Chile; INRIA; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Conicyt-Chile, under ACT [10336]; FONDECYT [1110888]; BASAL Project (Centro de Modelamiento Matematico, Universidad de Chile); project BIONATURE of CIRIC, INRIA-Chile","CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Conicyt-Chile(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)); INRIA; French Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Conicyt-Chile, under ACT; FONDECYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); BASAL Project (Centro de Modelamiento Matematico, Universidad de Chile)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT PIA/BASAL); project BIONATURE of CIRIC, INRIA-Chile","We acknowledge financial support from the STIC-AmSud program (CNRS, Conicyt-Chile, INRIA and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs) for the international research framework MIFIMA (Mathematics, Informatics and Fisheries Management).

I show empirically that managers' compensation increases when fund assets grow, even when diseconomies of scale in fund performance exist. Thus, managers' compensation is maximized at a much larger fund size than is optimal for fund performance. However, to avoid capital outflows, managers are also motivated to restrict fund growth to maintain style-average performance. Similarly, fund management firms have incentives to collect more capital for all funds under management, including their flagship funds, even at the expense of fund performance.","[Yin, Chengdong] Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus,"Yin, CD (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Krannert Sch Management, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",,,,Krannert School of Management at Purdue University,Krannert School of Management at Purdue University,"Chengdong Yin is with the Krannert School of Management at Purdue University.

Using data on sea-surface temperature anomalies, the impacts of climate on the conservation and the welfare that can be extracted from the stock are investigated. Results indicate that an informed management policy leads to stock biomass and resource rents that are up to 2.7 and 2 times higher, respectively, than under an uninformed policy. Also, the fishery is open 54 % longer under the informed policy. The magnitude of these effects depends on the choice of the discount rate indicating that when the future is highly discounted gains from the informed policy dissipate.","[Baggio, Michele] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Baggio, Michele] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Connecticut; Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,"Baggio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA.;Baggio, M (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Inst Environm Decis, Zurich, Switzerland.",michele.baggio@uconn.edu,,,,,,,70,3,3,0,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

We show that cash-based operating profitability (a measure that excludes accruals) outperforms measures of profitability that include accruals. Further, cash-based operating profitability subsumes accruals in predicting the cross section of average returns. An investor can increase a strategy's Sharpe ratio more by adding just a cash-based operating profitability factor to the investment opportunity set than by adding both an accruals factor and a profitability factor that includes accruals.

In line with this research, and as a supplement to previous empirical research on child mobility, this article suggests that child mobility is not only implemented as response to shocks and poverty, but also ex-ante such situations. That is, it is assumed that when households perceive themselves to be at heightened risk of critical poverty or shock, the likelihood of child-relocation increases. The hypothesis is tested by looking at the statistical association between child mobility and household head risk perception, operationalized as his or her level of worry about not being able to provide the family with food in the upcoming 12 months. Data from 2,078 households with eligible children in rural Benin, 2012, are analyzed. In 2010, Benin was struck by a massive flood that affected almost half the sampled households. In the OLS presented, child mobility is regressed on poverty, being shocked by the 2010 floods, and risk understood as level of worry about the future food situation and a set of socioeconomic controls. Household head risk perception is systematically associated with child mobility, while poverty and shock are not. If future risk perception indeed also predicts high-risk child relocations, then predictable social safety nets should be an adequate policy response.

One of the most frequently claimed effects is that gender inequality in economic opportunities may increase with mining. This paper is the first multi-country quantitative analysis of the local employment impacts for men and women of large-scale mining in the African continent. Using exact mine locations, we merge survey data for 800,000 individuals with data on all mine openings and closings across the continent, which enables a highly localized analysis of spillover effects. We employ a geographic difference-in-difference estimation exploiting the spatial and temporal variation in mining. We show that industrial mine opening is a mixed blessing for women. It triggers a local structural shift, whereby women shift from agricultural self-employment (25% decrease) to the service sector (50% increase), and are 16% more likely to earn cash. However, overall female employment decreases by 8% as agriculture is a larger sector than services. Male partners shift to skilled manual labor, and some find jobs in the mining sector. The effects of mine openings diminish with distance and are close to zero at 50 km from a mine. Mine closure causes the service and skilled sectors to contract. The results are robust to a wide battery of robustness checks, such as using different measures of distance and excluding migrants from the sample. This paper shows that large-scale mining can stimulate nonagricultural sectors in Africa, although it creates local boom-bust economies with transient and gender-specific employment effects.

The results show long-run relationships for all countries, except for the UK where there is no cointegration between conventional and Islamic stock prices. These findings suggest that the Islamic finance industry in the considered economies (except the UK) does not seem to be compliant to Islamic law's maxims, which hinders portfolio managers and market participants to benefit from the opportunities of international diversification and hedging effectiveness. From the correlation perspective, there is evidence of weak linkages between the Indonesian market and the developed markets for both conventional and Islamic stock prices, thus suggesting that investors can diversify their portfolios at the international level to minimize risk. However, there is high connection between the developed markets for both conventional and Islamic indexes. In addition, for each economy, the Islamic index is found to be strongly linked with its conventional counterpart. The structural change analysis reveals common break dates for several cross correlations, thus reflecting the similar time-paths of the interactions between markets. The presence of breaks in the inter-market linkages has important implications for international investors as regards portfolio diversification benefits and for financial policy makers regarding contagion risks and market policies.

The first was the heated discussion begun over 40years ago around Nyerere's African socialism' and the failures of the ujamaa policy of villagization. The second is the still unsettled debate around programmes of redistributive land reform in South Africa. Bernstein's distinction between the peasantry and petty commodity production allowed him to apply Lenin's theory of peasant differentiation to new contexts, and to locate African class struggles within the contradictions between capital and labour. He thus disposed of two competing visions: the harmonic peasant community and the maximizing entrepreneurial peasant hindered by the absence of markets. Yet, this paper argues, his focus on class formation within the peasantry can also limit our understanding of class alliances in the politics of anti-capitalist struggles in Africa.","[O'laughlin, Bridget] ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"O'laughlin, B (通讯作者)，ISS, POB 29776, NL-2502 LT The Hague, Netherlands.",brolaughlin@iss.nl,,,,,,,104,11,12,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1471-0358,1471-0366,,J AGRAR CHANGE,J.

The paper proposes a new methodology to measure the extent of gender intrahousehold inequality and its contribution to overall levels of inequality using an L-Theil index decomposition. The individual and joint distribution of inequality in four key indicators of child wellbeing is analyzed: stunting, birth registration, school attendance, and time spent on work and chores (working hours) in the search for evidence of gender bias. Evidence from various separate county studies had shown that the direction of the gender bias is not universal. Such conclusion holds when using a consistent methodology and comparable cross-country datasets; this paper shows that disparities inside households do not follow the same bias toward one or the other gender in all countries and the direction of the bias is not the same across indicators of wellbeing. While progress in improving child wellbeing has occurred in many countries, inequalities remain. Intrahousehold inequalities might still be considered a priority in an agenda focused on closing these progress gaps. (C) 2016 The Author.

However, governments are usually strapped for capital investment funds, and there are planning and financing problems that either delay LRT and street tramway improvements and/or hinder their utilisation. During the past decade, rail developments have dominated Turkish urban and national transport policies: many new lines have been opened and others are under construction. Turkey now has eight cities with LRT or tramway lines (in addition to the three major cities of Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir). Based on analyses of unpublished data from transport master plans, and from interviews conducted with planning experts who worked on such master plans, and from political leaders, this paper assesses how effectively these smaller cities have planned and financed their LRT and trams, and how efficiently they are operated. How well Turkey performs with its urban LRT and tramway developments within the context of an international railway renaissance is also critically assessed. In Turkey, the PPP modality of financing (mostly in the form of BOT) is favoured for highway investment whereas many of the railway projects still require international loans. A greater role for the private sector in Turkey is recommended to reinforce this embryonic railway renaissance and to ensure greater operational and financial sustainability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a test for detecting situations when such pairwise measures are inadequate and give incomplete results. This occurs when a significant portion of the multivariate dependence structure in the tails is of higher dimension than 2. Our test statistic is based on a decomposition of the stable tail dependence function describing multivariate tail dependence. The asymptotic properties of the test are provided and a bootstrap-based finite sample version of the test is proposed. A simulation study documents good size and power properties of the test including settings with time-series components and factor models. In an application to stock indices for non-crisis times, pairwise tail models seem appropriate for global markets while the test finds them not admissible for the tightly interconnected European market. From 2007/2008 on, however, higher order dependencies generally increase and require a multivariate tail model in all cases.","[Bormann, Carsten] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Geb 20-12,Schlossbezirk 12, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany; Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands; Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands",Helmholtz Association; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Bormann, C (通讯作者)，Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Geb 20-12,Schlossbezirk 12, D-76128 Karlsruhe, Germany.",carsten.bormann@kit.edu,"Schaumburg, Julia/AAI-8747-2020; Schienle, Melanie/JCO-7980-2023; Schaumburg, Julia/AAK-8174-2020","Schienle, Melanie/0000-0001-6000-5653; Schaumburg, Julia/0000-0003-1832-0355","LUH; Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture; German Research Association; Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Universities of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; European Union Seventh Framework Programme [320270-SYRTO]; Dutch National Science Foundation [VENI451-15-022]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SCHI-1127]","LUH; Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture; German Research Association(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-Wurttemberg; Universities of the State of Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany; European Union Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Dutch National Science Foundation(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG))","We thank the Editor (Andrew Patton) and two anonymous referees for many helpful comments that substantially improved the article.

In line with the analysis by Kauppi and Widgren (2004) we test two alternative explanations: political power vs. needs view. To do so, we extend the original data set (1976-2001) up to 2012 and introduce alternative econometric specifications. We also put forward the nucleolus as a measure of political power in the distributive context. Our results demonstrate that both power and needs are important factors in explaining EU budget allocation. Political power matters, but not as much as previous studies have shown. We also conclude that the nucleolus is a good alternative to the Shapley-Shubik index which was used previously. Power is more balanced with needs under the specifications based on the nucleolus.

Stress in a district is defined as the difference between the desired interest rate of its representative and the actual policy rate implemented by the FOMC. I find that the degree of stress reflects the stance of the US monetary policy, a positive stress level in the 1990s (which corresponds to a policy rate higher than the desired rate of FOMC members), and a negative stress level from the 2000s (which corresponds to a policy rate lower than the desired rate of FOMC members). However, the economic and financial crisis exacerbated the degree of stress measure, suggesting an increase in monetary policy uncertainty among FOMC members from that time.","[Bennani, Hamza] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Bennani, H (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Paris, France.",,"Bennani, Hamza/AAF-6997-2021; Bennani, Hamza/AAA-7967-2022","Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897; Bennani, Hamza/0000-0002-0042-8897",,,,,87,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0036-9292,1467-9485,,SCOT J POLIT ECON,Scott.

The same applies to advanced economies like the United States and Western Europe. The paper accounts for measurement issues with regard to the night lights data and considers several extensions of the empirical model in order to analyze if and under which circumstances the relationship between night lights and GDP growth is stable.

Whereas market data is available describing sales trends, there is limited understanding of the experience of early adopters of e-bike technology. This paper investigates the motives for e-bike purchase, rider experience and perceived impact on mobility, health and wellbeing through in-depth interviews with e-bike owners in the Netherlands and the UK Findings revealed that the motive for purchasing e-bikes was often to allow maintenance of cycling against a backdrop of changing individual or household circumstances. E-bikes also provided new opportunities for people who would not otherwise consider conventional cycling. Perceptions of travel behaviour change revealed that e biking was replacing conventional cycling but was also replacing journeys that would have been made by car. There was also a perception that e-biking has increased, or at least allowed participants to maintain, some form of physical activity and had benefited personal wellbeing. Technological, social and environmental barriers to e-biking were identified. These included weight of bicycle, battery life, purchase price, social stigma and limitations of cycle infrastructure provision. Additional research is necessary to quantify actual levels of mode substitution and new journey generation among new e-bike owners and the impact of e-biking on promoting physical health and mental wellbeing.

As is well known, Italy exhibits an economic divide between its central-northern and southern regions. This paper tries to ascertain whether there is also a divide in the diffusion of crime.

This is a crucial issue for evaluating refinance programs as a form of loss mitigation, and it became prominent in the debates around the Treasury Department's Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). These debates exposed gaps in the literature on the relationship between credit performance and changes in borrowers' monthly mortgage payments. Since then, several new studies have attempted to fill these holes, each pursing a different methodology. In this paper, we review the relevant debates and look at what downward adjustments in prime adjustable-rate mortgages can tell us about modifications of prime fixed-rate mortgages. We argue that this method better addresses the various sampling biases that plague all attempts to predict HARP's impact. Our analysis indicates that typical monthly payment reductions under HARP would reduce credit losses by 56 basis points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We distinguish communication effects (the effects of group discussions and interactions) from aggregation effects (mere impact of the voting procedure), which makes it possible to better understand the complex dynamics of group decision making. In an experiment, both effects occurred for intellective tasks whereas there were only aggregation effects in judgmental tasks. Communication effects always led to more rational choices; aggregation effects did so sometimes but not always. Groups violated stochastic dominance less often than individuals did, which was due to both aggregation and communication effects. In the Allais paradox tasks, there were almost no communication effects, and aggregation effects made groups deviate more from expected utility than individuals.","[Baillon, Aurelien; Bleichrodt, Han; Liu, Ning; Wakker, Peter P.] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Wakker, PP (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",Wakker@ese.eur.nl,"Baillon, Aurélien/E-6961-2012","Baillon, Aurélien/0000-0002-0169-9760; Liu, Ning/0000-0002-5898-5493",Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO),Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)),"Gary Charness, Enrico Diecidue, Yoram Halevy, the editor W.

Our evidence paints a nuanced picture. SBOs underperform and destroy value for investors when they are made by buyers under pressure to spend. Investors then reduce their capital allocation to the firms doing those transactions. But not all SBOs are money-burning devices. SBOs made under no pressure to spend perform as well as other buyouts. When buyer and seller have complementary skill sets, SBOs outperform other buyouts. Investors do not pay higher total transaction costs as a result of SBOs, even if they have a stake in both the buying fund and the selling fund. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The various lines of re-thinking which have helped to reform the policy draw heavily on modern theories of entrepreneurship and innovation, and these insights have contributed significantly to many of the elements of new policy logic and framework. Yet, these ideas also derive both from worldwide, rather than EU-specific insights, and also from a wide range of academic fields.

We find that reputation-damaged VCs interact differently in the future with their limited partners, other VCs, and IPO underwriters because they are perceived as ineffective monitors.

Using several middle class measures and a dynamic panel estimator, we show that the 'middle class-driven modernization' hypothesis finds strong empirical support in the sample of developing countries excluding Eastern Europe and Central Asia, while the 'middle class-driven democratic domino' effect finds support in the sample of developing countries excluding East Asia and the Pacific.

Ronald",,,Reflections on the Probability Space Induced by Moment Conditions with Implications for Bayesian Inference,JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bayesian inference; moment functions; structural models,,"Often a structural model implies that certain moment functions expressed in terms of data and model parameters follow a distribution. An assertion that moment functions follow a distribution logically implies a distribution on the arguments of the moment functions. This fact would appear to permit Bayesian inference on model parameters. The classic example is an assertion that the sample mean centered at a parameter and scaled by its standard error has Student's t-distribution followed by an assertion that the sample mean plus and minus a critical value times the standard error is a Bayesian credibility interval for the parameter. This article studies the logic of such assertions. The main finding is that if the moment functions have one of the properties of a pivotal, then the assertion of a distribution on moment functions coupled with a proper prior does permit Bayesian inference. Without the semi-pivotal condition, the assertion of a distribution for moment functions either partially or completely specifies the prior. In this case, Bayesian inference may or may not be practicable depending on how much of the distribution of the constituents remains indeterminate after imposition of a noncontradictory prior. An asset pricing example that uses data from the U.S. economy illustrates the ideas.","[Gallant, A.

The behavioral life-cycle hypothesis indicates self-control is an important aspect of household saving behavior. This study investigated if household wealth creation from 1994 to 2008 could be predicted by self-control among a sample of young baby boomers using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) data. Variables that significantly predicted 2008 net worth included homeownership, 1994 net worth, income, bankruptcy filing, inheritance, education level, race, marital status, children, retirement planning activities, locus of control, and self-mastery. The addition of self-control predictors to a regression model improved the model's ability to predict net worth by 1.3 % above and beyond the human capital, financial status, and demographic predictor variables. In total, the model explained 60 % of the variance in net worth. Findings indicated that individuals who invested in their human capital, were homeowners, and had higher self-control, accumulated more wealth.","[Griesdorn, Tim S.] Univ Incarnate Word, H E B Sch Business, 4301 Broadway,CPO 325, San Antonio, TX 78209 USA; [Durband, Dorothy B.] Kansas State Univ, Coll Human Ecol, Sch Family Studies & Human Serv, 302 Justin Hall, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",University Incarnate Word; Kansas State University,"Griesdorn, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Incarnate Word, H E B Sch Business, 4301 Broadway,CPO 325, San Antonio, TX 78209 USA.",griesdor@uiwtx.edu; dottie@k-state.edu,"Griesdorn, Tim/AAS-2114-2020",,,,,,56,6,7,1,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1058-0476,1573-3475,,J FAM ECON ISS,J.

Such one-stop shopping creates complementarity between products, leading in turn to lower prices after a big store is formed but may also lead to an improvement in the bargaining position vis-a-vis producers through the creation of an inside option that small stores do not have. We find that big stores will not be formed when the stores' ex ante bargaining power vis-a-vis producers is high.

The objective is twofold: first is to measure the level of integration in these economies, and the second is to better understand some of the fundamental drivers of integration. Our results suggest that integration varies widely across the region. One of the major drivers of integration is economic development, as more advanced countries generally had higher levels of integration. Moreover, joining the European Union either exerted a positive boost or was neutral with regards to sovereign bond integration. Finally, integration changes over time; in particular, integration has decreased with the financial crisis, although the decrease leveled off relatively swiftly soon after. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the increase in global liquidity in terms of key international currencies, driven by unconventional monetary policies, has led some emerging economies to move toward inflation and unstable capital markets. This means that there could be a global divergence of inflation between advanced and emerging economies. This inflation divergence also appears between emerging economies. The emerging economies, distinguished by capital flow control or current account surplus, have little inflation pressure. We suggest that the global divergence of inflation is related to both domestic and international liquidity circulation velocities.

This paper examines if an expansion in the supply of public preschool crowds-out private enrollment using rich data for municipalities in Brazil from 2000 to 2006, where federal transfers to local governments change discontinuously with given population thresholds. Results from a regression-discontinuity design reveal that larger federal transfers lead to a significant expansion of local public preschool services, but show no evidence of crowding-out of private enrollment, nor of negative impacts on the quality of private providers. This finding is consistent with a theory in which households differ in willingness-to-pay for preschool services, and private suppliers optimally adjust prices in response to an expansion of lower-quality, free-of-charge public supply. In the context of the model, the absence of crowding-out effects of more public preschool providers can be rationalized by the existence of relatively large differences in willingness-to-pay for preschool services across different demand segments. Our theoretical and empirical findings therefore suggest that in developing country settings characterized by relatively high income inequality, an expansion in public preschool supply will likely significantly increase enrollment among the poorest segments of society, and need not have adverse effects on the quantity or quality of local private supply.

The developed model accounts for spatial competition of alternative workplaces via accessibility variables measured to attractions of both the same and different types. The new model also has two new refinements. First, a much finer geographical level is used for modelling worker's choice of workplace given the location of firms and the distribution of jobs. Second, an employment agglomeration effect is incorporated by the inclusion of jobs in the industry class relevant to the worker and two accessibility measures. Modelling analysis on data collected from a survey conducted in Sydney in 2013 identifies highly significant spatial competition and employment agglomeration effects explaining workplace choice. The application of this model to analyse policy relating to the redistribution or growth of jobs within a general framework of MetroScan is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mixed Messages from Indonesia,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,DECENTRALIZATION,"Central government line agencies in Indonesia spend a significant amount of their budgets directly in the regions, much of it on functions that have already been decentralised to local governments. Such deconcentrated spending contravenes both international best practices and Indonesian decentralisation legislation. Empirical evidence on the question of actual impact of such spending in Indonesia is mixed. The share of central deconcentrated spending that is co-administered directly with local governments appears to have beneficial service delivery effects; but the portion organised through provinces - without significant input from districts - has a negative impact on service outcomes.","[Lewis, Blane D.] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Lewis, BD (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, HC Coombs Bldg,Room 7132, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",blane.lewis@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,13,6,7,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

In two experiments, three realistic credit card statements were presented with different outstanding balances. Participants, who were randomly allocated to one of four information conditions depending on supplementary information provided on the statements, stated how much they would repay that month. They were then asked about concerns they would have about repayment difficulties if they had a fixed consumer loan over three years. In Study 1 the alternative two-year repayment anchor had a negative effect on percent repayment, whereas in Study 2 the nine-month repayment anchor had a significant positive effect, especially for those with higher future repayment concern. Also, in both studies, future repayment concern had a direct inverse effect on repayment decisions which partially mediated the effect of disposable income. It is concluded that the addition to credit card statements of a table of cost and duration information for a range of repayment amounts may usefully support repayment decisions.

All countries exhibit hyperbolic discounting patterns, i.e., the immediate future is discounted more than far future. We also observe higher heterogeneity for shorter time horizons, consistent with the pattern reviewed by Frederick, Loewenstein, and O'Donoghue (2002). Cultural factors as captured by the Hofstede cultural dimensions (Hofstede, 1991) contribute significantly to the variation of time discounting, even after controlling for economic factors, such as GDP, inflation rate and growth rate. In particular, higher levels of Uncertainty Avoidance are associated with stronger hyperbolic discounting, whereas higher degrees of Individualism and Long Term Orientation predict stronger tendency to wait for larger payoffs. We also find the waiting tendency is correlated with innovation, environmental protection, crediting rating, and body mass index at country level after controlling for county wealth. These results help us to enhance the understanding of differences across financial markets and economic behavior worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that remittances improve migrant families' access to agricultural land which - depending on the context - fosters more equitable local land distribution patterns or land concentration by migrant families. Changes in the political economy of the country also combine to stimulate these patterns, while remittances contribute to secure land rights held by migrant households. But even though migrant households are acquiring more land, the trend does not change the traditional pattern of land distribution in the country. Regarding forests, significant changes were not observed in two of the communities, while in one we observed forest decline and in the last, forest recovery. A trend away from reliance on the land for survival results in forest recovery.","[Aguilar-Stoen, Mariel] Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, SUM, N-0317 Oslo, Norway; [Taylor, Matthew] Univ Denver, Dept Geog & Environm, Denver, CO 80208 USA; [Castellanos, Edwin] Univ Valle Guatemala, Ctr Estudios & Ambient Biodiversidad, Guatemala City 01015, Guatemala",University of Oslo; University of Denver; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala,"Aguilar-Stoen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Ctr Dev & Environm, SUM, POB 116, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",m.c.a.stoen@sum.uio.no; mtaylor7@du.edu; ecastell@uvg.edu.gt,"Taylor, Matthew/HMP-1929-2023","Aguilar-Stoen, Mariel/0000-0001-8709-4713; Castellanos, Edwin/0000-0001-9775-0518",Norwegian Research Council [193710],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),"This paper is part of the project 'Migration and Land Use Change in Rural Guatemala and Mexico: Is There a Forest Transition?' - MIRLU, financed by the Norwegian Research Council, project number 193710.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC), these attempts involve a three-step process: (1) diagnose what went wrong, (2) design regulatory and supervisory reforms that address these defects, and (3) implement the corrective reforms. We argue that US efforts to enhance financial regulation and supervision have faltered along each of these three dimensions. In particular, we provide numerous examples demonstrating that US authorities misdiagnosed, or perhaps in some cases even willfully disregarded, the causes of the crisis both by overemphasizing factors that did not play decisive roles in causing the onset or severity of the crisis and by underemphasizing factors that did. To increase regulatory accountability and help prevent another financial crisis, we propose the creation of an agency that would have access to all of the information available to regulators and whose sole function would be to publish regular reports on the key systemic risks in the financial system, and assessments of the adequacy of regulators' responses.","[Barth, J.

We apply the model to (i) the Swiss pension fund market as a whole and (ii) an individual Swiss pension fund. With our new approach, we are able to show that the pension funds' recovery from the recent financial crisis took much longer than the value increase of the asset portfolios suggests.

We consider an overlapping generations, open economy model of secular stagnation, and examine the effect of capital flows on the transmission of stagnation. In a world with a low natural rate of interest, greater capital integration transmits recessions across countries as opposed to lower interest rates. In a global secular stagnation, expansionary fiscal policy carries positive spillovers implying gains from coordination, and fiscal policy is self-financing. Expansionary monetary policy, by contrast, is beggar-thy-neighbor with output gains in one country coming at the expense of the other.

The authors document duration dependence and show that it exists within nearly every demographic subgroup. Then, they examine the implications of duration dependence on unemployment duration, emphasizing that a uniform job-finding rate that does not incorporate duration dependence understates unemployment duration. Finally, they explore a composition-based approach to duration dependence, where they solve for the distribution of preexisting heterogeneity that is consistent with observed duration dependence. The authors look at how this distribution varies cyclically and, in particular, during the Great Recession. The largest changes occur at the low finding-rate tail of this distribution.

This research, which assesses the influence of European integration on the Mediterranean regional structure, shows that the European Neighbourhood Policy has failed in its aim to promote sub-regional integration among Maghreb countries. In order to check whether the ENP (2004) has been relevant for this objective, four indicators proposed by the EU for measuring its performance are tested, as well as the evolution of Maghreb economic relationship with its main European partners (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) since the Barcelona Process (1995). Following a hybrid approach that combines descriptive institutional analysis and statistical work (with data from UNCTAD and IMF databases), this research reveals that none of the objectives has been reached and that Maghreb trade path obeys to international trends rather than to the entry into force of the ENP framework. Indeed, instead of boosting welfare through South-South integration, the ENP fosters a hub&spokes structure that widens horizontal and vertical asymmetries.","[Fernandez, Fatima] Univ Hassan II Casablanca, Univ Santiago Compostela, Grp Anal & Modelizat Econ, Grp Int Econ & Dev, 13 Rue Ezzohour, Casablanca, Morocco",Hassan II University of Casablanca,"Fernández, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hassan II Casablanca, Univ Santiago Compostela, Grp Anal & Modelizat Econ, Grp Int Econ & Dev, 13 Rue Ezzohour, Casablanca, Morocco.",fatima.fernandez.fernandez@rai.usc.es,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,7,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

There is an increased interest in identifying the main factors that could predict organizational commitment and performance. The current study aims to examine the relationship between communication climate, work locus of control and various dimensions of organizational commitment such as affective, normative and continuance commitment. Communication climate in an organization is a key determinant of the effectiveness thereof as it refers to the emotional level of a relationship. In other words, it describes the way people feel about each other as they carry out their daily activities. Work locus of control refers to the extent to which people believe that they are in control of their lives, or to external factors such as chance and powerful others, who are responsible for the events that influence their lives. The organizational commitment is a manifest response to the work groups and the measure of employee attachment towards the organization. It is directly related to the turnover rates, absenteeism, tardiness and individual performance level, with significant impact on the organizational efficiency. The focus of our study is of the variables which are due to the direct impact on the behavior of an employee and on the orientation thereof towards commitment being concentrated on communication climate and generalized perceived control belief within the work groups. The study comprised 91 participants from both public and private sector organizations in Romania. The attendants were invited to answer the following questionnaires: Communication Climate Inventory (Costigan & Schmiedler, 2004), Work Locus of Control Scale (Spector, 1988) and Organizational Commitment (Meyer & Allen, 1997). The study has a cross-sectional and correlation layout, all questionnaires being self-reported. The correlation analysis revealed that locus of control showed a positive relationship with continuance commitment. The results further demonstrate that supportive climate has a significant negative correlation with affective commitment and normative commitment. The implications with regard to theoretical research and organizational practice are also discussed. If the management wishes to increase the organizational commitment, it is wise for it to pay particular attention to the individual particularities and context of the work groups.","[Gheorghe, Virgil] Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania",National University of Political Studies & Public Administration (SNSPA) - Romania,"Gheorghe, V (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Polit Studies & Publ Adm, 30A Expozitiei Blvd,Sect 1, Bucharest 012104, Romania.",gheorghe.virgil@student.comunicare.ro,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,11,TRITONIC PUBL HOUSE,BUCHAREST,"5, COACAZELOR ST, SECTOR 2, BUCHAREST, 022651, ROMANIA",2392-702X,,978-606-749-181-4,STRATEGICA,,,2016,,,,,,,449,459,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8FR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392267300037,0

The campaign aimed to deter individuals from joining piracy by highlighting the dangers and problems associated with piracy. Despite the hype surrounding its commencement, the UNODC campaign was met with various challenges that resulted in minimal implementation and left a trail of angry donors, staff members and Somali government officials. This article examines awareness campaigns as a response to piracy. It provides a first-hand account of the actors and politics involved in shaping the design and implementation of the UNODC anti-piracy awareness campaign. It explores the implied and developed knowledges embedded within campaign messages and analyses how objects of intervention were produced and reproduced throughout the campaign.","[Gilmer, Brittany] Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Dept Criminal Justice, Modesto A Maidique Campus,11200 SW 8th St,PCA 369, Miami, FL 33199 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida International University,"Gilmer, B (通讯作者)，Florida Int Univ, Steven J Green Sch Int & Publ Affairs, Dept Criminal Justice, Modesto A Maidique Campus,11200 SW 8th St,PCA 369, Miami, FL 33199 USA.",bgilmer@fiu.edu,,,,,,,38,7,7,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0388,1743-9140,,J DEV STUD,J.

Trust forms a foundation for cooperation in workplace relationships. The paper discusses intellectual capital and its management looking at trust and trust development as intangible resource within organization and its work relationships. The paper focuses, more specifically, on analysing trusting, i.e. how trust or mistrust develops and trust is restored following the violation and breach of trust. Empirical findings are presented based on qualitative data from several sources. The aim of the paper is to increase understanding of trust development (mistrust and restoration). The purpose of the paper is to provide insights for further research and implications for both leadership practices and human capital skills development. Through building and sustaining trust (avoiding mistrust) in work relationships competences of human intellectual capital may be enhanced for enhancing business competitiveness. Studying mistrust and trust repair is important, as empirical studies of trust development show that the process is dynamic, rather sensitive and appears as the dynamics of evil which may be even unintentionally boosted. The process of trust development in inter-personal relations is perceived as 'wavelike' with splashes and calm, occurring in several episodes and phases. Interpersonal trust building begins as early as during the recruitment process and stage of initiation. If the opportunity and importance of trust-building is poorly understood and performed the initiation, for example, may lead to situations of mistrust and later on even in trust violations in trusting relationships between, say, the supervisor and subordinate unless, where trust between actors may need to be restored. In the theoretical section intellectual capital and its management is discussed. In order to operate in product and/or services markets, an organization combines different types of resources, intangible and tangible, such as human competencies, skills and knowledge, social structures, infrastructures and financial assets. Intangible resources have become a critical success factor for enterprises operating in a knowledge based economy. In the paper, distrust is dealt with in more detailed dealing with the situation of trust violation and breach. This paper adopts a relational view of trust meaning that trust is seen as intellectual, relational asset developed and sustained in interaction between people and forming a foundation for collaborative learning and co-operation in organizations. Trust is commonly reciprocal activity between individuals and within groups in organizations. It is built in interaction involving communication and other activities in daily operations. In today's management multi-channel communication occurs more and more technology-mediated which challenges ways, frequency and skills of interacting. The empirical part of the paper analyses trust in workplace relationships based on empirical qualitative data from multiple sources (case, narratives, interviews) and levels (individual, dyadic and group levels). The research questions are how mistrust develops and how trust is restored following trust violation or breach. The findings show that trust may be restored but it may be challenging. The paper suggests a few implications to avoid mistrust and restore trust. Leadership and leaders role in sustaining trust is also discussed.","[Ikonen, Mirjami; Savolainen, Taina] Univ Eastern Finland, Business Sch, Joensuu, Finland; [Lopez-Fresno, Palmira] Spanish Assoc Qual, Madrid, Spain; [Kohl, Holger] Fraunhofer Inst, Munich, Germany",University of Eastern Finland; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Ikonen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Eastern Finland, Business Sch, Joensuu, Finland.",mirjami.ikonen@uef.fi; taina.savolainen@uef.fi; correo@palmiralopezfresno.com; Holger.Kohl@ipk.fraunhofer.de,"Ikonen, Mirjami/ABD-4124-2020","Ikonen, Mirjami/0000-0002-9915-0927",,,,,36,2,2,1,14,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,119,128,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300015,0

The paper concludes that while in the near-term Dodd-Frank will probably reduce both risk in banking and the magnitude of financial intermediation, it is unlikely to do so in the longer term. Like nearly all major banking legislation in the United States before it, Dodd-Frank promises more than it is likely to deliver. It devotes insufficient attention to both economic incentives and continued innovations in technology and banking practices. Through time, the result should be the emergence of a financial system much like the pre-2007 system, with renewed fragility.","[Kaufman, G.

Analysts' forecasts bring prices in line with the expectations they embody, consistent with the notion that they contain information about future cash flows. However, analysts' forecasts exhibit predictable biases, and the market appears to underreact to the information in forecasts and to not fully filter the biases in forecasts. Analysts' forecasts are also helpful in estimating expected returns on securities, but evidence on the relation between analysts' forecasts and expected returns is still scarce.

What are the best solutions to rebalance the financial structure of Italian firms? How should banks refinance firms to provide them with the necessary period to settle finances? This paper provides the reader with some answers to both questions. With regards to the capitalisation processes, we recommend setting up new highly capitalised intermediaries. In particular, they should be created with capital that comes from selling those bank buildings that are no longer useful, given the increasing importance of online services. Later, we analyse the opportunity for and, thus, the effects of banks to securitise their loans.

Efficient farms are found in all farm size and system categories, with many of the smaller farms experiencing relatively high technical efficiency. Overall, we find significant economic forces at work towards more efficient and productive dairy production in both the EU and the United States.

Previous studies proved that labor mobility and the effect of immigration differs with respect to the business cycle. For the expansionary years was found a sizable relocation of native workers to occupations with more interactive rather than manual content as a response to immigration. This is no longer the case for economy in recession period. However, there is null impact on native employment that does not change with the business cycle. The European labor market has been studied just in the period before crisis. Following the study about Spanish task specialization we would like to see if there is any change of impact of immigration on native task specialization in European Union. We split the data on the time period of expansion and the time period of economic crisis using the European Labor Force Survey.

This article shows that a zero or a negative natural interest can be explained by the Bohm-Bawerkian and neoclassical theory. Firstly, two senses of time preference are introduced in a discounted utility model, and key determinants of the zero interest rate on the side of time preference are discussed in detail. Secondly, a simple general equilibrium model with fixed intertemporal endowment is presented. Within this model, a decreasing shape of the income stream is identified as a major source of zero interest along with a low intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption. Even in the world of zero or negative natural interest, it might be optimal to be a lender. The last section focuses on the role of marginal productivity of capital in the model, stressing the role of this phenomenon on one side and time preference on the other in lowering the natural rate of interest to a zero level.","[Potuzak, Pavel] Vysoka Skola Ekon, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Potuzák, P (通讯作者)，Vysoka Skola Ekon, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavel.potuzak@vse.cz,"Potuzak, Pavel/C-2954-2019","Potuzak, Pavel/0000-0003-2561-5768",,,,,38,2,2,0,8,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

The article empirically tests four-component model of Intellectual capital. The model is tested using Structural equation modelling on a large sample of 890 companies. The variables in the survey are drawn from previous literature therefore ensuring content validity. The results show a robust confirmation of the model. This proves the necessity of the fourth component - External social capital as an important component in Intellectual capital and its influence on innovation. The research also clearly shows how each component of intellectual capital affects product and process innovations.

Adopting the methodology of Beaudry et al. (2001), we track the behavior of the cross-sectional dispersions of hedge fund strategies' returns, market betas and alphas over the business cycle. The pattern of strategies' betas supports Beaudry et al.'s conjecture: hedge funds reduce their risk-taking (betas) during times of macroeconomic uncertainty, which makes their strategies more homogeneous and thus contributes to increased systemic risk in the financial system. However, the cyclical behavior of the cross-sectional dispersions of strategies' returns and strategies' alphas is not in line with Beaudry et al.'s conjecture. These dispersions tend to increase during episodes of rising macroeconomic uncertainty, which suggests the prevalence of the Black's (1976) leverage effect during financial turmoil and the fact that the exposure of hedge fund strategies to risk factors is quite different from each other. Finally, although remaining important, procyclicality seems to have declined through time in the hedge fund industry, which suggests that a learning process is at play. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We found that productivity spillovers diminished when the distance between foreign and domestic firms increases and that interactions among local firms amplify the spillovers. Within short distances, the presence of foreign firms creates positive backward, negative forward and horizontal spillovers.

The study, in particular, seeks to identify factors influencing the requirements determination. These allow better knowledge of the service coproduction phenomenon by providing insight into anatomy of service requirements decisions. Methodology/methods The study takes the qualitative research approach which allows an in-depth investigation. In particular the Critical Incident Technique is employed. Direct contact staff representatives recruited from different service sectors were interviewed by asking open-ended questions about particular incidents and the factors enabling requirements determination. 170 reliable stories were gathered and forwarded for content analysis. Scientific aim Taking into consideration that there is a lack of insight into real coproduction dynamism and roles, as well as links between theories and practical coproduction live, the study aims to provide in-depth insight into service coproduction. The new knowledge consists primarily in figuring out the factors influencing service coproduction and performing their systematisation. The relative importance of the identified factors also makes a special point of interest in this study. Findings The study identifies factors playing a crucial role during service coproduction. On the service provider side, first of all, these are the service provider's accumulated knowledge and capacity for maintaining effective relationships with customers. On the customer side, the possibility of obtaining information, and familiarity with the service by the customer are of particular importance. The study also demonstrates that the customer's personal features are a key coproduction factor. This factor is crucial when a service provider aims at a highly perceived quality. Conclusions All of the identified factors make particular fields of challenge for service systems. According to the study, service providers should try to engage customers personally because it facilitates high service quality. This study is the first one in the literature taking the in-depth study approach to investigate service coproduction with reference to requirements formation, but also one of only a few exploring the service coproduction phenomenon in an in-depth manner. The study proposes a fresh insight into service coproduction compared to numerous theoretical deliberations available in the scientific market.","[Urban, Wieslaw] Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland",Bialystok University of Technology,"Urban, W (通讯作者)，Bialystok Tech Univ, Wiejska 45A, PL-15351 Bialystok, Poland.",w.urban@pb.edu.pl,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,2,"BRNO UNIV TECHNOLOGY, FAC BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT",BRNO,"KOLEJNI 2906-4, BRNO, 612 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-214-5413-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,237,245,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2EH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000408885200028,0

Given the important contributions of SMEs in transition economies, we focus our discussion on this organizational type. Specifically, we present a conceptual model and eight propositions suitable for a comprehensive research agenda of SMEs in transition economies. The propositions present that a significant relationship exists between the extent to which institutions support market orientation practices, and management's recognition and emphasis of market orientation in an organization.

Effective vision affects organizational performance. However, there are some significant differences in organizational visions (Larwood et al. 1995). In some companies, vision is mutually shared and important for managers. It is action-oriented and long-term. In other companies, vision is general, difficult to describe, and usually it is neither strategic nor formalized. If there are some differences in organizational visions, then there must be some differences in the intellectual capital value of companies. Intellectual capital does not exist without a purpose. It is expected that these differences have their roots in the manner how managers are motivated. Besides, motivation is one of intangible assets. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationships between an approach to motivating managers and the structure and meaning of organizational vision, and how these relationships influence the company's intellectual capital. It is assumed that vision impacts how managers are motivated. At the same time, it is assumed that vision is the outcome of this process. The aim of this paper is also to propose two theoretical patterns which help to explain these analyzed relationships. The first proposition is that organizational vision is important and shared by managers when they participate in visioning and strategic review process, their team training and development is integrated with the vision as well as their performance (appraisal) and reward (incentives) criteria. Therefore, managers are cohesive as a team. It is expected that the new vision is well-articulated and effective. It should be positively associated with the company's intellectual capital value. The second proposition is that vision is not shared by all managers because there is no teamwork on it. Top management team is a constellation of senior executives with a minimum of collaboration (Hambrick 1995). Furthermore, training and development of managers are not integrated with the organizational vision neither are their performance and reward criteria. The approach to motivating managers is not coherent. Therefore, the management team is fragmented and organizational vision not inspiring. It is expected then the value of a company's intellectual capital is low. Little is known about the differences in organizational vision with regard to motivating managers. To fill this gap, two theoretical frameworks are proposed. These can be beneficial for researchers and practitioners.","[Zalesna, Aleksandra] Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland",,"Zalesna, A (通讯作者)，Bogdan Janski Sch Management & Entrepreneurship, Lomza, Poland.",aleksandrazalesna@wp.pl,,,,,,,27,1,2,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-90-3,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2016,,,,,,,339,345,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH4JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000400385300041,0

With a specific provisioning system, provisions are triggered by past due payments. With a dynamic system, both past due payments and expected losses over the whole business cycle are accounted for, and provisions are smoothed over the cycle. Numerical experiments with a parameterized version of the model show that a dynamic provisioning regime can be highly effective in mitigating procyclicality of the financial system. The results also indicate that the combination of a credit gap-augmented Taylor rule and a dynamic provisioning system with full smoothing may be the most effective way to mitigate real and financial volatility associated with financial shocks.

The main result for contracts exposed solely to financial risk (e.g. Doskeland and Nordahl, 2008; Dichtl and Drobetz, 2011) is that expected utility theory (EUT) fails to interpret demand for guarantees, while cumulative prospect theory (CPT) is able to support the demand. While the development of the financial market has a significant impact on the portfolio choice, some other non-financial risk might play an important role too. In the present paper, we take life insurance products as an example, where the long term nature of these contracts places a special emphasis on the uncertain lifetime of the investor. We incorporate the mortality risk and investigate its effect on the attractiveness of contracts offering minimum interest rate guarantees to EUT- and CPT-investors. For this purpose, we introduce two approaches for the consideration of multiple risk sources within CPT. We illustrate the theoretical framework with numerous simulations and our numerical results show that a long-term risk-averse EUT-investor prefers products with guarantees. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically, two mega-mergers would have been denied according to the concentration ratio or HHI criteria commonly used in merger guidelines today, thus hindering banks' risk reduction through consolidation.

These differences are observed only when the unit CEO was not the CEO or a director of the pre-spinoff parent firm-that is, when there is a greater need to assess the CEO's ability and match with the firm.

We analyze the stock price reactions for the 300 largest banks from 52 countries across 12 relevant regulatory announcement and designation events. We observe that the new regulation negatively affects the value of the newly regulated banks, yet that the official designation of banks as globally systemically important itself has a partly offsetting positive impact. A cross-sectional analysis of the valuation effects with respect to, for example, government ownership of banks supports the view that the positive reaction to these designations can be attributed to a Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) perception by investors. The fact that these valuation effects emerge from a regulation specifically designed to reduce the costs and risks of Too-Big-to-Fail demonstrates the inherently paradoxical nature of the new regulation. These results further suggest that even though the individual components of the regulation have been effective, revealing the identities of G-SIBs eliminated ambiguity about the presence of government guarantees, and thereby may have run counter to the regulators' intent to contain the effects of TBTF.

In our theoretical framework, the act of proposing or demanding a bribe violates a commonly held social norm, thus producing a psychological cost. By lowering this psychological cost, particularism increases the probability of offering or asking for a bribe. We test the predictions of the model by using individual-level data for 25 countries from the European Social Survey. Consistent with the theory, particularism is found to have a positive causal effect on the probability of offering a bribe. Overall, our findings indicate that policies aimed at favoring universalism may provide an effective tool to reduce corruption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that fund managers continuously adjust their exposure to different risk factors conditional on the recent performance of these factors. The majority of managers apply a positive feedback strategy, whereas the remaining managers use a negative feedback strategy. In addition, we find some evidence for factor timing ability, although managers appear to be more backward looking than forward looking. We show that positive feedback trading can be beneficial to fund performance in our setup. If managers applied the positive feedback strategy more aggressively, however, they could benefit more from it. As such, the smart switching benchmark can be used to assess the risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Schauten, Marc B. J.; Zwinkels, Remco C.

The first part summarizes previous related empirical literature conducted in the Philippines, Bangladesh, Mexico, Pakistan, Albania and Guatemala, as these developing nations share more and less similarities with Viet Nam and are among the top countries receiving remittances. Secondly, employing the ordinary least square (OLS) regression and logistic regression models and utilizing the largescale and nationally-representative household income and expenditure survey with the technical assistance of the World Bank and United Nations Development Program, this study contributes to the ongoing discussion about the link between remittances and Vietnamese household behavior by applying a microeconometric approach. First, as expected, households in receipt of remittances spend less at the margin on the key consumption normal good: food; or food is income elastic. Second, overseas remittances are associated with increased investment in education, which generates augmented human capital and has a future social return. Third, households in receipt of overseas remittances, especially those residing in urban areas, are more likely to channel funding towards productive business investment and capital gains in comparison with those without remittances. The findings strengthen the optimistic perspective of significant positive effects of remittances on household expenditure patterns in developing economies. The OLS method employed in this research, likewise in most previous studies, may affect the results of the estimated impacts of remittances on household behavior. The paper successfully proved international evidence of the remittances and household behavior nexus in Vietnam as a case study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some bankers and borrowers suggested that unnecessarily tight supervisory policies were a constraint on new lending that hindered the recovery. This paper explores one aspect of supervisory policy: whether the standards used to assign commercial bank CAMELS ratings have changed materially over time (1991-2013). Models incorporating time-varying parameters or economy-wide variables suggest that standards used in the assignment of CAMELS ratings over the post-crisis period generally were in line with historical experience. Indeed, each of the models used suggests that the variation in supervisory standards has been relatively small in absolute terms over most of the sample period. However, we show that when this measure of supervisory stringency becomes elevated, it has a noticeable dampening effect on lending activity in subsequent quarters.

The results demonstrate that a key variable driving transaction costs is the presence of a land use plan for reindeer husbandry, which is an interesting paradox as reindeer herders pursue the development of these land use plans even though this drives their transaction costs.","[Bostedt, Goeran; Widmark, Camilla; Andersson, Mats] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden; [Sandstrom, Camilla] Umea Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Umea University,"Bostedt, G (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Forest Econ, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",,"Andersson, Mats/ABS-5053-2022; Sandström, Camilla/JHT-1664-2023","Andersson, Mats/0000-0001-6008-219X; Sandström, Camilla/0000-0002-7674-6197; Bostedt, Goran/0000-0002-6540-743X; Widmark, Camila/0000-0002-1559-6471",Swedish Research Council FORMAS,Swedish Research Council FORMAS(Swedish Research Council Formas),The Swedish Research Council FORMAS financed this study.

We add pollution and a ceiling to the endogenous growth model of Tsur and Zemel (J Environ Econ Manag 49(3):484-499, 2005) to study the effects of the ceiling (and pollution) on capital and research investments. In the short run, the ceiling adds an additional scarcity to the one induced by the limited fossil fuel stock. Ceteris paribus, the extraction rate of cheap fossil fuel is reduced and backstop utilization boosted. This increases energy costs (energy cost effect) and makes R&D more beneficial compared with capital accumulation (research effect). R&D investments may increase, depending on capital endowment and the strength of the two effects. The sum of R&D and capital investments is affected, as both effects change disposable production. In the long-run, i.e. after the exhaustion of limited resources, the shape of the evolution path can be only affected by the ceiling, if the capital endowment is sufficiently large.","[Kollenbach, Gilbert] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, D-58084 Hagen, Germany; [Kollenbach, Gilbert] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, D-57068 Siegen, Germany; [Kollenbach, Gilbert] Lehrstuhl Volkswirtschaftslehre, Insbesondere Finanzwissensch, D-58084 Hagen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Kollenbach, G (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, D-58084 Hagen, Germany.",Gilbert.Kollenbach@Fernuni-Hagen.de,"Kollenbach, Gilbert/AAO-4207-2020","Kollenbach, Gilbert/0000-0002-1168-3316",,,,,24,6,6,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

The quality attribute considered is the environmental friendliness of products. Economic growth is modeled as a shift in income distribution. It shows that the effect of economic growth depends on the form it takes. A growth in income that is uniform across consumers improves the cleanup levels adopted by both firms. However, a growth in income that is accompanied by changes in income inequality may result in the lowering of one of the two qualities. More specifically, if the growth in income is accompanied by increased disparities in income distribution, the quality of the (environmentally) inferior variant is reduced. This has serious implications for the poor consumers if the product has safety or health hazards. The paper suggests a regulatory measure to prevent such deterioration in the quality of the inferior variant.","[Bansal, Sangeeta] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India; [Bansal, Sangeeta] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi; University of California System; University of California Berkeley","Bansal, S (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India.",sangeeta.bansal7@gmail.com,"Bansal, Dr Sangeeta/JOZ-8832-2023",,,,,,25,2,2,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1355-770X,1469-4395,,ENVIRON DEV ECON,Environ.

Consistent with Ozdagli (2012), financial leverage plays a dominant role, supported by adjustment costs (which represent the degree of investment irreversibility). Specifically, the observed value premium is driven by the financial leverage differences between value and growth firms, partially neutralized by investment irreversibility. The relation between the value premium and investment irreversibility is contrary to the intuition in Zhang (2005) and Cooper (2006). Operating leverage does not significantly influence the value premium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our results indicate mixed evidence depending on whether simultaneity between domestic monetary policy stance and the stock market behavior is taken into full account. When this simultaneity is not allowed we confirm previous evidence found in the literature, extended to the international field: a lax monetary policy, both domestic and global, decreases risk aversion.

Two essential dimensions of public or social risks are the inequality concerning the distribution of risks over various groups and members of society and the level of risk faced by individuals and by the society as a whole. This paper disentangles these two essential dimensions and studies people's preferences concerning different types of allocations of risks over groups of people. We do so in a laboratory experiment with real incentives, where subjects are placed in the role of a social planner and choose between different types of allocations of risks over 10 other participants. The allocations differ only in terms of dispersion, i.e. they differ only in terms of inequality and risk. The majority of our subjects exhibit clear preferences over different types of allocations consistent with ex ante inequality and individual risk aversion, and ex post inequality and collective risk seeking behavior. These results are consistent with the literature on public risk and can be reconciled with responsibility aversion.","[Rohde, Ingrid M.

The aim is to shed light on the variation in mobility resources of those who perceive they can use public transport as their primary mode of transport and of those who perceive they cannot ('mobility capability element), as well as that of those using public transport and of those not using it ('mobility functioning element). Increasing residential density, being female and having a higher functional capacity were among the mobility resources which produced a positive increase in the likelihood of considering it possible to use, and the use of, public transport. The higher the ratio of cars to household member, the lower the likelihood of including public transport as a mobility capability element or as a mobility functioning element. Most of those who included public transport use as both a mobility capability element and a mobility functioning element were also users of the private car. There was also a tendency towards car use rather than towards no travel if the individual was not a user of public transport.

Japan experienced several deregulations of listing requirements in the late 1990s. We use a dataset that covers both public and private firms for more than 30 years, which enables us to compare the firms' operating growth around IPOs as well as to compare the growth under both strict and relaxed listing requirements. When comparing the matched firms, we find that IPO firms' excess growth in profitability and productivity diminished after their IPOs, while their excess growth in terms of size (measured by sales and number of employees) still increased in the post-IPO period. This finding indicates that relaxing listing requirements enables high-growth firms to go public but does not lead to subsequent growth in productivity and profitability, although it does enable firms to be larger more after going public.

Under the assumptions of constant marginal value and additive separability of the demand schedule, we obtain closed-form solutions for the dealer's optimal demand schedule, and we find that her/his pre-auction short position impacts her/his bidding behavior in three ways. First, the primary dealer's demand for the auctioned security increases with her/his pre-auction short position. Second, the primary dealer's differential bid shading decreases with her/his pre-auction short position. Third, primary dealers with higher pre-auction short positions assign lower values to the auctioned security.

Because this approach encompasses these and other cases as feasible solutions, we also show how it can be used to optimize the construction of lattices so that discretization error is minimized, and we demonstrate its application for an option pricing example.","[Wang, Tianyang] Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Dyer, James S.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Informat Risk & Operat Management, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Hahn, Warren J.] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Finance, Austin, TX 78712 USA",Colorado State University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Wang, TY (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Finance & Real Estate, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.",Tianyang.Wang@business.colostate.edu; Jim.Dyer@mccombs.utexas.edu; Joe.Hahn@mccombs.utexas.edu,"Wang, Tianyang/A-3442-2019","Wang, Tianyang/0000-0001-9934-242X",,,,,45,2,2,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1380-6645,1573-7144,,REV DERIV RES,Rev.

Existing evidence, however, suggests that it does not perform equally in all markets and stocks. On the other hand, smaller emerging markets have not attracted sufficient empirical attention so far and we rather ignore whether call auctions are suitable mechanisms for their opening. Taking the Athens Exchange as a typical example of a thin peripheral market, we present evidence on how information gradually improves during the preopening and the characteristics of quoting activity that help explain why this learning process fails to fully reveal fair prices of stocks at the opening. We find that early preopening activity involves a large proportion of small, uninformative and less aggressive orders that contribute little to price discovery at the opening. In contrast, late orders are relatively larger, more informative and more aggressive, thus contributing to price efficiency; prices however remain significantly different from fair values. Opening prices are persistently biased, revealing the existence of a noise/illiquidity premium imposed on opening traders. Finally price correction takes place and price discovery is brought about by early trading activity in the subsequent continuous session. We conclude that small and peripheral markets would be better served by a combination of an opening call followed by a longer continuous double auction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using wealth data on US. households, we forecast changes in household wealth and calculate the importance of untaxed wealth in bequeathed estates. We then compare the aggregate and distributional burden of the current estate tax to policies in which only unrealized capital gains are subject to tax. We estimate that, in the coming decade, unrealized capital gains will comprise nearly half of the gross estate for estates worth over $50 million. Policies taxing capital gains can potentially raise more revenue than the current estate tax, but not without a substantial increase in the fraction of households facing a tax. Due to the high concentration of unrealized gains among the wealthy, we find that, although a modest capital gains allowance substantially reduces tax revenue, it sharply focuses the tax burden on the wealthiest households.","[Avery, Robert B.] Fed Housing Finance Agcy, Washington, DC USA; [Grodzicki, Daniel J.] Penn State Univ, Dept Econ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Moore, Kevin B.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Housing Finance Agency; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Avery, RB (通讯作者)，Fed Housing Finance Agcy, Washington, DC USA.",robert.avery@fhfa.gov; djg39@psu.edu; kevin.b.moore@frb.gov,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,8,NATL TAX ASSOC,WASHINGTON,"725 15TH ST, N W #600, WASHINGTON, DC 20005-2109 USA",0028-0283,1944-7477,,NATL TAX J,Natl.

We argue that the Arrow-Pratt-concept per se well matches with economic intuition in standard financial decision problems, such as willingness to pay for insurance and simple portfolio problems. Different from the literature, we find that the widely-applied spectral Arrow-Pratt-measure is not a consistent measure of Arrow-Pratt-risk aversion. Instead, the difference between the antiderivatives of the corresponding risk spectra is valid. Within the framework of Ross, we show that the popular subclasses of Expected Shortfall, and exponential and power spectral risk measures cannot be completely ordered with respect to Ross-risk aversion. Thus, for all these subclasses, the concept of Ross-risk aversion is not generally compatible with Arrow-Pratt-risk aversion, but induces counter-intuitive comparative statics of its own. Compatibility can be achieved if asset returns are jointly normally distributed. The general lesson is that these restrictions have to be considered before spectral risk measures can be applied for the purpose of optimal decision making and regulatory issues.

This paper examines the relationships among government capital injection, regulatory deposit insurance fund protection, bank interest margin, and technology choice of investment in human resource relative to information technology. An increase in human resource results in an increased interest margin, and further a decreased default risk when the bank adopts a relatively high level of information technology. We also show a positive effect of government capital injection on human resource investment and a negative effect on bank default risk. Regulatory deposit insurance fund protection weakens the increased human resource investment, but reinforces the decreased default risk Both the government capital injection and the regulatory deposit insurance fund protection may stabilize the distressed bank explicitly considering technology choice.

In this study, we examine the domestic politics of this competition by focusing on incentive use in the United States from 1999 to 2012. We define incentives as the targeted tax deductions or exemptions that are used to lure businesses into a locality. Drawing on data from municipal incentive programs, we examine how electoral competition shapes the use and oversight of targeted incentives. We find evidence that cities with elected mayors provide larger incentives than non-elected city managers by taking advantage of exogeneity in the assignment of city government institutions and a database of over 2000 investment incentives from 2010 to 2012. We also find that elected mayors enjoy more lax oversight of incentive projects than their appointed counterparts.

Territorial inequality is found to be persistent and reduces the pro-poor effect of local income growth.

We predict that the bank could bring an information advantage to insurance companies through TM by providing a customer list based on the customers' records in the bank. Bancassurance can play a role of integrating the information that is transferred from the bank to the insurance company. Our empirical evidence shows that, in contrast to OTC customers, there is less evidence of adverse selection, and there is also less evidence of moral hazard or fraud among the TM customers that have been sorted by the bank. This phenomenon could be attributed to the valuable private information provided by the credit records of customers kept by the bank.","[Peng, Jin-Lung] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Peng, Jin-Lung; Wang, Kili C.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Risk & Insurance Res Ctr, Coll Commerce, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Peng, Jin-Lung; Wang, Kili C.] Natl Chengchi Univ, Cardif Bancassurance Res Ctr, Coll Commerce, Taipei 11623, Taiwan; [Wang, Kili C.] Tamkang Univ, Dept Insurance, Taipei, Taiwan",National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University; National Chengchi University; Tamkang University,"Peng, JL (通讯作者)，Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Risk Management & Insurance, 64 Chihnan Rd,Sec 2 Wenshan, Taipei 11623, Taiwan.",kili@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,30,PALGRAVE MACMILLAN LTD,BASINGSTOKE,"BRUNEL RD BLDG, HOUNDMILLS, BASINGSTOKE RG21 6XS, HANTS, ENGLAND",1554-964X,1554-9658,,GENEVA RISK INS REV,Geneva Risk Insur.

Using structural equation modelling, latent-variable mediation analysis supported the notion that economizing behaviors significantly, but indirectly, predict greater depressed mood and lower life satisfaction through perceived financial strain.

Classifying various determinants into three categories, namely risk, illiquidity, and marketability, we show that risk and marketability are significant determinants of the discount on private placements over the entire sample period. However, we identify a structural break in the relation between the discount on private placements with illiquidity and, to a lesser degree, marketability. Specifically, we find that liquidity is a more important determinant during the pre-2003 period, but marketability becomes a more important determinant during the post-2003 period. We attribute the structural break to substantial changes in market microstructure during our sample period. Lower transaction costs make illiquidity less of a concern for investors, whereas more active trading by investors calls for a higher discount for the lack of marketability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Why do not successful managers increase fund size or fees? We argue that managers want to attract high-quality entrepreneurs, while entrepreneurs want to match with high-ability managers. However, observing fund performance does not allow entrepreneurs to distinguish a manager's ability from the quality of firms in the fund's portfolio. As a consequence, a fund manager may devote unobserved effort to select firms, and keep fund size small to limit the cost of effort, hoping to manipulate entrepreneurs' beliefs about his ability.","[Marquez, Robert] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Nanda, Vikram] Rutgers State Univ, Piscataway, NJ 08855 USA; [Yavuz, M.

An increase in capital injection increases the bank's interest margin and decreases the default risk. With increased government capital injection, profitability is increased and stability is reduced when the diversification degree increases. The increased return and the reduced risk are attenuated as the deposit insurance fund protection increases. Although the bank faces the two conflicting capitalization policies, we may suggest that loan portfolio should be as diversified as possible, producing better profitability and greater safety for the bank.

We show that the defect is not with the theory but with the use of a leverage ratio in which profitability affects both the numerator and the denominator. Profitability directly increases the value of equity. Firms do take the predicted offsetting actions. They issue debt and repurchase equity when profitability rises, and retire debt and issue equity when profitability falls. Consistent with variable transactions costs, the adjustment is not generally sufficient to fully undo the profitability shocks. Accordingly, on average the leverage ratio falls as profitability rises.","[Frank, Murray Z.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Goyal, Vidhan K.] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology,"Frank, MZ (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,"Goyal, Vidhan K/C-6488-2011; Frank, Murray/L-1451-2014","Goyal, Vidhan K/0000-0002-3932-4825;",Piper Jaffray; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [641608],Piper Jaffray; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"We are especially grateful for helpful comments from our referee.

We use the (double) reflection principle and propose a static replication portfolio of vanilla options for hedging of these options in the Black-Scholes model. The Monte Carlo simulation results for vanilla options with adjusted payoffs are provided to demonstrate the accuracy of the hedging strategies.

To this end, after carrying out a classical convergence analysis, a more thorough investigation of the entire distribution is presented by examining its external shape, the intra-distribution dynamics and the long-run equilibrium distribution. This analysis reveals the existence of a weak, rather insignificant, convergence process and that large cross-country differences are likely to persist in the long-run. Next, as polarization indicators are a proper way of appraising potential conflict in international environmental negotiations, we test whether, or not, the distribution dynamics concurs with the presence of polarization. Our results indicate that two poles can be clearly differentiated, one with high and other with low non- generating energy shares. In view of these findings, and to ensure a fair transition to a sustainable energy system, the paper calls for the development of an ambitious clean energy agenda, especially in countries with low non- generating energy shares.","[Maza, Adolfo; Villaverde, Jose; Hierro, Maria] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Villaverde, Jose] Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland",Universidad de Cantabria; University of Limerick,"Maza, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Ave Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",mazaaj@unican.es,"Maza, Adolfo/H-5265-2019","Maza, Adolfo/0000-0002-7299-3449; Villaverde, Jose/0000-0002-5393-091X",,,,,61,1,2,0,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This paper shows that cross-venue strategies create highly interlinked markets: trades on one venue are followed by sizeable cancellations of limit orders on competing venues. These cancellations are explained in a simple model of competition between two limit order markets with fast and slow traders. Only the fast traders can access the liquidity of both venues simultaneously. Empirically, we confirm the predictions that the fraction of fast traders (1) reduces the equilibrium liquidity supply and (2) reduces the magnitude of the cancellations following a trade.","[van Kervel, Vincent] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Kervel, V (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Finance, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",vincentvankervel@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,43,46,1,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0893-9454,1465-7368,,REV FINANC STUD,Rev.

The required labor income tax rate is inversely related to the risk-free real interest rate and the markup in the goods market, but it is proportional to the degree of external habit. Under this circumstance, the optimal monetary policy commands a countercyclical interest rate, having a perfect negative correlation with tax rate in the sticky price model with external habit. If a time-invariant tax is the only fiscal instrument, then the degree of external habit entails a gap between the private marginal rate of substitution between consumption and labor and the social marginal rate of substitution, generating an endogenous trade-off between the stabilization of welfare-relevant output gap and inflation. Under this circumstance, price stability is not the optimal policy. The monetary policy authority should optimally try to undo the time-varying distortions associated with external habit and monopoly power in goods market by deviating from price stability.","Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jung, Y (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",jungys@khu.ac.kr,"Jung, Yongseung/AAI-1058-2020",,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044637],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"I thank two anonymous referees for very helpful comments.

The field of entrepreneurship has evolved in a rather disjointed or seemingly random manner, and entrepreneurship has developed as a business discipline by borrowing, building upon, and adapting theoretical and conceptual work from such fields as sociology, psychology, anthropology, marketing, management, finance, organizational behavior, and engineering. And yet, it would appear that the volume of work attempting to describe, explain, and predict aspects of entrepreneurship has grown to a point where we can begin to develop a more complete and integrated picture. The purpose of this paper was to examine the various theoretical perspectives and frameworks of entrepreneurship and to offer an integrative perspective through a proposed framework of frameworks which ties together other existing frameworks, each of which explores a particular aspect of the overall phenomenon of entrepreneurship. The value of using a framework to explain and therefore better understand entrepreneurship is examined.","[Kuratko, Donald F.] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Morris, Michael H.] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Schindehutte, Minet] Syracuse Univ, Whitman Sch Management, Syracuse, NY 13244 USA",Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Syracuse University,"Kuratko, DF (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",dkuratko@indiana.edu; michael.morris@warrington.ufl.edu; mschinde@syr.edu,,"Morris, Michael/0000-0003-2784-410X",,,,,85,59,105,13,206,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

The model includes nonconvexities and any number of state variables but is, in its simplest form, a one-state variable problem. Clear-cuts with various rotation lengths and continuous harvesting appear as locally optimal solutions. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the local and global optimality of these two forest management types are obtained. Discounting is found to increase rotation length and to favor continuous harvesting. Initial state may determine the optimality of continuous forest cover versus clear-cuts. The relative value of large trees is an important factor in the optimality of different solutions.

Intuitively, financial constraints have a negative impact on firm expansion in new destinations by limiting firm ability to finance entry costs. The effect on exit from existing destinations is ambiguous. Due to financial constraints, a firm may face difficulties financing the recurrent costs of maintaining her market presence. But if financial constraints also affect entry, the firm may have strong incentives to stay in a given destination since it may not be able to fund the fixed entry costs associated to the reallocation of her portfolio of destinations. We develop a simple theoretical model which includes these two effects. We use a unique longitudinal dataset on French firms that contains information on export destinations of individual firms and allows to construct various firm-level measures of financial constraints to test these predictions. The empirical results suggest that financial constraints hamper a firms's ability to cover fixed entry costs as well as recurrent costs associated with maintaining the presence in a foreign market, thereby reducing the probability of entering into a new foreign markets and increasing the probability of exiting from an existing foreign market.","[Askenazy, Philippe] CNRS Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France; [Caldera, Aida] OECD, Paris, France; [Gaulier, Guillaume; Irac, Delphine] Banque France, F-75049 Paris 01, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Gaulier, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",Philippe.Askenazy@ens.fr; Aida.calderasanchez@oecd.org; guillaume.gaulier@banque-france.fr; Delphine.IRAC@acpr.banque-france.fr,,"Askenazy, Philippe/0000-0003-1447-9668",,,,,29,13,14,3,25,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1610-2878,1610-2886,,REV WORLD ECON,Rev.

Applying our augmented models to the carbon emission and major energy markets in Europe, we find evidence of feedback trading in coal and electricity markets, but not in carbon market where the institutional investors dominate. This finding is consistent with the notion that institutional investors are less susceptible to pursuing feedback-style investment strategies.

High network centrality can allow CEOs to efficiently gather and control private information, facilitating value-creating acquisition decisions. We show, however, that M&A deals initiated by high-centrality CEOs, in addition to being more frequent, carry greater value losses to both the acquirer and the combined entity than deals initiated by low-centrality CEOs. We also document that high-centrality CEOs are capable of avoiding the discipline of the markets for corporate control and the executive labor market, and that the mitigating effect of internal governance on CEO actions is limited. Our evidence suggests that corporate decisions can be influenced by a CEO's position in the social hierarchy, with high-centrality CEOs using their power and influence to increase entrenchment and reap private benefits.

Concerning Rawls himself, he has offered a philosophical formulation of the second principle of justice (fair equality of opportunity and principle of difference) but that sole formulation remains too vague to contain precise proposals in the field of economic and social policy. In spite of real differences at an epistemological level about the meaning of their own normative ideas, Sen, Kolm and Rawls can be considered as liberal egalitarians, but economics of this school of thought is still to be specified (1): The Rawlsian hierarchy between the principles de justice would give our essay its general framework (2), whereas Sen's capability approach would legitimize a more ambitious conception of fair equality of opportunity (3) and Kolm's distributive ELIE transfers would be a suitable application of the principle of difference (4). As a conclusion, the scope and limits of our essay are subject to a first examination (5).","[Gamel, Claude] Univ Aix Marseille, Ecole Econ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France; [Gamel, Claude] EHESS, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Gamel, C (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille, Ecole Econ Aix Marseille, CNRS, Marseille, France.",claude.gamel@univ-amu.fr,,,,,,,48,0,0,0,7,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,2105-2883,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

Consistent with this theory, we show that deals in more competitive environments and deals with fewer external impediments on execution are more likely to be structured as tender offers. Tender offers also require higher premiums than mergers.

Moreover, the composition of the labor force improved in terms of education and experience, two variables that are typically associated to higher human capital. The average worker in 2012 had a higher level of education and was one and a half years older than in 1998, reflecting the impact of the demographic transition. However, the average real wage was roughly constant. We show that a decline in the wage premium for education, and to a minor extent for experience, is responsible for the lack of growth in the average real wage. Had these two premia remained constant throughout the period of analysis, average labor earnings would have increased by about 2.6% per year, of which 0.7 percentage points are accounted for by the changes in the composition of the labor force in terms of age and education. We explore the role of the relative supply of workers with different levels of human capital as an explanation for the decline in the wage premium for education. Finally, we analyze the implications of these findings for some macroeconomic variables, as earnings and wage inequality, the labor share and total factor productivity.","[Urrutia, Carlos] ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico; [Paz, Peter] Banco Cent Reserva Peru, Lima, Peru",Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico,"Urrutia, C (通讯作者)，ITAM, Ctr Invest Econ, Ave Camino Santa Teresa 930, Mexico City 10700, DF, Mexico.",peter.paz@bcrp.gob.pe; currutia@itam.mx,,,,,,,21,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1363-6669,1467-9361,,REV DEV ECON,Rev.

Empirically, we apply this method to Chinese A-share market and conclude that the market turmoil of Year 2007-2008 caused long-lasting herding with a decaying trend.

At the fund level, all methods considered indicate decreasing returns, though estimates that avoid econometric biases are insignificant. We also find that the active management industry has become more skilled over time. This upward trend in skill coincides with industry growth, which precludes the skill improvement from boosting fund performance.

Output is regulated with production quotas, and imports are restricted through a system of tariff-rate quotas. Many of Canada's trading partners are seeking better access to Canadian dairy and poultry markets in negotiations over proposed preferential trade agreements. These pressures have renewed debate about the future of SM in Canada. We investigate one criticism of SM: that high prices for dairy and poultry products impose regressive distributional effects on Canadian consumers. We apply the Exact Affine Stone Index demand model to data from the Canadian Food Expenditure Survey to estimate consumer responses to price changes for dairy and poultry products. Parameters from the demand model are used to generate welfare comparisons between the current SM regime and a counterfactual liberalized market. Canada's SM policies are highly regressive, imposing a burden of approximately 2.3 percent ($339) of income per year on the poorest households, compared to 0.5 percent ($554) for the richest households. The burden is larger for households with children.","[Cardwell, Ryan; Lawley, Chad] Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; [Xiang, Di] Univ Manitoba, Dept Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada",University of Manitoba; University of Manitoba,"Cardwell, R (通讯作者)，Univ Manitoba, Dept Agribusiness & Agr Econ, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.",,,"Cardwell, Ryan/0000-0002-4441-3427; Xiang, Di/0000-0003-3915-9265",,,,,43,21,26,0,21,UNIV TORONTO PRESS INC,TORONTO,"JOURNALS DIVISION, 5201 DUFFERIN ST, DOWNSVIEW, TORONTO, ON M3H 5T8, CANADA",0317-0861,1911-9917,,CAN PUBLIC POL,Can.

We investigate empirically the determinants of money laundering and its regulation in close to 100 countries. We use various methodologies to put together a cross-country dataset on proxies for money laundering and construct specific money laundering regulation indices based on specific laws and their enforcement. Results show that tougher money laundering regulation, particularly those that criminalize feeding activities and improve disclosure, are linked to lower levels of money laundering across countries. The relevance of historical factors in explaining the variation of money laundering regulation across countries sheds light on the theories of institutions and provides room for further action, particularly in the areas of the law that reduce the burden of proof, increase the liability of intermediaries and improve disclosure.","[Chong, Alberto] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Chong, Alberto] Univ Pacifico, Lima, Peru; [Lopez-de-Silanes, Florencio] EDHEC Business Sch, Roubaix, France; [Lopez-de-Silanes, Florencio] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Ottawa; Universidad del Pacifico Peru; Universite Catholique de Lille; EDHEC Business School; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Chong, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, 120 Univ Prvt,Room 8006, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",achong@uottawa.ca,,,,,,,56,34,38,3,36,"WILEY PERIODICALS, INC",SAN FRANCISCO,"ONE MONTGOMERY ST, SUITE 1200, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94104 USA",0954-1985,1468-0343,,ECON POLIT-OXFORD,Econ.

Although prior research has examined the effect of name changes on the firm, these studies have focused primarily on the stock price reaction to name changes. Such a focus has a number of limitations, including a reliance on samples that consist solely of publicly traded firms and an inability to determine whether the source of the impact is driven by increases in revenue, increases in efficiency, and/or reductions in costs. We overcome these limitations by testing the impact of corporate name changes on U.S. property-casualty insurers using detailed statutory data. We find a significant and positive relation between name changes and subsequent growth in premiums. The results are robust across various model specifications and suggest that name changes contain information that consumers interpret as meaningfully positive.","[Cole, Cassandra R.] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Risk Management & Insurance, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Fier, Stephen G.] Univ Mississippi, Sch Business Adm, Finance, University, MS 38677 USA; [Carson, James M.] Univ Georgia, Terry Coll Business, Insurance, Athens, GA 30602 USA; [Andrews, Demetra] Indiana Univ Northwest, Sch Business & Econ, Mkt, Gary, IN 46408 USA",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Mississippi; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia; Indiana University System; Indiana University Northwest,"Cole, CR (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Risk Management & Insurance, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",ccole@fsu.edu; sfier@bus.olemiss.edu; jcarson@uga.edu; demandre@iun.edu,"Cole, Cassandra/AAW-1985-2021",,,,,,69,7,8,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

The findings indicate that (1) capital buffers countercyclically fluctuate over the business cycles, which is different from evidence in developed economies; (2) countercyclical capital buffers are mainly built up by increasing the numerator of capital ratio; (3) credit growth takes on a countercyclical feature, and capital buffers help enhance its countercyclicality; (4) deposit premium is negatively related to capital buffer, and this effect is stronger during economic downturns; and (5) capital buffers are less effective in affecting loan premiums regardless of the business cycles.

However, an analysis of the growth rates of the components of HCE suggests that there is a causal effect of party affiliation on the prescription drugs component.

Particularly, we ask the following questions: (i) What are the conditions under which foreign firms choose to produce tainted goods? (ii) Does globalization via freer trade lower product safety? (iii) Why are goods imported even though they are known to be harmful? We show the existence of a free trade Nash equilibrium characterized by production and trade of high-quality non-tainted products. However, free trade cannot prevent the export of tainted goods, because the foreign firm may deviate under different combinations of parameters. We identify self-correcting mechanisms such as nationalism and a political-economy re-allocation of public resources in favor of customs authorities. Nevertheless, we also uncover activities that exacerbate tainted production like errors of testing and sabotage by rival firms. J. Japanese Int. Economies 35 (2015) 99-116.

Various econometric-parametric and nonparametric-methods are considered, reflecting the implications of persistence, endogeneity, the necessity of breaking down our panel regionally, trends and temporal instability, and the small number of countries within each panel. In particular, we propose a parametric inference method that corrects for potential weak-identification of the tipping point. Weak identification may occur if the true EKC is linear while a quadratic income term is nevertheless imposed into the estimated equation. Relevant literature to date confirms that non-linearity of the EKC is indeed not granted, which provides the motivation for our work. We also propose a non-parametric counterpart to the parametric confidence set, for sensitivity analysis. Viewed collectively, our results confirm an inverted U-shaped EKC in the OECD countries but generally not elsewhere, although a local-pollutant analysis suggests favorable exceptions beyond the OECD. Our measures of uncertainty confirm that it is difficult to identify economically plausible tipping points. Policy-relevant estimates of the tipping point can nevertheless be recovered from a local-pollutant long-run or non-parametric perspective.","[Bernard, Jean-Thomas] Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Gavin, Michael; Khalaf, Lynda; Voia, Marcel] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, CMFE, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",University of Ottawa; Carleton University,"Bernard, JT (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Dept Econ, Social Sci Bldg,120 Univ, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada.",jbernar3@uottawa.ca; mgavin@connect.carleton.ca; Lynda_Khalaf@carleton.ca; marcel-cristian_voia@carleton.ca,"Voia, Marcel-Cristian/ABF-7355-2022","Voia, Marcel/0000-0002-9895-5299; Gavin, Michael/0000-0003-4721-480X",,,,,58,28,30,0,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

This can be explained by the difficulty of fully addressing the complex nature of this relationship. Building on resource-based and evolutionary considerations, the present study investigates the dynamics between growth and profits of young firms by explicitly considering the endogeneity and heterogeneity aspects of the relationship. Data are based on a cohort of Spanish manufacturing firms tracked during the period 1996-2010. The results indicate that young firm growth has a positive impact on profits. In contrast, the effect of profits on growth is not significant. Neither is there a significant correlation between past and current growth. Importantly, we find that the results are strongly influenced by inter-firm heterogeneity. Implications from these findings are discussed.","[Federico, Juan S.] Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Entrepreneurial Dev Programme PRODEM, Inst Ind, RA-1663 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Capelleras, Joan-Lluis] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Bellaterra 08193, Cerdanyola Del, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Federico, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Gen Sarmiento, Entrepreneurial Dev Programme PRODEM, Inst Ind, JM Gutierrez 1150, RA-1663 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",jfederic@ungs.edu.ar; joanlluis.capelleras@uab.es,"Capelleras, Joan-Lluís/L-3806-2017","Capelleras, Joan-Lluis/0000-0003-3228-4717; Federico, Juan/0000-0001-8027-0518",,,,,82,19,31,0,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

After including conventional controls we find for a sample of 60 countries that our measure of CS robustly predicts the GEDI (unconditional correlation = 0.65, standardized beta = 0.42), an index that gives weight to both entrepreneurial attitudes within a nation and the institutional and economic prerequisites for creating high-value, high-growth firms.

The originality of this paper consists in the development of analysis at the lowest level of aggregation of spatial data, namely local administrative unit (LAU) level: village, town, and city. This offers great flexibility to the analysis, because administrative grouping of LAU in: counties, regions or macro-regions, is not usually linked by the business decisions. To develop the research and to prove the nature of relationship between existing business environment and entrepreneurial activities, has been used a research methodology based on spatial statistics and Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis. The methodology proposed in the paper is applied and validate in a case study.

Our baseline projection assumes that trade-related policies do not change in each region, but that endowments and real GDP do change, at exogenously selected rates. We use this baseline and its assumptions to analyse how potential global changes may affect the Indonesian economy over this and the next decade.

The concept was expected to ease the transferability of best practices in city logistics, by analyzing similarities and differences between zones. This research uses a quantitative methodology to apply the LP concept, and assess its potential, using the city of Lisbon as a case study. The analysis is focused on: (a) the extrapolation of freight trip generation per establishment and delivery characteristics from a sample of commercial establishments to the population within the case study, (b) proposing a methodology to test the LPs, (c) testing the existence of proposed LPs. Freight trips have been extrapolated using a Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) model. Freight delivery characteristics were attributed to establishments from a sample-based probability distribution. LPs were tested using a two-step cluster analysis. Some LPs have been matched with clusters of case-study zones, subject to case study particularities. Profile overlap was not an issue and occurrences were expected. The testing showed that Logistic Profiles have the potential for being used as a departure point for urban freight planning and policy analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

A multivariate Fractionally Integrated Asymmetric Power ARCH model with dynamic conditional correlations (DCC) is estimated under Student-t distribution. We provide strong evidence of persistence behavior in sukuk and sharia stock volatilities and a time-varying negative correlation. Using the Bai and Perron (2003. Journal of Applied Econometrics, 18, 1) test, we uncover structural breakpoints in the DCCs path corresponding to extreme external events including the failure of Lehman Brother's on September 2008. Such extreme events have increased the magnitude of the dynamic correlations between sharia-stocks and sukuk. We estimate a modified DCC model with exogenous variables (DCCX), which allows for exogenous variables to impact the behavior of the DCC over time. We find significant behavioral shifts in the sukuk/sharia stock relationship, which can be explained by market liquidity, U.S. CDS spreads and crude oil prices.

We compare real incomes of workers and pensioners across 14 regions of the Czech Republic. We find that taking into account regional differences in price levels compresses the income differences between regions for private sector employees, but increases them for pensioners and some groups of public-sector employees. This result is strengthened when we employ microeconomic data to reflect the education, occupations, age and gender of workers. Private-sector wages in Prague are 43% higher than in the rest of the country, but one half of this difference can be explained by Prague's higher price level and the other half by workers' characteristics. When we take these two factors into account, public-sector wages and pensions are the lowest in Prague. We discuss the benefits and costs of the government reflecting the regional price levels in setting public-sector wages or pensions.","[Bajgar, Matej] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Jansky, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, CZ-11000 Prague 1, Czech Republic",University of Oxford; Charles University Prague,"Bajgar, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",matej.bajgar@economics.ox.ac.uk; jansky.peta@gmail.com,"Bajgar, Matej/ABF-5012-2021; Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Bajgar, Matej/0000-0002-3780-7970; Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",,,,,14,2,2,0,11,VYSOKA SKOLA EKONOMICKA,PRAGUE,"NAM W CHURCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 13067, CZECH REPUBLIC",0032-3233,,,POLIT EKON,Polit.

However, sheep numbers fell substantially from 70 million in 1982 to 31 million in 2012. This has led to large-scale rationalization within the processing industry, causing major processing companies to now focus on in-house performance, including external relationships with suppliers and downstream customers. Yet, there are still openly adversarial relationships between processing companies and farmer suppliers with a prevalence of spot market relationships between many producers and processors. As the industry attempts to determine how to improve performance, a clearer understanding of producers' selling behaviors and the drivers behind such behaviors is needed in New Zealand to effectively move towards a more comprehensive and sustainable procurement strategy for the industry. This research provides insights into why, and what influences why individual farmers chose various selling channels within the lamb meat supply chain.","[Bensemann, Jessica] Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Shadbolt, Nicola] Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Farm & Agribusiness Management, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University; Massey University,"Shadbolt, N (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Inst Agr & Environm, Farm & Agribusiness Management, Private Bag 11-222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",n.m.shadbolt@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,,66,4,7,0,12,WAGENINGEN ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,WAGENINGEN,"PO BOX 220, WAGENINGEN, 6700 AE, NETHERLANDS",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

According to the results obtained fiscal policy was generally procyclical except 2013. In the period of economic growth 2006-2008, the fiscal policy was highly procyclical and it continued to be procyclical during the economic recovery of 2009-2012 because of the necessity to reduce the budget deficit and because of the financing constraints.

Innovations an important part of the modern public policy of the state, but, in the same time, it is an independent tool Over the past three decades, the issues related to how, when, where and why innovation occurs in the capitalist economy and how government policy can enhance innovation, came in first place among economic research. Although much has not yet been confirmed but one conclusion of the confidence we can make: effective government policy is a vital foundation for successful innovations and the state plays an indispensable role in promoting (or deceleration) of innovation. Innovations can not simply be put on the market for two main reasons. Firstly, successful innovation activity requires the creation and support of complex knowledge bases and infrastructure, which can not be provided by firms acting alone. As this infrastructure is built is determined by state policy. Second, innovations are characterized by investment liabilities increased risk and uncertainty, so the incentives structure and risk management processes are needed and, in turn, they are one of the most critical forms of public policy. In this paper we will try to determine effective government policy for promoting innovations. The study uprise from a necessity to explain the differences in policies that governments can provide to promote innovations. In the present study, systemic, functional and semiotic theory and methodology were used to go further then the earlier approach of identifying correct government innovation policy. New types of policies are needed to maximize innovation activities, particularly policies directed to networking and improving firm R&D activities. To promote capability and competitiveness effectively, government policy should focus on sectors in which the economy specialize.","[Braga, Denys] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-b, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Braga, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Int Relat, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-b, Bratislava 85235 5, Slovakia.",denys.braga@euba.sk,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,10,VYDAVATELSTVO EKONOM,BRATISLAVA,"DOLNOZENSKA CESTA 1-B, BRATISLAVA, 852 35, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-225-4200-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,68,75,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1SG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380432500008,0

In recent years, despite significant development in market of commercial health insurance, its relative rate in development, taking economic development and economic scale into consideration, is not as satisfying as expected. Therefore, based on the medical reform and public needs, the study of influential factors of commercial health insurance in Zhejiang Province in term of demands, has profound significance on the long-term development of insurance system. Meanwhile, the study can help insurance companies seize opportunities and pinpoint the features of residents' health care insurance in Zhejiang, to exploit more various and competitive products to win the market. Firstly in the study, five aspects, namely the economic development, disease risks, population status quo, social factors, and insurance consciousness, are selected to analyze the influential factors of development of commercial health insurance in Zhejiang. Then, with the data on per capita disposable income, per capita health care expenditure, total health care expenditure in government expenditures, the ratio of the elderly in population, urban population number and penetration of health care insurance, from 2000 to 2013. We use multiple linear regression model, to analyze influential ways and degrees of demands for commercial health insurance by each factors in Zhejiang. Empirical analysis shows that urban population number, penetration of health care insurance has a most important influence of commercial health insurance in Zhejiang Province; the ratio of the elderly in population impacts followed; the rest had no significant effect.

Forests are associated with helping to reduce flooding and represent the main source of wooden material. From a more subjective perspective, forests serve as places with both spiritual and recreate value. As a major global carbon deposit, forests have a critical role in influencing the Earth's ecosystem and climate. Given the fact that people are also part of the ecosystem we may only ask ourselves: Is there any influence of the forests on the population's health? This paper aims to analyse the links between the forest area and the volume of harvested wood and the population's health degree. In order to determine these links we will use a panel-type econometric model for the development regions of Romania. The econometric analysis aims to confirm a cause-effect relationship between the forests and the population's health degree. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This process is a highly complex one and involves the identification, evaluation and selection of the best opportunity among different investments. This should be that one which could bring the most significant positive impact over the company. In which concerns European funded projects, the decision making moment is a critical one since a wrong taken decision can bring the company in the brinks of downfall due to its high costs, loss of resources and/or loss of opportunity for the company. In the same time a well taken decision can also bring the company in a very good strategic position on the market. For the Romanian companies, especially under the current world economic crisis, proper decision making became an important factor for their success or failure. After taking into consideration these aspects the current study proposes to assess several decision making systems and to compare them. The comparison will include quantitative and qualitative aspects, as well as financial and non-financial aspects. Based on the findings the authors will propose a decision making system which can be used by the top management and shareholders of Romanian or foreign companies to support their investment decisions, especially those investments which target European/National financing. The proposed system was designed to solve the bottlenecks in the current evaluation system for the investment projects proposed to be financed within European funding; especially those related to increasing competitiveness at the level of private companies.

It is shown that if there is no serious positive correlation, using both estimators is always preferable. Simple average is justified if both estimators exhibit similar variances or when variances are unknown. Weighted average is optimal in all other cases. In valuation, the findings are, however, useful only in limited number of situations. Combining unbiased estimates obtained from the same relatively large and well composed sample of comparison companies is the most common possible application. The optimal weight rule in that case is based on variances, not on standard deviations or coefficients of variation. The approach is also useful for cross-checking expert weight assignment.

The study revealed that the majority of accountants do not have knowledge of XBRL nevertheless they are open to the idea of voluntary implementing XBRL in Romania. Although Romania is a provisional XBRL jurisdiction the research showed that the standard is not used in this country. We found that the Romanian accountants have a preference for an automated process for creation, editing, viewing and validation of XBRL instance files and they consider that the CFO has the main responsibility for the XBRL files reliability. I consider that my study enhances the academic understanding of XBRL by exposing also the perceptions and needs of Romanian accountants regarding the standard.

The Czech margins were calculated as the share of the domestic food prices (DP) on the consumer prices (CP) and import margins as the share of the imported food prices (IP) on CP. For these calculations the model AGRO-2014 was used. It is a mathematical model of the agrarian sector which is going out from agricultural production, over processing of agricultural raw materials on food, distribution to stores and subsequent consumption. Calculation of margins for the consumer basket includes such food groups for which there exist all kinds of prices. For that market basket there was calculated total fictitious sum of the entries in the DP, IP and CP.

When students are working in groups, they will be a part of a community whereby everyone will lend support to one another. This will provide the academic and social support in learning that students need. When students of different performance levels co-operate with each other in working towards achieving a desired goal, the students are not merely accountable for their own learning process but are also responsible for their peers' learning process as well. In other words, success will breed more success. The learning experience can be further enriched when the teaching method which is used takes into account the interests and motivation of the learners. Student motivation will be heightened as a result of collaborative learning. This is because the students will feel in charge and empowered in terms of their own learning process.

The logistic regression gives stronger results in terms of the interpretation, outperforming the linear regression and we are expecting that others methods as neural networks and support vector machine improve the last one.

We also test for significant differences in leverage decisions between these two groups by applying a dummy variable approach. Our findings show that fundamental differences exist between mining and non-mining companies when making leverage decisions. We find evidence that mining firms are more sensitive to profitability and asset tangibility where neither profitability nor asset tangibility has significant association for non-mining firms. Overall results suggest that industry-type does matter for firms making leverage decisions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

For this reason, financial considerations of households in this area depend on the activities of the state (public administration) in housing - on housing policy. Market system of housing allocation, whether ownership or tenancy, is based on the fact that housing is a scarce good. Its allocation is based on supply and demand. The market system in the area of housing can sometimes have a negative impact on some households, the market is unable to satisfy certain groups of the population that are not able or willing to accept market price. For these reasons, there is a more or less regulation of the market. Regulation is both on the demand and supply side, and the government determines the rules of behaviour for all economic entities of the housing market. This article submits results of analysis of selected regulatory interference of the Czech state in the Czech housing market and assesses their implications deforming the market.

While the Balkans have traditionally been considered to lie on the periphery of financial phenomena, this wide assessment of the region has changed with the large-scale turmoil caused by the Greek Sovereign Debt crisis. Therefore, to curb nascent instability, financial authorities should remain alert and devise a mechanism able to effectively detect stress in their respective financial systems. So far - in the quest to build a comprehensive and universal Early Warning System - a number of broad measures and indicators have been proposed; however, none of them have been specifically tailored to reflect the distinct character of the Balkan countries with their diverse, yet analogous political, social and economic idiosyncrasies. This paper attempts to tackle this issue from a financial policy standpoint by contributing to the current literature on the subject in three separate ways. First, it builds upon the most recent findings in this area to develop an aggregate financial stability index that measures financial stability levels in nine countries geographically belonging to the Balkan region, entirely or at least in part. Most importantly, this index juxtaposes some well known IMF- backed Financial Soundness and macroprudential indicators with World Bank development indicators and CESifo measures of world economic climate. Second, the authors perform a Chanut-Laroque analysis of contribution to volatility levels in the aggregate stability index in order to explore which sub-indexes can explain the improvement or deterioration of the index value for the 1995-2011 period. Third, this paper compares and contrasts the evolution of financial stability of two sub-indices reflecting the diverging nature of the two groups of countries (Western Balkans vs. EU members) regarding their standing relative to European Union status.

Approximately 99% of the total number of enterprises in BiH are SMEs. Moreover, 41.85% of the total number of employed persons in BiH is employed in SMEs. However, major problem faced by SMEs is access to finance. This paper investigates the problems of SMEs' access to finance in the European Union (EU) focusing on the institutional framework for resolving the gap between SMEs' needs for external financing, on the one hand, and financial products/services offered by financial institutions, on the other hand. Furthermore, the aim of this paper is to address this issue by determining the degree of adequacy of different financial products/services available to SMEs in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and by evaluating the existing institutional framework for attracting different types of financial institutions (especially banks), which are capable to offer financial products/services tailored to the needs of SMEs. In order to assess the existing institutional framework for better access to finance for SMEs, a survey among SMEs in FBiH and financial institutions was conducted. As the research results show, it is important that financial institutions, as well as SMEs, engage in lobbying the government bodies to change regulations governing the SME sector. In that respect, the banking agencies of FBiH and Republic of Srpska, as the state supervisory bodies for banks, should, together with banks, start initiatives to change the laws on taxation of SMEs.","[Kokorovic Jukan, Meldina; Kozarevic, Emira; Nuhanovic, Senija] Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla,"Kokorovic Jukan, M (通讯作者)，Univ Tuzla, Fac Econ, Tuzla, Bosnia & Herceg.",meldina.kokorovic@untz.ba; emira.kozarevic@untz.ba; senija.nuhanovic@untz.ba,"Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/AAS-7598-2021","Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/0000-0002-4954-5437",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,"UNIV TUZLA, FAC ECONOMICS",TUZLA,"UNIVERZITETSKA 8, TUZLA, 75 000, BOSNIA & HERCEG",2490-2616,,,INT SCI C ECON INTEG,,,2015,,,,,,,38,56,,,,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI2UE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000410383700002,0

The results show that when a temporary change in taxation is made, that is removed in the next period, there is a temporary decline in the economic growth rate, but over time it stabilizes at its original level. In contrast, in the case of permanent tax changes, the rate of economic growth stabilizes at a new level that persists in the economy even after ten years, although there is also a steady increase in the growth rate of government spending in the economy.","[Kotlan, Igor; Machova, Zuzana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Kotlán, I (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",igor.kotlan@vsb.cz; zuzana.machova@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,43,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-114-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,424,434,,,,,,11,Economics; Public Administration,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE0GT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366004300045,0

This paper analyzes the issues of the Bosnia and Herzegovina pension system in the sense of maintaining an appropriate living standard of the third age population in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Basic goal of the paper is to emphasize the importance of risks related to the third age of Bosnia and Herzegovina population due to the existing unsustainable pension system. For that reason, individual responsibility of a person and private savings become more important for a proper financing of living standards in the third age. Voluntary private pension funds and life insurance products are possible answers to a worsen picture of the pension system and provision of additional income in the third age.

Annual shares of different PDSs are determined separately for residential, industrial and business premises, as well as other buildings - mainly public service buildings. The paper also sheds light on changes in the market structure to the extent that they influence the use of different PDSs in order to discover the key factors which could possibly hamper making conclusions about general trends in, and the impact of the economic situation on, the selection a PDS for a project. As to the results, the study shows that the separate contracts method is used the most while the share of construction management is the smallest. In-house construction, design-build and the traditional comprehensive contract are other systems used whose shares fall between the above two extremes. Changes in market structure over time most likely influence the use of different PDSs in housing construction. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Changes in tax rates have two effects on tax revenues: the arithmetic effect and the economic effect. The arithmetic effect is simply that if tax rates are lowered, tax revenues (per euro of tax base) will be lowered by the amount of the decrease in the rate. The economic effect, however, recognizes the positive impact that lower tax rates have on property assets by providing incentives to increase this activity. Raising tax rates has the opposite economic effect by penalizing participation in property assets activities. The arithmetic effect always works in the opposite direction from the economic effect. The property assets are affected, not only by property tax, but from all other direct and indirect taxes and, thus, the taxation environment has serious impact in Real Estate activities. By constructing a Whole-Life Costing (WLC) model for a commercial property asset and by using sensitivity analysis we examine the impact of tax environment, ceteris paribus, on a property asset value. With this way, we estimate the level of tax rate per tax and globally, penalizing the participation on commercial property assets activities.

The econometric hedonic housing price model is developed and estimated for the Cracow urban area. Many forms of the hedonic price function can be used to describe the relationships between price and housing characteristics. To select the most appropriate model the goodness of fit test was performed. The Analysis and Monitoring of Real Estate Market Transactions (AMRON) database of Polish Banks Association containing data regarding mainly structural characteristics and transaction prices of real estate is used with observations between 2013 and 2014 years. The GIS technique is applied for implementation to the database neighborhood and location attributes. In the logarithmic model there are five significant variables: distance to the city center, distance to shopping center, total floor area, age of the building and garage or parking place. The findings are comparable with other studies and suggest that, as expected, the distance to the city center and to the shopping center is negatively correlated with housing price. Households are willing to pay more for apartments with garage or parking place, with larger floor area and situated in the building of younger age. Interestingly, however, whether surrounding area is potentially threatened by the flood or not is not a significant attribute. The findings could help to fine tune the developing housing market to match supply with demand in quality terms.","[Ligus, Magdalena] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance & Value Based Management, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Peternek, Piotr] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Operat Res, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Ligus, M (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Dept Corp Finance & Value Based Management, Fac Management Comp Sci & Finance, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",magdalena.ligus@ue.wroc.pl; piotr.peternek@ue.wroc.pl,"Peternek, Piotr/U-1044-2018; Ligus, Magdalena/P-2958-2018","Peternek, Piotr/0000-0002-7621-1256;",,,,,13,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,480,489,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000053,0

The analysis is based on forward-looking Actual and Perceived Taylor Rules for the European Central Bank which are estimated in real-time using a newly constructed database for the period April 2000-November 2009. The former policy rule is based on the actual refirate set by the Governing Council, while the latter is estimated for the bank's economists using their main point forecast for the upcoming refi rate decision as a dependent variable. The empirical evidence shows that the pattern of the refi rate is broadly well predicted by the professional forecasters even though the latter have foreseen more accurately the increases rather than the policy rate cuts. Second, the results point to an increasing responsiveness of the ECB to macroeconomic fundamentals along the forecast horizon. Third, the rolling window regressions suggest that the estimated coefficients have changed after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in October 2008; the ECB has responded less strongly to macroeconomic fundamentals and the degree of policy inertia has decreased. A sensitivity analysis shows that the baseline results are robust to applying a recursive window methodology and some of the findings are qualitatively unaltered from using Consensus Economics forecasts in the regressions.","Pictet Asset Management, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland",,"Markov, N (通讯作者)，Pictet Asset Management, Route Acacias 60, CH-1211 Geneva 73, Switzerland.",nmarkov@pictet.com,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,1,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",1571-0386,,978-1-78441-779-6; 978-1-78441-780-2,INT SYMP EC,,,2015,24.0,,,,,,195,266,,10.1108/S1571-038620150000024019,0.0,,,72,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD1ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358537900008,0

The research carried out has revealed that the power and scope of globalization impacts in Baltic countries business environments (with the few exceptions) is gradually diminishing. The findings in general correspond with the trends in global markets that the process of globalization is gradually turning into functional regionalization. However, it is important to emphasize, that this new regionalization phenomenon is very different in forms, scope and origins than that of the sixties and seventies. The core conclusion of the research carried out is the following: the economic impacts of globalization process are progressively diminishing, however there are new unforeseen impacts evolving and there will be even more challenges for economic subjects to face in the future trying to stay competitive in volatile business environments.

For the sample of the largest nine Czech and four Slovak banks we aim to identify the strategies that these banks adopted in order to increase their capital ratios. Our analysis shows that for Czech banks as with the large multi-national banks from advanced economies, increased capital has played a major role in increasing the average capital ratio. Slovak banks, in addition, significantly decreased their risk to strengthen the overall ratio. The results of our analysis are useful mainly from a regulatory point of view as in both the Czech Republic and Slovakia the countercyclical buffer is set to its minimum of 0% of risk-weighted assets and the national regulators may increase the buffer up to 2.5% in the medium or long term.

Exploring different dimensions of sustainability should be connected with the exploration of quality of life and developments on a global level as it is there, where sustainability can be destroyed or ensured. Sustainability should be based on social cohesion. The reason behind this is the difficulty in integrating the numerous needs of citizens and requirements of different cultures. This paper explores the link between quality of life and sustainability, it shows a model that explains how sustainability can help to improve the quality of life of citizens, examining, in particular, how culture and the territory (state, regional, provincial or local level) must be integrated in the development model. The research considers that the goal of sustainable development is to enable all people throughout the world to satisfy their basic needs and enjoy a better quality of life, without compromising the quality of life of future generations. In this paper we argue that sustainable social development offers the most appropriate set of values for the creation and maintenance of good level of quality of life.","[Mella, Piero] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via S Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy; [Gazzola, Patrizia] Insubria Univ, Dept Econ, I-21100 Varese, Italy",University of Pavia; University of Insubria,"Mella, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Via S Felice 5, I-27100 Pavia, Italy.",piero.mella@unipv.it; patrizia.gazzola@uninsubria.it,,,,,,,37,6,6,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-342-4,,,,2015,,,,,,,542,551,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2FW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380464000060,0

The problem of this branch in the Czech Republic is its low competitiveness. This is the main reason why this branch is analyzed in the paper. The aim of the paper is to evaluate the development of key structural and economic indicators of the meat processing industry in all Central European countries. Moreover, Germany and Austria, as the main trade partners of the Czech Republic, are also compared with the Central European region. The purpose of the paper is to define the position of the Czech meat processing industry towards its main trade partners. The paper is based on the comparative analysis of structural indicators (number of enterprises, number of persons employed per enterprise), economic features (investment, production value, gross value added) and personnel costs analysis. The evaluation covers the time period 2008 - 2012. The main data source for the analysis is the database of the Eurostat structural business statistics. For a better comparability and relevance of the result, most indicators in branch Processing and preserving of meat and production of meat products are calculated per person employed. The indicators are evaluated over time though horizontal analysis and indexes. The results of the comparison show some differences between countries. Except Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic has the highest labor productivity; Slovakia and Poland have the lowest. More in-depth results of the structural and economic analysis in this branch are described and discussed in this article.","[Naglova, Zdenka; Spicka, Jindrich] Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Econ Agrarian Sect, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic",Institute of Agricultural Economics & Information - Czech Republic,"Náglová, Z (通讯作者)，Inst Agr Econ & Informat, Dept Econ Agrarian Sect, Manesova 75, Prague 12000 2, Czech Republic.",spicka.jindrich@uzei.cz,"Naglova, Zdenka/W-7256-2019; Spicka, Jindrich/C-9855-2013","Naglova, Zdenka/0000-0001-5871-1735; Spicka, Jindrich/0000-0001-5699-9544",,,,,9,2,2,1,2,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,292,299,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600032,0

Nevertheless, the fact is that the proportion of men and women differs for individual ministries. Analysis of the age structure of the examined group of employees for all ministries refutes the widespread public assumption of overage ministries. The overall median age of employees in all ministries is 42 years. Individual ministries, however, differ in their age structure. Adoption of the chi-square test also confirmed that the factor of ministry (type of ministry) has an impact on the age of employees. From the perspective of education, all the ministries have on average 89% university-educated employees. However, our research at the same time shows that among individual ministries there are obvious differences.

Empirical results suggest that plant size and regulatory changes have contributed to a 50 percent reduction in Salmonella on chicken. These lower Salmonella levels will likely strengthen the U.S. bargaining position in trade negotiations and enhance the U.S. reputation in world trade but will not likely result in immediate export gains.","[Ollinger, Michael] USDA, Diet Safety Econ Branch, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA; [Taha, Fawzi A.] USDA, Food Secur & Dev Branch, Econ Res Serv, Washington, DC 20024 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Ollinger, M (通讯作者)，USDA, Diet Safety Econ Branch, Econ Res Serv, 355 E St NW, Washington, DC 20024 USA.",ollinger@ers.usda.gov; ftaha@ers.usda.gov,,,,,,,23,1,2,0,4,INT FOOD & AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW,COLLEGE STATION,"333 BLOCKER BUILDING, 2124 TAMU, COLLEGE STATION, TX 77843-2124 USA",1559-2448,,,INT FOOD AGRIBUS MAN,Int.

Economic integration is based upon an economic arrangement between different regions, regarding the elimination of trade barriers and the coordination of monetary and fiscal policies. However, the participation of Greece in the Economic and Monetary Union and the adoption of the Euro ((sic)) as national currency, restricted country's international competitiveness. Despite the income increase, which rose from (sic) 5,500 (1991) to (sic) 17,745 (2008 before the economic crisis) thanks to the Greek accession to the EEC in 1981, the production system could not take advantage of the new conditions, due to its inability to resolve its vast structural and systemic weaknesses. The Greek society had a strictly short term view depending on the exploitation of the EU capital inflows, and the economic growth did not contribute either to growth in productivity or competitiveness for the country. Apart from economic integration, Greece also experienced intensely a social integration, which led to the differentiation in attitude for a large majority of Greeks. The rise of standards of living as well as the trend towards modernization, which characterize the Greek European integration, instead of reflecting a convergence, it is mostly characterized by a cultural imperialism, which is based on the idea of the poor countries of the European periphery imitating the rich of the center. However, the imitation of the western European consumption patterns could not be self-supported due to the lack of wealth, which led to borrowing and finally to the phenomenon of the over-indebted households. The country was introduced in an era of narcissism, which led to a collateral drawback, the downgrade of its social capital. (C) 2015 The Authors.

From this triple perspective it is necessary to assess whether a coordinated approach of the Black Sea region will be able to improve and sustain the European energy security and first of all Romania's national energy security, by applying strategies for diversifying supply sources, by stimulating competition on the supply side, through the efficient turning to account of its own resources and by connecting to the infrastructure projects allowing diversification of transport routes and access to new sources of energy, including return flows from West Europe. Although by the cancellation of Nabucco project, Romania has been deprived of an important infrastructure project it has, at least theoretically, other sources and opportunities to enhance energy security, thanks to discoveries in the Black Sea offshore area, to potential shale gas and renewable energy resources and last but not least by its nuclear energy capacity and potential. The year 2020 is looming as a common deadline for Europe in achieving several strategic objectives (the possibility of starting shale gas production in some European countries, the completion of major transport gas corridors gas, early operations of natural gas development in Black Sea waters etc) each of them marked by a substantial dose of uncertainty. But the current year could bring, in many respects, an economic, political and strategic clarification for Romania, given that the industry is renegotiating the fiscal regime for oil and gas extraction. The new tax system must be designed in a manner that stimulates equally the interests of foreign investors-because of large necessary investment funds, difficult geological conditions, lack of technological know-how and of capacity to access funding mechanisms and global portfolios by Romania-while ensuring a resource recovery to the benefit of the society.

The liberalization of international trade and investment flows has contributed to the spread of the effects of technological progress and influenced development in many countries, but also raised a number of limitations in opportunities for achieving sustainable development. Decade of the nineties of the twentieth century can be characterized as a period of increasing pressure on the environment, the direct recipient of pollutants, resulting from the use of dirty manufacturing processes and production techniques, as well as the space through which manufactured products are distributed, used and postponed. The uncontrolled use of natural resources, especially non-renewable, has led to the endangerment of existential prerequisite for the maintenance of a healthy environment, as well as deterioration of environmental quality and escalating environmental problems on a global level. Under pressure from institutional factors, multinational corporations (MNCs), as motor of developments in the world economy, today pay more attention to the integration of the dimensions of sustainability in its own operations. Involving aspects of managing the impacts of corporate activities on social development and the environment is in the function of sustainable business. Development of key competences in the area of addressing social and environmental issues is a prerequisite of achieving and sustaining competitive advantage of MNCs in the modern market. In addition, long-term negligence of the non-financial aspects of the business can make multiple negative effects on the financial performance and the reduction of corporate reputation among key stakeholders, thereby reducing its competitive advantage. Great impact on the rise of social-economic consciousness of MNCs was made by a bulk of problems caused by negative consequences of their activities, which gave rise to boycott of consumers and other stakeholders. This resulted in the decrease of enterprise credibility, ruin of their reputation, built in years, and failure in competitiveness. An MNC management team has realized that un-responsible behavior towards environment could have a boomerang effect to it. On the other hand, responsible behavior of enterprises towards stakeholders, society, and environment could contribute to achievement of competitive advantage. For example, by ensuring good working conditions to employees, by instigation of non-discrimination, by respecting of human rights, and by offering a possibility of advancement, MNC become attractive for new employees, especially most talented people. By insuring transparency towards shareholders, and respect of their rights, by continuous reporting, and risk management, MNC become attractive for new investments. By offering quality, healthy, and safe products, and by performing promises about after-sale services, enterprises become attractive for consumers. Talented employees, substantial capital, and safe market are the key conditions for achieving MNC competitive advantage. Hence, it is obvious that social responsible behavior of MNC becomes important factor of their survival and success. By explaining the impact of corporate social responsibility on the competitiveness of MNCs, the aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of such practice for the competitiveness of MNCs.

As the international visibility of localities cannot be increased unless thoughtful and well-funded investment plans are implemented to remediate local infrastructure, local public authorities must see that citizens are still satisfied with the level of taxation and the public services provided. Local public authorities must prove fully responsible with the public money and grant low-income people the possibility to pay taxes by installments. Additionally, they must innovate, granting citizens various methods of payment of taxes and duties due: at the cash desk, through bank transfer or by credit card.

In addition, other control variables including trade and intra-industry trade intensity, spatial and time dummies are applied in the regression model. The set of instrumental variables comprises various tax indicators, government expenditures and government political orientation measure. Various filtering techniques and macroeconomic indicators are applied to identify the business cycles.

It is assumed that the entire demand has a general non-linear form and the cost function is quadratic. The equilibrium of the model is equal to the level of price that maximizes profits, as can be seen in the classical microeconomic theory.

Measuring national rate of self-sufficiency clearly depict level of competitiveness, as in countries with low level of self-sufficiency usually the competitiveness of production and processing lag behind. Authors also use trade coverage indicator. In the framework of European Environmental Policy, specifically due to the European Bio Fuels Policy, significance of oil-bearing crops increased. Therefore the main aim of the article is to analyse competitiveness of selected V4 countries with respect to production of most widely cultivated oil-bearing crops in the region-oil seed rape and sunflower. Authors need to derive necessary information from national competent authorities (Ministries of Agriculture, National Statistical Offices, Eurostat, etc.). Information about foreign trade have been collected from the Market Access Database of the European Commission. Based on the available data we can expect conclusions, that European Bio Fuels policy had significant effect on production amounts in all analysed countries as its harvested area increased from 3 to 9 %. All countries evince self-sufficiency in oilseed rape production. Results of trade coverage evidence high competitiveness in production of oilseed rape by large exports of raw and processed material to Western Europe. Contrary to rape, CZ is not self-sufficient in sunflower due to decrease in production area and increase in consumption over last few years. But SK is self-sufficient in production of sunflower, its competitiveness is underlined by net exports of sunflower both in value and volume terms.","[Slaboch, Josef; Kotyza, Pavel] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Slaboch, J (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",jslaboch@pef.czu.cz; kotyza@pef.czu.cz,"Pavel, Kotyza/H-1840-2018; Slaboch, josef/H-3023-2018","Pavel, Kotyza/0000-0002-7706-7372; Slaboch, josef/0000-0002-7396-835X",,,,,23,6,6,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,363,375,,,,,,13,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600041,0

We analyse the voting behaviour of EU Member States (MSs) for voting results from 2003 to 2015 on the approval of GE crops to test for a gridlock; no reliable data are available pre-2003 - a time which included the EU's moratorium on GE crops. After the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has given a favourable opinion on the safety of a GE crop, the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH) votes on the application. If the SCFCAH reaches no decision, the Appeal Committee (AC) (pre the Treaty of Lisbon: the Council) votes on the application; if no decision is reached here, the final decision is left to the European Commission. All EU Member States (MSs) are represented on both committees; decisions are made by a qualified majority (QM) voting system, the rules of which have changed over time. Our data include 50 events; and 61 ballots at the SCFCAH and 57 ballots at the Council / AC. A QM has been achieved once only at the SCFCAH, but never at Council. At Council / AC level, Austria and Croatia have consistently voted against an approval, while The Netherlands has always supported approvals. All other MSs showed differences in their voting decisions at the SCFCAH and Council / AC level at least once. MS-fixed-effects are the major factors explaining the voting results supporting the gridlock hypothesis, while crop characteristics and crop use play no apparent role in MSs' voting behaviour. We maintain that a QM is unlikely following the latest directive for MSs to 'opt-out' on GE crop cultivation in their territories.","[Smart, Richard D.] Tech Univ Munich, Ctr Food & Life Sci Weihenstephan, D-80290 Munich, Germany; [Blum, Matthias] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast BT7 1NN, Antrim, North Ireland; [Wesseler, Justus] Wageningen Univ, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands",Technical University of Munich; Queens University Belfast; Wageningen University & Research,"Wesseler, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Chair Agr Econ & Rural Policy Grp, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",justus.wesseler@wur.nl,"Wesseler, Justus/H-5347-2016",,,,,,49,45,48,0,14,DEUTSCHER FACHVERLAG GMBH,FRANKFURT MAIN,"MAINZER LANDSTRASSE 251, 60328 FRANKFURT MAIN, GERMANY",0002-1121,0515-6866,,GER J AGR ECON,Ger.

Globalisation has removed the borders and shortened the distances between the countries. Some reasons such as information speed, shortening of distances and competition have brought innovative solutions in international business transactions. If we look generally to innovative developments in international business life, the most important examples are observed at payment and delivery terms. Recently with the impact of the revision made in 2010 there were radical changes at INCOTERMS. On the other hand a new form of payment BPO has been suggested to importers and exporters which hosts speed, technology and trust factors inside. One of the most important issues in international business transaction is payment. Exporter and importer pay similar attention to this subject and both of them wonder about how and when the payment will be done. Thus far, with effect of competition, speed and technology traditional payment terms such as cash, cash against documents and letter of credit remained inadequate, unreliable and expensive. In order to meet these needs, developing new payment method BPO has taken place in international business since 2013. In this study, payment terms in international business were examined. On the other hand, from the moment it entered into force in 2013, the new payment term BPO how often used, and previously which payment terms used instead of BPO were analysed. However, BPO and other payment terms are compared with each other and BPO's effects on Turkish international business life are also determined.

Soils are threatened by two basic dangers: the various soil degradation processes (water and wind erosion, acidification, salinisation, physical and biological degradation, unfavourable changes in the humus content and a decrease in the buffer capacity) as well as pollution. In spite of all these, quality, functionality and productivity of soils can be preserved and maintained. Our aim is developing a statistical based information system from the data of the Hungarian Soil Information Monitoring System measured points. We developed a method for estimating element content. To determine the concentration of the elements, we need only the GPS co-ordinates of the place based on the number of nearest neighbouring points. This method does not calculate with spatial circumstances. The other possibility is using the kriging method (spatial interpolation) for estimating more precisely the element content. In this study these two methods are compared. Building our statistical based information system has to determine the number of nearest neighbouring points to be considered in the case of certain elements. We discovered that elements can be ranged only into two groups depending on how many nearest neighbouring diagnostic points were considered to kriging. 3 neighbouring diagnostical points: K, P, Sr 10 neighbouring diagnostical points: Al, B, Ba, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, S, Ti, V, Y, Zn Using this method the soil pollution locations and elements and its concentration can be determined. The other important question is to investigate the socio-economic factors of these soil pollutions. There are a lot of data in the Eurostat database which can show the socio-economic effect of these pollutions. Based on these data is concluded that usage amount of chemical fertilizer, total population and total grain yield are the three most important socio-economic factors that contribute to soil heavy metal pollution. Enterprise amount, total cultivated area, gross value of farming, forestry, animal husbandry product as well as total freight amount have less impact on soil heavy metals pollution. Last and least impact factors are GDP and value of industry output in rural area. This article shows our research results on the field of socio-economic factors of soil pollution used by statistical analyses, based on the Eurostat database in Hungary and across Europe.

Regional foods or products not only promote regions; they also create new work places, they are significant potentials in the development of tourist industry (in particular gastro-tourism) and, last but not least, they give local citizens a sense of belonging to a region. The research is focused on the awareness of selected region citizens about regional foods in relation to quality, origin, trademark, price and impact on sustainable development in the promotion of the region. Taking into account regional development actors' view, the paper analyses whether the producers of regional foods experienced changes in economic profitability after receiving the mark and what significance the regional food mark has on the development of promotion in the region. Based on wider research questions, a general hypothesis and several work hypotheses were stated. The field survey was carried out with the help of a quantitative approach using techniques of questioning. The collated data were analysed using mathematical-statistic methods. The role of a quantitative survey using semi-standardised interviews with producers of awarded regional foods was to find out benefits and contribution of regional foods to the development of entrepreneurial activity both from a perspective of regional development and tourism. The elicited findings were analysed and discussed to draw conclusions.","[Varvazovska, Pavla] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Jarkovska, Martina] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Languages, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic; [Salkova, Daniela] CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Trade & Accounting, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic",Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague; Czech University of Life Sciences Prague,"Varvazovská, P (通讯作者)，CULS Prague, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Humanities, Kamycka 129, Prague 16521 6, Suchdol, Czech Republic.",varvazovska@pef.czu.cz; jarkovska@pef.czu.cz; salkova@pef.czu.cz,"Jarkovská, Martina/G-5493-2017; Salkova, Daniela/H-4401-2018","Jarkovská, Martina/0000-0003-4481-3743; Salkova, Daniela/0000-0002-9930-8595",,,,,13,2,2,0,4,CZECH UNIVERSITY LIFE SCIENCES PRAGUE,PRAGUE 6,"DEPT SYSTEMS ENG, KAMYCKA 129, PRAGUE 6 165 21, CZECH REPUBLIC",1213-7960,2464-4781,978-80-213-2581-4,AGRARIAN PERSPECT,,,2015,,,,,,,495,501,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373210600057,0

Currently, there is a lack in formal guidance over the usage of China's financial investment in agricultural science, in some regions the level of agricultural science and technology continues to lag behind, policy objectives have over the years being largely inconsistent, and there is a lack of focus on grooming talents to be expert specialists in agricultural technology. To solve these problems so as to achieve sustainable development in China, this thesis advocates for the further improvement in China's agricultural policies, financial technology system, technology management and services systems, technology policy system must be further improved and perfected with further investment in providing training to groom talents in the agricultural field. At the 2014 Central Economic Work Conference, it concluded that the transformation of agricultural development should be accelerated. As traditional economical policies is no longer as effective as before, technological innovations have become the most important indicator of the economic development provided. Technological innovation is a necessary means to achieve agricultural modernization, uplifting the Chinese agricultural model from its traditional form to be on par with modern technological standards. However due to various factors such as a weak foundation in agriculture, low level of mechanization, and an ever decreasing pool of rural labour force etc., the modernization of China's agriculture has been strictly restricted. By promoting innovations in agricultural technology, grain yield and quality will be maintained, ensuring the livelihood of the farmers, ultimately leading to a rapid and steady development in rural areas, protecting rural areas from being abandoned or urbanized.","[Wang, Wei; Sun, Chen-Chen] Harbin Univ Commerce, Inst Publ Finance & Adm, Harbin, Peoples R China",Harbin University of Commerce,"Wang, W (通讯作者)，Harbin Univ Commerce, Inst Publ Finance & Adm, Harbin, Peoples R China.",ww_77@126.com; 464448583@qq.com,"wang, zhe/JNE-3510-2023; liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023",,,,,,5,1,1,0,12,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-220-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,17,20,,,,,,4,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD4UG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361124400004,0

The paper mainly introduces the research and practice of this teaching mode, and demonstrates the feasibility of applying Teach-Learn-Do amalgamation in the specialized course The automobile engine electronic control technology. What's more, the paper verifies the success and necessity of teaching mode Teach-Learn-Do amalgamation in the specialized course through the good teaching results after specific implementation. According to the survey of magazine Auto Fan, in the teaching of automobile major, more than 40% of higher vocational colleges around the country still adopt the traditional mode, that is to only pass on theoretical knowledge in theory class, then receive practical teaching after completing the theory course. The biggest weakness of the traditional teaching method is theoretical management, in which the theory and practice are disconnected. In the process of learning theory, students feel boring and have no interest, so the study effect is unsatisfactory and the basic theoretical knowledge is weak; the students have high interest in the practical teaching but the ideal results can't be achieved due to lack of solid theoretical knowledge. What's worse, outdated theory is still passed on in some schools, which disconnects the practical teaching contents, and not enough time for practice or old practice equipment, which fall behind the actual technical requirement significantly, leading to scarce practical knowledge. According to the statistics of human resources and social security, more than 90% of recruitment units disagree with traditional teaching mode as three-month learning in the repair factory has better results than three-year school learning. In this situation, under the joint efforts of education departments at all levels and department of human resources and social security, the new teaching mode is born at the right moment, which is Teach-Learn-Do amalgamation.","Liaoning Jidian Polytech, Dandong 118009, Liaoning, Peoples R China",,"Yang, DM (通讯作者)，Liaoning Jidian Polytech, Dandong 118009, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",171999142@qq.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-68-4,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,8.0,,,,,,1265,1269,,,,,,5,Business; Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD7OC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363373700248,0

The extant family firm research has extensively adopted an input-output approach to the study of boards, but results have been inconclusive, calling for further research on intervening processes. By examining board ownership, this study shows that board processes are shaped by the life cycles of family firms across generations, as reflected in ownership dispersion among family directors: Cognitive conflict is the highest and the use of knowledge and skills is the lowest when the levels of balance in a board's voting power are moderate, which occurs when the board mostly mirrors a sibling partnership.

Still, it varies between and within countries, as well as over time, and irrespective of whether one values it for its own sake or for its beneficial consequences, it becomes important to identify its determinants. In this study, we investigate whether the character of economic policy plays a role, by looking at the effect of changes in economic freedom (i.e., lower government expenditures, lower and more general taxes and more modest regulation) on tolerance in one of the most market oriented countries, the United States. In comparing U.S. states, we find that an increase in the willingness to let atheists, homosexuals and communists speak, keep books in libraries and teach college students is, overall, positively related to preceding increases in economic freedom, more specifically in the form of more general taxes. We suggest, as one explanation, that a discriminatory tax system, which is susceptible to the influence of special interests and which treats people differently, gives rise to feelings of tension and conflict. In contrast, the positive association for tolerance towards racists only applies to speech and books, not to teaching, which may indicate that when it comes to educating the young, (in)tolerant attitudes towards racists are more fixed.

A 2-factor model that accounts for creative-destruction risk effectively explains the cross-sectional return variation of size-and book-to-market-sorted portfolios.

The reforms aim to reduce interconnectedness and improve counterparty risk management in these important markets. At the same time, however, the reforms necessarily concentrate risk in one or a few nodes in the financial network and also increase institutions' demand for high-quality assets to meet collateral requirements. This paper looks more closely at the implications of increased CCP clearing for both the topology and stability of the financial network. Building on Heath et al. (2013) and Markose (2012), the analysis supports the view that the concentration of risk in CCPs could generate instability if not appropriately managed. Nevertheless, maintaining CCP prefunded financial resources in accordance with international standards and dispersing any unfunded losses widely through the system can limit the potential for a CCP to transmit stress even in very extreme market conditions. The analysis uses the Bank for International Settlements Macroeconomic Assessment Group on Derivatives (MAGD) data set on the derivatives positions of the 41 largest bank participants in global OTC derivative markets in 2012.

Using a panel Granger non-causality approach, we reject the null hypothesis of Granger non-causality running from income inequality to economic freedom, but not vice versa. From a series of dynamic panel estimations we show that the effect of income inequality on economic freedom is negative and robust to the inclusion of additional controls. In particular, inequality is negatively associated with those components of economic freedom related to international trade, domestic market regulation as well as the rule of law and property rights protection. We argue that the negative effect of inequality on economic freedom is due to the economic elite converting its economic power into de facto political power to defend its economic interests; these interests run counter to economic freedom, discouraging innovation and competition as well as protecting the elite's rents. Finally, we show that economic freedom decreases with income inequality even in democratic countries, suggesting that democratic institutions do not prevent economic freedom from eroding. We argue that the latter finding corresponds to a system of political capitalism or captured democracy, where a powerful economic elite can nevertheless exercise de facto political power by cooperating with politicians and other decision-makers for their mutual benefit.","[Krieger, Tim; Meierrieks, Daniel] Univ Freiburg, Wilhelms Trasse 1b, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany; [Krieger, Tim] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Freiburg; Ifo Institut,"Meierrieks, D (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Wilhelms Trasse 1b, D-79098 Freiburg, Germany.",tim.krieger@vwl.uni-freiburg.de; daniel.meierrieks@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,"Krieger, Tim/G-6241-2012","Krieger, Tim/0000-0003-0045-9172",,,,,62,40,40,3,48,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",0176-2680,1873-5703,,EUR J POLIT ECON,Eur.

While there exists a fruitful and promising literature analyzing M&A activities in general, there is only limited evidence available on the acquisitions of high-tech start-ups and entrepreneurial firms by larger incumbents. This study addresses this issue and focuses on acquisitions targeted at public IPO firms. Our main interest is whether and how the stock market evaluates the specific human capital of the CEO and founder of the entrepreneurial target firm. While in general target firms assets are positively evaluated by market participants, this should not necessarily hold for assets owned by the founder of the target firm. The findings clearly show that stock market participants positively evaluate target firms intangible assets, as measured by patents. But that also the opposite holds if the assets are under control of the founder CEO. Our results thus strongly support conclusions derived from property rights or incomplete contract theory on joined ownership of assets and performance. We conclude that the acquirer's post-acquisition performance strongly depends on the continued access to the targets' specific intangible assets, which is not necessarily the case for the founder's specific human capital.","[Lehmann, Erik E.] Univ Augsburg, Univ Str 16, D-86159 Augsburg, Germany; [Schwerdtfeger, Manuel T.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",University of Augsburg; Leibniz University Hannover,"Schwerdtfeger, MT (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",manuel.schwerdtfeger@ufo-uni.hannover.de,,,,,,,100,6,8,2,66,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

We argue that since such international differences are often the underlying drivers for entrepreneurship that crosses borders, this area of research has a rich potential to improve our understanding of international entrepreneurship. In this paper, we develop a theoretical framework to examine the effects of the external business environment (the soil) on the entrepreneurial entry by individuals (the seeds). This leads us to fundamental predictions regarding differences in the extent of entrepreneurship in different national contexts. While in developed economies business ventures are more likely to be launched when the turnover rate of incumbent firms is high, the opposite is true in developing economies. Estimates generated using a large-scale data set provide empirical support for our theoretical predictions. Our findings suggest important avenues for new research regarding the role of factors such as the liability of newness and the stigma of failure in different national contexts, as well as the manner in which entrepreneurial dynamics evolve over time.","[Patti, Dario Maimone Ansaldo; Baglieri, Daniela] Univ Messina, Dept Econ, Piazza Pugliatti 1, I-98100 Messina, Italy; [Mudambi, Ram] Temple Univ, Dept Strateg Management, Fox Sch Business, Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Navarra, Pietro] Univ Penn, PPE Program, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Messina; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Pennsylvania,"Mudambi, R (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Strateg Management, Fox Sch Business, Alter Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",ram.mudambi@temple.edu,"Mudambi, Ram/N-1145-2019; Mudambi, Ram/A-8580-2008","Mudambi, Ram/0000-0002-5396-5602; BAGLIERI, Daniela/0000-0002-9615-2329",,,,,122,10,10,1,52,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0921-898X,1573-0913,,SMALL BUS ECON,Small Bus.

Using the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports along with homicide data collected from selected state law enforcement agencies, I investigate if this expansion was successful in reducing homicides among the target groups. I use variation from a legal loophole and a series of circuit court decisions to generate difference-indifferences estimates. I find evidence that the GCA expansion led to 17 percent fewer gun-related homicides among female intimate partner victims and 31 percent fewer gun homicides among male domestic child victims. The law also has protective benefits for those that were not targeted by the legislation. Other family members (parents and siblings) also experience a 24 percent reduction in gun homicides. I find no evidence that reductions in gun homicides were offset by an increase in nongun homicides.

As a source of income inequality and aggregate productivity loss, the country-specific magnitude and drivers of this gender gap are of great interest. Using national data from the Uganda National Panel Survey for 2009-10 and 2010-11 that include a full agricultural module and plot-level gender indicator, the gap before controlling for endowments was estimated to be 17.5%. Panel data methods were combined with an Oaxaca decomposition to investigate the gender differences in resource endowment and return to endowment driving this gap. Although men have greater access to inputs, input use is so low and inverse returns to plot size so strong in Uganda that smaller female-managed plots have a net endowment advantage of 12.9%, revealing a larger unexplained difference in return to endowments of 30.4%. One-half of this is attributed to differential returns to the child dependency ratio, implying that greater child care responsibility is the largest driver of the gap. Smaller drivers include differential uptake of cash crops, differential uptake and return to improved seeds and pesticides, and differential returns to male-owned assets. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We establish an economic growth model of ecosystem tipping risks, set in the context of possible forest dieback. We consider different specifications of impacts arising from the forest dieback tipping point, specifications such as changes in the system dynamics of the forests, changes in the forest mass, and impacts on economic output. We also consider endogenous and exogenous tipping point probabilities. For each specification we compute the optimal policies for forest management and emission control. Our results show qualitative differences in patterns of post-tipping event, optimal forest harvest, and either precautionary or aggressive pre-tipping event harvest patterns, a feature consistent with the findings of the existing literature. Optimal control of deforestation and carbon dioxide emission reduction also exhibits varied patterns of post- and pre-tipping levels depending on the nature of the tipping risk. Still, today's optimal policy is one of more stringent emissions control in presence of a potential forest dieback tipping point.","[Lontzek, Thomas S.; Wilms, Ole] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Moussonstr 15, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland; [Narita, Daiju] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Narita, Daiju] Hokkaido Univ, Grad Sch Econ & Business Adm, Kita Ku, Kita 9 Nishi 7, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600809, Japan",University of Zurich; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); Hokkaido University,"Lontzek, TS (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, Moussonstr 15, CH-8044 Zurich, Switzerland.",Thomas.lontzek@business.uzh.ch; daiju.narita@econ.hokudai.ac.jp; Ole.wilms@business.uzh.ch,"Narita, Daiju/AAH-2870-2020","Narita, Daiju/0000-0001-5695-9913; Lontzek, Thomas/0000-0002-4789-5820; Wilms, Ole/0000-0001-9606-2289",,,,,44,5,6,2,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0924-6460,1573-1502,,ENVIRON RESOUR ECON,Environ.

Further analysis shows that over-investment in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) is mainly driven by managerial overconfidence, and the negative association between inflation uncertainty and overinvestment is due to managerial overconfidence.

We explored whether the couple's financial regime was associated with different living standard outcomes for the partners.

In the Southern European countries of the sample the long-run pass through is directly affected by changes in banks' cost of funding, due to shifts in the spread between domestic and German long-term government bond interest rates. In the same way, the ESTAR/LSTAR parameterization of the short-run dynamics brings about innovative results and identifies a crucial role for the government bond spreads in countries which were involved in the recent European debt crisis.

Under a non-profit certifier it is always the case that both firms produce the highest quality and opt for certification. This is also the case under a for-profit certifier, but only when the degree of horizontal differentiation is sufficiently high. When horizontal differentiation is low, the for-profit certifier, by charging a very high certification fee, creates maximum vertical differentiation between firms. As a result, only one firm produces the highest quality and opts for certification whereas the other firm produces the lowest quality and does not opt for certification. This asymmetry under a for-profit certifier makes the market inefficient, which provides one possible explanation for the existence of mostly non-profit certifiers in such markets.","[Das, Sabyasachi] Univ Vienna, Vienna Grad Sch Econ, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Das, S (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Vienna Grad Sch Econ, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",Sabyasachi.das@univie.ac.at,,,Vienna Graduate School of Economics; Austrian Science Fund,Vienna Graduate School of Economics; Austrian Science Fund(Austrian Science Fund (FWF)),"I am grateful to Maarten Janssen and Franz Wirl for providing several helpful discussions and suggestions.

This article examines this question by studying the group of franchised Parisian voters of the 1840s. Different sources are matched in order to follow longitudinally the trajectories of the individuals who belong to this particularly rich and politically important group over time. Both short-term and long-term mobility are analyzed. Short-term mobility is observed by matching individuals who appear in the electoral lists of the years 1845 and 1846. These lists show the direct taxes that were paid by the voters. Long-term mobility is revealed, by exploiting the Parisian Tables of successions and absences (TSA) of the years 1845 to 1859. These contain information about the wealth at death of individuals. Because the tax-based voting franchise and wealth do not have the same structure, this article studies the comparability between these two variables and explores the question of the political representation of wealth. Despite the difference in definition between the tax-based voting franchise and wealth, the data set shows consistent correlations across time. Moreover, both in the short and long term, economic mobility proves to be substantial. 14 percent of individuals changed quintile between 1845 and 1846, which is considerable over a one-year period. Concerning long-term mobility, 65 percent of individuals changed quintile between 1845 and their respective years of death. All these results raise serious questions about the long-held idea of a stable plutocratic elite group.","[Delbos, Jean-Brieux] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Paris School of Economics,"Delbos, JB (通讯作者)，Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France.",jean.brieux.delbos@gmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,5,EDITIONS DALLOZ,PARIS CEDEX 14,"31-35 RUE FROIDEVAUX, PARIS CEDEX 14, 75685, FRANCE",0373-2630,,,REV ECON POLIT,Rev.

The HRS data permit us to examine out-of-pocket spending close to the end of life and to analyse the components of spending in more detail than has been done in previous studies. We find that spending risk rises sharply at older ages and near the end of life. While the median individual spent $6,328 out-of-pocket in the last year of life, 5 per cent were reported to have spent over $62,040. Our results also indicate that out-of-pocket spending is highly concentrated, with the top 10 per cent of spenders accounting for 42 per cent of all spending, and persistent, even over periods spanning many years. Finally, while certain categories of spending are very responsive to income and wealth, we do not find overall spending to be highly concentrated along these dimensions. Viewed within the international context, our results suggest that the fraction of households facing very high out-of-pocket spending is substantially greater in the US than in other developed countries.","[Fahle, Sean] SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA; [McGarry, Kathleen] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Skinner, Jonathan] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Dartmouth College,"Fahle, S (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",seanfahl@buffalo.edu; mcgarry@econ.ucla.edu; jonathan.s.skinner@dartmouth.edu,,,US National Institute on Aging [P01-AG19783]; National Institutes of Health Common Fund [U01-AG046830],US National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); National Institutes of Health Common Fund(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Office of the Director),"The authors thank Eric French, the participants of the 'Medical Spending across the Developed World' workshop that took place in London in March 2015 and two anonymous referees for their comments.

Insurers have responded to this development only recently by offering new reputation risk insurance solutions. The aim of this article is to present the first detailed academic analysis of these new insurance policies, including examination of the risks insurers face in offering such coverage. We also offer a conceptualization of reputation risk in an insurance and risk management context with focus on exposures, perils, and hazards. Our analysis indicates that loss identification and measurement generate the greatest challenges to insurers in providing reputation risk coverage. Lack of experience as well as the complexity of the chain of reputation risk events related to reputation insurance coverage present insurers with significant challenges in making this a viable line of business.","[Gatzert, Nadine] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Insurance Econ & Risk Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Schmit, Joan T.] Univ Wisconsin, Risk Management & Insurance, 975 Univ Ave, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Kolb, Andreas] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Insurance Econ & Risk Management, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany",University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Erlangen Nuremberg,"Gatzert, N (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Chair Insurance Econ & Risk Management, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",nadine.gatzert@fau.de; jschmit@bus.wisc.edu; andreas.kolb@fau.de,,,,,,,64,28,38,0,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-4367,1539-6975,,J RISK INSUR,J.

Two prominent institutionalist theories could explain this diverging trend in reserves: First, the political business cycle theory, suggesting that reserves are reduced before an election. Second, the veto player theory, implying that a high number of veto players increases the de facto independence of central bankers, who are reluctant to invest in reserves. A time-series cross-sectional analysis for up to 182 countries over the period 1990-2013 shows that democratic governments tend to reduce their reserves before elections. While veto players do not affect reserves directly, a high number of veto players tends to limit a political business cycle before an election. Elections and veto players do not have an influence in authoritarian regimes. Election cycles tend to explain why democracies have relatively fallen behind in a period of massive reserve accumulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
