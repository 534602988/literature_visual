We start from the well-known case, the Black-Scholes model for a put option with strike price and maturity given, which assumes the underlying asset to follow a geometric Brownian motion. This problem provides a reasonable basic framework to follow basic steps of derivation of variational formulation of option pricing problem. In general, variational formulation consists of finding a continuous function defined on the time interval with the values in a properly defined functional space. Finite element method applied to option pricing problem in finance yields usually a system of ordinary differential equations if discretization process applies to space domain of underlying asset only. Finite element linear basis functions span a finite dimensional space to approximate solution of American option pricing problem.","[Lukas, Ladislav] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Lukás, L (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",lukasl@kem.zcu.cz,"Lukas, Ladislav/B-5818-2016",,,,,,12,2,2,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,467,472,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900080,0

The results of study show that the definition of social innovation is still vague. Despite the social innovation being defined and interpreted differently, it provides the social benefits for both local community and/or society in general. When accepting broader description of social innovation, it was concluded that social innovation is not the same as social entrepreneurship. Nowadays, social innovations, particularly in the rural areas, focus on successful solution of different social, economic, political and environmental issues. The social benefits, for instance, reduce the threat of climate change (e.g. reducing greenhouse gas emissions); maintain the biodiversity, ecosystems and landscapes; offer fresh and healthy local food etc., can be provided by the social innovations based on the agricultural production and other rural activities. The following social innovations (but not all) are or will be suitable for Latvia: sustainable or environment friendly agricultural production; local food systems; social or care farming; social services; renewables (e.g. bioenergy); ecosystem services (int. al. tourism) and recreation services; cooperation; local action groups and financial services.","Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Riga, Latvia",,"Melece, L (通讯作者)，Latvian State Inst Agrarian Econ, Riga, Latvia.",ligita.melece@lvaei.lv,"Melece, Ligita/AAZ-6705-2020","Melece, Ligita/0000-0002-3120-3711",,,,,39,10,10,0,32,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,142,153,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400014,0

The Japanese government set a target ratio of logging residue use to 30% by 2030 compared with less than 1% in 2009. This study examined GHG emissions and the economic effects of logging and mill residues, which are employed as raw materials for various purposes in Maniwa, Japan. In 2012, 23,710 tonnes of woody biomass resources was collected and used in Maniwa, of which roughly 79% were logging residues. These resources are manufactured into several types of wood products, such as chips, bark, and chip dust. The manufactured products are then transported and consumed for paper, poultry litter, and fuel. Based on this, three scenarios were organized by changing the type of woody biomass resource use as follows: the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the logging-residues-only utilization (LRU) scenario, and the mill-residues-only utilization (MRU) scenario. Under the LRU scenario, the expected regional effect is almost 204 million JPY, whereas the MRU scenario achieves almost 20 times more financial benefits than the LRU scenario with the integrated woody biomass station. However, approximately 13 full-time jobs can be created under the LRU scenario, which is roughly 2.1 times higher than the 6 jobs created under the MRU scenario. In terms of GHG emissions, the LRU scenario can reduce GHG emissions by up to roughly 211 t CO(2)eq/t compared to the MRU scenario. Overall, the promotion of logging residue use for manufacturing wood products has significant advantages over mill residues in both the reduction of GHG emissions and the growth of regional economies.

The conceptual framework, basic characteristics and key questions addressed in the first section relate to the role of innovation and knowledge that is required to support the future prosperity of rural areas and agriculture based on the principles of the new paradigm of their development. The changes in strategic orientations that have resulted in the reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and new rural development policy of the EU are characterized, particularly in terms of the shift from the modernisation paradigm to a sustainability perspective. Secondly, the specificities of rural areas and agricultural sector in relation to the transfer of innovations are discussed emphasizing the systemic, cross-sectoral and territorial aspects of innovation processes. Next parts of the paper are aimed at presenting the performance and types of innovation in modernising rural economy and agriculture, and at describing the general principles of innovation policy.

While centralised oversight, enhanced transparency and restorative, technical intervention seem like sound regulatory initiatives, I problematise the methodologies, models and assumptions of sovereign ratings to show how the new ratings framework may actually impede the ability of the technocratic European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to redress the most egregious deficiencies of ratings. Drawing on the performativity of market relations, the paper argues how ESMA's supervisory conflicts undermine the EU's capacity to perform an alternative political economy of limits. Neither is it democratically sanctioned to interfere in the analytical substance of ratings nor should it distort the social facticity of creditworthiness by relying primarily on quantitative risk analysis, ESMA will be forced to either repoliticise the ratings process or promote the status quo, which diminishes fiscal sovereignty.","[Paudyn, Bartholomew] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Paudyn, B (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Int Relat Dept, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",b.paudyn@lse.ac.uk,"Paudyn, Bartholomew/AFS-5138-2022","Paudyn, Bartholomew/0000-0001-8587-3799",,,,,64,4,4,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

It became apparent that these materials could be successfully reused as new techniques and research questions emerged. This realization led several American leaders in the field of systematic taxonomy (the science of biological classification) and conservation genetics to argue for the need to take stock of and coordinate these heterogeneous collections. Their strategy, which they called 'planned hindsight,' was meant to organize the present in a way that appeared to anticipate the needs of future scientists. In this paper I examine how the seemingly paradoxical strategy of 'planned hindsight' has functioned as a strategy for choreographing life, time, and value at two centralized biospecimen collections: The Frozen Zoo in Escondido, CA, USA, and the Ambrose Monell Cryo Collection at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. I conclude that, in practice, 'planned hindsight' not only contributes to the endurance of frozen tissues but also preserves widely divergent speculative visions of the many different individuals involved with their creation, maintenance, and re-use.","[Radin, Joanna] Yale Univ, Program Hist Sci & Med, Sect Hist Med, Sterling Hall Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Radin, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Program Hist Sci & Med, Sect Hist Med, Sterling Hall Med, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",joanna.radin@yale.edu,,,,,,,92,17,17,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Climate change is a complex problem that requires traditional disciplines to work together to facilitate an integrated and coordinated response to its impacts. Transdisciplinary research approaches have been recognised for being well placed to aid responses to complex problems such as climate change. This paper draws on the experience of the South East Queensland Climate Adaptation Research Initiative (SEQCARI), Australia, to reflect upon the challenges involved in undertaking transdisciplinary research aimed at developing and improving a range of adaptation options for specific sectors as well as across sectors. Challenges and learning's are discussed based on the three phases of transdisciplinary research processes: problem framing and team building, co-creation of solution-oriented transferable knowledge, and (re)integration and application of created knowledge. Four key insights are then discussed to advance transdisciplinary research approaches for climate change adaptation: adoption of a dynamic learning approach such as learning-by-doing/ doing-by-learning to provide sufficient flexibility and scope to navigate potential barriers and conflicts; selection of social sciences to drive integration; choice of one sector as a platform for integration; and acknowledgement of existing barriers and limitations associated with the political context in which the research takes place.

Mathematical models capable of providing insights into the process of consensus reaching and also the resulting consensual evaluations are therefore studied in detail in the literature. In this paper we recall the soft consensus model proposed in 1986 by Kacprzyk and Fedrizzi and further developed by these authors in the following years. The idea of consensus is reflected in the concept of a majority of experts that are important enough agreeing on the evaluation (e.g. recommendation of a given alternative). In the multiple criteria group decision making model proposed in this paper we assume that from a given group of experts each expert provides evaluations of all the alternatives with respect to all the criteria in linguistic terms (with meanings modelled by fuzzy numbers). An overall fuzzy evaluation of each alternative by each expert is computed using fuzzy weighted average. The competences of the experts are assessed using predefined linguistic labels (with meanings modelled by fuzzy numbers) and a soft consensus is sought. The model finds a subset of the set of alternatives containing those alternatives that are evaluated good enough by a sufficient amount of important experts. The group evaluations of the alternatives from this set are computed from their overall fuzzy evaluations provided by the individual experts by fuzzy weighted average; fuzzy numbers representing the competences of the experts are used as weights. The best-evaluated alternative is then selected using e.g. a defuzzification by the center of gravity method.","[Stoklasa, Jan] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Stoklasa, J (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",jan.stoklasa@upol.cz; vojta.sukac@gmail.com; tomas.talasek@upol.cz; jana.talasova@upol.cz,"Talášek, Tomáš/E-3464-2017; Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016; Talašová, Jana/N-9789-2017","Talášek, Tomáš/0000-0001-8632-4599; Talašová, Jana/0000-0002-1903-170X",,,,,10,2,2,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,743,748,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900127,0

Governments invest in social policy to protect citizens from social risks (for instance, in the labor market). In this sense, economic policy and social policy are strongly linked. The different choices governments have with respect to social policy lead to variations in welfare states. Typically, scholars have divided welfare states into three groups: social democratic, liberal, and continental countries. This study examines citizens' attitudes toward social policy in 23 European countries, and especially within the three groups of welfare states. Attitudes toward social welfare are divided into two parts: respondents' opinions regarding national policy and their attitudes toward poverty. The study focuses on the connections between the type of welfare state and its citizens' attitudes toward social policy. The study also examines whether so-called situational factors (e. g., the level of income inequality, social expenditure, and social insurance) influence the social welfare attitudes of citizens. The data, which were gathered in 2012, are based on the European Social Survey's (N = 43,897) sixth round. The results show that the situational factors have an important role, especially in how citizens evaluate national social policy. However, simultaneous analyses of all the situational factors and social welfare attitudes suggest that the situational factors have only an indirect influence on attitudes toward poverty, such that respondents' opinions of national policy have a mediating role. In this sense, the results support a weak interpretation of the influence of situational factors on attitudes toward social welfare. Furthermore, the results show that attitudes toward social welfare are connected to the types of the welfare states, in this analysis, especially in the Nordic (particularly Finland, Norway, and Sweden) and liberal countries (particularly Great Britain and Ireland). In these countries, unlike others, respondents' opinions regarding national policy and attitudes toward poverty are positively related. However, according to a more detailed analysis, the Nordic and liberal countries can be separated from each other. The group of continental countries was excluded from the final analysis because it seemed not to be a coherent group, as the original welfarestate typology indicated.","[Toikko, Timo] Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Seinajoki, Finland; [Rantanen, Teemu] Laurea Univ Appl Sci, Vantaa, Finland",Seinajoki University of Applied Sciences; Laurea University of Applied Sciences,"Toikko, T (通讯作者)，Seinajoki Univ Appl Sci, Seinajoki, Finland.",timo.toikko@seamk.fi; teemu.rantanen@laurea.fi,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,161,169,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000017,0

Under the mean-conditional value at risk (M-CVaR) optimization framework, the efficient frontier of the mixed portfolio is dramatically improved after adding timberland assets in comparison of the mean-variance (M-V) efficient frontier. The asset allocation strategies formulated by the static and dynamic optimizations indicate that timberland assets maintain a significant allocation in the mixed portfolio. Moreover, risk decomposition is used to identify the risk sources under four different scenarios. It is found that large-cap stocks and small-cap stocks are generally risk intensifiers, whereas treasury bonds, treasury bills, and timberland assets are risk diversifiers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These deserve attention not as issues analyzed separately but as mutually interdependent phenomena. The coherence of trend and business cycle becomes crucial in the forecasting of the economic growth of a country based on the extrapolation of the trend. The objective of the paper is to show the limits of the application of statistical extrapolation methods used in forecasting the economic growth of a country. These limits arise from the choice of forecasting model as well as from the choice of time period length. The beginning and the end of the selected time period is strongly influenced by the phase of the business cycle. The extrapolation method used in this paper is applied to particular examples of GDP development in the Czech Republic in different time periods. The analysis in this paper has two parts. 1. The effect of different business cycle amplitudes of fluctuations, together with different trends, on the economic growth measurement is shown graphically in model situations. The development of economic indicators is composed by the cycle and the trend (in case of a short time-series after seasonal adjustment). In the economy of two countries with the same amplitude of cyclical fluctuation the fast growing trend means only a slowing of growth in the recession phase, but a low rate of growth may show an absolute decline in production. The second option is the analysis of two countries with different amplitudes of cyclical fluctuation by the same trend of economic development. Deeper recessions mean an absolute decrease in the volume of production in comparison with slowing down economic growth in the case of mild recessions. 2. Examples show that time period choice influences the method of extrapolation as well as the resulting trend. The choice of forecasting model depends not only on the trend development of the analyzed macroeconomic indicator but also on the length of period chosen to build the model on. This is especially the case when, due to the cycle, high fluctuation due to the cycle appears, bringing with it the shortening orextension of the analyzed time period (by only one or two years even). This can crucially influence the results of the analysis.","[Zikova, Alzbeta; Fialova, Helena] Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Int Trade, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10, Strasnice, Czech Republic",Metropolitan University Prague,"Zíková, A (通讯作者)，Metropolitan Univ Prague, Dept Int Trade, Dubecska 900-10, Prague 10, Strasnice, Czech Republic.",alzbeta.zikova@mup.cz,"Zíková, Alžběta/AAF-9606-2020; Zíková, Alžběta/D-1416-2018","Zíková, Alžběta/0000-0002-8043-2684; Zíková, Alžběta/0000-0002-8043-2684",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2099-5,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BF0SP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379396100028,0

Its proponents argue that forestry, agriculture and other land uses cannot be seen in isolation, but need to be integrated into a single management process. I apply argumentative discourse analysis (Hajer, 1995) to a series of documents, statements, observations and interviews to identify and analyze the power of this discourse in the UNFCCC and in particular on the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) negotiations. The paper highlights the central arguments of its storylines, its main critique and identifies members of its discourse coalition. It also assesses its discursive power, and concludes that although storylines of the integrated landscape approach discourse may be well recognized in the UNFCCC, in particular at side-events (discourse structuration), it has yet to impose its logics and rationales in a profound way (discourse institutionalization).

The dominant discourses in Spooks involve the manageable future (as a destination and a framework) and the future as judgment and apocalypse (which can be avoided through the process of macro-securitization that relies on predictive analysis and the efforts of competent individuals). We explore the anticipatory aspect of the series since it predicted geopolitical trends such as 7/7, the Ukrainian crises and the negative perception of Russia.

J,"Valatin, G; Moseley, D; Dandy, N",,,,"Valatin, Gregory; Moseley, Darren; Dandy, Norman",,,Insights from behavioural economics for forest economics and environmental policy: Potential nudges to encourage woodland creation for climate change mitigation and adaptation?,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nudge; Behavioural economics; Environmental economics; Afforestation; Public policy; Climate change,CONTINGENT VALUATION; FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; SOCIAL NORMS; PREFERENCES; INFORMATION; VALUES; POWER; COMPLEXITY; FORMATS,"Evidence from behavioural economics illustrates how cognitive factors can affect the preferences, values and choices of individual decision-makers. The evidence also shows how policy 'nudges' that account for the influence of cognitive factors can shift choices in socially desirable directions. Despite a wide range of potential applications, little research has been published to date applying behavioural economics in forestry. As an example of how behavioural economics could be used, this paper considers the potential for nudges in encouraging woodland creation to help meet climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. Although forests offer significant climate change mitigation and adaptation potential, land managers are often reluctant to create new woodlands, hindering accomplishment of national targets. Nudges could potentially help overcome the barriers. Disaggregating behavioural elements of woodland creation using the Stages of Change model, we identify a number of relevant intervention-points at which nudges could be applied. It is argued that nudges may best be tailored towards different types of land manager taking account of differences in attitudes, motivations, circumstances and behaviour. To be effective, a combination with other policy instruments is likely to be needed. Pilot studies are recommended in determining which nudges are cost-effective. The paucity of existing studies drawing upon behavioural economics, or testing out nudges, points to this as a current frontier of both forest economics and policy, but can also be considered a frontier of environmental policy more widely. Developing a consistent valuation framework allowing for the social endogeneity of preferences and for optimization (or some other protocol) to be used in selecting policy options remains a fundamental challenge.

The rise of 'market-based banking' highlights the growing inability of commercial banks to be patient. This raises the question of whether alternative forms of PC exist, but CPE lacks a framework to consider PC provision by financial markets. We develop our concept of PC and a framework for determining the investors most likely to provide it-and under which conditions. We define PC as equity or debt whose providers aim to capture benefits specific to long-term investments and who maintain their investment even in the face of adverse short-term conditions for the firm. We argue for determining patience though three questions: (a) Is the investment (loan) intended to be short or long term? (b) Is the investor engaged with management in pursuit of short-term share price performance or creditworthiness? and (c) What is the likelihood of exit because of concerns regarding short-term performance? Our framework lays the cornerstones for a new comparative theory of financial systems.","[Deeg, Richard] Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1228 Anderson Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Hardie, Iain] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Int Relat Polit & Int Relat, 4 23 Chrystal Macmillan Bldg,15a George Sq, Edinburgh EH8 9LD, Midlothian, Scotland",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; University of Edinburgh,"Deeg, R (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 1228 Anderson Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",rdeeg@temple.edu,"Shingade, Sudam Shrikrushna/D-5452-2019",,International Studies Association; University of Edinburgh; Temple University; European Research Council [291733]; European Research Council (ERC) [291733] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),International Studies Association; University of Edinburgh; Temple University; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"Support for this paper was provided by the International Studies Association, the University of Edinburgh and Temple University.

Therefore, it is relevant to have robust information of the availability for wood supply. The main aim of this paper is to harmonize the concept of 'forest available for wood supply' (FAWS) at European level. The data employed in this study was acquired through two questionnaires. The first questionnaire, conducted under the framework of COST Action FP1001 and a second questionnaire was completed by national correspondents and members of the UNECE/FAO. The analysis showed that reasons for the exclusion of forest from FAWS are diverse. Legal restrictions and specifically 'Protected areas' are considered by 79% of the countries while very few countries consider economic restrictions. A new FAWS reference definition is provided and the consequences of using this new definition in eight European countries were analysed. Application of the proposed definition will increase consistency and comparability of data FAWS and will result in decreasing the area of FAWS at a European level. (C) 2016 The Authors.

At the median age for the sample (24 years at test registration), the estimated decrease over a seven-year period is between 3 and 4 percentage points per $10,000 in student debt for men and a percentage point lower in absolute value for women.

This city-centric view stands in marked contrast to the pre-2000 assumption that Britain's largest cities were actually the main focus of declining employment and population. Drawing on a range of theoretical ideas and evidence, this article questions the view that the big cities are the key drivers of UK regional growth. It recognises that there have been important changes in trends, notably in London, but argues that the geography of recent economic trends in the UK is largely one of regional divergence. There is scant evidence that the big provincial cities perform better than other places-in fact, rather the opposite. The relationship between the big cities and their hinterlands is one of interdependence. The article also argues that the performance of UK cities is deeply intertwined with the structure of UK economic growth.","[Fothergill, Steve] Sheffield Hallam Univ, Ctr Reg Econ & Social Res, Howard St, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England; [Houston, Donald] Univ Glasgow, Dept Urban Studies, 25 Bute Gds, Glasgow G12 8RS, Lanark, Scotland",Sheffield Hallam University; University of Sheffield; University of Glasgow,"Fothergill, S (通讯作者)，Sheffield Hallam Univ, Ctr Reg Econ & Social Res, Howard St, Sheffield S1 1WB, S Yorkshire, England.",natsec@ccc-alliance.org.uk; donald.houston@glasgow.ac.uk,"Houston, Donald/AAC-7842-2020","Houston, Donald/0000-0002-7178-9630",,,,,60,10,10,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

I investigate the impact of both occupational and environmental sources of economic competition on attitudes towards immigration in Europe. Drawing on social stratification and labour economics theory, I discuss three dimensions of the occupation affecting exposure to competition: (i) skill specialization; (ii) monitoring costs; and (iii) the mix of manual versus communicational skills. Environmental correlates are tested by estimating the net change in anti-immigrant sentiments experienced during the first dip of the Great Recession, and by connecting this change to (i) country differences in the intensity of GDP contraction and (ii) prior growth in foreign-born shares. Applying two-step multi-level regression to a pool of the 2004 and the 2010 rounds of the European Social Survey, I find evidence consistent with both occupational and environmental sources of competitive threat.","[Polavieja, Javier G.] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Polavieja, JG (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Social Sci, Madrid, Spain.",javier.polavieja@uc3m.es,"Polavieja, Javier/AAF-6405-2019","POLAVIEJA, JAVIER G./0000-0003-4079-9913",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CSO2012-38521],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, 6th National Plan of Scientific Research [grant number CSO2012-38521] as part of the project Competition, Adaptation and Labour-Market Attainment of International Migrants in Europe, CALMA.",,59,47,48,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The study introduces three indicators to measure the degree to which unpaid care work may interfere with paid work, either by directly disrupting it or by being intertwined with it. The regression estimates show that while the amount of time spent on unpaid care work negatively affects the earnings of both men and women, the interference of unpaid work with paid work lowers earnings more for women than for men. Quantitatively, the gender differences in the time spent on unpaid care work and its interference with paid work account for 28 percent of the gender earnings gap in China.","[Qi, Liangshu] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Dong, Xiao-yuan] Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada",Tsinghua University; University of Winnipeg,"Qi, LS (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.;Dong, XY (通讯作者)，Univ Winnipeg, Dept Econ, 515 Portage Ave, Winnipeg, MB R3B 2E9, Canada.",qilsh@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn; x.dong@uwinnipeg.ca,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71173126],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71173126].

Empirical research of 486 WTO disputes filed between 1995 and 2014 indicates that legal capacity matters more than power considerations in the WTO members' legal dispute settlements. This study is based on the premise that Kazakhstan does best when using the WTO dispute settlement system (after its accession to the WTO) against its main trading partners. Moreover, it attempts to predict the maximum gross domestic product (GDP) levels of Kazakhstan's potential defendants. The main findings are that under the legal capacity theory, Kazakhstan's economic features (such as GDP per capita, international trade position, government efficiency, military and non-military government spending, and others) are sufficient to proceed with legal claims against the Netherlands, Austria, Romania, Portugal, and Belarus.","[Amirbekova, Alua] Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Law, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Galyamov, Ruslan] Kazakh British Tech Univ, Int Sch Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan",Al-Farabi Kazakh National University; Kazakh British Technical University,"Amirbekova, A (通讯作者)，Al Farabi Kazakh Natl Univ, Fac Law, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.;Galyamov, R (通讯作者)，Kazakh British Tech Univ, Int Sch Econ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan.",amir.alua@gmail.com; r.galyamov@hotmail.com,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,9,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with DMD from Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Data on demographic characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, informal care, labor productivity losses, and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Costs have been estimated from a societal perspective adopting a bottom-up approach. A total of 422 questionnaires were included in the study; 268 of which were collected from patients with DMD and 154 from caregivers. The average annual cost per person in 2012 ranged from a,not sign7657 in Hungary to a,not sign58,704 in France. Direct non-healthcare costs are the main component of whole costs and informal care is the main driver of non-healthcare costs. Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. With regard to HRQOL of adult patients, the EQ-5D VAS score and EQ-5D index scores were 50.5 and 0.24, respectively. The corresponding EQ-5D VAS and EQ-5D index scores for caregivers were 74.7 and 0.71, respectively. We have estimated the average annual cost per patient with DMD in eight European countries adopting a social perspective, and to our knowledge this is the first study with such a wide perspective. The results on costs show a considerable gap between Eastern and Western European countries. Non-healthcare costs range from 64 to 89 % of overall costs and informal care is to a great extent the main driver of this cost category. The HRQOL of people with DMD is much lower than that of the general population.","[Cavazza, Marianna; Armeni, Patrizio; Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy; [Kodra, Yllka; De Santis, Marta; Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist Super Sanita ISS, Rome, Italy; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera De La Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio; Linertova, Renata; Oliva-Moreno, Juan; Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Red Invest Serv Sanitarios Enfermedades Cronicas, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Fdn Canaria Invest Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv Canary Isl Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz De Tenerife, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] ISCIII, Inst Rare Dis Res, Madrid, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] RDR, Madrid, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] CIBERER, Madrid, Spain; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Mario Negri Inst Pharmacol Res, Ctr Ric Clin Malattie Rare Aldo & Cele Dacco, Bergamo, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Pentek, Marta] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [von der Schulenburg, Johann Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Hannover, Germany; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy & LSE Hlth, London, England; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Paris, France; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Iskrov, Georgi] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, U1123, Paris, France",Bocconi University; Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS; Corvinus University Budapest; Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Medical University Plovdiv; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Universite Paris Cite,"Cavazza, M (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Via Roentgen 1, I-20136 Milan, Italy.",marianna.cavazza@unibocconi.it,"Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015; DE SANTIS, MARTA/A-6650-2015","Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; CAVAZZA, MARIANNA/0000-0001-5609-6804; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X; DE SANTIS, MARTA/0000-0002-9516-1901; ARMENI, PATRIZIO/0000-0003-3150-3332; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252",Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which received funding from the European Union within the framework of the Health Programme [Grant A101205].

We conducted a cross-sectional study of patients with PWS from Spain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Germany, Italy, the UK, Sweden and France. Data on demographic characteristics, healthcare resource utilisation, informal care, labour productivity losses and HRQOL were collected from questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A total of 261 patients completed the questionnaire. The average annual costs ranged from a,not sign 3937 to a,not sign 67,484 between countries; the reference year for unit prices was 2012. Direct healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 311 to a,not sign 18,760, direct non-healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign 1269 to a,not sign 44,035, and loss of labour productivity ranged from a,not sign 0 to a,not sign 2255. Costs were also shown to differ between children and adults. The mean EQ-5D index score for adult PWS patients ranged between 0.40 and 0.81 and the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale score ranged between 51.25 and 90.00. The main strengths of this study lie in our bottom-up approach to costing and in the evaluation of PWS patients from a broad societal perspective. This type of analysis is very scarce in the international literature on rare diseases in comparison with other illnesses. We conclude that PWS patients incur considerable societal costs and experience substantial deterioration in HRQOL.","[Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Red Investigacin Servicios Sanitarios Enfermedade, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Canary Islands Fdn Hlth Res FUNCANIS, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] Inst Rare Dis Res IIER, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv, Canary Islands Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de La Palma, CA, Spain; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci Hlth Res Ctr, London, England; [Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist superiore sanitA ISS, Rome, Italy; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Centro Ric Cliniche Malattie Rare Aldo Cele Dacc, Ist Ric Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Ranica, Bergamo, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Iskrov, Georgi] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Baji, Petra] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Delgado, Claudia] Federacin Espaola Enfermedades Raras FEDER, Madrid, Spain; [von der Schulenburg, Johann Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Inst Risk & Insurance, Hannover, Germany; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, F-U1123 Paris, France; [Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care CERGAS, Milan, Italy",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Instituto de Investigacion de Enfermedades Raras (IIER); Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Medical University Plovdiv; Corvinus University Budapest; Leibniz University Hannover; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Bocconi University,"López-Bastida, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain.",julio.lopezbastida@uclm.es,"Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015","Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252",Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which received funding from the European Union within the framework of the Health Programme [grant A101205].

This paper shows that the modern perspective to the valuation of forests was presented in German territorial states much earlier than has previously been thought. In 1805 a competent forest mathematician Johann Hossfeld showed explicitly how forest value can be derived under both intermittent and sustained yield management, thus discovering the Faustmann formula. The study also shows that the close intellectual and professional connections among the first German 'forest economists' seem to have played a key role in the diffusion of modern forest economic principles from Hossfeld and his contemporaries to Faustmann and Pressler, and perhaps even more generally to modem capital theory.

By analysing the role of regional policies in the resilience of regions in two distinct periods, the article concludes that the existing policies have made only a limited contribution to the building of resilient regions, and emphasises the need for a new perspective in the developing of policies for regional resilience.","[Eraydin, Ayda] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Dumlupinar Cad,Univ Mahallesi 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey",Middle East Technical University,"Eraydin, A (通讯作者)，Middle E Tech Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Dumlupinar Cad,Univ Mahallesi 1, TR-06800 Ankara, Turkey.",ayda@metu.edu.tr,"ERAYDIN, Ayda/B-1344-2018",,,,,,62,29,31,7,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Methods: The study uses cross-sectional and pooled probit and negative bionomial regressions models to estimate the determinants of use of the above listed reproductive health services for the period from 1993 to 2008. Results: Summary statistics suggest that the above-listed reproductive health services have consistently improved from 1993 to 2008. However, use of traditional methods of contraception increased in urban centers between 2003 and 2008, although the reverse was the case in rural areas. Regression results suggest that place of residence, access to and availability of health services, religion, and birth order are significant correlates of use of reproductive health services. Additionally, the study suggests that the number of living children has the largest effect on use of modern contraception. The effect of a partner's education on use of modern contraception is higher than that of the woman, and a much stronger correlation exists between household wealth and use of reproductive health inputs than expected. Conclusion: The study associates the increasing use of traditional contraceptives in urban centers and the much stronger effect of household wealth with urban poverty and the increasing indirect cost of health services, and argues for interventions to improve quality of service in public facilities and reduce inequities in the distribution of health facilities. Finally, the study advocates for family planning-related interventions that involve and target partners given the importance of partner education in the use of modern contraception.","[Abekah-Nkrumah, Gordon; Abor, Patience Aseweh] Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Publ Adm & Hlth Serv Management, POB 78, Legon, Accra, Ghana",University of Ghana,"Abekah-Nkrumah, G (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Business Sch, Dept Publ Adm & Hlth Serv Management, POB 78, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",gabekah-nkrumah@ug.edu.gh,,,African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) [RT0851],African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),The authors would like to express their appreciation to the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) who funded this research under research grant number RT0851.

We modified a previous theoretical model, adding leverage as a disciplining device. An important implication of our model is that only in deep crises ownership concentration plays a role in attenuating the effect of macroeconomic shock on firm value. We test this hypothesis using a sample of Brazilian firms during distinct phases of the 2008-9 crisis. Our empirical analyzes shows that only in the most critical part of the crisis, ownership concentration reduced the negative effects of the financial crisis.","[da Cunha, Claudio M.

The first section summarizes trends in MES. For the Raw Material industry is characterized a conservative approach and some technologies are promoted more slowly (e.g. Big Data). As one of the problems is mentioned operating very old systems (10 years and over) and problems related to maintenance and administration of these systems. Examples of such systems are, for example, control systems of coal preparation plants at OKD (concepts from the late 90s on servers running VMS operating system) or a dispatching system for monitoring gas flow balances in RWE (underground gas storage, Tranovice). When acquiring MES systems, the requirement for long-term sustainability is to be expected and therefore is recommended that you use more proven and stable technology that allows maintenance of the system in the longer term. In the next part of the article describes best practices for the development of information systems (MES) for the Raw Material industry, where mainly continuous production is dominated. Delivery of MES systems is not just about IT / ICT technologies, but will also address a number of other technical, organizational and security issues. In systems for the control at coal mining and processing is required intrinsic safety equipment, environmental resistance and supplier of information technology must have the authorization (in the Czech Republic by CMA). For continuous processes in the 7x24 operation they are often required systems in the category of fault-tolerant. More attention also focuses on data security in MES systems. At the end of the article is devoted to the use of RFID technology in the Raw Material industry to identify the raw materials during the manufacturing process. RFID tags can be inserted directly into the mined material and there exists also robust tags designed for explosive environments.","[Danel, Roman] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Danel, R (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, 17 Listopadu 15-2172, Ostrava 70800, Czech Republic.",roman.danel@vsb.cz,"Danel, Roman/ABA-8078-2020","Danel, Roman/0000-0001-9333-0567",,,,,10,3,3,1,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-303-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,19,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Engineering, Multidisciplinary; Telecommunications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Telecommunications,BH9XJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404420200003,0

Along with intensive industrial growth the BRICS countries are also large agricultural producers: they account for one-third of the world's agricultural production. About half of the world's pork production is produced on the territory of the BRICS countries, about one-third of poultry and beef. At the same time, there are certain tendencies for formation of specialization of each country on the global agricultural market.

In the context of hedge funds, fees have usually been a hybrid combination of two different types, which has coined a well-known business term of 2 and 20. As an attempt to provide better alignment with their investors, in a new context of low interest rates and lukewarm performance, a new type of fund fees has been introduced in the last few years that offers a more symmetric payment structure, which we will refer to as shared loss. In this framework, in return for receiving performance fees, the fund manager provides some downside protection against losses to the investors. We show that the position values of the investor and the hedge fund manager can be formulated as portfolios of options, and discuss issues regarding pricing and fairness of the fee rates, and incentives for both investors and hedge fund managers. In particular, we will be able to show that, from a present value perspective, these fee structures can be set up as being favorable either to the hedge fund manager or to the investor. The paper is based on an arbitrage-free pricing framework. However, if one is to take into account the value to the business that investor capital brings to a fund, which is not part of our framework, it is possible to create a situation where both investors as well as asset managers win.","[Djerroud, Ben; Shakourifar, Mohammad] Sigma Anal & Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Saunders, David] Univ Waterloo, Dept Stat & Actuarial Sci, Waterloo, ON, Canada; [Seco, Luis] Univ Toronto, Dept Math, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Waterloo; University of Toronto,"Shakourifar, M (通讯作者)，Sigma Anal & Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",ben_d@sigmanalysis.com; dsaunders@uwaterloo.ca; seco@math.utoronto.ca; mohammad@sigmanalysis.com,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR),This research was supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.,,10,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,369,383,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_17,0.0,,,15,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500017,0

Under competitiveness in this study we understand: analysis of the management of the enterprise resources on the basis of which are created, maintained and improved competitive advantages generating positive economic result for a long period of time. From a statistical point of view, competitiveness is a complex indicator, characterized by numerous manifestations. It is composed of derived and one-dimensional indicators. The first expresses several sides of some phenomenon, while the second only individual side, a separate part of the phenomenon. The estimation of the level of the derived indicator, respectively, the complex indicator as a result of the transition from individual to the general, is based on the values of the simple indicators. Its practical calculation is done through aggregation of one-dimensional indicators values by means of the so called Hellwig's method. In this study the competitiveness is characterized on the basis of the following derived indicators: competitiveness of the product being marketed, labour's productivity, financial performance, enterprise growth, economic realization of forest resources ownership. Based on the above indicators complex criteria of the competitiveness of forestry enterprise is calculated. It is standardized from 0 to 1. The methodology is applied in the six state forestry enterprises for management of state forest territories. On the basis of results some recommendations for improvement of competitiveness are done.","[Kolev, Konstantin] Univ Forestry, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of Forestry - Bulgaria,"Kolev, K (通讯作者)，Univ Forestry, Sofia, Bulgaria.",,,,,,,,6,0,1,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,439,446,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200057,0

While structural changes in the labour market took place rather rapidly, accompanying institutional changes have been more gradual. While maintaining some core institutional arrangements, each country has adjusted to new labour market challenges and thereby created various labour market risks. In the period of de-industrialization, both South Korea and Japan experienced a sharp increase in the proportion of atypical workers, unlike the case of Taiwan. This study investigates how the institutional legacy of state corporatism matters in explaining how these three economies have differed in two respects: (a) a rapid increase in the proportion of atypical workers, and (b) the gendered characteristic of atypical employment-that is to say, a disproportionate concentration of women in atypical employment.","[Lee, Sophia Seung-Yoon] Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Social Welf, Seoul 120750, South Korea",Ewha Womans University,"Lee, SSY (通讯作者)，Ewha Womans Univ, Dept Social Welf, Seoul 120750, South Korea.",sophia.sy.lee@ewha.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A5A2A03044657],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This study was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A5A2A03044657).,,107,13,13,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

During the second stage, an ordered logit regression method was used to generate a model of tolerance to socially oriented taxation. It was proven that the level of commitment here depends on how respondents perceive social responsibility including its implementation mechanisms. The survey results showed that respondents rather unaware of unconventional tax mechanisms demonstrated high level of readiness to assume additional social obligations.

This paper analyses theoretical models for qualitative variables used in sustainable development. More exact and detailed information on natural resources are vital to the state, as well as to environmental agencies and to the private sector. The type of forest vegetation is one of the basic characteristics that are recorded and analysed in order to maintain the ecological balance. Generally, the type of forest vegetation is either recorded directly by the agents, or by tele-detection. Both techniques are costly both in financial and time terms or even impossible to do. Predictive models offer an alternative to obtain this data. Although linear regression models are used on a wide scale by biologists and ecologists, these models are inadequate when the dependent variable is qualitative.. Logit models are a natural complement to regression models, where the endogenous variable is a qualitative variable, a situation that may be obtained or not, or a category of a classification. The popularity of logit models is explained by the multivariate nature of the models and the easiness with which they evil be interpreted.","[Manea, Daniela; Titan, Emilia; Boboc, Cristina] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Manea, D (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",daniela.todose@csie.ase.ro; emilia.titan@csie.ase.ro; cristina.boboc@csie.ase.ro; andra.anoaica@gmail.com,"MANEA, DANIELA/AAR-5590-2020; Titan, Emilia/AAR-7437-2020; Boboc, Cristina/H-9878-2016","MANEA, DANIELA/0000-0002-7655-1541; Titan, Emilia/0000-0003-0614-1958; Boboc, Cristina/0000-0002-7397-4821",,,,,7,3,3,1,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Proponents argue that these governance instruments safeguard public goods such as the climate yet they are accused of creating political markets, and political prices, here understood as market distortion. This paper studies the 'politics' of pricing by following the adoption of the first feed-in tariff in France. Pricing as a way of achieving non-economic ends, such as climate mitigation, brings the values of several public goods into play, all the while prompting a translation of these values into a single price. Following the struggles over the pricing of wind power in the early 2000s, the study illustrates that rather than a pollution of the market sphere by that of politics, a politics of pricing can be observed in four distinct struggles: namely the framing of the public interest; valuation as the articulation of the future; the possible agencies of governance; and role of valuation methods and calculations.","[Pallesen, Trine] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Pallesen, T (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Org, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",tp.ioa@cbs.dk,,"Pallesen, Trine/0000-0001-8844-9336",,,,,60,22,22,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The profitability of algorithmic trading systems is compared to the passive ` Buy and Hold' strategy. In the study we present three trading systems, the basic one and two its modifications. The systems use business strategies based on assumptions of Technical Analysis (TA). TA assumes that stock prices move in three types of trends: primary, secondary and minor. The subject of our interest is the minor trend which usually lasts for several days. During the duration of this trend the share price accumulates a gain or loss in relation to the price at the beginning of the trend. We further assume that the probability of reversing this trend increases with accumulated loss or gain. For modelling the probability of trend reversal, we use the theory of Markov chains. States in which there is a high probability of a change in the trend are suitable for generating trading orders. The results of this study show that algorithmic trading systems employing this strategy are able to outperform the market.","[Svoboda, Milan; Rihova, Pavla] Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Svoboda, M (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Univ 8, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",svobodm@kem.zcu.cz; divisova@kem.zcu.cz,,,"research project The Research of Factors Affecting Share Price Movement, Prediction of Share Price Movement and Design of Algorithms for Self-acting Trading of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen [SGS-2015-026]","research project The Research of Factors Affecting Share Price Movement, Prediction of Share Price Movement and Design of Algorithms for Self-acting Trading of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen","The article was supported by research project The Research of Factors Affecting Share Price Movement, Prediction of Share Price Movement and Design of Algorithms for Self-acting Trading SGS-2015-026 of the Faculty of Economics, University of West Bohemia in Pilsen.",,6,1,1,0,4,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-972328-0-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,362,368,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG9XU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000394099300059,0

There are 3.9 participants, on (population-weighted) average, in the 395 ratings areas spanning the 34 states with federally facilitated marketplaces (FFMs). Using data on the plans offered in the FFMs, together with predicted market shares for HIM participants (estimated using 2011 insurer-state market shares in the individual insurance market), we study the impact of competition on premiums. We exploit variation in ratings-area-level competition induced by UnitedHealthcare's decision not to participate in any of the FFMs. We estimate that the second-lowest-price silver premium (which is directly linked to federal subsidies) would have decreased by 5.4 percent, on average, had UnitedHealthcare participated. If all insurers active in each state's individual insurance market in 2011 had participated in all ratings areas in that state's HIM, we estimate this key premium would be 11.1% lower and 2014 federal subsidies would be reduced by $1.7 billion.","[Dafny, Leemore; Ody, Christopher] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Dafny, Leemore; Gruber, Jonathan] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Gruber, Jonathan] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Dafny, L (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",l-dafny@kellogg.northwestern.edu,,,,,,,27,51,69,1,11,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

We contrast two polar instances of risk-sensitive preferences: the traditional discounted utility model, which imposes a positive rate of pure time preference and risk neutrality with respect to intertemporal utility, and multiplicatively separable preferences, which display risk aversion in that dimension but no pure time preferences. We show that both representations of preferences can rationalize the same economy when there is no collapse risk associated with pollution. Once we introduce a collapse risk whose hazard rate depends on the pollution stock, multiplicatively separable preferences are associated with a much higher value of catastrophic risk reduction, and a more stringent policy response. A relatively high discount rate may thus be compatible with large emissions abatement in the face of a low probability large impact event, reflecting preferences for catastrophic risk reduction.

Empirical research has shown, however, that while community forest management has often improved forest conditions, the goals of poverty alleviation and local empowerment have not been fully attained. The wide gap between theory and practice of community forest management has caused scholars to emphasise the role of power and politics in the design, practice and outcome of decentralisation. More recently, the roles of techno-bureaucratic values, practices and the authority given to 'expert' knowledge have been highlighted as important factors impeding its successful implementation. Building on these insights, this paper, conjoined with other contributions to this special issue, aims to examine the role of professionalisation and 'expert' knowledge in community-based forest management in Tanzania, particularly with regard to its economic development and local empowerment benefits. Drawing on long-term research in the Angai village land forest reserve in Liwale, Lindi Region, Tanzania, this paper illustrates how almost 20 years after the inception of community-based forest management, villagers are still waiting for the promised political and economic benefits to materialise. We argue that professionalisation and the privileged role of 'expert' knowledge hampered forest decentralisation. Based on our findings, we join other authors of this special issue in calling for less technically and bureaucratically demanding ways of forest management and planning to allow local communities to fully take over ownership and control of forest resources and to relieve state and non-state actors of cumbersome and overburdening development requirements.

Capture fisheries are currently overexploited and their yield has become stagnant over the last decades and, in some cases, has even declined. Nevertheless, aquaculture has the potential to meet these challenges if well practiced. The study therefore, aims to estimate Technical Efficiency of tank culture systems using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Additionally, it also investigates the determinants of technical inefficiency by employing a regression model. The estimated technical efficiency was 0.89, which means that the fish farmers can reach full technical efficiency through reducing their input usage by another 11%. Results indicate that farmer's experience, educational level, extension training, job status, and water management have positive and statistically significant impacts on technical efficiency. Therefore, increase in any of these factors will have a direct impact on technical efficiency.","[Iliyasu, Abdullahi; Mohamed, Zainal Abidin] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness & Informat Syst, Serdang 43400, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Iliyasu, A (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Agr, Dept Agribusiness & Informat Syst, Serdang 43400, Malaysia.",manawaci@yahoo.co.uk,,,,,,,44,16,16,0,17,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

J,"Poli, R",,,,"Poli, Roberto",,,The implicit future orientation of the capability approach,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capability approach; Martha Nussbaum; Amartya Sen; Becoming agent; Generating and consuming futures; Anticipation,SENSE,"Whilst the future is an important, almost constitutive aspect of the capability approach developed primarily by Sen and Nussbaum, the usual versions of the approach do not make the future orientation of the approach explicit. By making explicit the future orientation of the capability approach, the entire approach acquires a different flavour and offers new directions for development. The paper presents an array of ideas, such as the certainty of capabilities, the difference between the nature of values and the capacity to see them, the dynamic nature of agents, the distinction among three different acceptations of the category 'person', the idea of dynamic disease and the generation and consumption of futures, and futures literacy. As soon as the future is understood as an active force that is able to influence the present, it becomes one of the most relevant value-generating, sensemaking force. The futures embedded in the agents' space of liberty act therefore as an active force which modifies the agents' present through their explicit and implicit anticipation. Three recommendations summarize the paper's main conclusions, respectively, on the capacity of agents (I) to generate their future; (2) to generate a future wide enough to appear unbounded; and (3) to generate a future such that the agents' space of liberty will not be diminished.

Overall, the study indicates that local social values play an important role in fostering entrepreneurial resilience.

Social scientists have offered several accounts to explain financial markets' ascendance, but this work often portrays financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent theoretical paradigms-political economy and neo-institutionalism-with few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs. I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot understand financialization without understanding production-global production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a more analytically rigorous research agenda.","Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Soener, M (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",soener.1@osu.edu,"Soener, Matthew/ABL-2056-2022","Soener, Matthew/0000-0002-9261-9622",,,,,60,41,49,4,52,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The model shows that the wage impact of immigration depends on the competing effects of an increase in labor market competition and an increase in the consumer base. Immigrant remittances provide a unique way of isolating this latter effect because they reduce the consumer base but not the workforce. The predictions of the model are tested using an unusually rich German data set that has detailed information on remittances and wages. As expected, the results indicate that a I percent increase in remittances depress the wages of native workers by 0.06 percent. Furthermore, remittances predominantly affect workers in nontraded industries that are more reliant on domestic consumption.","Williams Coll, Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA",Williams College,"Olney, WW (通讯作者)，Williams Coll, Econ, Williamstown, MA 01267 USA.",,,,,,,,25,5,7,1,20,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Elementary teachers in North Carolina that teach the same grade in their first two years are approximately 20% more likely to stay than teachers who teach two different grades in their first two years of teaching. More generally, within total experience categories, teachers with the fewest years of grade-specific experience have the highest probability of turnover. We argue that this pattern is driven both by the disruption caused by grade reassignment and by the fact that teachers with stable grade assignments have effectively smaller workloads since they can reuse lesson plans and, more generally, apply grade-specific skills.

What explains growing political acquiescence to relevant market-enabling rules? The present article identifies feedback processes whereby such rules lock in over time. First, as markets expand, market proponents grow more numerous and develop increasing stakes. Second, potential challengers find it increasingly difficult to mobilize protest, because routinization reduces salience and because market exposure renders protesters more vulnerable. Third, potential challengers lose incentives to protest, because market exposure eliminates some non-market structures that inspire defensive action, and because 'constrain-thy-neighbor' dynamics encourage the further spread of market-enabling rules as a means of self-defense. The case of market-enabling takeover regulation in Britain since the 1950s illustrates how these processes gradually changed the preferences and resources of bankers, institutional investors, corporate managers and employees and thereby help explain why parliamentary interest in market-restraining counter-measures grew weaker over time.","Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Callaghan, H (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Study Soc, Cologne, Germany.",hc@mpifg.de,"Callaghan, Helen Jessica/ISU-5415-2023",,,,,,91,14,15,0,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

One of the most important issues relates to the repayment burden (RB), the proportion of a debtor's income per period required to repay loans. RBs are fundamental to assessments of student loan systems, and must impact on debtors' consumption experience and loan default probabilities. Surprisingly, there is little evidence of the size of RBs with respect to Stafford loans and our major goal is to rectify this deficiency through the presentation of a large range of plausible calculations, for average graduates and young lawyers working in either the private or public sectors. Importantly, we are able to compare estimates of RBs at the mean of incomes with a much more useful approach using unconditional quantile estimates of incomes. The disaggregation illustrates how critical it is to explore RBs across the income distribution by age and sex, and between employment sectors for lawyers. It is shown that RBs are a potentially important problem for a significant minority of debtors, and could assume major difficulties for some. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Swinburne University of Technology held a collaboratory workshop of academics across disciplines and a range of business leaders to explore firstly what a globally responsible leader would look like and secondly how these capabilities would be developed. In taking forwards actions from the workshop, the Business School was noticeably absent which raised the specific question regarding the on-going role for business schools in the future development of leaders, and how they would need to change in order to maintain a future role in this sphere.

The Oxford Dictionary (1993) provides one definition of lore as 'A doctrine, a precept; a creed, a religion.' This is the definition adopted for this paper. The paper concludes that the discrepancies among weather observations, scientific assessments and decision makers' perceptions suggest that climate-change lore exists, or is coming into existence. The paper then discusses the implications for the science-policy interface and suggests that given current trajectories, science could come to play a secondary role to climate-change lore in regional political decision making concerning climate change. To the truth-to-power model of the science-policy interface and the tenets of post-normal science, three additional possibly evolving science-policy configurations (as pertaining to the climate change issue) are offered.

It is founded upon a definition of unobserved state variable indicating a regime for sampling the specific observation. It is assumed that one or more change-points separate the regimes. Position of the change-points is unknown and must be estimated. Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is chosen to generate samples from conditional distributions of the parameters. Comparisons of alternative models are possible with quality indicators utilizing the marginal log likelihood function, primarily the Bayes factor. Diagnostic tools check the mixing properties of the sampled Markov chains required at convergence. 95% Highest Posterior Density intervals for the parameters in MCMC sample in regimes, posterior probability that observation is in specific state and posterior probabilities of regime change are supplied for every time point.

Here I invoke Derrida in discussion of how in the investigation of the fatal brain disease kuru, the partible tissues of the Fore people of Papua New Guinea became frozen spectral commodities in the exchange regimes of modern biomedical science - and how they gained, or retained, value as they were objectified. I follow these Fore - or kuru - valuables into the frozen archive, asking what has become of the remainder, whether it now amounts to anything more than defrosting debris among the postcolonial ruins.

According to the red herring hypothesis, the positive correlation between age and HCE is exclusively due to the fact that mortality rises with age and a large share of HCE is caused by proximity to death. As a consequence, rising longevity-through falling mortality rates-may even reduce HCE. However, a weakness of many previous empirical studies is that they use cross-sectional evidence to make inferences on a development over time. In this paper, we analyse the impact of rising longevity on the trend of HCE over time by using data from a pseudo-panel of German sickness fund members over the period 1997-2009. Using (dynamic) panel data models, we find that age, mortality and 5-year survival rates each have a positive impact on per-capita HCE. Our explanation for the last finding is that physicians treat patients more aggressively if the results of these treatments pay off over a longer time span, which we call Eubie Blake effect. A simulation on the basis of an official population forecast for Germany is used to isolate the effect of demographic ageing on real per-capita HCE over the coming decades. We find that, while falling mortality rates as such lower HCE, this effect is more than compensated by an increase in remaining life expectancy so that the net effect of ageing on HCE over time is clearly positive.","[Breyer, Friedrich] Univ Konstanz, Fachbereich Wirtschaftswissensch, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Lorenz, Normann] Univ Trier, D-54286 Trier, Germany; [Niebel, Thomas] ZEW, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany",University of Konstanz; Universitat Trier; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Lorenz, N (通讯作者)，Univ Trier, Univ Ring 15, D-54286 Trier, Germany.",friedrich.breyer@uni-konstanz.de; lorenzn@uni-trier.de; niebel@zew.de,,"Niebel, Thomas/0000-0003-3083-9168",,,,,38,36,37,0,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Also, relationship between investment in intangible assets and bankruptcy status will be determined. Mainly, profitability ratios as Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Net Profit Margin, Gross Profit Margin etc. are used as measures of financial performance. The empirical findings are based on sample which consists of companies that operated in Republic of Croatia. Financial information was obtained from annual financial statements which are publicly available on Croatian Financial Agency website. The sample comprises of two groups.

The introduction is based on the basic definition by Schumpeter, who defined innovation as combination of development changes. Following, there are characterized approaches of authors, who developed the original Schumpeter's theory, and now they are primarily focused on successful management of innovation in enterprises. Common features of definitions are application of new ideas, change, improvement and invention. It is necessary to distinct innovation and invention, which is the ability to find new knowledge, see the possibilities of useful changes, but it is only the first step in a long innovation process in which a good idea gets into the form of useful and effective product or service. Subsequently, the article deals with creativity, which means the ability to create new technical and cultural, spiritual and material values. Creativity and its link to learning and achieved experience are regarded as condition for creation, processing and dissemination of innovation and thus the highlight of creativity became the basis for creative economy, which is precisely grounded on human creativity. The article explains the difference between creativity and innovation, where innovation is more than just an original idea - it means that new ideas must be implemented successfully on the market or that things will be implemented in new ways. The essence of creativity lies in the diversity of thinking. Its base is divergent thinking, in which personality focuses on expanding and finding new and appropriate solutions to problems and opportunities of various logical alternatives. The creative potential is the sum of knowledge, skills, abilities, and motivation, personal and moral qualities which are involved in the creative process. At the end of the article, there is an innovative model, which expresses the relationship between creativity and innovation characterized by creative skills as essential part of the comprehensive model in terms of the prerequisites for innovative capacity and innovation potential of enterprises.","[Corejova, Tatiana] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Corejová, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",tatiana.corejova@fpedas.uniza.sk; maria.rostasova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Rostasova, Maria/P-9598-2016; Corejova, Tatiana/R-3145-2019","Corejova, Tatiana/0000-0003-0775-940X",,,,,20,3,3,0,10,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,114,127,,,,,,14,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800012,0

In order to overcome this problem models based on the so-called jump-diffusion processes are created if only the empirical data distributions seem to be normal at least after an extraction of jumps. The case of the freight rate in container shipping fulfils this requirement. In this paper we consider the idea of the European Call options for the freight rate. Different approaches for the pricing are presented and the option premium is calculated numerically based on the jump-diffusion model. Results are calculated using the real data from one of the market leading companies and from the s.c. Shanghai Indeces.

Using information from 5,307 landing days, hedonic inverse demand functions are estimated with a random coefficient (RC) model. Results show that there are price premiums for larger sizes of cod and for cod with the highest quality rating. Results also show that own-quantity and cross-quantity effects are small and negative for most attributes. Thus, there is an indication that the management of a fish stock that changes the quantity of attributes will also change the prices of attributes, although the price effect is small in the case of Swedish Baltic cod.","Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hammarlund, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",cecilia.hammarlund@nek.lu.se,,,Swedish Research Council Formas (SoundFish project),Swedish Research Council Formas (SoundFish project)(Swedish Research Council Formas),"Cecilia Hammarlund is a PhD student, Lund University, Department of Economics, Box 7082, 220 07 Lund, Sweden (email: cecilia.hammarlund@nek.lu.se).

The instability in their relationship resulting from the animosity in their territorial dispute resolving process could affect the regional relations and potentially the environment of global international relations beyond the region, as well. Therefore it is important to be aware of the dispute resolving process and all the factors which influence it. This study examines the macroeconomic situations in China and Japan and evaluates their current state of development. The aim of the paper to answer a research question was to conduct a multicriterial analysis of the chosen macroeconomic magnitudes and on the basis of the analysis evaluate the economic situation of the countries. Both countries have exceptionally high GDP (gross domestic product) at current prices which indicates production of goods and services as well as the change of price level. The unemployment rate was feasible in both cases, around 4 %, while Chinese development of the discussed indicator can be evaluated as more stable. Both countries experienced deflation during 2008 - 2012, but in the case of China the prevailing phenomenon was inflation, unlike in Japan. Deflation rates in Japan were more apparent. Multicriterial macroeconomic evaluation of these countries' economic levels is applied to conduct the study while the chosen macroeconomic magnitudes in particular country are examined and compared. The results of research are further used to evaluate interconnections of the economic situation in East Asian countries and their attitudes to the territory dispute-resolving process. Moreover, the study will explain the main interests of countries in the disputing territory. Despite some of the difficulties in both economies, they were evaluated as strong and it was presumed that both Japan and China will try to fortify their position in international relations and presumably will try to negotiate while discussing territory disputes without any compromises that would reduce their economic gains. This presumption was affirmed in the third chapter where it seemed that economic reasons for owning the territory were prevailing (especially when there are mineral reserves found in the vicinity of disputed territory) whereas the strategic position of the territory is an important aspect of resolving disputes, as well.","[Heczkova, Marketa] Univ Econ Prague, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13000 3, Zizko, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Heczková, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Jan Masaryk Ctr Int Studies, Namesti Winstona Churchilla 1938-4, Prague 13000 3, Zizko, Czech Republic.",xhecm00@vse.cz,,,,,,,46,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,259,271,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800026,0

However, the implications of the assumed trend from government to multi-level forest governance for interest groups have not been sufficiently examined. This paper examines the case of German forest politics and studies the effects of the trend towards multi-level governance for forest-related interest groups. The empirical analysis implies that interest groups are in an organizational and/or strategic reconfiguration process in response to changes of the overall governance structure. Different coping strategies among interest groups organized on multiple levels, and interest groups organized on a single organizational level are observed. Many interest groups feel overwhelmed in their attempt to understand and observe every level of action at the same time. Inequalities between the ability of different interest groups to influence decision-making might be reinforced by the trend towards a multi-level governance structure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The paper aims to evaluate the distribution of economic opportunities among Lithuanian population by counties based on the integrated indicator. The following tasks were set in order to reach the aim of the research: 1. To explore influencing factors to economic opportunities of residents. 2. Grounding on the completed integrated indicator to assess economic opportunities of residents in Lithuania by counties. Study results suggest that economic opportunities of residents depend on education, gender, employment opportunities, wage differentiation, etc. Occupancy is a very important factor, which ensures economic independence of individuals. Statistical data analysis shows that the differentiation of economic opportunities of residents is formed on the regional level: in different counties, cities and villages, rural residents have uneven opportunities. The calculated integrated indicator has shown that the best situation belongs to Vilnius County (1st place) and the worst situation considering the integrated indicator belongs to Marijampole County (10th place). The value of the integrated indicator of Marijampole County is even 88.6% lower as compared to the corresponding indicator of Vilnius County.","Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Business & Rural Dev Management Inst, Fac Econ & Management, Ringaudai, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Kiausiene, I (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Business & Rural Dev Management Inst, Fac Econ & Management, Ringaudai, Lithuania.",ilona.kiausiene@asu.lt,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,0,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,176,185,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100018,0

Though Islamic financial institutions have expanded significantly over the recent two decades in Australia, they face a laissez faire market, which failed to address their particular regulatory needs. Operating in a conventional banking favoured environment without special regulatory treatment, the Islamic financial institutions may give in to competition at the risk of jeopardising Shari'ah compliance in Australia. Taking a risk-based perspective, a responsive regulatory system is developed, incorporating self-regulation such as the IFSB Standards, a black-letter laws and the hybrid, responsive to the business characteristics and corporate governance. A Seven-stage model was also developed to operationalise the responsive regulatory framework.

General scheme of building composite indicators includes several steps that have to be made and corresponding methods have to be chosen. Primarily, selection of sub-indicators, normalizing methods, weighting schemes and aggregation formulas are fundamental. This paper deals with the selection of appropriate tool for weighting scheme, i.e. the issue of weights. When used in benchmarking framework, weights can have a significant effect on the overall composite indicator and the evaluated units' rankings. Therefore an objective approach of determining weighting scheme in composite weighted index for measuring EU regional resilience is suggested. Several dimensions of regional resilience as sub-indicators exist, therefore it is necessary to use different weighting for (1) each dimension of regional resilience, (2) each EU NUTS 2 region and (3) each year of reference period. For this purpose, the entropy method is used to determine objective weighting scheme based on information available in the data set.","[Melecky, Lukas; Stanickova, Michaela] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Melecky, L (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",lukas.melecky@vsb.cz; michaela.stanickova@vsb.cz,"Stanickova, Michaela/ABE-6334-2020; Melecky, Lukas/A-8078-2015; Melecky, Lukas/AAY-7847-2021","Stanickova, Michaela/0000-0001-6210-2377; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400; Melecky, Lukas/0000-0001-8889-6400",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,525,530,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900090,0

While studies have identified factors that influence child malnutrition and related inequalities in Ghana, very little efforts have been made to decompose these inequalities across various household characteristics. This study examined the influence of socioeconomic factors on inequality in child malnutrition using a decomposition approach. Methods: The study employed cross section data from the 2011 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS). Analysis was done at three levels: First, concentration curves were constructed to explore the nature of inequality in child malnutrition. Secondly, concentration indices were computed to quantify the magnitude of inequality. Thirdly, decomposition analysis was conducted to determine the role of mother's education and health insurance coverage in inequality of child malnutrition. Results: The concentration curves showed that there exists a pro-poor inequality in child malnutrition measured by stunting and wasting. The concentration indices of these measures indicated that the magnitude of inequality was higher and significant at 1 % for weight-for-age (WAZ) (-0.1641), relative to height-for-age (HAZ) (-0.1613). The decomposition analyses show that whilst mother's education contributed about 13 and 11 % to inequality in HAZ, it contributed about 18.9 and 11.8 % to inequality in WAZ for primary and secondary or above education attainments, respectively. Finally, health insurance contributed about 1.91 and 1.03 % to inequality in HAZ and WAZ, respectively. Conclusion: The results suggest that there is the need to encourage critical policies directed towards improving female literacy in the country. The existence of a functional health insurance system and increasing universal coverage are recommended to mitigate child malnutrition.","[Novignon, Jacob] Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Aboagye, Emmanuel] Univ Oslo, Dept Hlth Econ Policy & Management, Oslo, Norway; [Agyemang, Otuo Serebour] Univ Cape Coast, Sch Business, Cape Coast, Ghana; [Aryeetey, Genevieve] Univ Ghana, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy Planning & Management, Legon, Ghana",University of Ibadan; University of Oslo; University of Cape Coast; University of Ghana,"Novignon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Dept Econ, Ibadan, Nigeria.",jnovignon@gmail.com,"Novignon, Jacob/H-1827-2017; Aboagye, Emmanuel/AAP-4991-2020; Aboagye, Emmanuel/K-3269-2019; agyemang, otuo serebour/A-6023-2018","Novignon, Jacob/0000-0002-4718-9328; Aboagye, Emmanuel/0000-0001-5709-5387; agyemang, otuo serebour/0000-0001-7482-4385; Aryeetey, Genevieve Cecilia/0000-0002-0530-8675",,,,,32,44,45,1,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

So they are more exposed to trade and supply shocks; also productivity shocks are more likely to occur. A general knowledge is that the more common are supply shocks, the more convenient is nGDP targeting. The discretionary policy is formalised as an optimising problem to choose aggregate demand so as to minimise a given loss function. Afterwards, an econometric model is derived, estimated and relevant conclusions drawn. The principles on which the theoretical models are developed may differ for advanced and for middle income economies.

It has an impact on price drop of commodity and simultaneously it generates production-economic uncertainty for primary producers. The pork production has undergone several periods of crisis in the last decade and still it is not fully recovered. The cause of this condition was the unpreparedness of Slovakia to join the EU, which is related to the absence of significant subsidy incentives for the development of pig farming. In comparison with surrounding countries is considered as a primary disadvantage for Slovak farmers. In 2004, were 1472 pig farms, in 2012 it was only the 860. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the economics of pig farming as a whole in terms of real cash flows while respecting the production and economic relations between different breeding categories. The aim is to provide a global model view on economy pig farming. Information needed to resolve the defined issues; we obtain from the official Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and its archived agricultural and food publications, from the Research Institute of Agricultural and Food Economics (RIAFE) and its publications: Situation and outlook reports and Farms' costs and economic results in Slovakia. In this paper, the situation on the pig farms is monitored in details, such as: Analysis of number of pigs, Analysis of productive and reproductive characteristics of pigs and their impact on the economy of production, Analysis of the costs of individual categories of pigs, Production of slaughter pigs in the Slovak Republic, Development of sales of slaughter pigs. The results showed that the observed sector is significantly affected by the competitive pressure on the EU market, international price developments, the high costs of production animal commodities (sector is without of grant support in a loss), low intensity parameters of production, limited financial budget for the implementation of investment projects (including modernization of technological equipment) and unbalanced supplier-customer relationships. Slovakia reports deficits on pork, while the share in the total domestic consumption is decreasing with time while meeting the needs of the processing industry and domestic consumption in domestic market. In the fact, more and more pig farmers carry their production directly through exports, which are returned to Slovakia in the form of processed products. In 2012, Slovak meat products were contained only 35.2% of the whole products of the meat industry on the shelves of Slovak retail stores. It is alarming. In the recommendations, we recommend to government prepare and to adopt the balanced and stable set of the terms of financial support for pig farmers in the new programming period 2014 - 2020. Only this action has the positive consequences on developments in this sector. Indeed, the determination of optimal exercise price would be a competitive advantage in the CEE region. Long-term stabilization of the sector and the subsequent building competitiveness of pig farming is conditioned by the fact that so far existing subsidy system does not let to procure the quality feed mixtures, medications, recovery of genetic material and does not let to realize investment in reconstruction and technological equipment.","[Pavl'akova, Stanislava; Zentkova, Iveta] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Pavl'áková, S (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",pavlakova.s@gmail.com; iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,815,824,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800077,0

A chi-square goodness of fit test for testing null hypothesis is realised and verificated, that data follow the Benford distribution. Further the finance operation is compared in each of the years 2010-2014 from the perspective of Benford's law. There will be also compared different approaches to the analysis of the tested data and compared the results of different testing methods, for example Pearson's chi-squared test of goodness of fit and Z statistics. Benfords Law by the current theory is considered to be a powerful tool allowing quick screening of data for anomalies.

A common way of dealing with the epistemological challenge of situated knowledge production, as proposed by transdisciplinarity, is to point to the fundamental aspect of reflexivity. But reflexivity also includes being aware that power and control over the object is derived from the social position of researchers, an issue not often explicitly discussed in transdisciplinary research. Reflexivity thus represents an important but insufficient principle for guaranteeing appropriate levels of self-reflection within a process of knowledge coproduction. We therefore hypothesize that transdisciplinary research could greatly benefit from feminist scientific tradition, in particular the insights of standpoint theory and the concept of 'strong objectivity'. We analyse, and reflect upon, how a recent transdisciplinary research initiative - conducted together with civil society organizations in (CS05) in six countries: Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Ecuador and India - has benefited from the use of 'strong objectivity'. We analyse how the social position of all stakeholders, including ourselves as the scientific actors in this initiative, influence the process and conditions of transdisciplinary knowledge co-production, and we discuss how power and control by scientists affects the process and conditions of interaction. Thereby we argue for the necessity of explicitly assuming sides in contested contexts for reaching objectivity in transdisciplinary research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

CMS analysis is used to decompose changes in the European Union's (EU) share of the global market for exports into competitiveness and structural effects over 2004-2013. CMSA is used to identify and quantify competitiveness from the export data and breaks down a country's export performance into a pure competitiveness effect and a structural effect within the EU countries. The EU has experienced competitive pressures from China and other emerging economies that have resulted in a loss of global market share. Changes of a country's market share in world exports result from many interrelated factors.

First, the authors define institutions as socially approved behaviour models that restrict the rationality of an individual and constrain or encourage specific behaviour and classify institutions into two groups - governance institutions and value institutions. Secondly, the authors propose and implement an innovative and consistent yet simple and informative methodology for quantitative evaluation of institutions. The core of the methodology is the Institution Index Matrix that combines Institution Index and Institutional Potential Index in a single framework, where the level of quality of institutions is placed on X axis and the results of policies that facilitate growth-friendly institutions- on the Y axis. To measure the quality of institutions several World Bank's World Development and Worldwide Governance Indicators are used as well as the results from the World Value Survey. The analysis confirms that the leaders regarding the quality of institutions are the Nordic countries, Western European countries and New Zealand, Canada, the United States and Australia and the laggards - Southern, Central and Eastern European countries as well as Hong Kong, Chile and Israel. The low quality of institutions might impede the economic convergence. Finally, the authors provide a detailed analysis of the institutional environment in the countries with the worst institution indicators and propose solutions for the development of growth-friendly institutions in these countries.

Methodology covers review of worldwide literature and studies based on sources of power industry. Author is carrying out questionnaire surveys on a sample power companies pursuing concession activities in energy industries in UE and questionnaire surveys carried out among Regulators from European power markets and global markets. The research contribute to the development of the theory of tariffing through the development of empirical measures to limit the negative impact of state intervention in sector of energy companies operating in the regulated market and the development of the use of econometric models in the process of enterprise value creation. The model will also contribute to the development of tools catalogue under the concept of VBM. There are some symptoms for the proliferation of empirical instruments in both science and economic practice in the form of econometric models used for regulatory purposes in tariffing procedures for energy business. The Model will represent an empirical approach to the task of negotiation of the regulated income for energy providers particularly for gas fuel distribution providers. The Model in its instrumental and methodological di-mension will be designed based on best practices on the global energy markets and will contribute to design the VBM tools for energy companies' development. This article is presenting the results of analysis of international experience regarding the regulation of the gas fuel distribution sector. Based on the results of analyses of international experience, general regulatory guidelines and best practices were identified for determining individual components of regulated revenue of entities pursuing gas fuel distribution activity. Implementation results of the research can be a pioneering approach to the creation of the empirical basis for the process of tariffing.","[Wegrzyn, Adam] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Wegrzyn, A (通讯作者)，Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",adam.wegrzyn@ue.wroc.pl,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,766,776,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500089,0

Methods Retrospective population-based cohort study conducted using Swedish medical records linked to national registers. Patients were included based on prescriptions of lipid-lowering therapy between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2011 and followed until 31 December 2012 for identification of CV events and estimation of work productivity loss (sick leave and disability pension) and indirect costs. Patients were stratified into two cohorts based on CV risk level: history of major cardiovascular disease (CVD) and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent. Propensity score matching was applied to compare patients with new events (cases) to patients without new events (controls). The incremental effect of CV events was estimated using a difference-in-differences design, comparing productivity loss among cases and controls during the year before and the year after the cases' event. Results The incremental effect on indirect costs was largest in the CHD risk equivalent cohort (n = 2946) at (sic)3119 (P value <0.01). The corresponding figure in the major CVD history cohort (n = 4508) was (sic)2210 (P value <0.01). There was substantial variation in productivity loss depending on the type of event. Transient ischemic attack and revascularization had no significant effect on indirect costs. Myocardial infarction ((sic)), unstable angina ((sic)) and, most notably, ischemic stroke ((sic)) yielded substantial incremental cost estimates (P values <0.01). Conclusions Indirect costs related to work productivity losses of CV events are substantial in Swedish high-risk patients treated for hyperlipidemia and vary considerably by type of event.","[Banefelt, J.; Hallberg, S.; Mesterton, J.] Quantify Res, Hantverkargatan 8, S-11221 Stockholm, Sweden; [Fox, K.

The findings highlight the important role that technological relatedness has on increasing firm productivity, providing some support for the idea that regions should pursue a strategy of 'regional branching' to evolve the local industrial mix into related economic activities. The findings also reveal, however, that increasing technological relatedness may asymmetrically harm underperforming firms and widen disparities in productivity between local firms.","[Howell, Anthony] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [He, Canfei] Peking Univ, Coll Urban & Environm Sci, 5 Yiheyuan Rd, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yang, Rudai] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Fan, Cindy] UCLA, Geog Dept, 255 Bunche Hall, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Peking University; Peking University; Peking University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Howell, A (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, 5 Yiheyuan Rd Haidian Dist, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",tonyjhowell@pku.edu.cn; hecanfei@urban.pku.edu.cn; rdyang@pku.edu.cn; fan@geog.ucla.edu,,"Howell, Anthony/0000-0002-4211-0190","School of Economics, Peking University; National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars [41425001]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41271130]","School of Economics, Peking University; National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))","The authors would like to acknowledge funding support from the School of Economics, Peking University; the National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars, No. 41425001; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 41271130.",,27,17,22,1,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

Exploiting this natural experiment, we devise an empirical strategy to estimate the intention-to-treat effect of this paid exemption on education and labor market outcomes of the individuals in the target group. We find that the paid exemption reform reduces the years of schooling among males who are eligible to benefit from the reform relative to the ineligible males. In particular, the probability of receiving a college degree or above falls among the eligible males. The result is robust to alternative estimation strategies. We find no reduction in education when we implement the same exercises with (i) data on females and (ii) placebo reform dates. The interpretation is that the reform has reduced the incentives to continue education for the purpose of deferring military service. We also find suggestive evidence that the paid exemption reform reduces the labor income for males in the target group. The reduction in earnings is likely due to the reduction in education. It should be noted, however, that due to the characteristics of the population on the treatment margin, the external validity of these results should be assessed cautiously. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The model is calibrated to reflect the U.S. experience. As in previous studies, using a single-sector version of our model, we find that the cap regime generates lower volatility of real variables than the tax regime, but the latter may be preferable from the welfare perspective. Still, our multi-sector analysis points to the importance of the origin of the shocks in the ranking of the two instruments and to the desirability of going beyond a single-sector analysis in evaluating their merits. We find no significant difference between the cap and the tax regimes when shocks come from non-energy sectors. In contrast, the cap has lower volatility but higher welfare costs than the tax for the shocks to energy production. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Departing from a review of this literature, we take a step further from the flexicurity' prescription, to follow the capabilities approach of Sen and others, and develop a concept of social capabilities-based flexicurity for a learning economy, arguing that labour market performance must be targeted in an approach that includes a strong commitment to social well-being.","[Judzik, Dario; Spagnolo, Laura T.] Minist Trabajo Empleo & Seguridad Social, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Khan, Haider A.] Univ Denver, Econ, Josef Korbel Sch Int Studies, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Judzik, D (通讯作者)，Minist Trabajo Empleo & Seguridad Social, Subsecretaria Polit Estudios & Estadist Laborales, Ave Leandro N Alem 628 2 Piso, RA-1001 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",djudzik@trabajo.gob.ar,,,,,,,51,4,4,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Consumer mobility can have important implications for competition. Consumers should be price-responsive and be willing to switch insurer in search of the best-value products. Moreover, although theory suggests low-risk consumers are more likely to switch insurer, this process should not be driven by insurers looking to attract low risks. This study utilizes data on 320,830 VHI healthcare policies due for renewal between August 2013 and June 2014. At the time of renewal, policyholders were categorized as either 'switchers' or 'stayers', and policy information was collected for the prior 12 months. Differences between these groups were assessed by means of logistic regression. The ability of Ireland's risk equalization scheme to account for the relative attractiveness of switchers was also examined. Policyholders were price sensitive (OR 1.052, p < 0.01), however, price-sensitivity declined with age. Age (OR 0.971; p < 0.01) and hospital utilization (OR 0.977; p < 0.01) were both negatively associated with switching. In line with these findings, switchers were less costly than stayers for the 12 months prior to the switch/renew decision for single person (difference in average cost = a,not sign540.64) and multiple-person policies (difference in average cost = a,not sign450.74). Some cost differences remain for single-person policies following risk equalization (difference in average cost = a,not sign88.12). Consumers appear price-responsive, which is important for competition provided it is based on correct incentives. Risk equalization payments largely eliminated the profitable status of switchers, although further refinements may be required.","[Keegan, Conor; Thomas, Steve] TCD, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Teljeur, Conor] HIQA, Dublin 7, Ireland; [Turner, Brian] UCC, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin; University College Cork,"Keegan, C (通讯作者)，TCD, Ctr Hlth Policy & Management, Dublin 2, Ireland.",keegancp@tcd.ie,"Turner, Brian/AAV-6832-2021","Thomas, Steve/0000-0001-9306-0114; Turner, Brian/0000-0003-2545-8336",Health Research Board [PHD/2007/16],Health Research Board,The authors would like to thank VHI Healthcare for access to their policyholder database.

Our results indicate that while agriculture began displacing grasslands that originally provided high yields of honey, afforestation now compensates those losses through the flowerings of Eucalyptus grandis. By extending the flowering season from six to eight months, beekeepers' dependency on tree plantations has increased. However, forestry enterprises are now shifting to plant more productive species that do not flower similarly, anticipating a threshold crossover to which the beekeepers may be unable to adapt. In conclusion, resilience of this environmentally sensitive livelihood has been suppressed primarily by land use changes that have introduced new costs and challenges into honey production. However, threshold dynamics that appear as multifaceted challenges faced by beekeepers occur also elsewhere in the system. Certain outcomes of the threshold dynamics similar to feedback loops in social-ecological systems were identified, including considerations of out-migration and change in occupation, of which ultimate impacts remain unclear. Most beekeepers still cope with the remaining viability, but it appears that the current resilience level does not allow for further harmful impacts. This case example of coupled social and ecological interactions through a livelihood lens gives rise to future research in evolving new dimensions to govern social-ecological systems in Uruguay and beyond.

At the same time, disadvantaged families often sort out of existing programs. To counter differences in learning outcomes between children from different socioeconomic backgrounds, governments are pushing for universal child care. However, it is unclear how effective programs with universal participation may be at addressing the needs of disadvantaged children. We provide evidence on the long-run effect on schooling of mandating kindergarten at age 5-6. Our identifying variation comes from a reform that lowered school starting-age from 7 to 6 in Norway in 1997. The new program was designed as a low intensity kindergarten program, similar to voluntary child care programs available before mandating.

The analysis at a sub-national level, NUTS3, allows us to identify the spatial structure of economic complexity and the patterns of converge/divergence in this important ingredient of economic performance. We find evidence of a convergence in provincial production complexity during the pre-crisis period. Besides, we highlight using panel estimates a significant role of product sophisticatedness as an engine of growth. The current crisis has halted this convergence process and has asymmetrically affected provincial areas, substantially increasing the heterogeneity of provincial trajectories, in particular in the least developed parts of the country.","[Coniglio, Nicola Daniele; Lagravinese, Raffaele; Vurchio, Davide] Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Econ & Math Methods, I-70124 Bari, Italy; [Lagravinese, Raffaele] Univ Rome Tre, Ctr Rossi Doria, Via Ostiense 159, I-00154 Rome, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; Roma Tre University,"Coniglio, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Bari A Moro, Dept Econ & Math Methods, I-70124 Bari, Italy.",nicoladaniele.coniglio@uniba.it; raffaele.lagravinese@uniba.it; davide.vurchio87@gmail.com,"Vurchio, Davide/JRW-5824-2023","Coniglio, Nicola Daniele/0000-0001-6488-4122; Vurchio, Davide/0000-0003-1892-2161",Centro Rossi-Doria; Economics Department of Roma Tre University [791/2014],Centro Rossi-Doria; Economics Department of Roma Tre University,"Raffaele Lagravinese wishes to thank the Centro Rossi-Doria.

Hence higher education institutions face a tradeoff if they wish to increase admission.

The aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of barriers and bridges in social and ecological systems for intensification of wood production in NW Russia. This requires that past development trajectories are understood. Using a local logging frontier in Russia's Komi Republic as a case study, we employed an environmental history approach to: (1) recreate the wood harvesting history for the period 1719-2014, (2) identify the main actors that produced this history, and (3) analyse what ideologies influenced decision making. First, after a long history of selective harvesting before the Russian Revolution in 1917, forests were rapidly clear-felled during the Soviet period 1921-1991. Following general economic deceleration, and thus severely reduced harvesting activities during 1992-1997, the rate of logging has increased slightly again. To conclude, barriers in ecosystems to intensification include Soviet legacies of large-scale harvesting, which resulted in a very uneven age distribution, limited and poorly conducted silviculture, as well as insufficient transport infrastructure. Additionally, social system barriers are a conservative mind-set at the policy level, unpredictable conditions for forest use rights and ownership, and limited value-added production at local level. Developing predictable rules and norms, forest zoning at local to regional scales, and the emergence of place-based multi-level collaborative learning concepts like Model Forest provide opportunity for bridging the observed barriers.

Regulators thus failed to consider that a buildup of macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities could pose systemic risk to the financial sector. The global credit crisis showed the inadequacy of purely prudential surveillance systems and the need for bank supervisors to better detect the buildup of macroeconomic risks before they can threaten the financial system. This article presents an empirical framework for analyzing how effectively macroprudential policies control credit growth, leverage growth, and housing price appreciation.

In addition, due to climate change more frequent extreme precipitation may also increase the frequency and intensity of flash floods. In this study, a hydrologic model H08 has been applied over the basin at a relatively fine grid resolution (10 km). The impacts of climate change are assessed by using the super-high resolution MRI-AGCM3.2S with MB scenario through three time-slice experiments; the base-period (1979-2003), the near-future (2015-2039), and the far-future (2075-2099) periods. This study investigates the spatio-temporal changes and the changes in the frequency of precipitation and runoff with different magnitude ranges and finds the implications for water resources management under climate change. Results show that, (a) the projected maximum increment of mean annual precipitation (runoff) is +23% (+34%) and +31% (+39%) during the near-future and the far-future, respectively, (b) the projected increment of median value of monthly discharges at basin outlet is significantly high in wet period (May July), ranging from 38 to 44% and 25-104% in the near-future and the far future, respectively. Moreover, the monsoonal peaks are expected to come about 1 similar to 1.5 month earlier, which ultimately lead to higher possibility of earlier flash flood in the future. This anticipated higher increment in peak discharge as well as future shifting of seasonal cycle of river discharge will have significant implications for agriculture and flood disaster management. Findings will also contribute to enhance water resource management in the basin and improve the design of adaptive measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study presents an analysis of the occurrence of grassland fire, the factors influencing it, and the fire mitigation strategies employed by small farm-holders in four adjacent upland communities in Carranglan, Nueva Ecija, Philippines. With a total of 779 fire incidents recorded from 2002-2014 covering an estimated overall total of 19,500 ha, grassland areas in Carranglan warrants urgent rehabilitation. The number of fire occurrence in Carranglan were found to have significant positive relationship with temperature, compound topographic index (CH) and aspect (P < 0.05). In response, upland farmers implement several fire mitigation strategies that are either vegetational and structural in nature. The most common practices include regular grass cutting and the establishment of fire lines. Using simple linear regression, the number of fire mitigation strategies implemented by upland farmers is very highly associated to the years of residence in the area, number of children in the household, age of respondents, educational level, livelihood, and farm lot ownership (P < 0.01). The limited number of fire-mitigating strategies implemented by the upland farmers may have contributed to the frequent occurrence of grassland fires in Carranglan. Strategies that would significantly increase farmers' awareness of and capability in implementing various fire-mitigating strategies must be incorporated in a fire hazards management program to ensure success of reforestation projects, which is a key approach in rehabilitating the upland ecosystems.

As expected, the results show that wages have a positive relationship with productivity and a negative relationship with unemployment. The authors also include institutional variables, showing that more flexible labour markets are consistent with wage moderation. They find that, since 2004, increased international competition has made wage determination more strictly related to productivity, and that real exchange rate appreciation triggers a drop in wages. Their results also indicate that government intervention and wage bargaining concertation have a wage-moderating role.","[Camarero, Mariam] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Econ, INTECO Joint Res Unit, Castellon De La Plana, Spain; [D'Adamo, Gaetano; Tamarit, Cecilio] Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, INTECO Joint Res Unit, E-46003 Valencia, Spain",Universitat Jaume I; University of Valencia,"D'Adamo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Valencia, Dept Appl Econ 2, INTECO Joint Res Unit, E-46003 Valencia, Spain.",camarero@eco.uji.es; gaetano.dadamo@uv.es; cecilio.tamarit@uv.es,"Tamarit, Cecilio/A-8178-2010; Tamarit, Cecilio/N-2017-2019; Camarero, Mariam/A-5047-2008","Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Tamarit, Cecilio/0000-0002-0538-9882; Camarero, Mariam/0000-0003-4525-5181","MINECO [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Generalitat Valenciana Prometeo action [2009/098]; European Commission [542457-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL, 542434-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL]",MINECO(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana Prometeo action; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from MINECO project ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R, Generalitat Valenciana Prometeo action 2009/098 and the European Commission (Lifelong Learning Program-Jean Monnet Action references 542457-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL and 542434-LLP-1-2013-1-ES-AJM-CL).

However, the bootstrap rolling-window approach enables us to identify possible time-varying causalities between time series based on sub-sample data. Using a twenty-four-months rolling window over the period 1995:02 to 2013:02 in China and 2003:02-2013:02 in India, we do find that there are bidirectional causal relationships between EPU and stock returns in several sub-periods rather than in the whole sample period.

Most existing studies on this topic look primarily at asset holdings; we examine liability holdings as well. Using the International Monetary Fund's Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey data for equities, long-term debt, and short-term debt, our analysis generally supports the conventional wisdom that East Asian countries are more financially integrated with global financial centers than they are with each other. This is true for both asset holdings and liabilities and is confirmed by an econometric analysis based on financial gravity equations. However, the gap between global integration and regional integration has narrowed for asset holdings over time but not for liability holdings. The results of additional econometric analysis indicate that diversification of liability holdings can mitigate financial instability due to global financial shocks. More precisely, diversification was associated with smaller exchange rate depreciation during the quantitative easing taper tantrum of 2013. These results point to a possible benefit from strengthening regional financial integration. Deeper regional integration would reduce dependence on global financial markets for funding and hence vulnerability to global shocks.","[Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Econ & Res Dept, Macroecon & Finance Res Div, Manila, Philippines; [Shin, Kwanho] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Asian Development Bank; Korea University,"Shin, K (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 5-1 Anam Dong, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",khshin@korea.ac.kr,"Shin, Kwanho/AAL-7502-2021","Shin, Kwanho/0000-0001-9747-7603",Asian Development Bank; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A2A03065052],Asian Development Bank; National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by the Asian Development Bank and the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5A2A03065052).,,17,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

A conceptual framework illustrated with urban adaptation policy,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Co-production; Transformation; Futures; Urban heat island; Climate change; Adaptation,KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; CITIES,"Projects in which science-based futures are produced indicating the relevant impacts of climatic changes are proliferating, in tandem with the increasing attention for climate change adaptation. Constructionist science studies have put forward the concept of 'co-production' to understand how knowledge claims become stable, authoritative, get institutionalised and reorder science and society. Moreover, knowledge and structures of power are co-evolutionary. Exercises in constructing futures are interesting practices where what is and what ought are enmeshed, and where knowledge claims may in turn be performative for societal reordering. This article presents a conceptual framework to understand the transformation of knowledge claims about the future in more analytical detail. Five concepts are suggested to aid the analysis of transformations: reduction, extension, rhetorical packaging, modification and redefinition. This conceptual framework is used to present a qualitative, in-depth study about the transformation of the volatile issue of urban warming in the face of climate change in the Netherlands, and the related knowledge claims on the future of this issue. As this case makes clear, the constant erosion of legitimacy for urban warming as a matter of collective concern is important to understand the transformation of knowledge claims. Also, the context and organisational embedding in which the projects originated had direct consequences for the construction of relevant knowledge on future urban warming. Moreover, the pre-existing methodologies science brings to the production of knowledge functioned as important templates which transformed the issue of urban warming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such an approach may not provide accurate economic impact estimates since climate change will affect multiple sectors simultaneously. Furthermore, imprecise aggregate economic impact estimates may result if one were to add together individual sector impact estimates. We used CGE models to compare economic impacts of individual, additive, and simultaneous climate-induced changes in Canadian and other regions' forest and agriculture sectors over the 2006-2051 period. We found negative additive impact biases in a majority of regions for five of our economic variables including GDP, income, imports, terms of trade, capital, and total output. Positive additive impact biases were found in a majority of regions for four economic variables including welfare, consumption, export, and labor. These findings emphasize the importance of considering impacted sectors simultaneously when using CGE models to evaluate the economic impacts of climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study sought to identify the determinants of import demand for Egyptian potatoes in these two countries. A general differentiated demand system approach was used to estimate conditional potato import demand per country. For each country, it was assumed that the system of conditional import demand equations for potatoes is specified according to the sources of origin and also depends on all imported potato prices and total import potato expenditure. When estimated econometrically, this import demand model allows conditional price and expenditure elasticities to be derived. The econometric results indicated that with an estimated elasticity of 1.95, Egyptian potato exports responded significantly to total expenditure on imported potatoes by Germany. On the other hand, Egyptian potato exports to Germany did not exhibit significant price responses. In all cases but one, estimated conditional uncompensated price elasticities were not statistically different from zero. However, more interesting results were obtained concerning the price responses of Egyptian potato exports to the UK, whereby the conditional ( uncompensated) direct elasticity of potato imports from Egypt to the UK (-0.71) showed an inelastic response to its own price. Furthermore, Egyptian potato exports seemed to compete on the UK market with potatoes originating from Israel and France, while they displayed complementarity with Dutch imports.","[Abu Hatab, A.] Suez Canal Univ, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Al Arish, Egypt; [Surry, Y.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Uppsala, Sweden",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Suez Canal University; Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Abu Hatab, A (通讯作者)，Suez Canal Univ, Dept Econ & Rural Dev, Al Arish, Egypt.",ahatab@a-sci-agr.suez.edu.eg; yves.surry@slu.se,"Abu Hatab, Assem/J-6823-2019","Abu Hatab, Assem/0000-0002-6764-1887",,,,,15,1,1,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,39,47,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.6,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400006,0

Over the period from 1997 to 2012, we find that three conventional indices (Europe, Japan, and UK) are efficient, but that none of the Islamic indices are efficient in these markets. During the recent financial crisis, our results indicate slightly more efficiency for the Islamic indices than their conventional counterparts. Our study finds that overall the conventional indices are more efficient than their Islamic counterparts. Nevertheless, during periods of general downturns the Islamic indices have shown the same level of efficiency as their counterparts. Furthermore, it appears that during the last two sub-periods under study, the Islamic indices have moved toward efficiency, displaying the same level of efficiency as their counterparts.","[Al-Khazali, Osamah M.] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business & Adm, Dept Finance, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Leduc, Guillaume] Amer Univ Sharjah, Dept Math & Stat, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Alsayed, Mohammad Saleh] Univ Wollongong Dubai, Dept Finance & Accounting, Dubai, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah; American University of Sharjah; University of Wollongong,"Al-Khazali, OM (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",kazali@aus.edu,"Leduc, Guillaume/Q-8164-2019; Alkhazali, Osamah/AAI-5218-2021","Leduc, Guillaume/0000-0003-3800-8211; Alkhazali, Osamah/0000-0002-1287-3066",,,,,47,38,39,1,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The present article introduces an innovative measurement, which is demonstrated to fit better into arbitrage pricing theory than existing approaches. This topic is not only interesting for negative basis investors.

A process of increasing the concentration level in retailing has been observed since the year 2000 in Bulgaria, through increasing the area of physical retail units, building national retail chains, foreign chains entering the market, facilitating the merger and acquisition processes. Methods: The analysis is descriptive and covers the period from 2008 to 2014. The comparative analysis of concentration and buyer power of retailers is carried out through the coefficient of overtaking base indexes of those indicators. The information is based on data provided by the National Statistical Institute of Bulgaria at the request of the author, Eurostat and Euromonitor data. Results: The concentration ratio of the four main competitors in retail trade with predominantly food products is constantly growing and its increase is outpacing the gross margin level growth in the retail trade industry. The research results support the hypothesis that food retail concentration is higher in comparison with food manufacturing concentration, which results in the retailers' stronger position as buyers. Conclusion: The food retail trade concentration process in Bulgaria is going to continue and it is bound to lead to an increase of the retailers' bargaining power in negotiations as buyers. The latter is a prerequisite for more research on the indicated processes and their impact on consumers, producers, small retailers, the local community and society as a whole.","[Dimitrova, Violeta] Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria",University of Economics Varna,"Dimitrova, V (通讯作者)，Varna Univ Econ, Varna, Bulgaria.",,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,185,192,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100025,0

Results indicate that an increase in women's bargaining power promotes adequate HIV prevention strategies, namely condom use within marriage and HIV-related spousal communication. Own income, language skills, and awareness of options outside marriage also play an important role. By estimating a constant for each individual in the sample, the analysis controls for the impact individual-specific, nonmeasurable characteristics have on attitudes toward prevention. It captures the impact of HIV campaigns and increases in HIV prevalence over time on prevention behavior by using (regional) time trends. The findings are highly comparable across different econometric specifications and suggest substantial gains from placing greater emphasis on women's empowerment to effectively combat the spread of HIV, particularly in developing countries.","[Gerritzen, Berit] Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ SIAW HSG, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, SG, Switzerland",University of St Gallen,"Gerritzen, B (通讯作者)，Univ St Gallen, Swiss Inst Int Econ SIAW HSG, Bodanstr 8, CH-9000 St Gallen, SG, Switzerland.",,,,"Swiss National Science Foundation [P1SGP1_148719]; NICHD [R01HD053781, R01HD044228, R01HD/MH41713]; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [P1SGP1_148719] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)",Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); NICHD(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)); Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank Jerome Adda, Iris Bohnet, Bruno S.

The aim of this paper is to present the results of empirical research focused on identifying the current situation in using of the prediction methods in Czech companies. In the paper are formulated two partial goals. The first partial goal is to define main reasons why Czech companies do not use prediction methods. The second partial goal is to identify the most used prediction methods in Czech companies. Following the aim of this paper we formulated 4 hypotheses. The validity of hypotheses was verified by statistical software programme SPSS on basis of primary data gained in questionnaire research. Thanks to 100 questionnaires received from business entities we were able to verify and evaluate the current state of using of prediction methods.,"[Gundova, Petra] Matej Bel Univ Banska, Fac Econ, Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Gundová, P (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska, Fac Econ, Bystrica, Slovakia.",petra.gundova@umb.sk,"Gundova, Petra/HKO-6336-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,3,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,133,142,,,,,,10,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100012,0

We employ various methods of forecast combination, bootstrap aggregation (bagging), diffusion index (principal component), and Bayesian regressions to allow for a simultaneous role of the variables under consideration, besides individual predictive regressions. We assess both the statistical and economic significance of the individual predictive regressions, combination methods, bagging, principal components, and Bayesian regressions. Our results show that forecast combination methods and principal component regressions improve the predictability of the equity premium relative to the benchmark autoregressive model of order one (AR[1]). However, the Bayesian predictive regressions are found to be the standout performers with the models outperforming the individual regressions, forecast combination methods, bagging and principal component regressions, both in terms of statistical (forecasting) and economic (utility) gains.","[Gupta, Rangan; Modise, Mampho P.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Uwilingiye, Josine] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Johannesburg,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,,,,,,,40,6,9,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Two data sets (self-designed household surveys at Xingwen County in 2012 and the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) data covering 29 provinces in 2013) are adopted for empirical analysis. The results find that land reduction has significantly positive effects on the probability and the share of family nonfarm labor allocation from both data sets.

Georgia has a long history of peach cultivation. However, due to the August 2008 Five Day War with Russia, a historic neighboring trading partner, direct shipment to Russia was no longer allowed. This resulted in a considerable oversupply of fruit that needed to be marketed to neighboring Azerbaijan. The commercial peach orchards that I visited needed considerable attention. Following site visits, problem diagnoses and extensive discussions with the owners and farm manager, an intensive educational training program was taught both in classroom and field settings. This included a comprehensive week-long Peach Growing 101 training course. Visits to other comercial and government run orchards were used to build connections between the growers I was working with and other in-country experts. Georgia does not have a Cooperative Extension service like here in the USA. Visits to both local wholesale and retail farmer's markets were used as opportunities to discuss best management practices after harvest. A full recommendation report was prepared and shared with the growers. Near the end of the second visit, I participated in an interview about peach growing for the popular Our Farm television program to a national television audience on 9/9/2012. We made observations about problems in the orchard and discussed differences in peach cultivation between the Republic of Georgia and the USA.","[Layne, D.

Has the pricing reform strengthened the linkage between the international crude market and China's petroleum products market? Has the pricing reform magnified shocks to the international crude market on China's economy? Our results show that the reform has strengthened the relationship between China's petroleum prices and international crude price without negative influence on China's economy, but the effect of China's petroleum prices on international crude price is still limited.

The national power grid company's estimation regarding installed power of PVPPs shows that it will increase in the coming three years by almost 35%. The operation of PVPPs is mainly based on solar radiation. This paper develops several solutions for PVPP generation forecast. We have considered the yearly dataset of two PVPPs located in Corabia 7 MW and Izvoru 9.6 MW; the distance between the two PVPPs is about 100 km. First, we have developed the neural networks for predicting, analysing and monitoring the performance indicator for PVPP generation in Romania by applying three algorithms: Levenberg-Marquardt, the Bayesian Regularization and the Scaled Conjugate Gradient algorithms.

It starts from the national level, macro regional and regional for the indicators, determining the indices of structure (for acreage and total production), using the following formula: Is=si/st x100(%). In average yield case, macro-regional and regional levels comparison is realized with national level of the indicator. In terms of cultivated area, Macro region 2 holds almost half of the national sunflower (47.08%), followed by three Macro regions 1 (28.25%), Macro region 4 (19.64%) and Macro region 1 (5.03%) - aspect correlated with favorability areas of culture at national level. Total production is dominated in structure, by Macro region 2, followed by Macro region 3 Macro region 4 and Macro regions 1 (42.82, 30.61, 21.49 and 5.08%), similar situation with cultivated area. National average yield is exceeded in case of Macro regions 3 and 4 (9.45 and respectively + 8.14%), while the level of macro-regions 1 and 2 record subunit levels (98.58 and 91.04% respectively). The sunflower is a plant demanding environmental conditions (climate, soil, etc.), but fmds favorable conditions-in general-of culture in Romania. Is necessary the appropriate framing of crop in culture rotations and solving the retooling problem of mechanical park. A particular aspect is represented by capitalization of production, which we solved at least in terms of quantity, but must be strongly negotiated with beneficiaries in terms of delivery price obtained.","[Panzaru, Radu Lucian; Medelete, Dragon Mihai] Univ Craiova, Fac Agron, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Pânzaru, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Fac Agron, Craiova, Romania.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,709,716,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100093,0

The purpose of this workshop was to introduce the latest methodology for design and analysis of blocked experiments. ANOVA, when applied to non-normal - more properly called non-Gaussian - data common in horticultural research, is not recommended as it produces inaccurate mean estimates and unreliable hypothesis test results. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM), implemented by the SAS (R) procedure GLIMMIX, or its R equivalent, lme4, allow the researcher to identify the appropriate distribution and analyze the data with more accuracy. Using examples of block designs for a greenhouse situation in which strawberries in pots are grown on benches, we showed how to use GLMM methods to optimize the design. We also illustrated the differences between ANOVA- and GLMM-based analysis, and demonstrated how to select and interpret appropriate analyses.

This promotes dynamic development of the services sphere. An important position in the services sector is occupied by everyday services for the population. Along with that, the network of everyday services companies and their branches is underdeveloped in rural areas, especially in peripheral towns and villages, which presents a weakness of the sphere of everyday services. It is common knowledge that utility companies, both state and private, suffer from serious personnel problems. An important role in the functioning and development of the local services sphere and in particular in the areas of everyday, utility and social services, belongs to municipal administrations, since rapid progress in the local services sector will serve as a catalyst for local development capable of launching a continuous chain of intrinsic changes in the economy of a municipality. Yet not all local administrations pay due attention to that, for which reason a number of urgent problems with certain services of everyday nature and services of market infrastructure are neglected and left to their own devices. Whereas in present-day conditions local administrations should not only encourage the development of a variety of services but also actively promote and take part in it themselves. The subject of state regulation of the services sphere has not been extensively developed by Russian authors. A lot of operational aspects of the services sector, including management and state regulation under present-day market conditions and the specifics of its development in Russia, remain insufficiently studied, which points to the vast potential for extensive and intensive development of this field of economics as well as its importance for the national economy.

A highly educated and skilled workforce therefore becomes an imperative in order to achieve the necessary productivity gains. The task for horticulture is to re-fashion its image, create career paths for newcomers and work smarter not harder. An appropriate workforce will only occur if prospective employees find attraction to the careers on offer in the industry.

Tourism, as a significant and powerful socioeconomic phenomenon, has a very important role in that transition. The aim of the paper was to point out the importance of responsible tourism, as a concept that refers to the willingness of different stakeholders involved in tourism to take responsibility to respond, to act and to contribute to sustainability. The empirical research was aimed to estimate the contribution of local population to environmental conservation of tourism destinations. The Istrian County, as the most developed tourist region in Croatia was taken as a case study. It has shown that in the Istrian County local people are environmentally conscious, but with a relatively low level of environmental literacy. It was explained with lack of free time, financial constraints, insufficient knowledge, etc. Tourism is considered as contributing to the conservation of natural heritage. The preserved environment is considered as an important competitive advantage of Croatian tourism. The inhabitants of cities more oriented toward tourism have a higher level of environmental literacy and are more satisfied with the state of the environment in their local communities. As it was supposed, women have a higher level of environmental literacy than men. They are more critical and less satisfied with the state of the environment, but in the same time, more ready to be active engaged. It can be concluded that tourism development have a positive impact on conservation of natural heritage in the observed communities. Educational activities (formal, informal and non formal education) and relevant media could improve the level of environmental literacy of various stakeholders.","[Rakitovac, Kristina Afric] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Rakitovac, KA (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia.",,,,,,,,13,1,1,2,18,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,889,896,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100116,0

The Indian rural economy is also experiencing an entrepreneurial need. A farm business necessarily requires deliberate decision and proper investment, after assessing risks and available resources to maximize profit. Therefore, entrepreneurship is not simply adoption of new technology but also transformation of technology suited to the rural sector. The main targeted objective of this program is economic empowerment of rural women through building capacity in entrepreneurship and information and communication technology skills to enable them to market their horticultural produce (fruits and vegetables). The program aims to help the women self-help groups to earn improved livelihoods by organizing them into cooperatives. Farmers need to adopt a set of postharvest technologies which are cost effective and appropriate for reducing losses by keeping perishable produce fresh for longer period or processing them into durable products, viz., juice, pulp, concentrate, etc., to fetch a better return on their produce. An integrated postharvest management approach helps in achieving (i) better market access; (ii) nutrition security; (iii) poverty alleviation; (iv) employment generation; (v) environment protection; and (vi) economic transformation of rural populations. Apart from helping farmers to get loans through SHG-Bank linkage, it provides the necessary subsidy and techno-managerial support through training and capacity building so that the women will start making a reasonable profit from the beginning. This paper focuses on, and provides an insight into, the qualities required for rural women entrepreneurs, and the opportunities and challenges faced by them, followed by a brief discussion on entrepreneurship as a career.","[Raman, N.

For that a questionnaire was fulfilled by supermarket consumers. According to their answers, most of the consumers will not go to a specific supermarket due to the offers they can find there (location and the products are more important factors), but they may pick a different product because of that. In conclusion, offers may change the buying behavior once the consumers are in supermarket, ultimately making them to choose products that may not really need.","[Stoicescu, Cristina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stoicescu, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",kris_stoicesku@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,353,360,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300056,0

The presence of strategic management supports the competitiveness of the enterprises, as confirmed by numerous empirical studies. The behaviour of the Czech companies is influenced by their communist history and their resistance to long-term planning. So the utilisation of strategic activities within the managing of companies can be lower in comparison with Austria. The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors influencing the level of strategic activities' implementation in SMEs in the Czech Republic and Austria. We have tested the impact of the strategic management utilisation level on the economic results from the earliest. After that, verification of hypotheses between two factors, namely size and perceived environmental uncertainty, and the level of strategic management utilisation is tested. In order to verify the hypotheses, we analysed quantitative data collected by a survey of SMEs in the Czech Republic and Austria in 2012. The statistical comparison of the data from the two countries enables us to test the hypothesis of cultural differences' impact on the level of the strategic activities' utilisation given, either historically or demographically.The results confirm that the level of strategic activities' implementation positively influences the economic situation of the SMEs. The level of strategic activities' implementation is positively influenced by both the size of the company and the perceived environmental uncertainty. But there is a statistically significant difference in the perception of environmental uncertainty between the Czech and Austrian companies.","[Svandova, Eva; Odehnalova, Pavla] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Svandová, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Svandova, Eva/C-7492-2015; Marciánová, Pavla/ABA-9195-2021; Marciánová, Pavla/AAA-3534-2020; Švandová, Eva/AAE-2416-2020","Marciánová, Pavla/0000-0002-4835-8293;",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,747,754,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200098,0

Therefore, we setup a small-open Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model with non-trivial interactions between real and financial sectors, where loans can be taken in domestic or foreign currency. We calibrate the model for the Romanian economy and we show that the presence of foreign currency loans affects the transmission mechanism of the monetary policy. Furthermore, the optimal behavior of the monetary policy is influenced by the presence of foreign currency loans and, in the case of a positive technology shock, the value of the central bank loss function increases significantly in comparison with the scenario where loans can be taken only in domestic currency. Also, our simulations reveal that a tightening of the monetary policy can translate into a shift in the composition of loans, which eventually could affect the efficiency of the monetary policy impulse.","[Viziniuc, Madalin] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Viziniuc, M (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",madalin.viziniuc@fin.ase.ro,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,347,352,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300055,0

I argue that cycle metaphors naturalize change and distract us from the social and institutional relations underpinning transformation in local property markets. I emphasize the performative nature of cycles by focusing on the networks of actors - brokers, appraisers, investors, and planners - that move capital through the built environment, articulating arguments for its free passage, identifying inflexion points, and temporarily stabilizing the meanings associated with individual buildings, submarkets, and periods. Drawing from a case study of an office development cycle in downtown Chicago (1998-2009), I argue that cycles can be treated not only as metaphors that describe economic processes, but also as socially effective constructions in their own right. Specifically, I consider three ways in which actors perform cycles, including (1) professionals' use of market devices that contain within them assumptions regarding the proper timing of (dis) investment; (2) the existence of incentives for herding among professionals that draw them to and away from assets at roughly the same times; and (3) the importance of cycle thinking in instilling the confidence necessary to speculate on an unknown future.","[Weber, Rachel] Univ Illinois, Urban Planning & Policy Dept, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Weber, R (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urban Planning & Policy Dept, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",rachelw@uic.edu,,,,,,,63,29,30,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The aggregate level of confidence in society reflects the consumers' expectations about their future incomes together with their preferences between current and future consumption and determines aggregate demand for consumption spending.

The strategy situates China as a regional trade and transit hub in the Heart of Asia. This study's theoretical framework is a hybrid of fragile state theory and the new economic geography theory. The finding of this study is about the One Belt One Road strategy is more advanced than the traditional international development aid model. This study employee the Afghanistan and DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) as the case studies to identify One Belt One Road strategy would promote the most fragile and isolated states to become more fully integrated into the regional and global economies by developing the transport, energy and mining sectors. The study further finds that the implementation of the hardware infrastructure projects may result in increased risk of failure in certain politically fractious and unstable regions of the countries. This study contributes substantially to aid policy by demonstrating the characteristics that are essential to a successful strategy for the development of a failed state that is geological-characterized, fragile, and conflict-affected. Moreover, this study expands the use of econometric techniques such as cost-benefit analysis to the design of an economic development strategy for the failed states. Thus, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, this study will contribute to the emerging bodies of academic research on fragile states; post-conflict reconstruction and stabilization; geological-characterized less development countries; and applied and theoretical economic growth models.","[Zhang, Yan-zhe] Liaoning Univ, Sch Econ, Shenyang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Hui-zhi] Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China",Liaoning University; Jilin University,"Zhang, HZ (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Northeast Asian Studies Coll, Changchun, Jilin, Peoples R China.",yan.zhang@canberra.edu.au; huizhi@jlu.edu.cn,"zhang, huizhi/AAT-6273-2020",,,,,,14,0,0,0,13,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-368-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,135,139,,,,,,5,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BF8YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385266400025,0

Assignment to remediation is generally made on the basis of performance on a placement exam. When students are required to take a placement exam prior to enrolling in college-level courses, assignment to remediation may dissuade students from actually going to college. This is because remediation could increase the time required to complete a degree (because remedial courses do not count toward academic degrees), and also because being identified as needing remediation might have stigma effects or provide students with new information about their unsuitability for college. This paper examines this issue empirically using administrative data from Texas. Using regression discontinuity methods, we find that students whose placement exam scores would require them to be in remediation are no less likely to enroll in college than are students who score just above the remediation placement cutoff.","[Martorell, Paco] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Educ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [McFarlin, Isaac, Jr.] Univ Michigan, Gerald Ford Sch Publ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Xue, Yu] Univ Texas Dallas, Educ Res Ctr, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Martorell, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Sch Educ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",pmartorell@ucdavis.edu; imcfar@umich.edu; yxx036000@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,45,10,18,0,43,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

Using a step wise time series cross section regression analysis on state-level panel data over 1990-2008, we examine two hypotheses to explain this increase: Forest cover is influenced by policies as well as the timber market. While appropriately controlling for economic and structural influences, we find that implementation of joint forest management is positively correlated with forest cover, implying that community participation is key to effective afforestation; and the timber and fuel wood market demands are positively correlated with forest cover, implying that demand-driven growth is conducive to forest growth, especially in presence of complementary policies. Our results suggest that policies, by supporting individual interests, can increase forest cover more effectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The research focused on the destemming process and examined both the consumers' and producers' perspectives. An auction experiment was conducted to measure consumer preferences for wakame with different destemming standards (1, 4, 7, and 10mm). It was found that, although consumer preferences were diverse, there was no preference between the present (1-mm) and 4-mm standards. In addition, a production experiment was used to measure the amount of labor that could be saved (and thereby the improvement in profit) by relaxing the standard from 1mm to 4mm. It was concluded that this new standard would increase productivity by 13.3% without affecting consumer demand, which will improve the structure of this industry for competition against cheaper foreign products.","[Wakamatsu, Hiroki; Miyata, Tsutomu] Fisheries Res Agcy, Ctr Econ & Business Adm, Natl Res Inst Fisheries Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan",Japan Fisheries Research & Education Agency (FRA),"Wakamatsu, H (通讯作者)，Fisheries Res Agcy, Ctr Econ & Business Adm, 2-12-4 Fukuura, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2368648, Japan.",hwakamatsu@affrc.go.jp,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Evidence from Sales Managers,JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STOCK OPTION AWARDS; INCENTIVES; SCHEMES,"This paper examines how sales managers, acting as agents of the firm, game the staffing and incentives of their subordinates. Sales managers on a quota's cusp have a unique personal incentive to retain and lower quotas for poor-performing subordinates, allowing one to isolate a manager's interest from the firm's. Using microdata from 244 firms that subscribe to a cloud-based service for processing sales compensation, I estimate that 13%-15% of both quota adjustments and retentions among poor performers are explained by managers' incentives around quotas. Although a minority of poor performers are subsequently terminated or transferred, most are retained indefinitely.","Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Benson, A (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",alanmb@mit.edu,,"Benson, Alan/0000-0003-4256-3357",,,,,37,9,11,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0734-306X,1537-5307,,J LABOR ECON,J.

Such differences may matter for post-compulsory education choices in school systems where external assessments are not available when these choices are made. I use sibling fixed effects methods to simulate changes in educational choices for disadvantaged groups if they were graded by their teachers as their advantaged peers. The results suggest that probabilities of enrolling in more ambitious tracks would increase across the whole ability distribution and for all disadvantaged groups. In particular, in the middle of the ability distribution the results predict an increase of 5% points in migrant pupils' probability of enrolling in high-school. The corresponding increase for pupils with low educated parents is 4% points, closing 13% of the high-school enrolment gap to pupils with high educated parents. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Higher wages may be required to compensate for a less pleasant environment or a higher cost of living. If wages in a competing sector within an area are less flexible and therefore less competitive this may lead to an inability to employ staff. This paper considers the market for nursing staff in France where there is general regulation of wages and public hospitals compete for staff with the private hospital and non-hospital sectors. We consider two types of nursing staff, registered and assistant nurses and first establish the degree of spatial variation in the competitiveness of pay of nurses in public hospitals. We then consider whether these spatial variations are associated with variation in the employment of nursing staff. We find that despite regulation of pay in the public and private sector, there are substantial local variations in the competitiveness of nurses' pay. We find evidence that the spatial variations in the competitiveness of pay are associated with relative numbers of assistant nurses but not registered nurses. While we find the influence of the competitiveness of pay is small, it suggests that nonpay conditions may be an important factor in adjusting the labour market as might be expected in such a regulated market.","[Combes, Jean-Baptiste] Inst Res & Informat Hlth Econ, F-75018 Paris, France; [Delattre, Eric] Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Delattre, Eric] THEMA, UMR CNRS 8184, F-95011 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Elliott, Bob; Skaetun, Diane] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",CY Cergy Paris Universite; University of Aberdeen,"Combes, JB (通讯作者)，Inst Res & Informat Hlth Econ, 10 Rue Vauvenargues, F-75018 Paris, France.",jeanbaptiste.combes@free.fr; eric.delattre@u-cergy.fr; r.elliott@abdn.ac.uk; d.skatun@abdn.ac.uk,"Combes, Simon Jean-Baptiste/AAD-1978-2022","Combes, Simon Jean-Baptiste/0000-0001-6594-8458",Rennes Metropole; University of Aberdeen,Rennes Metropole(Region Bretagne); University of Aberdeen,"We are very grateful for the comments of two anonymous referees who greatly improved this article.

To inform policy makers about the cost burden in CF, it is crucial to understand what factors influence the costs and how they affect the costs. Based on 1,060 observations (from 731 patients) obtained from the Australian Data Registry, individual annual health care costs were calculated and a regression analysis was carried out to examine the impact of multiple variables on the costs. A method of retransformation and a hypothetical patient were used for cost analysis. We show that an additional one unit improvement of FEV1pp (i.e., forced expiratory volume in 1 s as a percentage of predicted volume) reduces the costs by 1.4 %, or for a hypothetical patient whose FEV1pp is 73 the cost reduction is A$252. The presence of chronic infections increases the costs by 69.9-163.5 % (A$12,852-A$30,047 for the hypothetical patient) depending on the type of infection. The type of CF genetic mutation and the patient's age both have significant effects on the costs. In particular, being homozygous for p.F508del increases the costs by 26.8 % compared to all the other gene mutations. We conclude that bacterial infections have a very strong influence on the costs, so reducing both the infection rates and the severity of the condition may lead to substantial cost savings. We also suggest that the patient's genetic profile should be considered as an important cost determinant.","[Gu, Yuanyuan] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia; [Garcia-Perez, Sonia] Inst Salud Carlos III, Agcy Hlth Technol Assessment, Madrid, Spain; [Garcia-Perez, Sonia] REDISSEC, Madrid, Spain; [Massie, John] Royal Childrens Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Massie, John] Univ Melbourne, Dept Paediat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Massie, John] Murdoch Childrens Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [van Gool, Kees] Univ Technol Sydney, Ctr Hlth Econ Res & Evaluat, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",Monash University; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; Agencia de Evaluacion de Tecnologias Sanitarias (AETS); Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne; University of Melbourne; Murdoch Children's Research Institute; University of Technology Sydney,"Gu, YY (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Level 2,Bldg 75, Melbourne, Vic 3800, Australia.",yuanyuan.gu@monash.edu,"van Gool, Kees/JXW-8446-2024","van Gool, Kees/0000-0002-1424-9304; Gu, Yuanyuan/0000-0002-3816-9106",University of Technology Sydney; National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant [571926],University of Technology Sydney; National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant,"This project was funded by an Early Career Research Grant at the University of Technology Sydney and a National Health and Medical Research Council Health Services Research Capacity Building Grant (No. 571926).

J,"Bateman, D",,,,"Bateman, Debra",,,Ethical dilemmas: Teaching futures in schools,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Futures education; Educational policy; Ethical practices; Curriculum; Values,EDUCATION; REFLECTIONS; MOTIVATION; TEACHERS; FAMILIES; SELF,"Educational policy is implicitly futures oriented, yet in most instances fails to engage learners with explicit futures tools and concepts at a school level. Futures studies in education, or futures education has the potential to reposition learning as purposeful and mobilizes the lives of participants by connecting the curriculum of schools with the multifaceted futures of learners. This is a complex task within the tensions often existing between: the cultural role of a school, the expectations of a society, the expertise of teachers, and the increasingly diverse needs of learners (Bateman, 2012). It is between the tensions of these things that the 'ethical' issues of what is taught, or omitted as content in a classroom and the consequences of these choices are evident. This paper highlights ethical and moral dilemmas, as they were apparent in two futures education projects. In the first study, the teachers discuss the inherent limitations of offering a broader and more futures oriented curriculum. In the second study, teachers reflect upon their students' anxiety with regards to futures images as they are interrogated within a curriculum study. Each of these studies highlights the ethical challenges that arise, when possible, preferable and probable futures are developed as part of learning in school settings, which are culturally and demographically diverse. Tirri and Husu (2002) highlight the ethical dilemmas, which emerge in classrooms around the world, based on conflicts in values and competing intentions between key stakeholders. In the studies which contribute to this discussion, there is evidence to suggest that futures thinking causes conflict within an individual's perception of how the world should be, or their worldview as a result of futures imagining which goes beyond what is taken for granted, or is an assumed future eventuality. In the same way, Carrington, Deppeler, and Moss (2010) argue that all curriculum choices about what is taught (or not taught) in a classroom reflect an ethical decision made by a teacher, with regards to what is foregrounded for learning and what is omitted. It is crucial to re-examine the role of a school in educating students for their futures, as opposed to educating students with an aim of furthering governmental agendas. More significantly, however, as this paper highlights, it is exploring the boundaries of what is acceptable or unacceptable, appropriate or inappropriate to teach in a classroom, given the changing diversities of schools and education systems throughout the world.

Although computer-assisted learning (CAL) has been considered one alternative to improve learning outcomes in a cost-effective way, the empirical evidence of its impacts on improving learning outcomes is mixed. This paper uses a randomized field experiment to explore the effects of CAL on student academic and non-academic outcomes for students in migrant schools in Beijing. Our results show that a remedial CAL program held out of regular school hours improved the student standardized math scores by 0.15 standard deviations and most of the program effect took place within 2 months after the start of the program. Students with less-educated parents benefited more from the program. Moreover, CAL also significantly increased the students' interest in learning. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A main challenge in this context is to identify social factors influencing the level of public acceptability towards co-management frameworks especially in countries where the state has had traditionally a very strong role in the management of natural resources. The present paper aims to investigate the social factors influencing the level of acceptability for participatory management frameworks in two forest protected areas of Greece differing in the date of their establishment: the Tzoumerka-Peristeri-Arachthos Gorge National Park and the Vikos-Aoos National Park. Specifically, through the distribution of a structured questionnaire to local communities, we explored the influence of social factors (trust in institutions, social trust and social networks) on citizens' perceptions for a shift in participatory management frameworks. Furthermore, we explore the restriction that citizens perceive from the implementation of such frameworks. According to the study, there is clear preference towards a collaborative management framework which is based on the cooperation of local communities with state actors. Social trust, social networks and institutional trust have a significant impact on citizens' perceptions, especially for collaborative management policies which promote the cooperation of local communities with public actors. Finally, the level of restriction that citizens perceive from each proposed policy is also linked with the level of acceptability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We used the Survey on Disabilities, Autonomy and Dependency carried out in Spain in 2008 to obtain information on disabled individuals with Alzheimer and their informal caregivers. Assessment of informal care time was performed using three different approaches: the proxy good method, the opportunity cost method and the contingent valuation method. A statistical multivariate analysis-an ordered probit model-was performed to study the determinants of informal care provided. The average number of required informal hours per year was 4,151. The cost per caregiver ranged from 31,839 to 52,760 euros under the proxy good method; it was estimated at 20,053 euros under the opportunity cost method; and it ranged between 18,680 and 29,057 euros under the contingent valuation method. The degree of dependency and the formal care services were the main variables that explained the variability of the informal time provided. When a person presents a very high level of dependency, the probability of receiving more than 100 h of informal care per week is 25.8 % higher than a non-dependent person with AD. Formal in-home care complements informal caregiving, while formal care outside the home replaces it. Informal care represents a high social cost in people with AD, regardless of the estimation method considered. A higher level of dependence is associated with more hours of informal care provided.","[Maria Pena-Longobardo, Luz; Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Toledo, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Red Invest Serv Salud Enfermedades Cron REDISSEC, Toledo, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Law & Social Sci, Toledo, Spain.",juan.olivamoreno@uclm.es,"Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/K-6413-2017","Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/0000-0001-7224-2189",,,,,44,34,38,1,24,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Therefore this paper draws upon multiple models of rule compliance to assess the factors influencing compliance in the high forest zone of Ghana. Specifically, the paper considers whether compliance with formal laws that prohibit the felling of timber trees, farming in forest reserves and the use of fire to clear land is explained by perceptions of government enforcement, social norms and/or the perceived legitimacy of rules and government officials while controlling for a number of potentially intervening factors, and each other. The results indicate that compliance is affected by deterrence, social norms, and the perceived fairness of laws; but more importantly it demonstrates that the factors affecting compliance vary across the three studied rules. Whereas compliance with the tree-felling rule is driven by government enforcement; compliance with the fire and farming rules appears to be linked to social norms and the fairness of rules. Given that levels of compliance are considerably higher for the bushfire and farming rules; we conclude by suggesting greater attention on the normative aspects of the compliance decision, and legal reforms that might align legislation with the social norms and practices of local users.

In contrast to this general trend, Brazil emerged as a noteworthy exception due to the widespread implementation of major REDD+ initiatives. This research paper aims at understanding the implementation of REDD+ in Brazil from a discursive perspective. The analysis identifies two discourses that are guiding the implementation of REDD+ in different ways. On the one hand, advocates of a sustainable development discourse conceive REDD+ as a centralized mechanism to foster pre-existing deforestation control and sustainable economic activities through centralized mechanisms such as the Amazon Fund. On the other hand, a number of disconnected actors follow a carbon commodification discourse inspired by the idea of neoliberal conservation and create REDD+ projects to provide carbon offset to voluntary markets. The analysis of these discourses reveal that implementation processes do not rely on discursive convergence, but rather culminate in the parallel development and implementation of distinct REDD+ discourses that are at the same time competing, coexisting and collaborating on different levels.

Using the unique, natural experiment of a mandated divorce cooling-off period in Korea, a difference-in-differences (DD) estimation of the impact of such a cooling-off period on divorce outcomes shows that the cooling-off period increases filing cancellation and reduces finalized divorce rates without any effect on initial divorce filing rates. Estimates indicate that the number of divorces finalized decreases by approximately 9 percent, and that this effect is consistent over the long run. Research also shows that couples who have undergone a prior separation period or have conclusive causes to divorce do not respond to the cooling-off period, suggesting that emotional state at the time of decision is the driving force of observed dynamic inconsistency.","[Wie, Dainn] Natl Grad Sch Policy Studies, Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1068677, Japan; [Kim, Hyoungjong] Korea Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies; Korea University,"Wie, D (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Sch Policy Studies, Econ, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",wie-dainn@grips.ac.jp; hyoungjong.kim@gmail.com,,,,,,,36,4,5,14,135,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

J,"Charron, JO",,,,"Charron, Jacques-Olivier",,,Toward investee's capitalism A civic-market compromise,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Investor; Investee; Financial asset; Capitalism; Compromise; Valuation,,"Thirty years ago, capitalism shifted from a civic-industrial compromise to an industrial-market compromise. It may now be on the eve of morphing into a civic-market one. To understand why and how this could happen, we analyze the legitimacy crisis of capitalism and explore a possible outcome. This crisis is considered as a crisis of the legitimacy of financial markets, stemming from a gap between their justification and characteristics of the goods traded on it, i.e. financial assets. We first show the lack of any intrinsic utility of these goods makes the markets where they are traded impossible to legitimize within a market order:Then their legitimation within the industrial order or an industrial-market compromise is described as highly problematic. Given these difficulties, we narrow the focus on the question of the legitimation of the valuation of financial assets. Their dual nature of both tradable and representative items makes us suggest a civic-market compromise, which would make finance more symmetrical by making valuation political. We then show such a perspective is obscured by the pervasive strength of the investor's point of view, but also that the mounting debates on public and private debt may provide opportunities for the development of such an investee's capitalism.

One potential explanation is that FPC sector may be more responsive to labor market changes than public competitors. Using panel datasets of Associate's degree students, we examine the effects of changes in labor market conditions across various employment fields on enrollment and degree completion in related majors. The results indicate that enrollment and degree completion in the FPC sector is positively related to employment growth and wages in related occupations, while public institutions remain largely unresponsive. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that these relationships are similar across groups of students by gender and ethnicity. Furthermore, the results also indicate that students in public institutions are non-responsive to changes in labor markets associated with requiring an Associate's or Bachelor's degree.

We use the recent China-X-Ray Equipment dispute as a case study to show that linkage between the two instruments may not be the consequence of a government-led policy but instead a result of firm-driven responses to an industrial policy. This in turn may lead to antidumping tit-for-tat behavior between WTO members.

They widened the range of colleges they sent scores to, and low-income ACT-takers attended more-selective colleges.

We apply a matching technique to cross-sectional microdata from the Spanish Health Survey for the years 2006 and 2011-2012 to estimate the average treatment effect of unemployment on self-assessed health (SAH) in the last year, mental problems in the last year and on the mental health risk in the short term. We also use a differences-in-differences estimation method between the two periods to check if the impact of unemployment on health depends on the economic context. Unemployment has a significant negative impact on both SAH and mental health. This impact is particularly high for the long-term unemployed. With respect to the impact on mental health, negative effects significantly worsen with the economic crisis. For the full model, the changes in effects of long-term unemployment on mental problems and mental health risk are, respectively, 0.35 (CI 0.19-0.50) and 0.20 (CI 0.07-0.34). Anxiety and stress about the future associated with unemployment could have a large impact on individuals' health. It may be necessary to prevent health deterioration in vulnerable groups such as the unemployed, and also to monitor specific health risks that arise in recessions, such as psychological problems.","[Urbanos-Garrido, Rosa M.] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Lopez-Valcarcel, Beatriz G.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ & Gest, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Lopez-Valcarcel, BG (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Metodos Cuantitat Econ & Gest, Campus Tafira, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, Spain.",bvalcarcel@dmc.ulpgc.es,"Valcarcel, Bea G/A-9891-2010; Urbanos-Garrido, Rosa M/K-2086-2017","Valcarcel, Bea G/0000-0002-5571-3257; Urbanos-Garrido, Rosa M/0000-0001-9339-4798",,,,,56,138,140,2,34,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Biomass measurements from eight plots in Kitulangalo Forest Reserve, Tanzania, were used to estimate a Verhulst growth model for miombo woodland. After incorporating the effect of fire, a non-linear programming model was used to determine economically optimal harvest of such woodland for charcoal production. Optimization was done with and without payment for reduced emissions from forest degradation under the assumption that the woodland was not reserved for environmental protection. It helped testing strategies for management of public land. At the current charcoal price and discount rates above 7.3%, immediate harvest of present stock was found optimal. At 10% interest rate, carbon sequestration payments and emission taxes of 15 USD MgCO(2)e(-1) were required so as to avoid woodland degradation. If emissions were not taxed, sequestration payments of more than 40 USD MgCO(2)e(-1) would not prevent harvest when biomass density is high (60-100 MgCO(2)e ha(-1)). The farm-gate price discussed here will be lower than the price found in international agreements due to transaction costs. Unless affluent societies are prepared to pay more than 10-20 USD MgCO(2)e(-1), degradation of miombo woodlands in Tanzania and other sub-Saharan countries is likely to continue in the absence of some alternate measures.

In 2014 in Latvia, the counter-sanctions affected most the following industries: dairy farming, the fruit and vegetable industry and the international road transport industry; later, the fish processing industry and other industries were also affected after the Russian rouble exchange rate fell and an economic crisis emerged in Russia. It is important to enterprises of the affected industries, banks and government institutions to predict the length of this crisis in order to design appropriate action strategies. The research aim is to forecast the length of the effects of the geopolitical crisis in Latvia. The present research is based on analyses of Russia's balance of payments, other indicators and the effects of the Western sanctions against Russia as well as on an assumption that after a certain period, Russia's economy faces serious problems, which may lead to political and economic situation change in Russia and, consequently, to the end of this crisis.

Two related issues of concern are also addressed: (1) does the SP data reflect hypothetical bias, and (2) is convergent validity reflected in separate estimates of consumer surplus generated using RP and SP data?","Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada",,"Androkovich, RA (通讯作者)，Thompson Rivers Univ, Dept Econ, 900 McGill Rd, Kamloops, BC V2C 0C8, Canada.",randrokovich@tru.ca,,,,,,,32,6,6,0,21,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

However, in the countries of the Congo Basin forests receive very little attention in national planning and policies. Climate change is not currently considered in decisions and long-term forest management plans in these countries. This paper demonstrates that: (1) Congo Basin forests are needed for adaptation because they can help to decrease human vulnerability to climate change; and (2) Congo Basin forest management practices need to be adapted to accommodate climate change because these forests are vulnerable to climate change. A framework for facilitating adaptation in forestry is discussed and a review of adaptive actions presented. The paper recommends the adoption of sustainable forest management approach that includes a climate change focus. Such management should not only avoid any adverse effects on the forest resources and conservation of biodiversity, but also provides opportunities for greater, more sustainable rural development and poverty alleviation through income generation and employment opportunities.

The algorithm can be applied to any dataset and it is exponential in the maximum number of intersecting 1/n-narrowed intervals. This number corresponds to the largest clique in the associated interval intersection graph. We analyze the size of the clique for some natural probabilistic data generating processes, showing that the size of the clique grows moderately.

The issue of the creation of a multilateral register of Geographical Indications (GIs) for wines and spirits is one such area. Despite several years of wrangling, arriving at a landing zone on this issue still appears to be a far-fetched dream, if the mood expressed by the WTO Members in the December 2014 informal meeting on the multilateral register is anything to go by! Written against this backdrop, the present article has two objectives. First, it makes an attempt to trace the historical, legal as well as economic reasons underlying the protracted debates on GIs under the WTO and beyond - which have widely been referred to as one between the 'Old World' (e.g., the EU, Switzerland) and the 'New World' (e.g., the US, Australia, Canada; Argentina, Chile, etc.).

However researchers [1, 2] have reported that decision-makers' choices frequently violate the stochastic dominance. In such situations the prospect theory better describes choices. The paper exploits the proposal of Rieger and Wang [10] which extends the application of prospect theory to the decision alternatives with continuous distributions. In our paper we show the application of this approach based on real market data. Piasecki and Tomasik [9] stated that logarithmic rates of return of majority of stocks have normal-inverse Gaussian (NIG) distribution.

They are sufficient when the best alternative from a given set of alternatives is to be chosen. However, in the decision making about acceptance or rejection of alternatives entering one by one into a system (e.g. decision making about granting a credit in banking), an evaluation of absolute type with respect to the given goal is needed. The evaluations of absolute type presented in this paper are measurements on an absolute scale where one limit point expresses total fulfillment of the given goal while the second limit point means the total lack of its fulfillment. Such evaluations of absolute type are used in the Partial Goals Method which is implemented in its fuzzified version in the FuzzME software (Fuzzy Methods of Multiple Criteria Evaluation). In this paper, the evaluation process applied in the Partial Goals Method will be studied from the point of view of the measure theory.","[Jandova, Vera; Talasova, Jana] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic",Palacky University Olomouc,"Jandová, V (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Math Anal & Applicat Math, 17 Listopadu 1192-12, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",vera.jandova@upol.cz; jana.talasova@upol.cz,"Talašová, Jana/N-9789-2017","Talašová, Jana/0000-0002-1903-170X",,,,,5,1,1,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,321,326,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900055,0

The. evaluation method used is the Balanced Scorecard, which was designed in 1993 by the authors Kaplan and Norton as a system of balanced perspectives (based on finances, customers, internal processes and growth). Currently, however, the original Balanced Scorecard method exhibits certain deficiencies in its approach to measuring business performance and achieving a competitive advantage, especially in terms of an overly simplistic unidirectional causality in the strategic map, the same weight assigned to individual scales or the failure to distinguish cause and effect in time. Content included in the case study is a comparison of a classical and dynamic model of a Balanced Scorecard in the Czech business environment, particularly in companies providing banking services. A properly drawn up scorecard should contain a set of standards of outputs and driving forces for the company's performance. The methods given by the authors indicate that a company should follow the general standards that reflect a common goal of all strategies across sectors and companies. These are output standards, or delayed indicators, which include profitability, market share, and customer satisfaction. In contrast, lead indicators should also be defined in the company, the driving forces of performance, most of which are unique to a particular company. These strategic standards then define a strategy for achieving a competitive advantage. Recently, many authors emphasise the need for change in the approach to performance measurement. Although the Balanced Scorecard is very effective tool in this area, the question remains whether this method in today's dynamic environment is still sufficient.","[Kozena, Marcela] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kozená, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,1,9,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,177,184,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200023,0

Over the last twenty years, WTO has accepted thirty-four new members ranging from some of world's largest economies to some of the least developed. Of them, China's accession has been internationally recognized as one of the most historic events. 'This is an historic moment for the WTO, for China and for international economic cooperation', said the WTO's Director-General, Mike Moore, commenting on the approval of China's accession on 10 November 2001. China's membership of the WTO has been a resounding success for both the WTO and China. The WTO has not only made a major contribution to the strength and stability of the global economy by helping to boost trade growth, resolve numerous trade disputes and support developing countries to integrate into the trading system, but also played a pivotal role in strengthening multilateralism, establishing an inclusive world economic order and promoting an open, rules-based and non-discriminatory multilateral trading system. Since admission to the WTO, China not only became the largest trading nation of goods in 2013, but also has set a new blueprint for the rule of law in the world's second largest economy in 2014. No doubt, the rule of law in trade encouraged by the WTO has promoted and will further push the rule of law in China. The WTO promotes the rule of law in trade in China in at least the following five dimensions: the optimization of China's trade institutions, the legalization of China's trading system, the strengthening of China's trade law enforcement capacity, the promotion of judicial review on China's trade-related governmental decisions and the perfection of the rule of law in China's trade.","[Liao Li] Wuhan Univ, Sch Law, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Yu Minyou] Wuhan Univ, Collaborat Innovat Ctr Territorial Sovereignty &, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Wuhan University,"Liao, L (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Law, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",liaoli@whu.edu.cn; fxyymy@whu.edu.cn,"wang, yu/IUQ-6654-2023",,Korean Foundation for Advanced Studies,Korean Foundation for Advanced Studies,"Liao Li, PhD., Law School, Wuhan University, China.

But can voluntary standards deliver gender equity? This contribution responds to this question by exploring how standards and gendered division of labor interact in certified-tea value chains (for example, Ethical Tea Partnership, Fairtrade, Organic, and Rainforest Alliance) in Tanzania. The results of this mixed-method study (2008-10, 2013) contribute to the literature on gender equity and standards by building on the gendered value-chain approach to analyze these complex and contextual interactions. The study proposes that there is a need to focus on the interactions between men and women with different skills and training that contribute to how equitably their roles are distributed in the certified-tea value chains.","[Loconto, Allison] Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA SenS, Inst Francilien Rech Innovat Soc, 5 Blvd Descartes, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France",INRAE; Universite Gustave-Eiffel,"Loconto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Est Marne la Vallee, Inst Natl Rech Agron INRA SenS, Inst Francilien Rech Innovat Soc, 5 Blvd Descartes, F-77420 Champs Sur Marne, France.",amloconto@versailles.inra.fr,"Loconto, Allison M/L-5526-2017; Loconto, Allison Marie/AAW-4787-2020","Loconto, Allison Marie/0000-0001-8949-186X",National Science Foundation [SES-0924202]; Institute of International Education Fulbright Fellowship - US Department of State,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute of International Education Fulbright Fellowship - US Department of State,"All personal information that would allow the identification of any person or person(s) described in the contribution has been removed.

This optimism follows from the fact that the largest construction companies, which are relatively well-off even during the recession, were qualified for the study. The construction boom has already established itself in Poland and in the world from two years, which currently results in the increase of the property prices, and the spectre of decrease in the property prices is fading into oblivion. However, it has to be borne in mind what was learnt at the turn of 2007 and 2008, where the property prices rapidly decreased, and interest rates of credit soared upwards, which resulted in collapse of the property market and large bankruptcies. The construction boom examined and calculated by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) is not as optimistic as the ratios for the construction provided by large construction companies. The construction companies of all sizes take part in the CSO study, and the medium, small and micro companies assess the situation unfavourably. According to CSO, the construction boom was 11 minus in October 2014, and it was lower than that recorded in September, by 4 points. The construction companies quoted on the Warsaw Stock Exchange on the WIGBUDOWNICTWO index were subjected to the study. During the study it was demonstrated how the construction companies deal on the property market and what financial results they achieve. They were subjected to a thorough economic analysis, and their value over the years was determined. At the same time, it was examined whether companies of the construction sector have the fair value or if they covered the losses from the time of the first global economic crisis and the collapse occurred at the time on the property market, in which pieces of properties can be bought even 50% cheaper.","[Parvi, Rafal] Sch Banking Wroclaw, St Fabryczna 29-31, PL-53609 Wroclaw, Poland",,"Parvi, R (通讯作者)，Sch Banking Wroclaw, St Fabryczna 29-31, PL-53609 Wroclaw, Poland.",rafalp4@o2.pl,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,401,409,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000036,0

The Czech economy data show positive but asymmetric behaviour between housing prices and consumption. It can be explained by following mechanism. When the prices of houses fall, the housing wealth decreases, which decreases consumption substantially as constraint on borrowing is binding. On the other hand, rise in house prices increases housing wealth, the constraint becomes slack and consumption increases only slightly. Such mechanism is incorporated into DSGE model that is estimated on data of the Czech economy using Bayesian techniques. The results from model simulation show that the occasionally binding constraint is able to replicate asymmetric behaviour of house prices and consumption found in the data.","[Reichel, Vlastimil; Hlousek, Miroslav] Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Reichel, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",reichel.v@mail.muni.cz; hlousek@econ.muni.cz,"Reichel, Vlastimil/AAB-5334-2021; Hlousek, Miroslav/G-8508-2013","Reichel, Vlastimil/0000-0001-7280-4508;",,,,,5,1,1,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,707,712,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900121,0

Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty-three frail older people living at home were randomly assigned to either an intervention (n = 80) or a control group (n = 73). The 1-year intervention was carried out by nurses and physiotherapists working as case managers, who undertook home visits at least once a month. Differences in costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the health-related quality-of-life instruments EQ-5D and EQ-VAS, and also the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were investigated. All analyses used the intention-to-treat principle. Results: There were no significant differences between the intervention group and control group for total cost, EQ-5D-based QALY or EQ-VAS-based QALY for the 1-year study. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not conducted because no significant differences were found for either EQ-5D- or EQ-VAS-based QALY, or costs. However, the intervention group had significantly lower levels of informal care and help with instrumental activities of daily living both as costs ((sic)3,927 vs. (sic)6,550, p = 0.037) and provided hours (200 vs. 333 hours per year, p = 0.037). Conclusions: The intervention was cost neutral and does not seem to have affected health-related quality of life for the 1-year study, which may be because the follow-up period was too short. The intervention seems to have reduced hours and cost of informal care and help required with instrumental activities of daily living. This suggests that the intervention provides relief to informal caregivers.","[Sandberg, Magnus; Kristensson, Jimmie] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, POB 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Jakobsson, Ulf; Midl, Patrik, V] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Ctr Primary Hlth Care Res, SE-20502 Malmo, Sweden; [Jakobsson, Ulf; Midl, Patrik, V] Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Clin Sci Malmo, SE-20502 Malmo, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University,"Sandberg, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Sci, POB 157, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.",Magnus.Sandberg@med.lu.se,"Midlov, Patrik/L-8201-2015; Sandberg, Magnus/E-7608-2014","Midlov, Patrik/0000-0002-5871-8731; Sandberg, Magnus/0000-0002-8915-8730",Faculty of Medicine at Lund University; Vardalinstitutet; Region Skane; Johan and Greta Koch's Foundation; Swedish Association of Health Professionals (Vardforbundet); Swedish Society of Nursing; SodraSverigesSjukskoterskehem (SSSH),Faculty of Medicine at Lund University; Vardalinstitutet; Region Skane; Johan and Greta Koch's Foundation; Swedish Association of Health Professionals (Vardforbundet); Swedish Society of Nursing; SodraSverigesSjukskoterskehem (SSSH),"This project was carried out in a collaboration between the Faculty of Medicine at Lund University, the Swedish Institute for Health Sciences (Vardalinstitutet), Skane University Hospital (SUS) in Lund and the primary care and municipality of Eslov.

Economic empowerment of women through entrepreneurship and small business offers a huge space for the introduction real changes in their lives. Entrepreneurship and small business located in the center of events as change agents in the world, regardless of whether it is more or less developed countries. Why? Because it is an important source of job creation and open career opportunities for both men and women. It is an indisputable fact, however, that one is going, extensive presence of asymmetry in the approach to entrepreneurship and small business, which, among other things, also reflected in the trends in the labor market. Men and women were and still are affected by the loss or reduced employment security, or job loss, and women take an increasing share of responsibility cost of living adjustment for the family. But man traditionally remains breadwinner of the family as conditional access to employment, and this fact leads to high levels of participation of women on the list of the unemployed. For all that, as a result, self-employment has become for many women this is their only chance for paid work. At the same time, however, women are confronted with fewer opportunities to start their own business due to specific gender barriers in access to information, support networks and collateral. Determining sexually sensitive policies in supporting the development of small and medium business is therefore an important priority of economic policy in countries in transition. The primary goal is that through a descriptive study (first in Bosnia and Herzegovina) to determine whether and to what extent business problems are present in a woman's small entrepreneurship in Bosnia and Herzegovina in post-conflict and transitional reality. In a broader context, the results should show whether and to what extent business problems are related to insufficient economic education, and to indicate the level of readiness of women entrepreneur in small business to further education, and the purpose of acquiring the knowledge necessary for solving business problems. Work will in this regard try to show what the current economic opportunities for additional education for women entrepreneur in Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the realization of the research there will be used all the basic methods of logical and scientific knowledge. Research on this topic was based on primary data collection methods, testing techniques through surveys. To this end, we have interviewed 125 women entrepreneur in small business in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The work will include theoretical analysis of the concept of women's entrepreneurship in general, based on the available literature, scientific articles, professional journals, and other available and relevant information. In connection with the interpretation of the data obtained, the paper will in this regard provide recommendations for measures to ensure the initial conditions (empowerment through all forms of education and training) that would result in a larger (self) employment of women and their increased participation in economic activities.","[Sestic, Munira; Ibrahimagic, Sabina] Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Sarajevo,"Sestic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sarajevo, Sch Econ & Business Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",munira.sestic@efsa.unsa.ba; sabina.ibrahimagic@efsa.unsa.ba,"Šestić, Munira/GLS-7814-2022","Šestić, Munira/0000-0002-4389-0758",,,,,18,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,491,512,,,,,,22,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000046,0

Thus, in the majority of cases of relevant regression analysis normality of error terms is expected. However, this is not true in many practical situations. While OLS estimator is known to be very sensitive to outliers, the robust regression estimator (e.g. Least Trimmed Squares, LTS) is known not to be unduly affected by the presence of outliers. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the trade-off between power and robustness of selected classical and robust normality tests of error terms in regression models.

Initially, the program appeared to be a success, bringing order to the previous years' derbies. Ex-vessel prices rose, harvest stabilized, and there was an orderly shrinking of the fleet to an economically appropriate size. The subsequent history of the fishery is more complex. ITQ sales dwindled in 1995, then ceased for 13 years. Harvest plummeted to barely a tenth of the eligible quota, and in 2010 the fleet's quota was reduced 88%. Was the wreckfish ITQ program a failure? We provide the first published analysis of the program in two decades. We examine the decisions of former participants to leave the fishery.

Land use science appears to be a designated field for TDR. However, to date, the additional expenses of TDR are accompanied by a so far not proved added value, and empirical findings are claimed to be scarce and dispersed over several disciplines and case studies. We reviewed 299 articles obtained from a structured literature search to (1) investigate the current differences between theory and practice, (2) identify empirical findings, and (3) ascertain the contributions of TDR to promoting sustainable land use management. Our results demonstrate that, in spite of an increasing conceptual consistency in the theoretical discussion of TDR, the implementation of TDR remains a substantial challenge, in part because of the gap between theory and practice. In addition, research on TDR is science and process centred. The benefits of TOR in addressing real-world problems within the field of land use remain unproven. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The usual quantifications via previous cost-of-illness approaches mostly have several weaknesses, e.g., applying indirect methods by using population-attributable fractions to identify parts of costs that can be accrued to obesity, second using highly aggregated data and third often only displaying part of the costs. This article presents a new approach and a new estimation of the cost and consequences of obesity in Germany using claims data from a German health insurance company. A sample of 146,000 individuals was analyzed with both a prevalence and a life-cycle focus on the cost and consequences of obesity. With additional data sets, we calculate the deaths per year due to obesity, the excess costs per year and several intangible consequences usually referred to as pain and suffering. Our results show that the cost estimations of obesity in Germany so far have been largely underestimated. The annual direct costs of obesity in Germany amount to approximately (sic)29.39 billion and the indirect costs to an additional (sic)33.65 billion. A total of 102,000 subjects die prematurely each year because of obesity, and there is a significant excess of unemployment, long-term nursing care, and pain and suffering due to obesity. From a lifetime perspective, every obese man is equal to an additional burden of (sic)166,911 and each woman of (sic)206,526 for the social security system in Germany. Obesity due to unhealthy eating is thus about to replace tobacco consumption in terms of costs and consequences as the main hazardous lifestyle factor and thus should be more intensively focussed by public health policy.","[Effertz, Tobias] Univ Hamburg, Inst Recht Wirtschaft, Max Brauer Allee 60, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany; [Engel, Susanne; Verheyen, Frank; Linder, Roland] TK Nutzen & Effizienz Gesundheitswesen, WINEG Wissenschaft Inst, Bramfelder Str 140, D-22305 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Effertz, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Recht Wirtschaft, Max Brauer Allee 60, D-22765 Hamburg, Germany.",effertz@uni-hamburg.de,"Effertz, Tobias/AAE-8102-2022",,,,,,48,49,50,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

J,"Deegen, P",,,,"Deegen, Peter",,,Private and public timber production: How markets and political institutions matter,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Institutions; Public choice; Public forest enterprise; Exit costs; Liability; Faustmann model,EXIT,"The aim behind this paper was to find a logical explanation for the simultaneous existence of public and private timber enterprises based on an individual, subjective benefit-cost weighting made in the context of different institutional arrangements. In the section on modeling, the effects of the separation of forest ownership and forest management, and of private and public ownership sharing are studied. The main difference between public and private timber enterprises relates to the exit clause. Whereas public timber production is characterized by a strong exit clause, in the case of private timber enterprises the individual stockholder can exit almost without constraint The strong exit clause in public enterprises increases the liability as technique for hedging the risks of timber production. This becomes more pronounced the greater the degree to which the public fiscal derision is separated into a production and a liability derision. The reason for this is that where there is a higher degree of public decision making an unconstrained majority rule applies, which also leads to a transfer of liability to a minority. Another factor is that the limited time perspective involved in public choices does not outperform the advantage of lower interest rates associated with public timber production. The strong exit clause in public timber enterprises also provides an opportunity for the forest manager to increase the forest rotation length. The paper concludes with some remarks on how the results obtained from the simple public choice model employed in the study are applicable to a representative democracy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

There is a well-established tradition associated with centralized giga-scale nuclear systems and continental super grids, which may be contrasted with future trajectories based on decentralized conventional renewables such as hydro, wind and solar power. The traditional centralized view emphasizes a seemingly ineluctable direction of evolution based on claimed fossil fuel decarbonization which leads, via nuclear power, to the hydrogen economy. But China and to some extent India are emerging as the principal practitioners of an alternative vision of energy growth, underpinning their vast industrialization efforts, based on conventional renewables that are the products of manufacturing, and whose industrial dynamics are driven by cost reduction achieved by learning curves. In this paper, a critique is offered of the traditional view of a centralized energy future, and a restatement of the real drivers of alternative energy pathways actually being pursued by countries like China and India is offered.

This paper contributes to the discussion by examining how farmer led Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) movement in Hungary creates an alternative in the dominant food regime. To examine CSAs future potentials, semi-structured interviews with producers, consumers-members, and experts, a consumer-member survey, and secondary data sources were utilized. We analyse ambiguities or uncertainties of production, logistics, economic viability, and community formation to sort out social and material practices that co-produce goods and values centred on sustainability.

Food-a basic human need- has engaged over time in an intrinsic relationship with the design discipline. Design and Food interact at several levels: material (product), immaterial (service) but also prospective (thought). Designers, along with other actors, shape the production, communication, packaging and distribution of food as well as the more ephemeral aspects of food consumption focused on the valorization of people's senses and experiences. Bearing in mind that each possible design intervention strongly impacts on environmental and social behaviors, the challenge here is to address the challenge of insuring durable innovation within complex social and technological dynamics. Through the lens of an Advanced Design practice, this paper raises the importance of reconsidering the definition of trends in order to build sustainable futures for food and thus for people. Trends are seeds of tomorrow scattered in the overwhelming detail of the present.(2) Modern societal trends(3) are drivers for adequate growth and continuous innovation. With a phenomenological approach this paper wants to show how the attention to trend can change food ways.

Dealing with the virtual nature of e-commerce to create a borderless global economy requires the involvement of the World Trade Organization (WTO) as the only international organization regulating global trade between nations. However, the WTO has struggled in its efforts to address the various uncertainties of classification applied to e-commerce products (hereinafter 'Classification') under its existing Agreements (e.g. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and General Agreement on Trade in Services (CATS)). This article investigates how a comprehensive approach is needed to address foundational Classification challenges. Using the key tools of the grounded theory method, this article analyses all the WTO Members' discussions (1998-2014) related to the Classification issue. It does so as a basis for critiquing the WTO's approach to addressing this challenge. It argues e-commerce products are both or neither goods or services. Extending the territorial and geographical notions created for traditional trade to the virtual nature of digital world is simply inadequate and fails to appropriately draw a certain line between traditional trade and existing as well as emerging e-commerce products. On this basis this article provides an outline of the distinct and more integrated approach needed.","[Richards, Cameron] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Educ, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University,,farokhnia@ymail.com; cameronkrichards@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,9,9,0,21,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We present new evidence on the effects of merit aid scholarship programs - programs that offer partial or full tuition subsidies to high achieving in-state students. Using Census data on 24 to 32 year olds in the U.S. from 1990 to 2010, we show that eligibility for merit aid programs slightly increases the propensity of state natives to live in-state, while also extending in-state enrollment into the late twenties. However, the share of a cohort both living in-state and having a BA is unchanged, with a possible decline in overall BA attainment. These patterns notwithstanding, the magnitude of merit aid effects is of an order of magnitude smaller than size of the treated population, suggesting that nearly all of the spending on these programs transfers resources to individuals whose ultimate migration decisions remain unchanged.

In many ways foreshadowing the US presidential election of Donald Trump, Brexit brought to the surface and gave a public voice to socio-economic divisions that were deeply embedded, sometimes illogical, but until now had either been ignored or hushed out of 'respectable' public debate. This Discussion Forum emanates from a spontaneous seminar organized 2 days after the Brexit vote on June 25, 2016 as part of the SASE conference held in University of California-Berkeley and followed by an open call for papers by Socio-Economic Review. The papers here draw attention to the origins of the Brexit vote in deep-seated socio-economic divisions (O'Reilly), widening differences in economic performance across sectors and regions of the UK (Froud, Sukhdev and Williams) and the growth of poor quality jobs (Warhurst). Meanwhile, the political dynamics of the Brexit vote were also shaped by the fractured nature of UK business elites (Morgan), divisions between locals and cosmopolitans (Grey) and creative but muddled actions of elites that arguably generated consequences they themselves failed to fully anticipate (Wood and Wright). From the perspective of Europe, Brexit reflects a history of dysfunctional economic policy in Europe that prioritized market competition in ways that neglected and ultimately undermined solidarity (Boyer). Here, Brexit reflects a political strategy to both renationalize and recommodify solidarity in the face of fears over migration, and which are likely to have major consequences for social solidarity in Europe more generally (Frerichs and Sankari). However, Brexit is unlikely to provide a durable social and political solution to the wider tensions between globalization and democracy, which also affect all countries throughout Europe (Rona-Tas). Ultimately, the Brexit vote underlines social divisions that combine class inequalities with regional ones, not just in Britain but throughout Europe (Le Gales).","[O'Reilly, Jacqueline] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"O'Reilly, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England.",j.o'reilly@brighton.ac.uk,"O'Reilly, Jacqueline/Q-2384-2019; O'Reilly, Jacqueline/HCI-8567-2022; Wood, Geoffrey/ABA-5274-2020; Frerichs, Sabine/V-3891-2018","O'Reilly, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6223-154X; O'Reilly, Jacqueline/0000-0001-6223-154X; Wood, Geoffrey/0000-0001-9709-1823;",,,,,21,36,39,2,118,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We used the Delphi method to assess possible outcomes of three scenarios based on the strength of mitigation policy. The scenarios scrutinised were (1) Baseline, (2) Tight Control and (3) Energy Plus Food. These scenarios create different adaptive needs and measures on farms. Baseline scenario follows the present and forthcoming development in agriculture and Tight Control scenario, in turn, constitutes all possible mitigation measures recently introduced in the scientific discussion. In Energy Plus Food scenario, farms increasingly produce renewable energy in addition to food and, therefore, have new opportunities to develop their businesses. The Delphi panel estimated how the farms would cope with different future developments represented by the scenarios. Based on our results, it is evident that interdisciplinary analysis in research and inter-sectoral cooperation between agricultural and energy policies are required.

Although real estate developers, the intermediary between capital and the local built environment, faced a similar rise of more market-oriented banking, Dutch developers financialized their activities while their Belgian counterparts did not. The Dutch case demonstrates how financialized corporations can make accumulation cycles more extreme, particularly by placing the creation of fictitious capital at the centre of their business strategies. The Belgian case illustrates how patient capital, i.e. multi-generational wealth looking for sustainable growth, can function as a strong barrier to financialization processes, thus moderating the influence of financialized capitalism on the economy.","[van Loon, Jannes] Univ Leuven KUL, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200E Bus 2409, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium",,"van Loon, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven KUL, Div Geog & Tourism, Celestijnenlaan 200E Bus 2409, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",jannes.vanloon@kuleuven.be,,,European Research Council [313376],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),This work was supported by the European Research Council [313376].,,56,16,17,1,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

There has been a lack of academic attention to understanding this duality of forest density preferences for homebuyers in at-risk Wildland Urban Interfaces (WUIs). To fill this gap, we investigated the influence of forest density on WUI house sales in four high fire-risk zones in dry, mixed conifer forests of the Western U.S with a spatial hedonic pricing model. Explanatory attributes related to house structure, neighborhood, and environmental amenities were assessed, along with a set of WUI variables that included forest density ranges at two buffer levels a 100 in radius level and a 500 m radius level. Results indicate a strong preference for lower forest density at the 100 m level, but a countering preference for higher forest density at the larger 500 m buffer. These findings suggest the need to reconsider broad approaches in public awareness campaigns and regional planning, as well as fire management policies and strategies. Preference for higher density forests implies that if left to homeowners, fuel treatments in public spaces will be underinvested. (C) 2016 The Authors.

These papers have extended the literature using drastically different input and output combinations from one another, with little theoretical or empirical support backing these specifications. Issues arise that many of these inputs and outputs are available for a subset of OECD countries each year. Using a common estimator and the different specifications proposed leads to the result that efficiency rankings across papers can diverge quite significantly, with several countries being highly efficient in one specification and highly inefficient in another. Broad input-output measures that are collected annually provide consistent efficiency rankings across specifications, compared to specifications that utilize specific measures collected infrequently. This paper also finds that broad output measures that are not quality-adjusted, such as life expectancy, seem to be a suitable alternative for infrequently collected quality-adjusted output measures, such as disability adjusted life years.","[Gearhart, Richard] Calif State Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA",California State University System; California State University Bakersfield,"Gearhart, R (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Publ Adm, 20 BDC,9001 Stockdale Highway, Bakersfield, CA 93311 USA.",rgearhart1@csub.edu,,,,,,,28,6,6,0,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Fifty-seven potentially relevant studies were identified which collectively report 321 CRC-related HSUVs. HSUVs (even for similar health states) vary markedly and this adds to the uncertainty regarding estimates of cost-effectiveness. There are relatively few methodologically robust HSUVs that can be directly used in economic evaluations concerned with CRC.

It shows that the gendered choices they make remain largely intact after conditioning on prior test scores, indicating that these choices are not driven by differences in perceived mathematical ability, or by boys' comparative advantage in mathematics. Moreover, girls who choose matriculation electives in physics and computer science score higher than boys, on average.

Conditions under which these two policy schemes lead to similar market outcomes are identified: We show that perfect capital markets and rational expectations over carbon prices are required for the equivalency of the two policy schemes. However, the basic principles with which the two policies would need to be implemented suggest that the carbon rent policy could be more easily put into practice. Furthermore, we suggest a way how to integrate the forest carbon policies into an emission trading scheme. We show that a fully compensatory carbon rent policy in the EU would require 10-50% of the emission trading revenues depending of the interest rate and expected carbon price inflation. If implemented at the global level, the policy would need even significantly higher shares of hypothesized global emission permit revenues. The policies can utilize baseline trajectories of forest carbon that reduce the costs at desired level, but distort forest owners' valuation of the carbon flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use propensity score matching of households based on recall based data from before implementation of PFM from 286 households and comparison of current incomes (2012), as well as review of records and interviews. Results reveal that members have higher total and forest-related incomes than non-members and indicate that impacts derive from labour and market opportunities supported by donor institutions, more than from differential access to forest products. In terms of governance the Kenya Forest Service largely remains in control of decision-making. Thus, PFM resembles Integrated Conservation and Development Project (ICDP) approaches. We conclude that current forest governance approaches in Kenya appear not to support participation in practice. Further, we conclude that impact evaluations must examine both outcomes and participatory forestry to provide meaningful policy evidence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We performed a word frequency analysis to measure the relative importance of the political system, the economy, science, art, religion, law, sport, health, education, and the mass media to three pertinent journals in the field of futures studies and foresight. The results show that Futures, Long Range Planning, and Technological Forecasting and Social Change have different and changing preferences for the above function systems, an information which authors may find helpful in supporting decisions on where to submit. Our results also show that all journals feature a highly significant bias to the triple helix systems - the political system, the economy, and science. While the latter bias may be adequate to scientific journals, the dominant focus on the political system and the economy as well as the corresponding neglect of the other systems points at implicit presumptions about the importance of the individual systems that may not be in line with their importance to the larger society.

Using the French Offre d'emploi et recrutement (OFER) survey on the hiring practices of 3584 firms in 2005, we investigate how firms organize the selection of job applicants and analyse the outcome of this selection with regard to the profiles of successful applicants. The data analysis reveals four types of screening processes: an informal process (streamlined) and three formalized processes (written-based, testing and professionalized). The use of a type of screening process depends on the constraints and resources of the firm and on the expected type of match. Finally, logit regressions show that personal and professional networks tend to penalize women and formal testing screening processes seem to favour unemployed or inactive people, whereas the formalized screening processes are likely to penalize individuals without diplomas.","[de Larquier, Guillemette] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, CNRS, EconomiX, Nanterre, France; [de Larquier, Guillemette] Ctr Etud Emploi, Noisy Le Grand, France; [Marchal, Emmanuelle] SciencesPo, CNRS, Ctr Sociol Org, Paris, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Nanterre; Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"de Larquier, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre Def, CNRS, EconomiX, Nanterre, France.;de Larquier, G (通讯作者)，Ctr Etud Emploi, Noisy Le Grand, France.",larquier@u-paris10.fr,,,,,,,44,6,6,1,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The role of workplace characteristics in nurses' labor supply,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Nurses labor supply; Worker heterogeneity; Compensating wage differentials; Primary data,REGISTERED NURSES; MARKET; POLICY; WAGES,"Empirically rigorous studies of nursing labor supply have to date relied on extant secondary data and focused almost exclusively on the role of pay. Yet the conditions under which nurses work and the timing and convenience of the hours they work are also important determinants of labor supply. Where there are national pay structures and pay structures are relatively inflexible, as in nursing in European countries, these factors become more important. One of the principal ways in which employers can improve the relative attractiveness of nursing jobs is by changing these other conditions of employment. This study uses new primary data to estimate an extended model of nursing labor supply. It is the first to explore whether and how measures of non-pecuniary workplace characteristics and observed individual (worker) heterogeneity over non-pecuniary job aspects impact estimates of the elasticity of hours with respect to wages. Our results have implications for the future sustainability of an adequately sized nurse workforce and patient care especially at a time when European healthcare systems are confronted with severe financial pressures that have resulted in squeezes in levels of healthcare funding.","[Eberth, Barbara] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Elliott, Robert F.; Skatun, Diane] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",Newcastle University - UK; University of Aberdeen,"Eberth, B (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.",barbara.eberth@newcastle.ac.uk,,,ESRC [RES-000-23-1240]; Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-1240] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorates(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),We are grateful for the thoughtful comments of two referees.

The volatility of this economy since the 1980s had suggested the likelihood of a sharp loss of jobs, maybe followed by a strong bounce-back, if the finance sector could overcome reputational damage from its role in the debacle of 2007-2008. In fact this area proved both the most resilient in the downturn and the most dynamic in the upturn, accounting for all or most net job gains in the UK. This article considers three types of explanation for this positive outcome, in terms of: fundamental economic strengths allowing it to keep going through generally tough times; an advantaged position in relation to elite choices about resource allocation and restructuring in the face of a general fiscal/commercial squeeze; and (less conventionally) the impact of massive support to/through the banking sector, in first mitigating impacts of the downturn for the financial centre, and then fuelling another global city boom. The last of these is argued to be key to understanding not only why central London has done so well since the crisis, but how it is still liable to be 'the capital of boom and bust'.","[Gordon, Ian R.] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gordon, IR (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",i.r.gordon@lse.ac.uk,"Gordon, Ian R/B-8892-2008","Gordon, Ian Richard/0000-0002-2170-8193",,,,,44,9,10,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

It is believed that mass media is a powerful channel in political communication of different political actors in communicating their perception on certain issues. Forest discourses are not limited to the scientific and political sphere but also a popular topic for mass media in Bangladesh. In this study, media discourses from 1989 to 2009 from the The Daily Ittefaq of Bangladesh are analyzed. A quantitative-qualitative content analysis of newspaper articles on forest topics was the chosen methodology. The forest discourses in the Bangladeshi print media from 1989 to 2009 was built around the crisis argumentation i.e. the forest of Bangladesh is in a crisis. Deforestation and wildlife conservation dominated the Bangladesh forest media discourse where genuine events like illegal logging, forest destruction, wildlife poaching and wildlife human conflicts were most prominent issues discussed in the mass media of Bangladesh. journalists were the prominent speaker in the print media and primarily shaped the discussion around the problems of the Bangladeshi forest sector. This study finds that the presence of center political actors like politicians and administration do not have much media standing in forest discourse. Therefore they have limited influence or interest in the formulation of forest discourse in the Bangladeshi print media. On the contrary the peripheral actors enjoyed dominant standing in the Bangladeshi print media discourse and thus influence the forest discourses in the print media. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In theory, school value added can reflect not only principals' effectiveness but also other school-specific influences on student achievement growth that are outside of principals' control. In this paper, we isolate principals' effects on student achievement growth and examine the extent to which school value added captures the effects that principals persistently demonstrate.

Emerging wood-based energy markets would increase prices of small-diameter timber products, thereby encouraging forest landowners to possibly opt for shorter rotation ages. We developed a comprehensive forest carbon model to track four carbon pools (carbon related to silvicultural activities, carbon sequestered on forestlands, carbon sequestered in wood products and wood present in landfills, and avoided carbon emissions) at the stand level to determine efficacy of carbon and bioenergy markets in mitigating carbon emissions with and without any change in rotation ages. Slash pine (Pinus elliottii)- a common species planted across the Coastal Plain of Georgia and Florida was taken as a representative species. We find that an increase in rotation age does not necessarily transform into additional carbon savings relative to some base rotation ages over a planning horizon of 100 years. Similarly, a decrease in the rotation age is not necessarily beneficial from carbon perspective either with respect to some base rotation ages. The utilization of all timber products for manufacturing of wood pellets to generate electricity in the United Kingdom maximizes carbon savings without any change in the rotation age. Suitable safeguards need to be incorporated in existing forest and bioenergy certification schemes to ensure efficacy of reforested lands in mitigating carbon emissions.

Interlinkages among community characteristics affecting the implementation of governance arrangements, forest policy instruments or traditional social norms are untangled; this enlightens policy-makers and practitioners about the variables requiring attention beyond traditional technical factors or individual incentives. Through the review of social capital (SC) and forest governance literature, we find network structure and institutions as their common core aspects. Theoretical relationships and feedbacks are first identified, and then checked in published forestry case studies. We propose hence a dynamic, nested model comprehensively illustrating the co-evolution of SC and forest governance elements along a policy process. The model uncovers the interrelation between different factors underlying natural resources' and rural development challenges based on cooperative behaviour. This model identifies cognitive dimensions of SC as triggers of local-level governance reforms. Network structure shapes information flows, power relationships, trust among actors and innovation spread. Trust and social sanctioning impinge on the enforcement of (in)formal norms and rules. The model applies in forest policies entailing cooperation among open-access resource users, landowners' coordination for adjacency externalities, upscaling management, or value chain reorganisation.

We describe the barriers that students face during the transition to college and review the evidence on potential policy solutions. We focus primarily on research that examines causal relationships using experimental or quasi-experimental methods, though we draw upon descriptive evidence to provide context. Our review is distinctive in three respects. First, in addition to the literature on financial aid, we examine the evidence on informational and behavioral interventions, academic programs, and affirmative action policies intended to improve college access. Second, we incorporate a wealth of recent research not included in prior reviews. Finally, we conceptualize college access broadly, as including not just whether but also where students attend and whether they have access to college level courses. We conclude with a discussion of implications for policy and research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the context of a multi-country study of rare diseases (BURQOL-RD project), a cross-sectional survey was performed among MPS patients in seven European countries. Data on demographic characteristics, health resource utilization, informal care, and loss of labor productivity were collected. The EQ-5D, Barthel index (BI), and Zarit burden interview (ZBI) questionnaires were used to assess patients' and their informal caregivers' quality of life, patients' functional ability, and caregivers' burden, respectively. Altogether, 120 patients (children 62 %, females 40 %) and 66 caregivers completed the questionnaire. Patients' mean age was 16.5 years and median age at diagnosis was 3 years. Adult patients' average EQ-5D and EQ VAS scores varied across countries from 0.13 to 0.43 and 30.0 to 62.2, respectively, mean BI was 46.7, and ZBI was 32.7. Mean informal care time was 51.3 h/week.

Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. Direct costs accounted for most of the costs in all five countries (80, 100, 99, 98, and 93 %, respectively). MPS patients experience substantial loss of HRQOL and their families take a remarkable part in their care. Although utilization of health and social care resources varies significantly across countries, MPS incurs considerable societal costs in all the countries studied.","[Pentek, Marta; Gulacsi, Laszlo; Brodszky, Valentin; Baji, Petra] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Boncz, Imre] Univ Pecs, Inst Hlth Insurance, Pecs, Hungary; [Pogany, Gabor] Hungarian Federat People Rare & Congenital Dis RI, Budapest, Hungary; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Talavera Reina, Toledo, Spain; [Lopez-Bastida, Julio] Red Investigacin Servicios Sanitarios Enfermedade, Madrid, Spain; [Linertova, Renata] Fdn Canaria Investigacin Sanitaria FUNCANIS, Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Toledo, Spain; [Serrano-Aguilar, Pedro] Evaluat & Planning Serv, Canary Islands Hlth Serv, Santa Cruz de La Palma, CA, Spain; [Posada-de-la-Paz, Manuel] SpainRDR CIBERER, Inst Rare Dis Res, ISCIII, Madrid, Spain; [Taruscio, Domenica] Natl Ctr Rare Dis, Ist Superiore SanitA ISS, Rome, Italy; [Iskrov, Georgi] Inst Rare Dis, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Iskrov, Georgi] Med Univ Plovdiv, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Social Med & Publ Hlth, Plovdiv, Bulgaria; [Schieppati, Arrigo] Centro Ric Cliniche Malattie Rare Aldo Cele Dacc, Ist Ric Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Ranica Bergamo, Italy; [von der Schulenburg, Johann Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Hannover, Germany; [Kanavos, Panos] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Social Policy & LSE Hlth, London, England; [Chevreul, Karine] URC Eco Ile France, AP HP, Htel Dieu, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] Univ Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, ECEVE, UMRS 1123, Paris, France; [Chevreul, Karine] INSERM, ECEVE, F-U1123 Paris, France; [Persson, Ulf] Swedish Inst Hlth Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Fattore, Giovanni] Bocconi Univ, Ctr Res Hlth & Social Care Management CERGAS, Milan, Italy",Corvinus University Budapest; University of Pecs; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Instituto de Salud Carlos III; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERER; Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS); Medical University Plovdiv; Leibniz University Hannover; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Assistance Publique Hopitaux Paris (APHP); Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Bocconi University,"Péntek, M (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Dept Hlth Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",marta.pentek@uni-corvinus.hu,"Gulacsi, Laszlo/HMD-6274-2023; Linertová, Renata/F-6425-2011; Brodszky, Valentin/AFN-4112-2022; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Iskrov, Georgi/AAO-2925-2021; Péntek, Márta/HTQ-3097-2023; Posada, Manuel/C-3832-2008; Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; chevreul, karine/AAN-2380-2020; Baji, Petra/JHV-1617-2023; Taruscio, Domenica/A-6646-2015; Boncz, Imre/A-8940-2013","Brodszky, Valentin/0000-0002-6095-2295; Iskrov, Georgi/0000-0002-0988-0062; Péntek, Márta/0000-0001-9636-6012; Posada, Manuel/0000-0002-8372-4180; Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Baji, Petra/0000-0003-2899-8557; Linertova, Renata/0000-0002-0138-9252; Gulacsi, Laszlo/0000-0002-9285-8746; Taruscio, Domenica/0000-0001-5403-233X; FATTORE, GIOVANNI/0000-0001-6545-2110; Boncz, Imre/0000-0003-3699-6236",Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union [A101205],Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project from European Union,"Supported by the Social/Economic Burden and Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients with Rare Diseases in Europe Project, which received funding from the European Union within the framework of the Health Programme [Grant A101205].

For both lung cancer mortality risks and total smoking mortality risks, respondents believe that e-cigarettes pose risks that are lower than the risks of conventional tobacco cigarettes. However, people greatly overestimate the risk levels of e-cigarettes compared with the actual risk levels. Risk beliefs for conventional cigarettes receive at least a two-thirds informational weight in the formation of e-cigarette risk beliefs. Public perceptions of nicotine levels of e-cigarettes are closer to the beliefs for conventional cigarettes than are their health risk perceptions. Consumers' desired uses of e-cigarettes are more strongly related to health risk perceptions than perceived e-cigarette nicotine levels. The overestimation of e-cigarette risks establishes a potential role for informational policies.","[Viscusi, W.

Capital intensity growth and human capital accumulation have been significant contributors to stronger productivity gains. Private-sector development has positively affected productivity growth-but mostly through the increasing role of new private companies. Still, unfinished privatization represents a significant obstacle to stronger productivity gains. The effect of increasing trade openness is significant but negative, most likely owing to weak export competitiveness of Croatian companies. Neither greenfield nor (predominant) brownfield foreign direct investment inflows have contributed to higher labor productivity growth. Further privatization and structural reforms seem to be the most promising policy measures that need to be undertaken in order to achieve higher productivity gains.","[Vuksic, Goran] Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Public Finance,"Vuksic, G (通讯作者)，Inst Publ Finance, Smiciklasova 21, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",goran.vuksic@ijf.hr,"Vuksic, Goran/A-7454-2016","Vuksic, Goran/0000-0003-1502-5561",,,,,29,13,15,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Affirmative action measures were expected to particularly enhance women's agency regarding decisions on decentralized service delivery. However, to date, this potentially transformative reform to the local government system has produced mixed results. This study updates identity economics with intersectional and institutional theories to shed light on the agency of elected women representatives (EWRs) in different federal states of India. The findings show that institutions, including social norms, entail specific identity costs that reinforce stereotyped accounts on women's political agency. Additional policy measures are required to address the incurred costs and render quotas for women effective. The analysis illustrates that an identity economics perspective, grounded in feminist thought, can yield valuable insights for investigating women's agency and for designing gender-sensitive policies.","[Mueller, Ulrike] Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany",University Hohenheim,"Mueller, U (通讯作者)，Univ Hohenheim, Inst Agr Econ & Social Sci Trop & Subtrop, Wollgrasweg 43, D-70599 Stuttgart, Germany.",ulrike_mueller@uni-hohenheim.de,,,German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),"The research for this paper was conducted while on a fellowship funded by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), which is gratefully acknowledged.

Using data for 2006-2014 and with futures prices with maturities up to 6 months we find that spot and lagged futures prices are cointegrated and that the futures price provides an unbiased estimate of the spot price. We also find that, with the exception of the front month, that the causality is one-directional. The spot prices lead futures prices between 1-6 months maturity. Hence, while the spot and lagged futures prices are unbiased estimates, we do not find support for the hypothesis that futures prices provide a price discovery function. Rather, it seems that innovations in the spot price influence futures prices. This finding is not uncommon in new and immature futures contracts markets. Hence, the salmon futures market is still immature and has not yet reached the stage where futures prices are able to predict future spot prices.","[Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, 1741 Museum Rd,185 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank; Oglend, Atle] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Misund, Bard] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, Stavanger, Norway",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, 1741 Museum Rd,185 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.;Asche, F (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, 1741 Museum Rd,185 Rogers Hall,POB 110570, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",frank.asche@ufl.edu,"Misund, Bård/J-8720-2016; Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Misund, Bård/0000-0001-7069-5707; Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),Financial support from the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund and Norwegian Research Council is acknowledged.,,55,48,49,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Identification of the conditions behind this process has been carried out on the basis of survey research conducted in commercial farms based in Opole Region.

Thus, we may expect retail prices of farmed to be lower than prices of wild fish and demand to be less elastic. Otherwise, marketing of farmed fish may generate some extra value that justifies higher prices and may exhibit more elastic demand. To test these hypotheses, we employ monthly household scanner panel data for Germany from 2006 to 2010 for six frozen seafood products that include farmed and wild fish.

The problem is fitted into a class of ergodic controllable finite Markov chains game. It is consider the case where a strong Stackelberg equilibrium point is convenient for both firms. We first analyze the best-reply dynamics of the Stackelberg duopoly model such that each firm's best-reply strategies set agree with the set of maximizers of the opponents' strategies. Then, the classical Stackelberg duopoly game is transformed into a potential game in terms of the Lyapunov theory. As a result, a duopoly model has the benefit that the best-reply dynamics results in a natural implementation of the behavior of a Lyapunov-like function. In addition, the strong equilibrium point properties of Stackelberg and Lyapunov meet in potential games. We validate the proposed method theoretically by computing the complexity and by a numerical experiment related to the duopoly model.","[Clempner, Julio B.] Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Poznyak, Alexander S.] Ctr Res & Adv Studies, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico,"Clempner, JB (通讯作者)，Inst Politecn Nacl, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",julio@clempner.name; apoznyak@ctrl.cinvestav.mx,"Poznyak, Alexander/U-1729-2019",,,,,,21,12,12,1,8,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

On the level of constitutional law, nudging is criticized for being paternalistic. On second thought, many forms of nudging are in contrast not paternalistic, because they do not protect an individual from themselves, but others from negative effects of the actions of an individual. Especially in environmental policies, nudging therefore proves to be legitimate. However, nudging might not be as effective as policy instrument for environmental issues, as many hope. Even though this article shows interesting possible examples of nudging, it also argues why the effect of nudging as main policy instrument in solving environmental problems will be limited.","[Ekardt, Felix; Wieding, Jutta] Forschungsstelle Nachhaltigkeit & Klimapolit, Leipzig, Germany",,"Ekardt, F (通讯作者)，Forschungsstelle Nachhaltigkeit & Klimapolit, Leipzig, Germany.",mail@sustainability-justice-climate.eu; jutta.wieding@posteo.de,,,,,,,17,3,3,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,247,262,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_13,0.0,,,16,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500014,0

Demographic aging of the population is one of the social processes focused the attention of researchers from many disciplines: economists, specialists in medicine and public health, social politicians and sociologists. Demographic aging of the population is not unexpected process; it is determined by several factors, especially the increasing of life expectancy. High impact on this occurrence has also entering into the age of 65+ generation born during the post-war baby boomers. However the disparity in the rate of increase the percentage of old people in different regions in Poland and Czech Republic should be pointed. Special importance has the problem of scarcity of geriatric care resources; also diversify access to them by people living in different regions. The aim of this article is diagnosis the geriatric care resources in a situation of an aging population in Poland and Czech Republic.

For doing this, in this paper, the network analysis approach has been used to understand the structure and the dynamics involved in the shelled fruit trade taking place between the main producing countries on a global level. The representation of international trading of shelled fruit as a network is a useful tool to understand and measure phenomena such as the globalization of the trading of shelled fruit between countries.

Besides other factors, managed competition relies on a sufficient price-elastic demand. This paper presents a systematic review of empirical studies on price elasticity of demand for health insurance. The objective was to identify the differing international ranges of price elasticity and to find socio-economic as well as setting-oriented factors that influence price elasticity. Relevant literature for the topic was identified through a two-step identification process including a systematic search in appropriate databases and further searches within the references of the results. A total of 45 studies from countries such as the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were found. Clear differences in price elasticity by countries were identified. While empirical studies showed a range between -0.2 and -1.0 for optional primary health insurance in the US, higher price elasticities between -0.6 and -4.2 for Germany and around -2 for Switzerland were calculated for mandatory primary health insurance. Dutch studies found price elasticities below -0.5. In consideration of all relevant studies, age and poorer health status were identified to decrease price elasticity. Other socio-economic factors had an unclear impact or too limited evidence. Premium level, range of premiums, homogeneity of benefits/coverage and degree of forced decision were found to have a major influence on price elasticity in their settings. Further influence was found from supplementary insurance and premium-dependent employer contribution.","[Pendzialek, Jonas B.; Simic, Dusan; Stock, Stephanie] Univ Hosp Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Pendzialek, JB (通讯作者)，Univ Hosp Cologne, Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Gleueler Str 176-178, D-50935 Cologne, Germany.",jonas.pendzialek@gmail.com,,,,,,,59,25,29,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Currently Russia's system of mechanisms and methods for developing external economic activities appears to lack efficiency and fails to yield the desired results. That in turn limits the pool of opportunities available to Russian companies on international markets and reduces the attractiveness of cooperating with the Russian Federation for potential foreign business partners. What is relevant today for Russia's economy is to promptly determine what factors impact external economic activities most in order to facilitate further development and implementation of a complex of measures aimed at increasing Russia's foreign trade efficiency, creating new types of production based on latest technologies and equipment, ensuring Russia's economic security, and improving the nation's general wellbeing.

Interpreting textual claims generally requires consumers to engage in extensive and deliberate processing (so-called type 2 processing in dual processing models in social psychology). In real life competitive choice settings, however, businesses preferably make use of colours and other visual elements to successfully attract consumers. In case this approach supports consumers in making healthier food decisions, it can be seen as a form of nudging, as this approach largely appeals to consumers' reactive, intuitive modes of decision making (i.e., system 1 processing). Nevertheless, visuals may mislead consumers to a larger extent than textual claims in that they overpromise health benefits of consuming the product. In order to effectively regulate health claims in the EU, we claim that regulation has to devote attention to the regulation of pictorial claims. We will first illustrate such a mechanism and its potential for effective nudging on the example of health and nutrition claims in the EU. We will then investigate on the example of the differences between textual and pictorial claims whether the EU health claims regulation is effective in making sure that sales techniques of food companies are being regulated as effective nudging instead of misleading marketing tactics.","[Purnhagen, Kai] Wageningen Univ, Law & Governance Grp, Hollandseweg Leeuwenborch Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands; [van Herpen, Erica; van Kleef, Ellen] Wageningen Univ, Mkt & Consumer Behav Grp, NL-6706 Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research; Wageningen University & Research,"Purnhagen, K (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Law & Governance Grp, Hollandseweg Leeuwenborch Bldg 201, NL-6706 KN Wageningen, Netherlands.",Kai.Purnhagen@wur.nl; erica.vanherpen@wur.nl; ellen.vankleef@wur.nl,"van Herpen, Erica/E-8731-2012; van Kleef, Ellen/B-7789-2009; Purnhagen, Kai Peter/HKN-8244-2023","van Kleef, Ellen/0000-0002-8797-6983;",,,,,70,13,13,1,26,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,197,216,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_11,0.0,,,20,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500012,0

Even the low-end mobile phones are enabled with options to access social networking sites (SNS). It helps that SNS can now be accessed in vernacular languages, too. This development in mobile telephony has the potential to mitigate the socio-economic disparity of the country's population (D'Costa, in this edition) and make SNS available to the people, which in turn can connect millions of users instantly and efficiently. It is not surprising then that Indian SNS users are beginning to harness this capacity to digital activism. Any form of communication, non-profit or commercial, must involve a level of persuasion to be considered successful. While persuasion can take many different forms, in activism mediated through digital communication tools, it tends to follow two paradigms: to inform and to inspire, depending on the socio-economic development of the people to be persuaded; in a developed country, digital activism is used to inspire people on an issue of concern, and in a developing country digital tools are used foremost to inform the people about a cause. The choice of paradigm is also guided by access to communication technology. I argue that given the disparity in socio-economic development (D'Costa, in this edition) between urban and rural regions in contemporary India, both paradigms coexist within the Indian context. The way inspiration-based activities are managed and implemented is comparable to the persuasive strategies of a multinational corporation seeking global recognition. I conclude that digital activist branding has the potential to bring about social change, depending on how the communication tool is being used along with the nature of the issues raised online.","[Ray, Paula] Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland,"Ray, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.",paula.ray@auckland.ac.nz,"RAY, PAULA/GSD-8126-2022",,,,,,51,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,229,248,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_12,0.0,,,20,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800012,0

It affects not only the economic aspects but also social aspects of social life in general. Tourism allows to travel and get new experiences, to travel without barriers, escape from everyday stereotypes, and to self realize and disseminate the knowledge. One of the prerequisites for the development of tourism in the country is the capacity of the accommodation establishments. Within the accommodation establishments their number, size, spatial location, as well as the overall quality of services are important. The quality of produced provided services and goods determines long-term prosperity of an enterprise on the market. Quality is also a factor that enables an enterprise to achieve a competitive advantage on a constantly developing market. Tourism and its services represent a specific sphere in present society. Accommodation establishments and their services face to strong competitive environment that is a reason why they are forced to provide high quality services to distinguish from the others. Competition in the area of accommodation services is growing. Such establishments represent necessary potential for the development of tourism in general. Constant monitoring and improving in different areas of the quality boost competitiveness. To evaluate the level of quality of them, several research methods can be used. For the purpose of this paper the GAP model was exploited. It was focused on the dimension of service reliability in chosen hotel located in eastern part of Slovakia.

The alternative mode of transport are motorail trains, which offer convenience for passengers to travel from door to door in their own car. Accordingly, it is very important to study the effectiveness of the organisation of motorail trains for Bulgarian railway routes along which business and tourist trips are made. Providing such services is a factor in tourist travel and transport development. The experimental research has been carried out for the Sofia-Plovdiv-Burgas railway axis. In this paper a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of the organisation of motorail trains is proposed. It comprises a few steps. In the first step, by using the AHP method, the variants of transportation by motorail trains are formed and the probabilities for stochastic variation of passengers are determined. In the second step the operating costs of transportation and financial investment for a new type of wagons are determined. The payback period has been chosen as a criterion of efficiency. In the third step a Decision Tree Analysis is performed to determine the best variant of transportation. The environmental and social benefits of the new transport technology have been determined. The results, which have been obtained, indicate that the motorail trains would be an effective technology for thatparticular railway route.","[Stoilova, Svetla] Tech Univ Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria",Technical University Sofia,"Stoilova, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Sofia, Sofia, Bulgaria.",,"stoilova, svetla/J-6182-2017","stoilova, svetla/0000-0002-3178-1968",,,,,9,6,6,1,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,627,634,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200082,0

Yet the role of timber plantations, their specific goals, perceptions, actors involved, and management systems had been redefined in the past and they continue to evolve today. It is important to understand the driving forces and historical trends shaping timber plantations in Indonesia in order to critically reflect on their changing roles in the forestry sector. This article traces the development of Indonesian forest plantations through time by categorizing them into paradigms. Proposed explanatory framework helps to see the historical legacies in,the Indonesian plantation sector. The identification of historical plantation modes is based on a literature review while current approaches and specific policy instruments are discussed based on exploratory empirical case-study material from three Indonesian forest plantation estates (involving joint forest management, community forest management and large private timber company). The historical review shows a range of continuities and helps to explain the problems forest plantations in Indonesia face today. It points to socially-oriented community forest management as highly praised by its stakeholders, able to improve rural livelihoods and secure environmental benefits. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study believes that in spite of the longterm lack of work force at some positions in the given countries, the amount of salaries in some sectors of economy do not increase as a rule. This is reasoned with the help of statistical data and via mathematical calculations it explains and proves the relation between the amount and development of salaries of working immigrants and the natives. In the end it evaluates the impact of immigration on decreasing the lack of work force and its pressure on the increase of salaries in some sectors. Moreover, it mentions the level of salaries of migrated work force when entering the labour market of Germany and Austria in comparison to the natives as well as the increase of level of salaries after acquiring practical skill and language knowledge.","[Tupa, Magdalena] Univ Alexander Dubchek Trencin, Dept Management & Human Resource Dev, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia",Alexander Dubcek University Trencin,"Tupá, M (通讯作者)，Univ Alexander Dubchek Trencin, Dept Management & Human Resource Dev, Fac Social & Econ Relat, Trencin, Slovakia.",,"Tupá, Magdaléna/AAR-2100-2021","Tupá, Magdaléna/0000-0003-4532-2292",VEGA agency [c.1/0736/14],VEGA agency(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This publication was created within the frame of the project funded by VEGA agency Trends in the migration of labor force in the EU countries and its impact on the economic and social development of Slovakia (c.1/0736/14).,,13,4,4,1,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,321,328,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200042,0

The types are derived from patterns of student responses to individual items on a multiple-choice test. The micro and macro data from the Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) are used to show how aggregate scores can be reinterpreted based on their learning components. The regression analysis shows the relative contribution from learning components to aggregate scores. A value-added or difference score has a potential problem because it is a mixture of positive and negative learning.

We find no evidence of a positive mean impact of acceleration in any specification and significant negative effects on performance in both Algebra land the traditional followup course, Geometry.

(Eur J Health Econ 12: 345-352, 2011) published a top-down cost of illness study on the health burden, and direct and indirect costs of morbidity and mortality attributable to excess weight (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)) in Germany in 2002. The objective of the current study was to update the 2002 estimates to the year 2008. To simplify comparisons, we closely followed the methods and assumptions of the original study, using 2008 data for most input parameters (e.g. prevalence, mortality, resource use, costs). Excess weight related deaths increased by 31 % (from 36,653 to 47,964) and associated years of potential life lost (from 428,093 to 588,237) and quality adjusted life years lost (from 367,722 to 505,748) by about 37 %, respectively. Excess weight caused (sic)16,797 million in total costs in 2008 (+ 70 %), of which (sic)8,647 million were direct costs (corresponding to 3.27 % of total German health care expenditures in 2008). About 73 % ((sic)12,235 million) of total excess weight related costs were attributable to obesity (BMI C30 kg/m(2)). The main drivers of direct costs were endocrinological (44 %) and cardiovascular (38 %) diseases. Indirect costs amounted to (sic)8,150 million in 2008 (+62 %), of which about two-thirds were indirect costs from unpaid work. The great majority of indirect costs were due to premature mortality ((sic)5,669 million). The variation of input parameters (univariate sensitivity analyses) resulted in attributable costs between (sic)8,978 million (-47 % compared to base case) and (sic)25,060 million (+49 %). The marked increase in excess weight related costs can largely be explained by increases in the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and to a lesser extent from increases in resource consumption, as well as increases in (unit) costs and wages (comprising 5.5 % inflation).","[Lehnert, Thomas; Streltchenia, Pawel; Konnopka, Alexander; Koenig, Hans-Helmut] Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany; [Lehnert, Thomas; Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.] Univ Leipzig, IFB Adipos Dis, Univ Med Leipzig, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Riedel-Heller, Steffi G.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Social Med Occupat Med & Publ Hlth, D-04103 Leipzig, Germany",University of Hamburg; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; Leipzig University; Leipzig University,"Lehnert, T (通讯作者)，Univ Med Ctr Hamburg Eppendorf, Dept Hlth Econ & Hlth Serv Res, Hamburg Ctr Hlth Econ, Martinistr 52, D-20246 Hamburg, Germany.",t.lehnert@uke.de,"König, Hans-Helmut/P-1211-2018; Riedel-Heller, Steffi/ABG-1537-2021","Riedel-Heller, Steffi/0000-0003-4321-6090","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany [FKZ: 01EO1001]","Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF))","This work was supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), Germany, FKZ: 01EO1001.

Design/methodology/approach: This article is based on a practical and historical review of several key documents at the Pierre Wack Memorial Library. The theoretical scope of the paper is to view current scenario planning practices in light of the foundational ideas of its originator. Findings: Pierre's personal materials contain several important practical implications for using scenarios. These are summarized after analyzing, synthesizing and reviewing his ideas. Research limitations/implications: Because the article is based on Wades personal views about scenario planning, it is necessarily limited. However, the goal is to revisit the original intent of scenario planning by reviewing the personal documents of one of its originators. Practical implications: The main goal of the paper is to distill practical advice from Wack's documents. These are: (a) scenarios must be part of a larger strategy system and the elements are clarified, (b) scenarios should not be positioned or sold as the product/outcome of scenario planning, (c) the two-day workshop approach to scenario planning is not adequate, and (d) scenario planning should not primarily be practiced as group process. These issues are discussed and further explanations and solutions are examined. Social implications:This article is intended to provoke challenging questions about the nature of current scenario planning practices. We hope this work might change the common approach to scenario planning and offer guidance for avoiding disappointment in scenario planning because it is increasingly practiced inadequately. Originality/value: This article features some of Wack's original views about what is required for successful scenario planning. Further, this article uses his own words and is based on his personal documents, videos, presentation transcriptions and personal writings that have not before been in the public domain. This article will be of value to any executive, manager or consultant considering scenario planning, who wants to learn how it was originally intended to be practiced, how to get the most out of it, and what to avoid.

Improvements in care management for some may improve efficiency system-wide, with implications for optimal payment policy in public insurance programs. These system-level effects may depend on local health-care market structure and vary based on patient characteristics. We use exogenous variation in the Medicare payment schedule to isolate the effects of market-level managed care enrollment on the quantity and quality of care delivered. We find that in areas with greater enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in managed care, the non-managed care beneficiaries have fewer days in the hospital but more outpatient visits, consistent with a substitution of less expensive outpatient care for more expensive inpatient care, particularly at high levels of managed care. We find no evidence that care is of lower quality. Optimal payment policies for Medicare managed care enrollees that account for system-level spillovers may thus be higher than those that do not.","[Baicker, Katherine] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Robbins, Jacob A.] Brown Univ, Dept Econ, Providence, RI 02912 USA",Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

This article estimates the price effects of management reform in the Swedish Baltic Sea cod fishery. In April 2011, as part of a reform process aimed at giving fishers more flexibility, vessels using active gear were given annual non-transferable catch quotas. We examine whether the new management system has altered the bargaining power between fishers and processors in the ex-vessel market for fish. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach we find that post-reform fishers improve their bargaining power and thus are paid a higher price. However, the price increase is small, amounting to around 2% of the pre-reform price.","[Blomquist, Johan; Waldo, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Hammarlund, Cecilia] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Econ, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; Lund University,"Blomquist, J (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Econ, POB 730, SE-22007 Lund, Sweden.",johan.blomquist@slu.se; cecilia.hammarlund@nek.lu.se; staffan.waldo@slu.se,"waldo, staffan/AHA-9201-2022","Blomquist, Johan/0000-0002-9668-4149",,,,,34,6,7,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The insertion of grommets is currently being used to correct hearing impairment and prevent complications of unmanaged OME, but there is ongoing discussion about whether the benefits of grommets outweigh the costs and risks. A decision-tree model was developed to assess the surgical insertion of grommets with two non-surgical alternatives (hearing-aids and do-nothing strategies) in cleft palate children with persistent bilateral OME. The model assumed a 2-year time horizon and a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were valued using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated by linking utility values with potential hearing gains measured in decibels. Multiple data sources were used, including reviews of the clinical effectiveness, resource use and utility literature, and supplemented with expert opinion. Uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Expected value of perfect information analysis was used to calculate the potential value of future research. The results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the grommets strategy was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A 9,065 pound per QALY gained compared with the do-nothing strategy, and the hearing-aids strategy was extended dominated by the grommets strategy. The population expected value of perfect information was A 5,194,030 pound at a willingness to pay threshold of A 20,000 pound per QALY, implying that future research could be potentially worthwhile. This study found some evidence that the insertion of grommets to manage cleft palate children with bilateral OME is likely to be cost-effective, but further research is required to inform this treatment choice.","[Mohiuddin, Syed; O'Brien, Kevin; Bruce, Iain] Univ Manchester, Healing Fdn Cleft & Craniofacial Clin Res Ctr, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Mohiuddin, Syed; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Fenwick, Elisabeth] Univ Glasgow, Inst Hlth & Wellbeing, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [O'Brien, Kevin] Univ Manchester, Sch Dent, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Bruce, Iain] Royal Manchester Childrens Hosp, Paediat ENT Dept, Manchester M27 1HA, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester; University of Glasgow; University of Manchester; Royal Manchester Children's Hospital,"Mohiuddin, S (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Inst Populat Hlth, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",syed.mohiuddin@manchester.ac.uk,"Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020; Bruce, Iain A/H-9508-2019","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Bruce, Iain A/0000-0003-0831-4760; Mohiuddin, Syed/0000-0003-4585-3392","National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme at the National Health Service; Healing Foundation, UK","National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme at the National Health Service; Healing Foundation, UK","This study was supported by the National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment Programme at the National Health Service and the Healing Foundation, UK.

We use a continuous-time surplus production model and an economic model with downward-sloping demand and stock-dependent costs. First, we derive an optimal exploitation policy as a feedback control rule by applying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman approach and analyze the effects of stochasticity on the optimal policy. Then, we characterize the long-term sustainable optimal state and estimate the risk of stock collapse due to stochastically induced critical depensation. We find that the optimal harvest policy in the stochastic setting is conservative at low stochasticity and approaches the myopic solution at high stochasticity. The risk of stock collapse is increasing with the stochasticity and decreasing with stock sizes.","[Poudel, Diwakar; Sandal, Leif K.] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, N-5045 Bergen, Norway; [Kvamsdal, Sturla F.] NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, SNF Ctr Appl Res NHH, N-5045 Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Poudel, D (通讯作者)，NHH Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Helleveien 30, N-5045 Bergen, Norway.",Diwakar.Poudel@nhh.no; Leif.Sandal@nhh.no; Sturla.Kvamsdal@nhh.no,"Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/W-3702-2019","Sandal, Leif Kristoffer/0000-0002-5384-0316; Poudel, Diwakar/0000-0001-9604-5905","Norwegian Research Council (NFR) [196433/S40, 216571/E40, 234238/E40]",Norwegian Research Council (NFR)(Research Council of Norway),"We thank Keith Criddle, Hakan Eggert, Rognvaldur Hannesson, Stein Ivar Steinshamn, two anonymous referees, and an associate editor of Marine Resource Economics for helpful comments and suggestions on the manuscript.

Uncertainty remains about relative net benefits of profit-maximizing timber rotations compared to the net present value of incumbent land uses such as cattle ranching. The scientific and popular literatures have displayed enthusiasm for teak (Tectona grandis) and native species plantations. We estimate a realistic yield model for teak, an exotic tree species, based on growth data from actual small scale landholders who were incentivized to convert lands to teak plantations. We use a suite of well fit yield models to solve for the optimal Faustmann rotation and compute the net present value (NPV) of a teak plantation to a private land manager as a starting point for understanding land-use patterns. We compare the NPV from forestry to cattle and find that site characteristics, discount rates, and market prices are all important factors in influencing the land manager's decision to switch from cattle ranching to plantation forestry. We find that traditional cattle ranching is economically competitive, in terms of NPV, with and may often outperform teak plantations within the PCW. This result is robust to the teak yield model selected. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The transition from a conditional cash transfer to a more in-kind benefit affects the relative prices of different types of education, pushing veterans to invest in more expensive (plausibly higher-quality) schooling. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, combined with state level variation in the degree of benefit expansion, I find that the higher level of benefits increased college enrollment of separated veterans by between 15 and 20 percent while also shifting the composition of enrollment toward four-year schools.","Univ Virginia, Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Barr, A (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",barr@virginia.edu,,,American Educational Research Association; National Science Foundation [DRL-0941014]; Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Research On Learning [0941014] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,American Educational Research Association; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Education and Human Resources; Division Of Research On Learning(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for STEM Education (EDU)),"Andrew Barr is an ABD graduate student in Economics at the University of Virginia.

In the last twenty years efforts have increased to develop standards and guidelines as voluntary-based policy tools for guaranteeing sustainable forest management. However, most are focused exclusively or prevalently on natural or semi-natural forests, while only a few are specific to planted forests or plantations. Many differences can be identified among existing standards and guidelines that can be applied to planted forests and forest plantations. The paper, which main aim is to assess whether and to what extent planted forests are properly considered within the existing sets of standards/guidelines and to identify areas for improvements, is based on a series of comparative analysis. Both quantitative (number) and qualitative ( quality in terms of coherency, consistency and completeness) aspects of indicators for addressing environmental, economic and social issues are considered. First, 42 standards/guidelines are classified and compared. Secondly, 3 standards for forest certification and 3 guidelines developed by international organisations are Compared. Finally, a gap analysis is carried out with respect to an ad hoc reference standard with 386 indicators. Ball-charts, radar graphs and histograms are used to show results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We test whether higher fees increase the number of dentists accepting Medicaid patients using data from annual surveys of dentists conducted by the American Dental Association between 1999 and 2009. We find a positive, though small, effect of Medicaid payment rates on whether a dentist treats any publicly insured patients and the percentage of the practice's patients who have public insurance.

Consequently, insurers face incentives for risk rating and risk selection, both of which jeopardize affordability of coverage, accessibility to health care, and quality of care. This study explores to what extent the predictive performance of the prediction model used in risk equalization can be improved by using additional administrative information on costs and diagnoses from three prior years. We analyze data from 13.8 million individuals in the Netherlands in the period 2006-2009. First, we show that there is potential for improving models' predictive performance at both the population and subgroup level by extending them with risk adjusters based on cost and/or diagnostic information from multiple prior years. Second, we show that even these extended models do not adequately compensate insurers. By using these extended models incentives for risk rating and risk selection can be reduced substantially but not removed completely. The extent to which risk-equalization models can be improved in practice may differ across countries, depending on the availability of data, the method chosen to calculate risk-adjusted payments, the value judgment by the regulator about risk factors for which the model should and should not compensate insurers, and the trade-off between risk selection and efficiency.","[van Veen, S.

Although there are some available substitutes for northern forests' timber resource, such as poplar plantation, agricultural wastes, and recycled papers, the present status of access to the resources presents a significant constraint on the viability of cellulosic product manufacturing. Accordingly, this research presents a decision-making model developed to select the best solution for raw material supply to the wood-cellulosic industry. Three possibilities can be considered as potential solutions: (I) implementation of poplar plantation and other agricultural products by manufacturers, (2) short-term contracts with public and private firms and farmers, and (3) long-term contracts with public and private firms and farmers. The Analytic Network Process and Analytic Hierarchy Process were used to synthesize and analyze the model. Our analysis using these techniques shows that all calculated decisions are influenced by external factors. A value-weighted competency model was calculated in the first stage with the influence of external factors on the competency model. Hierarchical design decisions were made for each of the competencies and their subsets. Paired comparison matrices associated with the degree of importance of each of the competencies were achieved in the second stage. In the final stage, subsets of competencies' weights and their sub-options were identified with the combination of the competencies and the best solution was obtained. Finally a sensitivity analysis of the model was performed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The existing literature has thus far focused predominantly on moderate, institutional, elite-oriented forms of contention over welfare policy reform. The article presents evidence that disruptive, innovative or elite-challenging forms of contention play an important role in welfare reform and should therefore be the subject of more sustained research. Pooled time-series cross-sectional analysis provides support for the claim that this more disruptive type of contention has a more significant and consistent impact on the process of welfare reform than do the institutional and moderate forms of contention that are more frequently studied (especially under adverse economic conditions and heightened levels of global socio-economic pressure). This is because (a) participants in acts of institutional, elite-oriented forms of contention more readily accede to elite discourse when it is asserted that welfare retrenchment measures are 'necessary'; and (b) moderate, elite-oriented activities are more easily ignored by policy makers.","Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Bailey, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",d.j.bailey@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,86,22,24,2,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Although a considerable body of literature has focused on natural disaster insurance programs for agricultural producers, not much is known about forest disaster insurance. This paper contributes to this knowledge gap by looking at the Fujian Forest Disaster Insurance (FFDI) program in China. In particular, we examine the extent to which the socio-demographic characteristics and production practice of forest producers, along with other factors, are associated with their participation decision to the program. Moreover, we assess the impact of the FFDI program on household income. Using a household survey of 950 forest producers in Fujian Province in China, it is evident that the education of forest producers, participation in producers' organizations in the local area, and the incidence of forest fires in the local counties are significant determinants of participation in the FFDI program. With respect to the welfare effect, we found that the FFDI program significantly increased household income by approximately 10%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It becomes evident that fat gets to be revalued and remediated by women already privileged within circuits of capital, demarcations along lines of race, and notions of normative embodiment.

Ignoring this relationship may lead to ignoring group effects and hence to invalidating many of the traditional techniques of statistical analysis used to investigate the relationships between data. People living within the same country may be more similar to each other than people living in other countries; they share the country economic characteristics, lifestyle, social factors, and health care availability, which may have a collective influence over and above individual circumstances. The degree of satisfaction with life may be determined by factors that may be shaped by the specific country environment. The ability to model such complex relationships comes at a computational cost. Each multi-level software package has a different interface and different capabilities; therefore the choice of which to use is important. Using R and SPSS we develop a multilevel analysis of the level of satisfaction with life in general of individuals from Central and Eastern Europe that are grouped within countries.

Through the initiation and development of entrepreneurial way of thinking and the development of entrepreneurial competences, production and exports are increased as well as the overall employment rate in a particular country. Besides its positive effects on the growth of newly founded firms, entrepreneurial competence also acts positively on the more efficient ways of using the existing creative potentials of knowledge and skills in the society. The interest for educational programs that support and develop entrepreneurial competence is on the rise. The research whose results we are presenting was aimed at determining entrepreneurial competence. The research was done using the structured questionnaire and it included 321 students of The University North, enrolled in study programs that do not belong to the economic study programs nor are connected with them. Descriptive statistical method was used to analyze the data. The results of the research have shown that a higher level of entrepreneurial competence increases the affinity towards entrepreneurial behavior. The results of the research have also shown that teaching in higher education institutions does not significantly develop entrepreneurial competences. Entrepreneurial competence is a key for a higher competitiveness, personal development and sustainable employability of an individual i.e. student. It helps in the creation, recognition and use of opportunities and introducing changes. Entrepreneurial competence makes innovation, survival and growth in a dynamic and competitive environment easier.","[Hunjet, Anica; Kozina, Goran] Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin 42000, Croatia; [Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Koprivnica 48000, Croatia",University North - Croatia; University North - Croatia,"Hunjet, A (通讯作者)，Univ North, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin 42000, Croatia.",anica.hunjet@unin.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr; petar.kurecic@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,12,2,2,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,620,629,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000057,0

It compares women's control over and benefits from jointly held land and housing with those of coupled women not owning land or housing at all and coupled women owning them solely. The lack of a clear and consistent advantage of joint ownership potentially arises from frequent disagreement within couples about whether the land or house is jointly owned. The study serves as a reminder of the complexities of joint ownership in practice, particularly within families, that need to be considered in order for coupled women to benefit from joint asset ownership. Efforts promoting joint ownership, for example, joint titling and marital property laws supporting joint ownership, should not only consider these complexities but also establish and communicate clear and enforceable rules for joint ownership.","[Kes, Aslihan] Int Ctr Res Women, 1120 20th St NW Suite 500 N, Washington, DC 20036 USA",,,krista.l.jacobs@gmail.com; akes@icrw.org,,,International Center for Research on Women,International Center for Research on Women,"The authors thank the journal editors, four anonymous reviewers, and participants at the Workshop for the Special Issue on Engendering Economic Policy in Africa (Cape Town, South Africa, May 2013) for their detailed and constructive comments.

The involvement of foreign capital contributed to the use of modern organizational and management solutions coming from the West. The society, bank employees and also researchers used to assess employment in banks as demanding. Bank employees are frequently called knowledge workers. It is often said that the requirements for positions in the banking sector are high. The prevalence of higher education among banks' employees clearly affected this opinion. On the other hand, what can be observed in Poland is the popularization and depreciation of BA and MA education. Earlier surveys and the results of interviews conducted with employees of banks confirm the high requirements placed on the workers(2). The author challenges the thesis that the personnel policy in Poland's banks is characterized by high requirements placed on applicants and employees. Considerations need to be supported by theory. Given the author's earlier analysis, it seems that it would be appropriate to anchor the considerations and empirical observations in the sieve model presented by M. Kostera. It is one of the two models (besides the human capital model) of personnel policy proposed by this author. The following are the main assumptions of the sieve model: high requirements on workers, competition between employees, high professionalism, constant personnel fluctuations, personnel's lack of loyalty. This paper's aim is to confirm or deny the fact that the sieve model exists in the process of recruitment and selection of candidates for banking positions in Poland.","[Kazmierczyk, Jerzy] Poznan Uniwers Econ, Poznan, Poland",,"Kazmierczyk, J (通讯作者)，Poznan Uniwers Econ, Poznan, Poland.",jerzy.kazmierczyk@ue.poznan.pl,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,9,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,404,414,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800041,0

This study intends to estimate the income-elasticities of healthcare expenditure in public and private sectors separately for investigating whether healthcare is a ` necessity' or 'luxury' for citizens of these countries. Panel data from 9 SEAR countries over 16 years (1995-2010) were employed. Fixed-and random-effect models were fitted to estimate income-elasticity of public, private and total healthcare expenditure. Results showed that one percent point increase in GDP per capita increased private expenditure on healthcare by 1.128%, while public expenditure increased by only 0.412%. Inclusion of three-year lagged variables of GDP per capita in the models did not have remarkable influence on the findings. The citizens of SEAR countries consider healthcare as a necessity while provided through public sector and a luxury when delivered by private sector. By increasing the public provisions of healthcare, more redistribution of healthcare resources can be ensured, which can accelerate the journey of SEAR countries towards universal health coverage.","[Khan, Jahangir Am; Mahumud, Rashidul Alam] Ctr Equity & Hlth Syst, Hlth Econ & Financing Res Grp, 68 Shahid Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh; [Khan, Jahangir Am; Mahumud, Rashidul Alam] BRAC Univ, Ctr Excellence Univ Hlth Coverage icddr, B & James P Grant Sch Publ Hlth, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Khan, Jahangir Am] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth LIME, Hlth Econ Unit, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden",Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee BRAC; BRAC University; Karolinska Institutet,"Khan, JA (通讯作者)，Ctr Equity & Hlth Syst, Hlth Econ & Financing Res Grp, 68 Shahid Tajuddin Ahmed Sharani, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh.",jahangir.khan@icddrb.org,"Khan, Jahangir/AAG-4014-2019; Mahumud, Dr Rashidul Alam/O-2477-2018","KHAN, JAHANGIR/0000-0002-6151-764X; Mahumud, Dr Rashidul Alam/0000-0001-9788-1868",Centre of Excellence for Universal Health Coverage,Centre of Excellence for Universal Health Coverage,"The Centre of Excellence for Universal Health Coverage acknowledges the financial contribution of the Rockefeller Foundation for doing this study.

To analyze this, we compose three-step estimations by using a sample of KOSPI 200 firms during 1,803 trading days between 2005 and 2012. We first estimate the relationship between exchange rate exposure and hedging activities and see whether financial regulation had any effect on hedging activities. Furthermore, using TSLS analysis, we estimate the effect of hedging activities on exchange rate exposure, which is caused by tightened financial regulation in the form of corporate governance. We report the following findings. First, firms are less likely to be exposed to exchange risk with more hedging activities. Second, corporate governance has a strongly positive effect on the hedging activities. Firms use more hedging tools when they have a strong structure of shareholder's protection, clear outside ownership, and a better monitoring system; but the relationship becomes weaker in times of crisis.","[Kim, Jong-Hee] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Econ Coll Commerce, Jeonju 561756, South Korea; [Kim, Joocheol] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ & Quantitat Risk Management QRM, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Yonsei University,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Econ Coll Commerce, 567 Baekje Daero, Jeonju Si 561756, Jeoliabuk Do, South Korea.",jonghk5@jbnu.ac.kr,"Kim, Joocheol/A-9603-2015",,,,,,55,5,5,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The initial problem therefore is the issue of justifying the autonomy of ethics in the light of the claims of applied ethics especially applied economic ethics of value. Not only due to epistemological and methodological issues, but also due to its urgency with regard to the human existence, which brooks no delay. An emphasis, which would prefer one discipline on the detriment of another, could have undesired impacts on the lives of individuals. However, our effort is to approach ethics as a doctrine which treats good, evil, the values and faith in the future in their relation to the totality of the lives of individuals and the entire society. The problem encountered in contemporary ethics is the exact opposite of such efforts. The example we will mention as the first one is particularly significant today. It involves the emphasis on pro-social and economic behavior of each individual on their own. It is quite adequate to strengthen the pro-social role ethics of values as every man actualizes himself in economic relationships. In this context, ethics is tasked to serve as one instrument of economic life. Since every individual is supposed to be a part of the economic life, they must be participated on the ethics of values. The question of any ethics must be preceded by an analysis of man and his culture in the world. Philosophical/linguistic examinations capable of showing the situation which surrounds and determines man. Only after that can it be shown to what extent the following sentence applies and where it ceases to be valid: We must be held accountable for the consequence of our actions. This paves the way to the justification of any moral and ethical requirement. But it only does so after the autonomy of man in the world is proved. Therefore, man holds the key to his situation in his own hands and may freely choose and decide as well as carry full responsibility for his actions. The behavior of corporates in different countries is regulated by the different state laws. Different civic societies, in some countries more, in some less, generate press on the corporates for their bigger social responsibility and ethical behavior. From this position it is easy to understand that words global corporate responsibility or global ethical behavior are mostly philosophical constructs which surpass reality. Our effort is to bring the idea of responsibility closer to economic reality. Methodologically this article is divided into three parts. The first part is a philosophical analysis of main terms, which we are interested in. We would like to analyze the terms ethics, morality, ethos and values from etymological and epistemological position. We will search for the real meaning of this word and compare with recent discourse. The major interest of this article is explained this phenomena from the philosophical positions. The second part of the article is economic analysis of the situation of the corporate in different regions - countries, mainly in European Union. This step is a description and comparison of the same corporate behavior in different regions and their social politics through the contents and states. This description should give the real position for ethical phenomena. The third part is the conclusion. In conclusion we try to propose the solution of this situation suggesting hermeneutical understanding of values.","[Klimsza, Lucjan] Univ Ostraviensis, Pedag Fac, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Lokaj, Ales] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Klimsza, L (通讯作者)，Univ Ostraviensis, Pedag Fac, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",lucjan.klimsza@osu.cz; ales.lokaj@vsb.cz,"Klimsza, Lucjan/B-3192-2014; Lokaj, Ales/I-8579-2018","Klimsza, Lucjan/0000-0001-7514-3813; Lokaj, Ales/0000-0003-3821-2140",,,,,8,1,1,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,426,435,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800043,0

This study deals with the potential problems related to, first, relying on self-reported weight and height to calculate BMI (misreporting), and, second, the concern that BMI is a deficient measure of body fat (misclassification). Using a regional Swedish sample, we analyze whether socioeconomic disparities in BMI are biased because of misreporting, and whether socioeconomic disparities in the risk of obesity are sensitive to whether BMI or waist circumference is used to define obesity. Education and income are used as socioeconomic indicators. The overall conclusion is that misreporting and misclassification may indeed matter for estimated educational and income disparities in BMI and obesity. In the misreporting part we find that women with higher education misreport less than those with lower education, leading to underestimation of the education disparity when using self-reported information. In the misclassification part we find that the probability of being misclassified decreases with income, for both men and women. Among women, the consequence is a steeper income gradient when obesity is defined using waist circumference instead of BMI. Among men the income gradient is statistically insignificant irrespective of how obesity is defined, but when estimating the probability of obesity defined by waist circumference, an educational gradient, which is not present when classifying men using BMI, arises.","[Ljungvall, Asa; Gerdtham, Ulf G.] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Ljungvall, Asa; Gerdtham, Ulf G.] Lund Univ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Gerdtham, Ulf G.] Lund Univ, Ctr Primary Hlth Care Res, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Lindblad, Ulf] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Publ Hlth & Community Med, Gothenburg, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Lund University; University of Gothenburg,"Ljungvall, Å (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ, POB 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.",asa.ljungvall@nek.lu.se,"Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/I-6766-2018","Gerdtham, Ulf-Goran/0000-0002-0647-7817",,,,,36,21,21,2,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Empirical analysis is focused on both the OECD and EU countries and their comparison in the period 2000-2012. From a methodological point of view, GMM estimator is used. The results of empirical analyses show that in case of the traditional breakdown of government expenditure, the impact of productive expenditure on economic growth is negative in OECD countries and not significant in EU countries. However, in case of the classification of government expenditure on individual and collective services, results confirm that individual services affect economic growth negative and collective services promote economic growth, as the expenditure on collective services also includes spending on R&D unlike unproductive spending e.g. in case of expenditure on education.","[Machova, Zuzana; Kotlan, Igor; Drobiszova, Agata] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Natl Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Machová, Z (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Natl Econ, Sokolska 33, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",zazana.machova@vsb.cz; igor.kotlan@vsb.cz; agata.drobiszova@vsb.cz,"Kotlan, Igor/ABD-2528-2020; Machova, Zuzana/AAF-1384-2021","Kotlan, Igor/0000-0002-6121-3216; Machova, Zuzana/0000-0002-3448-4600",,,,,24,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,478,483,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900082,0

In our work we focus on random point generators: uniform random, greedy, and a polite one. Uniform randomness is the standard option typically used when no better concept is available. Greedy approach is based on component-wise sequential point construction. First coordinate is chosen randomly and the remaining ones are set to have the best values related to the previous coordinates. While this approach can help in some cases, it generates points with low diversity and can be trapped in local extremes. Novelty of this paper consists in the politeness of random point generation process. First coordinate is chosen randomly and the process is sequential as well. As opposed to greedy approach we are not concerned only with the best choice, but we select k-th best variant using Binomial distribution with constant mean value of the politeness parameter. Such approach may be considered a trade off between greedy and uniform random approach. This is demonstrated via numerical experiments on Traveling Salesman Problem using Random Shooting, Iterated Local Search and Fast Simulated Annealing.","[Mojzes, Matej; Kukal, Jaromir; Quang Van Tran] FNSPE CTU Prague, Appl Software Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Mojzes, M (通讯作者)，FNSPE CTU Prague, Appl Software Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague, Czech Republic.",mojzemat@fjfi.cvut.cz; jaromir.kukal@fjfi.cvut.cz; tran@vse.cz,"Tran, Quang Van/GRJ-1138-2022",,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,560,565,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900096,0

But what are the changes within managerial accounting system that have appeared in conditions of medium-sized company in the Czech Republic? The paper presents the results of the analysis of current state of the cost management and product costing process in the company. The analysis was carried out by the means of a primary qualitative research, using the methods of in-depth interviews with relevant managers supported by internal documents provided by the company. The general methods of analysis, comparison and synthesis were applied. The form of case study is used to present the results of the analysis. Attention was first drawn to description of the process of product costing in the company. Later, ways were identified to refine the system of product costing, focusing particularly on costs incurred within production process and on the possibilities of using modem methods of cost allocation. The research results are an important contribution to the development of cost allocation methods linked with the beer production. The paper brings evidence of current state of cost management and product costing process from the real conditions of the mediumsized brewery, whose product range has more than quadrupled in the last twenty years. A proposal on streamlining and refining the managerial accounting system, in the form of draft amendments, was performed with the use of a differentiated multistage approach to costs allocation on different products within the company product costing.","[Munzarova, Simona; Vavra, Jan; Bednarikova, Marie; Vlckova, Vladimira; Ritschelova, Adriana] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Munzarova, S (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Vavra, Jan/AAK-2759-2020; Vlckova, Vladimira/W-1868-2018","Vavra, Jan/0000-0002-1047-9591; Vlckova, Vladimira/0000-0002-6271-7424",,,,,11,0,0,0,8,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,645,652,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200083,0

Citing variability in DNA and populations in the Asian region, Singaporean biostatisticians challenge DeCode Genetics of Iceland as an exemplary model of genomic research. They claim that genetic traits among populations in Asia that are relatively new to medical genomics - and being gathered 'in the wild' - gain value from being calculated and databased. The infrastructure deploys the ethnic heuristic in different registers. First, the network of ethnicity becomes a supple membrane coextensive with the network of genetic data points. Second, ethnicity is rendered an immutable mobile that circulates databases beyond tiny Singapore, making the infrastructure at once situated, flexible, and expansive. Third, the ethnic signifier carries affective value that enhances a sense of what is at stake in the building, mobilization and implications of such Asian databases.

Society can be considered as being part of the transport infrastructure, because society's everyday routine directly affects the use of infrastructure and related processes. Driver's behaviour in road traffic is an essential factor for a safe transport infrastructure. Road traffic accident statistics in each country is a significant indicator of transport infrastructure quality and its efficient usage. The problem of the study is the negative influence of drivers driving behaviours to road safety and the necessity to propose the discussion of solutions to change these behaviours. For a solution to the defined problem, the authors put the article's objective: with the aim of determining the essential benefits from a change in driving habits, to identify preventive actions applied in practice, to improve road safety and to reduce the number of road traffic accidents. National economic indicators affect society's behaviour and there is a direct observable correlation to road traffic accident's statistics. Serious accidents are associated with driving a car or being in a car that was involved in a road traffic accident. The issue of traffic safety needs to be addressed at a national level, however, entrepreneurs must engage in solving this problem, whereas road accidents directly affect the profitability of companies.","[Valdemars, Andris] Latvenergo AS, Transport Fleet Replacement Unit, Kaunas, Lithuania; [Atstaja, Dzintra; Vasiljeva, Zane] BA Sch Business & Finance, Riga, Latvia",,"Valdemars, A (通讯作者)，Latvenergo AS, Transport Fleet Replacement Unit, Kaunas, Lithuania.",andris.valdemars@gmail.com; dzintra.atstaja@ba.lv; zanevasiljeva@gmail.com,"ATSTAJA, Dzintra/A-6576-2010","ATSTAJA, Dzintra/0000-0002-9411-7212",,,,,16,2,2,0,5,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,132,140,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100013,0

This article leverages existing research on the economic impacts of Anti Dumping (AD) and MES together with data on the evolution of AD action and trade, to explore the likely impacts of such a decision.. We conclude that such impacts, although real, have been greatly exaggerated by detractors. IVIES is likely to reduce the number of AD cases taken against Chinese exports and the applied duty in cases that are investigated, which would indeed increase Chinese imports. However, in past cases of according MES, both in the EU and elsewhere, AD cases have continued and methodologies have been adapted to take account of the reality of such markets. Finally, Switzerland, a country which has never applied AD action to their imports, has not seen its market monopolized by Chinese imports, even in key sensitive sectors. In addition, prices of Chinese imports to that market are often higher than for low cost EU suppliers. Overall, only a few EU Member States will be affected and two industries ceramics and steel will be key to that impact, underlining the potential need for targeted support measures.","[Curran, Louise] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Toulouse, France; [Maiza, Andoni] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Dept Appl Econ 1, Vitoria, Spain",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; University of Basque Country,"Curran, L (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, Dept Mkt & Int Business, Toulouse, France.",,"Maiza-Larrarte, Andoni/M-3429-2015; Curran, Louise/AHE-2801-2022","Maiza-Larrarte, Andoni/0000-0001-9595-9457; curran, louise/0000-0001-9326-052X",,,,,85,4,4,2,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Descriptive statistics and econometric techniques such as probit, tobit, and Heckman two-step selection models were used to analyze the data. The study finds that households derive a significant portion of their income from the collection of NTFPs; however, the extent and pattern of household dependence on NTFPs for income differ widely across different socioeconomic and demographic profiles. Level of education, age, landholding and household size, number of children, and gender influence the intensity of household collection of NTFPs. Households located inside the core zone of the reserve tend to depend more on NTFP collection compared to households residing in the buffer zone. Provision of non-farm employment and adequate farm land will go a long way in reducing household dependence on NTFPs and thereby improve forest conservation outcomes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A decade later, a broadened AFT agenda has eluded effective evaluation. The recently concluded Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) provides an ideal opportunity to narrow the scope of AFT activities to heed the call for 'Managing for Development Results' (MfDR). The article reviews the evidence on trade costs distinguishing between LDCs and Landlocked LDCS (LLDCs). The article also includes new estimates of time in transit for international parcel data that is measured relatively accurately. New estimates provide support for allocating a greater share of AFT funds towards LDCs and particularly towards LLDCs, both groups showing higher trade costs than comparators and less progress in reducing trade costs since 1995. On average, time in customs for imports and exports are also significantly higher for both groups than for their respective comparators. LDCs and LLDCs have systematically lower scores for the components in the new Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Trade Facilitation Indicator (TFI). These new estimates suggest that a successful implementation of the TFA, defined as moving halfway towards the frontier value of the TFI for the respective country grouping could reduce trade costs for imports of LDCs by 2.5% and by 4.5% for LLDCs. Even though there is more to trade costs than customs management, monitoring implementation of the TFA would be part of the Istanbul Program of Action (IPoA) and a stepping stone towards the concrete trade performance targets that have lacked in AFT activities so far.","[de Melo, Jaime] Univ Geneva, FERDI, Geneva, Switzerland; [de Melo, Jaime] Geneva Business Sch, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wagner, Laurent] FERDI, Paris, France",University of Geneva,"de Melo, J (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, FERDI, Geneva, Switzerland.;de Melo, J (通讯作者)，Geneva Business Sch, Geneva, Switzerland.",Jaime.demelo@unige.ch; laurent.wagner@ferdi.fr,,,FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program 'Investissement d'Avenir' of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program 'Investissement d'Avenir' of the French government,"This article benefited from the financial support of the FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International) and of the program 'Investissement d'Avenir' (reference ANR-10-LABX-14-01) of the French government.

This spatial variation may however cause large distributional heterogeneity of policy changes. In this study, we use a choice experiment to test whether peoples' preferences for restrictions in forest access is influenced by spatial heterogeneity in local forest presence and quality conditions. Combining survey data with GIS information we assess the size of local forest cover, distance to nearest forest and forest quality indicators in a radius of 2.5 km from respondent's residence. We demonstrate that a nationally framed policy implementing access reductions to protect wildlife may have heterogeneous welfare consequences which can be described by a general disutility for access reductions and dependency on local forest attributes.

Data on study efforts are derived from an electronic learning environment, which records the amount of time students are logged in, the number of exercises generated, and the fraction of topics completed. Another measure of study effort is participation in an online summer course. We find no statistically significant relationship between impatience and study effort. However, we find that impatient students obtain lower grades and fail final exams more often, suggesting that impatient students are of lower unmeasured ability.

This paper is the first to exploit the diversity in economic structure across municipalities to consider the shape of the feminization U in a developing country. Using data from South Africa's 2007 Community Survey, this study investigates whether a feminization U exists. Results reveal a U-shaped relationship between the share of nonagricultural employment and women's probability of being in the labor force. Results show that the exclusion of informal urban employment leads to an overestimation of the U slope and part of the decline in women's labor force participation during early structural change is likely related to household and care constraints. A U-shaped relationship is not found between the share of households with electricity and women's probability of being in the labor force.","[Roncolato, Leanne] Franklin & Marshall Coll Econ, Dept Econ, POB 3003, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA",Franklin & Marshall College,"Roncolato, L (通讯作者)，Franklin & Marshall Coll Econ, Dept Econ, POB 3003, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA.",leanneronco@gmail.com,,,,,,,39,6,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

This research aims to find the optimum share of preventive health expenditure to gross domestic product (GDP) and investigate the implications of preventive health services on economic performance and the population's wellbeing. Methods: We develop the economic growth model to undertake health-economic analyses and parameterize for Taiwan setting. Based on the US experiences over the period from 1975 to 2013, this research further examines the model's predictions on the relationship between preventive health expenditure and economic performance. Results: Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that an inverse U-shaped relationship exists between the proportion of GDP spent on prevention and social welfare, as well as between the proportion spent on prevention and economic growth. Empirical analysis shows an under-investment in prevention in Taiwan. The spending of preventive healthcare in Taiwan government was 0.0027 GDP in 2014, while the optimization levels for economic development and social welfare would be 0 . 0119 and 0 . 0203, respectively. There is a statistically significant nonlinear relationship between health expenditure on prevention and the estimated real impact of economic performance from US experiences. The welfare-maximizing proportion of preventive expenditure is usually greater than the proportion maximizing economic growth, indicating a conflict between economic growth and welfare after a marginal share. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that it is worthwhile increasing investment on prevention up until an optimization level for economic development and social welfare. Such levels could also be estimated in other economies.","[Wang, Fuhmei] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Publ Hlth, Dept Econ, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Res Ctr Energy Technol & Strategy, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Wang, Jung-Der] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Huang, Yu-Xiu] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Dept Econ, Tainan 701, Taiwan",National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University; National Cheng Kung University,"Wang, JD (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Res Ctr Energy Technol & Strategy, Tainan 701, Taiwan.;Wang, JD (通讯作者)，Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Dept Publ Hlth, Tainan 701, Taiwan.",jdwang121@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-006 -086, MOST104-2410-H-006-109, MOST104-2314-B-006-023, MOST105-2410-H-006-091]; Ministry of Education, Taiwan, The Aim for the Top University Project to the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Ministry of Education, Taiwan, The Aim for the Top University Project to the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)","This work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan (Grant no.

Framed as a technologically driven and economically profitable vision of continued growth in a resource-scarce world, the CE has of late been taken up by the European Commission and global business leaders alike. However, within CE debates and documentation, little is said about the social and political implications of such transformative agendas. Whilst CE proponents claim their agenda is 'radical', this paper outlines its inability to address many deeply embedded challenges around issues of consumption and the consumer, echoing as it does the problematic (and arguably failed) agendas of sustainable consumption/lifestyles. Using the Sharing Economy as an example, we argue here that the ontological and sociological assumptions of the CE must be open to more 'radical' critique and reconsideration if this agenda is to deliver the profound transformations that its advocates claim are within our collective reach.

The analysis, grounded on thematic interviews and surveys on both sides of the border, identifies some of the critical events of mis- and non-communication that deepened the disagreement between the neighbors. Likewise, it examines the extent to which the dispute has changed popular imageries of the neighboring nation and provided ground for the reproduction of negative stereotypes and defensive nationalisms. The case study offers an example of unruly amplification of decisive acts of neglect and provocations in an international interface setting, and thus provides conceptual tools for socio-environmental conflict researchers concerned with dissociations and non-linkages in contemporary globalization.

Although most states have successfully implemented their respective systems, research on early funding models suggests a difficult fiscal environment can introduce tension between theory and practice of the concept. This policy brief uses the case of Washington State's redesign of the Student Achievement Initiative to describe new implications around this tension. The revision focused on using a base reallocation as the funding source in the context of diminished state resources and the importance of college buy-in. Regression analyses tested the alignment between the principles and metrics for awarding funds, which resulted in a funding model that awarded the maximum dollars related to performance versus college characteristics.

The study also analyses the perception-reality gap in financial literacy and the attitude of young adults towards financial education. Primary data collected using a structured questionnaire from 736 young adults is used in this study. Statistical techniques such as analysis of variance and chi-square test are employed to analyse the data. The findings reveal that the financial literacy in Kerala is low, with an average young adult answering only 44% of the questions correctly. The study finds that gender, marital status, age, religion, education, the discipline of study, occupation, work experience, income, and parents' education and their occupation influence financial literacy. It is also observed that respondents tend to overrate their financial literacy by around 50%, indicating their over-confidence in the knowledge of matters related to personal finance. However, a majority of the respondents (89%) expressed the need for financial education for young adults. This study, hence calls for initiatives to improve financial literacy among young adults in Kerala and for further research in this direction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

I analyze the effect that pharmaceutical innovation had on premature cancer mortality in Switzerland during the period 1995-2012 by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in premature mortality, controlling for the number of people diagnosed and mean age at diagnosis. Premature cancer mortality before ages 75 and 65 is significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered 5, 10, and 15 years earlier. The number of drugs registered during 1980-1997 explains 63 % of the variation across cancer sites in the 1995-2012 log change in the premature (before age 75) mortality rate. Controlling for the cumulative number of drugs, the cumulative number of chemical subgroups does not have a statistically significant effect on premature mortality. This suggests that drugs (chemical substances) within the same class (chemical subgroup) are not therapeutically equivalent. Over 17,000 life-years before age 75 were gained in 2012 due to drugs registered during 1990-2007. The number of life-years before age 75 gained in 2012 from drugs registered during two earlier periods (1985-2002 and 1980-1997) were more than twice as great. Since mean utilization of new drugs is much lower than mean utilization of older drugs, more recent drug registrations may have a smaller effect on premature mortality than earlier drug registrations even if the average quality of newer drugs is higher. Estimates of the cost per life-year gained before ages 75 and 65 in 2012 from drugs registered during 1990-2007 are $21,228 and $28,673, respectively. These figures are below even the lowest estimates from the value-of-life literature of the value of a quality-adjusted life-year. The estimates indicate that the cost per life-year before age 75 gained from drugs registered during earlier periods (1985-2002 and 1980-1997) were considerably lower: $5299 and $3218, respectively. The largest reductions in premature mortality occur at least a decade after drugs are registered, when their utilization increases significantly. This suggests that if Switzerland is to obtain substantial additional reductions in premature cancer mortality in the future (a decade or more from now) at a modest cost, pharmaceutical innovation (registration of new drugs) is needed today.","[Lichtenberg, Frank R.] Columbia Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Lichtenberg, Frank R.] CESifo, New York, NY 10031 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; Columbia University,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，CESifo, New York, NY 10031 USA.",frank.lichtenberg@columbia.edu,,,,,,,19,13,14,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

We examine how the threat of such a shift alters the strategic management of a common pool renewable resource. We consider exogenous and endogenous threats and examine their effects on both incentives to join a coalition and harvest decisions. We find that an exogenous threat of reduced resource growth may cause the coalition to grow in size, and, perhaps of most interest, we identify conditions under which members of the stable coalition reduce harvest while non-members increase harvest in response to the threat. In contrast, an exogenous threat of total stock collapse may destabilize coalitions, resulting in higher harvest from former members, but reduced harvest by non-members. When the threat of either type of shift is endogenous, the threat of regime shift can induce stable coalitions with more than two members.

While past studies have exemplified the causal link to be small, albeit statistically significant, this paper aims to estimate the causal effect to investigate whether the effect of income after controlling for the endogeneity remains small in the long run. By correcting for the bias, and knowing the bias direction, one can also infer about the underlying backward effect. Design and setting: This paper uses an instrument variables two-stage-least-squares estimation on the Young Lives 2009 cross-sectional dataset from Andhra Pradesh, India, to understand the aforementioned relationship. Results: The selected measure of household economic standing differentially affects the estimation. There is significant positive effect of both short-run household expenditure and long-run household wealth on child stunting, with the latter having a larger impact. The backward link running from child health to household income is likely an inverse association in our sample with lower child health inducing higher earnings. While higher average community education improved child health, increased community entertainment expenditure is found to have a negative effect. Conclusion: While policies catered towards improving household wealth will decrease child stunting in the long run, maternal education and the community play an equally reinforcing role in improving child health and are perhaps faster routes to achieving the goal of better child health in the short run.","[Fakir, Adnan M.

High rates of forest loss can be attributed to failure by policies to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. It is argued that in most Least Developed Countries such as Zambia, adopted forest and natural resources policies are rarely put into effect resulting in ecosystem degradation. This study examined policy actor's perception of implementation of policies aimed at reducing deforestation and forest degradation and their implications for forest resources. To examine policy implementation, 55 policy actors were interviewed at national, regional and local levels. This included government officials, Non-Governmental Organisations, traditional leaders and local people. Interviews were analysed using discourse analysis. Findings show that policy implementations deficits are prevalent in Zambia's forest sector. Policy actors-identified the main barriers as inadequate institutional capacity, inadequate legal framework, political influences, insecure land tenure, poor funding, and lack of intersectoral coordination. The paper has shown gaps between policies and their implementation. To halt deforestation and forest degradation, it is imperative that formulated policies are implemented. This will require improved communication and coordination among government units and various stakeholders, sufficient resources and harmonizing policies and legal frameworks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As such, the essay raises issues that are inherent in modelling and simulation now and others that are likely to in the future. The emphasis will be on the ubiquity of modelling and simulation, and not on any instance of its practice. It does not describe the outcome of a particular research project but describes situations that are likely to face modelling and simulation as the polity searches for guidance, no more, on the degree of relevance, reasonableness and robustness modelling, and simulation may offer on the conduct of life in a world now showing signs of overcrowding. The polity often assumes that modelling and simulation represent reality more closely than they actually do leading to important differences between the real world occupied by all life on Earth and the world portrayed by models and simulations. The rapid advance of computer power has led to increasingly complicated models whatever their form. The boundary between complication and complexity is fuzzy, but once crossed the guidance sought from modelling and simulation becomes increasingly opaque. Complexity involves dynamic interactions (situations) between six themes (social, technology, economics, ecology, politics and values/norms (the STEEPV acronym)) creating the notion of convergence related to situations. The essay makes reference to convergence of nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive sciences (NBIC) that has led to ideas of improving human performance. In reality NBIC is not about nanotechnology, which is not a unified field, but about the convergence of many threads of science, technology and engineering, and society. Models and simulations have played such an extraordinary but largely unnoticed part in this convergence that they may be regarded as the convergence and that its progress depends upon them. Perhaps there are no better examples than the penetration of mathematics and computable models into biology and living systems. If human performance can be improved its genesis will lie there providing the real world allows convergence in desirable ways rather than expecting the natural world to become obedient to computable, partial models.

Therefore an alternative understanding of scientific knowledge transfer is suggested: In the RIU-model, scientific knowledge is produced in the science system (Research), and science-based problem solutions are utilized within politics by political actors (Utilization). Between the two spheres there is no automatic connection that leads to a linear application of science in policy making. Rather, it highlights the important sphere of integration, a step that lies between science and utilization. Integration means the orientation of research toward political and practical problems with the aim to describe and solve them (Integration). By the example of a German case study (activities of the German federal environment agency in waste policy) it will be shown (1) what important integration measures are, and (2) how they lead to science-based policy advice that matters in policy making.

The Commission suggested that government subsidies had only delayed car plant closures and reiterated its longstanding opposition to industry policy and redistributive regional adjustment programmes by government. Industrialists, employer associations, state governments and trade unions have, however, questioned the Commission's forecasts for both economic spillover effects and social impacts in regions affected by automotive plant closures. In addition to challenging several underlying assumptions used to calculate the Productivity Commission's forecasts, this article argues that insufficient attention has been paid to the quality of future work.

At various junctures of these relations (three of which are analysed in this article), turgid European promises were not fully realized. Consequently, a wide gap has been created between rhetoric and concrete actions and between the de jure and de facto economic and trade value of the legal regimes governing EU-Israel bilateral relations.

The need for revision emerged from societal changes manifested through the changing objectives of private forest owners, increasing and diversifying demands for forest goods and services and increasing number of stakeholders, as well as the changes in the forest sector operational environment that relate to the globalisation of markets and influences of international policies. Advocacy Coalition Framework guided this study to identify and describe the belief structures and coordination of advocacy coalitions in the Finnish forest sector in the context of the revision of the Forest Act. Three coalitions were identified on the basis of policy core beliefs and coordination between actors: Forestry coalition and Administrative coalition derive their normative beliefs from the forest paradigm, whereas Environmental coalition derives its beliefs from the environmental paradigm. The differences deriving from the two different paradigms have led to polarised coordination patterns between rival coalitions, minimal communication channels between opponents and a long-term disagreement about major questions in the subsystem. Interestingly, the government seems to have a divided representation in forest policy, since Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and Ministry of Environment contribute via different coalitions. In the future, the success of Finnish forest sector depends on how well it is able to combine different preconditions deriving from these two paradigms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The present study investigates the effect of the proportion of privately insured patients on the density of SHI-licensed physicians, while controlling for regional variations in the average income from SHI patients. Methods The proportion of residents in a district with private health insurance is estimated using complete administrative data from the SHI system and the German population census. Missing values are estimated using multiple imputation techniques. All models control for the estimated average income ambulatory physicians generate from treating SHI insured patients and a well-defined set of covariates on the level of districts in Germany in 2010. Results Our results show that every percentage change in the proportion of residents with private health insurance is associated with increases of 2.1 and 1.3 % in the density of specialists and GPs respectively. Higher SHI income in rural areas does not compensate for this effect. Conclusion From a financial perspective, it is rational for a physician to locate a new practice in a district with a high proportion of privately insured patients. From the perspective of patients in the SHI system, the incentive effects of PHI presumably contribute to a concentration of health care services in wealthy and urban areas. To date, the needs-based planning mechanism has been unable to address this imbalance.","[Sundmacher, Leonie; Ozegowski, Susanne] Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Ozegowski, Susanne] BMC EV, Friedrichstr 36, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",University of Munich,"Sundmacher, L (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich Sch Management, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Schackstr 4, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",sundmacher@bwl.lmu.de,"Sundmacher, Leonie/B-7696-2016",,,,,,35,15,16,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Based on data gathered by EU Delegations from competent authorities in partner countries, this article is the first of its kind to analyse the uptake of preferences by EU exports in these markets. Overall, the preference utilization rate (PUR) stood at about 7 5% in 2013, up from 63% in 2009, albeit with a changing country coverage over the years. The PURs vary signcantly by originating EU Member State (MS) and by broad product group. EU export flows of low values make relatively good use of preferences as opposed to low value exports from developing countries to developed countries, which is something the literature has pointed to.

The empirical analysis examines the extent to which the PUR is influenced by the preferential margin, the value of exports and potential duty savings.","[Nilsson, Lars] European Commiss Directorate Gen Trade, Chief Economist & Trade Anal Unit, Brussels, Belgium",,"Nilsson, L (通讯作者)，European Commiss Directorate Gen Trade, Chief Economist & Trade Anal Unit, Brussels, Belgium.",lars.nilsson@ec.europa.eu,,"Nilsson, Lars/0000-0003-0012-1753",,,,,13,11,11,0,1,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We introduce a novel experimental design that attempts to disentangle potential confounds in previous experiments. A key feature of our experimental design is to have the exact same regulations chosen endogenously as those that are imposed exogenously. When we compare the same regulations chosen endogenously to those externally imposed, we observe no differences in extraction levels among CPR users in a laboratory experiment. We also observe no differences between weak external regulations and no regulations, after controlling for a potential confound. However, when we add communication to our endogenous treatment, we observe significant behavioral differences between endogenous regulations with communication and exogenous regulations without communication. Our results suggest that externally imposed regulations do not crowd out intrinsic motivations in the lab and they confirm that communication facilitates cooperation to reduce extraction.

It uses descriptive and econometric analysis to determine the relationship between the level of protection from the market of regional economies in the years of economic boom between 1995 and 2007 and employment trends in the first 4 years of the crisis (2008-2012). The analysis covers 272 NUTS2-level regions in 27 EU countries. The results of the analysis show that regions which had developed more sheltered economies during the boom years have not weathered the employment shock associated with the crisis well, while pre-crisis dynamism in employment generation has been connected to lower during-crisis employment destruction. The only exceptions are the most highly sheltered economies in the pre-crisis period, which have endured a lower level of job destruction than any other type of region. The question is whether this early resistance to job destruction can be maintained once the recovery starts.","[Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fratesi, U (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.;Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",ugo.fratesi@polimi.it; a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X",European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [269868],European Research Council under the European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We would like to thank the editors in charge as well as three anonymous reviewers for incisive and useful changes to earlier versions of the paper.

The willingness of government to hold control over forest resources while transferring only part of property rights to local communities is one of the major constraints. Therefore, there is a need to explore alternative approaches, which enhance the position and accountability of local communities in community forest management. This study evaluated socio-economic and ecological outcomes of community forestry in a context of important property rights conceded to local communities. The study was conducted using focus groups discussions, forest income evaluation and assessment of forest resources and their dynamics. Findings showed that institutional design with important property rights conceded to local communities partially empowered local communities and reduced threats while improving the condition of forest resources. The approach also yielded positive economic outcomes that enabled bordering populations to make up to 25% of their global annual income from the forest. However, the sustainability of this scheme of forest management was mostly limited by the financial dependency on local non-governmental organization, by local institutions and discrepancy in forest benefits sharing among local forest users.

Using longitudinal survey and transcript data, this study examines whether taking these applied STEM courses in high school can predict higher odds of declaring a STEM major in college. The findings reveal that taking applied STEM courses in high school is associated with a higher probability of declaring a STEM college major for four-year students. Moreover, applied STEM course-taking is highly predictive of declaring an applied STEM major.

In contrast, mainstream studies running national time series have generally decomposed the growth of health-care spending into observables and non observables (a mixture of technological progress and the cost disease), thus ignoring the separate contribution of the cost disease. But progress is something good, while rent may be viewed as being wasted in the system and is to be avoided. It is important to separate the two. This paper uses a new (Hartwig-Colombier) method to decompose the growth rate of provincial per capita health-care spending in Canada over the period 1982-2011 into the contributions of the cost disease, traditional observable variables, and technological progress. Based on extensive robustness analysis across a variety of specifications, estimation methods, and two separate data sets, we find that the cost disease (rent extracting) is a relatively minor contributor, while technical progress in health care and growth in per capita incomes are by far the biggest contributors to the secular growth in health-care spending in Canada.","[Rossen, Bradley; Faroque, Akhter] Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada",Laurentian University,"Faroque, A (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Dept Econ, Sudbury, ON P3E 2C6, Canada.",afaroque@laurentian.ca,"PAN, ZEQIANG/X-6341-2018",,,,,,39,2,2,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

In addition to the renowned equity principles severity of illness (operationalized as initial health) and fair innings (operationalized as age), some characteristics of beneficiaries (culpability and having dependents) and the disease (rarity) were included in the choice experiment. We used a nested logit model to analyse the data. We found that all selected attributes significantly influenced respondents' choices. The phased inclusion showed that additional attributes affected respondents' preferences for previously-included attributes and reduced unobserved variance.

Uncertainty or sudden societal opposition might politically be employed to dismantle earlier made policies or investments and therefore threaten longterm adaptive capacity. This article highlights how successful long-term decision-making can be understood as a matter of puzzling over uncertainty and powering for getting things done, but above all requires sustainment of these decisions on the long term. For doing so the paper analyses the decision-making process of the Dutch Delta Committee in 2008, which firmly put the climate adaptation issue on the Dutch political agenda and subsequently sustained the issue on the policy agenda through the creation of a Delta Commissioner, a Delta Fund and a Delta Act. Our analysis illustrates how the crucial actors in and around the Second Delta Committee deployed strategies of puzzling, powering, and what we define as perpetuation to deal with the long-term policy issue of climate adaptation. The latter is especially important for policy issues that require a long-term continued effort by policy-makers, or will only manifest themselves on the long term. Then, it is not only important to create meaning and organize power now, but also to maintain and ensure that meaning and power for time to come. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On the other hand, the issue of budget deficit was introduced in economic literature since 1980s. Within this decade, current budget deficit significantly increased in the USA. Emerging of this phenomenon prompted many economists to establish public sector as the macroeconomic unbalancing factor, on the contrary to Keynesy who regarded public sector as the balance factor, particularly in developing countries since developing countries deal with specific problems such as foreign debt, high inflation, difficulties of payment balances, exchange parallel markets as well as various external shocks. Therefore, this research tried to study the effect of growth, efficiency and government budget deficit in MENA selected countries within 2000-2013 by using the recommended static panel models. Results of the estimated relations for the first model in which government budget deficit is the dependent variable indicate positive effect of economic growth and inflation rate variables as well as the negative effect of labor productivity and government budget deficit. Moreover, the second model in which economic growth is the dependent variable demonstrates the positive effect of labor productivity index and economic growth. In addition, negative correlation of government budget deficit with economic growth is also maintained. (C) 2016 The Authors.

One of the key essentials to keep organizations in the present economic competition is effective management of their supply chains under uncertainty. The concept of supply chain flexibility intends to specify the ability of a supply chain to perform in satisfaction under uncertainty. However, there is lack of cause and effect modelling in this area. Accordingly, this paper attempts to study the flexibility capabilities of IT-based supply chain, using a Grey-based DEMATEL Method. To this end, according to the literature, four main factors were identified as most important flexibility capabilities of IT-based supply chain which totally include 25 measurement items. Next, to evaluate the cause and effect relationships of factors an online questionnaire link distributed to professors and experts in this subject which finally 20 completed questionnaires collected. To analyze factors interactions using Grey-based DEMATEL method, firstly, experts' opinions of grey numbers are turned into crisp numbers and all opinions are unified into a single viewpoint. Then the crisp numbers normalized in DEMATEL and total matrix of each factor is calculated. At the end, the values of R, D, R+D and R-D are calculated, which based on these criteria the cause and effect relationships of factors analyzed and flexibility capabilities of IT-based supply chain prioritized.

This 'neuromolecular gaze' [Rose, N. & Abi-Rached, J. (2013) Neuro: The New Brain Sciences and the Management of the Mind, Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ] also heralds new ways of intervening in the regulation of social phenomena, based on the objectification of the cerebral processes that underlie individual conducts. Neuroeconomics applies this brain-centric perspective to the study of economic decision-making. This paper engages with the two dominant approaches in neuroeconomics. The first section concentrates on the work of Paul Glimcher, who considers economic models and their correlative notion of (utility maximization' as providing the neurosciences with a theoretical framework as to how the brain solves decision problems. The second section discusses the findings of behavioural neuroeconomics, which attempts to model departures from the rationality axiom by measuring the cognitive and emotional biases that have their sources in the brain's complex architecture. Whereas both strands of neuroeconomics rely on a benchmark of economic rationality, this paper argues that they reformulate in allegedly neutral neuroscientific terms a behavioural norm that is basically moral in nature. If rational decision-making conditions economic and indeed evolutionary survival, and yet if most people regularly fail as utility optimizers, then understanding the neural causes of such failures should help people better themselves and behave as good homines aeconomici.","[Bissonnette, Jean Francois] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Sophiapol, Paris, France",Universite Paris Nanterre,"Bissonnette, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Def, Sophiapol, Paris, France.",jfbissonnette@u-paris10.fr,,,Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture [148069],Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture,This work was supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Quebec-Societe et Culture [grant number 148069].,,52,1,1,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

While India experienced widespread famines with surprising regularity in the past, independent India can he said to have avoided that. However, hunger and malnutrition have continued to plague India to this day, despite the dramatic improvements in its economic growth in recent decades. This chapter examines the evolution of India's food economy and its administration since independence in some of its relevant aspects. Its purpose is to understand the underlying issues by identifying the factors and forces responsible for the unresolved problem of India's food and nutrition insecurity and its concomitant, the widespread maternal and child undernutrition. It looks at the current situation in respect of the availability and affordability of food, and how they affect people at different levels of affluence in both rural and urban India. It then turns to the examination of food and nutrition policies and their interaction with poverty, its measurement and alleviation. The passing of the National Food Security Act in 2013, guaranteeing access to food as a right, is discussed next to assess how its provisions might influence India's quest for greater food and nutrition security. The chapter finishes on some general observations on the food sector of the Indian economy.","[Chatterjee, Srikanta] Massey Univ, Econ, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Massey University,"Chatterjee, S (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Econ, Palmerston North, New Zealand.",S.Chatterjee@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,79,106,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_5,0.0,,,28,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800005,0

Students learn about specific issues in land conservation, ecosystem services, preferences for nonmoney outcomes, and general issues in policymaking.

In the first attempt to answer the primary question of our research, we applied the comparison evaluation via multiple methods in order to assess the relative value of the all 5 FICs (SIFs) listed on the Romanian Bucharest Stock Exchange, based on fundamental parameters of the analysis. One answer to the question of our research is that ROE and ROA multiples are the independent variables that best explains the relative valuation differences between the 5 FICs (SIFs). Then, we further approach the second part of the research question trying to identify any possible statistical relationships between multiples relative evaluation and the fundamental factors that feasibly influence these multiples. We analyzed nine regression equations between the three multiples (EV/EBITDA; P/E and Price/Book) and three of their possible independent fundamental factors (MktCap; Tax Rate; ROA; ROE and Reinvestment Rate). We performed our analysis for all 5 FICs (SIFs). Correlation between multiple fundamental factors suggests that the most significant are their relations with rates of return (ROA and ROE), and with the rate of reinvestment of net profit (ReinvRate). The negative correlation between the EV/EBITDA multiple and P/E multiple, on the one hand, and the ROE and ReinvRate, on the other hand, is explained by the fact that the profits number of the two multiples are included as denominator of the ratios of these multiples.","[Dragoi, Bogdan Alexandru] SIF Banat Crisana, Arad, Romania; [Stancu, Ion; Mitroi, Adrian] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Stancu, Andrei Tudor] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Business Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; University of East Anglia,"Dragoi, BA (通讯作者)，SIF Banat Crisana, Arad, Romania.",bogdan.dragoi@sifl.ro; ion.stancu@ase.ro; adrian.mitroi@fin.ase.ro; stancudoru@yahoo.com,,,,,,,6,0,3,0,20,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Alongside morality and ethics, transparency is part of the aggregate of principles lying at the heart of authentic corporate governance, and it also accounts for one of the primary means to level informational asymmetry. It is meant to capitalize on entities credibility by ensuring a convergence between their actions and statements since its foundation implies a trustworthy presentation of reality, without distorting, much less manipulating it. It's the management, responsible for guaranteeing 'a half open book' in relation to the activity undertaken by entities, the one which, by means of its conduct, has to take into account both the dissemination side of transparency throughout the relationship with stakeholders and the legislative framework, which regulates the activity of entities and provides them with rather coercive indications towards the path to follow. In a similar vein, the management is also expected to furnish an intrinsic confidentiality, necessary to advance within an extremely competitive environment. In this complex context, our present paper, by using objective study and in-depth research as well as objective methods of observation and comparative analysis, aims to evaluate the extent to which universities in Romania develop their activity in transparency conditions. Our research will consider the transparency entailed by sessions which address entity dynamics, the issuing of financial statements and indispensable revelations. Furthermore, we will take into consideration the information related to our activity results as well as reports on management, wealth statements, personnel policy, and the acquisitions made. We will equally attempt to analyze the impact generated by applying or not the principle of transparency to the entities assessed and to dare to bring forth some recommendations in order to displace opacity from entities activity.","[Dragomir, Isabela Victoria; Avram, Marioara; Domnisoru, Sorinel; Baluna, Radu Nicolae] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Dragomir, IV (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania.",,"Baluna, Radu/S-1319-2019; Dragomir, Victoria Isabela M/S-8908-2017",,,,,,5,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,35,42,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100005,0

Here we study a multi-curve extension of short rate models where, in addition to the short rate itself, we introduce short rate spreads. In particular, we consider a Gaussian factor model where the short rate and the spreads are second order polynomials of Gaussian factor processes. This leads to an exponentially quadratic model class that is less well known than the exponentially affine class. In the latter class the factors enter linearly and for positivity one considers square root factor processes. While the square root factors in the affine class have more involved distributions, in the quadratic class the factors remain Gaussian and this leads to various advantages, in particular for derivative pricing. After some preliminaries on martingale modeling in the multi-curve setup, we concentrate on pricing of linear and optional derivatives. For linear derivatives, we exhibit an adjustment factor that allows one to pass from pre-crisis single curve values to the corresponding post-crisis multi-curve values.","[Grbac, Zorana] Univ Paris Diderot Paris 7, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, Case 7012, F-75205 Paris 13, France; [Meneghello, Laura; Runggaldier, Wolfgang J.] Univ Padua, Dipartimento Matemat Pura & Applicata, Via Trieste 63, I-35121 Padua, Italy",Universite Paris Cite; University of Padua,"Grbac, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Diderot Paris 7, Lab Probabilites & Modeles Aleatoires, Case 7012, F-75205 Paris 13, France.",grbac@math.univ-paris-diderot.fr; meneghello.laura@yahoo.com; runggal@math.unipd.it,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,0,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,191,226,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_10,0.0,,,36,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500010,0

The basic premise of the study is that the very act of establishing a research design entails a process involving a series of valuations where different values are evoked, ordered, and displaced. In focus is the articulation and ordering of what counts as central values in research design for two kinds of biomedical treatment trials, namely the traditional randomised controlled trial (RCT) and the emerging new form of biomarker trials used to assess biomarker/treatment combinations (BTTs). The empirical material consists of textbooks (RCTs) and journal articles (BTTs). We ask how these materials articulate the various scientific, medical, and economic values at play. Among the differences uncovered are a difference in relation to what counts as ethical in relation to prior knowledge, differences in the flexibility in design as well as the valuation of the risk for false positives and false negatives. More broadly, the study shows how textual accounts of different ways of producing knowledge are linked to partly different valuations of ethics, flexibility, and risk as part of establishing the research design of biomedical experiments.","[Helgesson, Claes-Fredrik; Lee, Francis; Linden, Lisa] Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Linkoping, Sweden",Linkoping University,"Helgesson, CF (通讯作者)，Linkoping Univ, Dept Themat Studies Technol & Social Change, Linkoping, Sweden.",claes-fredrik.helgesson@liu.se,"Helgesson, Claes-Fredrik/A-7326-2011; Lindén, Lisa/AAC-8952-2022; Lee, Francis/ABF-4731-2020","Helgesson, Claes-Fredrik/0000-0002-6074-6088; Lindén, Lisa/0000-0001-9816-7164; Lee, Francis/0000-0002-7206-2046",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond,Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"This paper reports a sub-study within the larger project `Trials of Value' where Helgesson and Lee investigate the valuations performed in the designing of different kinds of experiments in medicine and biomedicine.

The purpose is to describe the methodological principles of the tool and to put it into use by calculating and comparing the costs attributable to overweight for The Netherlands, Germany and Czech Republic. The tool uses a top-down and prevalence-based approach, consisting of five steps. Step one identifies overweight-related diseases and age-and gender-specific relative risks. Included diseases are ischemic heart disease, stroke, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, colorectal cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer, kidney cancer and osteoarthritis. Step two consists of collecting data on the age-and gender-specific prevalence of these diseases. Step three uses the population-attributable prevalence to determine the part of the prevalence of these diseases that is attributable to overweight. Step four calculates the health care costs associated with these diseases. Step five calculates the costs of these diseases that are attributable to overweight. Overweight is responsible for 20-26 % of the direct costs of included diseases, with sensitivity analyses varying this percentage between 15-31 %. Percentage of costs attributable to obesity and preobesity is about the same. Diseases with the highest percentage of costs due to overweight are diabetes, endometrial cancer and osteoarthritis. Disease costs attributable to overweight as a percentage of total health care expenditures range from 2 to 4 %. Data are consistent for all three countries, resulting in roughly a quarter of costs of included diseases being attributable to overweight.","[Lette, M.; Bemelmans, W. J. E.; Slobbe, L. C.

Information asymmetry showed no conspicuous variations with greater transparency. However, after further grouping, the empirical results revealed that increased transparency facilitated a decrease in information asymmetry in the sub-samples, which originally exhibited greater information asymmetry. In addition, the intraday patterns of probability of informed trading revealed that greater transparency facilitates decreased market information asymmetry after opening.","[Lin, Yaling] I Shou Univ, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",I Shou University,"Lin, YL (通讯作者)，1,Sec 1,Syuecheng Rd, Kaohsiung 840, Taiwan.",auswa@isu.edu.tw,,,,,,,22,2,2,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The focus of this paper was on the process of economic localisation as a driver towards a more responsible economic model. The aims of the paper were to consider the limitations of the dominant economic concept, to discuss the concept of economic localisation and to analyse the process of economic localisation in Croatia. The empirical research was aimed to map different grassroots initiatives related with economic localisation developed in the last decade in Croatia. The main criteria were their contribution to the transition towards sustainable economy. The research has shown different initiatives at the local levels that are already contributing to a creation of more resilient and sustainable local communities. Although those initiatives currently have small impact at the national level, they are clear indicators of potentials that sustainable economy in Croatia could have.","[Rakitovac, Kristina Afric] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Rakitovac, KA (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula, Croatia.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,277,284,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100037,0

Despite the world economy globalization, which gives a comparative advantage by reducing transport and transaction costs, the development of the economy competitiveness is becoming an increasingly important separate institutional form of economic potential concentration. The article analyzes the cluster as an institutional form that has an impact on regional economic development at the stage of re industrialization. There is an active policy for the creation of regional clusters in the Russian economy. It is expected that such institutional arrangements provide for innovative regions development in conditions of re-industrialization economy. Experience shows that businesses tend to cluster in certain regions. This is due to the benefits that arise from geographical concentration and from the region's specialization in certain types of activities. There is an opinion, that the enterprises included in the regional cluster structure have higher economic performance. The analysis suggests that not all existing clusters influence the development of innovations in the region, and the analysis forecast for the clusters development shows that the most significant indicator of the cluster influence to the region is the revenue, which forms the GRP structure. It is concluded that the cluster is an efficient tool for territory development.","[Shevchenko, Inna; Razvadovskaya, Yuliya; Khanina, Anna] Southern Fed Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia",Southern Federal University,"Shevchenko, I (通讯作者)，Southern Fed Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia.",,"Shevchenko, Inna K/N-8184-2015",,Russian Foundation for Humanities research project [15-02-00344],Russian Foundation for Humanities research project,"The publication was prepared within the framework of the Russian Foundation for Humanities, research project No. 15-02-00344.

The constraint on the foreign interest rates is modelled using new computational tool DynareOBC designed and created by Tom Holden. In the second part of our analysis we deal with the foreign capital flows that are implied by the interest rate differential. Czech National Bank uses a nominal exchange rate as an unconventional monetary policy instrument. Stable level of exchange rate may attract foreign investors and that generates pressure on appreciation of the FX rate and the central bank must intervene.

Several simulations were carried out to build an optimal model, whose efficiency is evaluated with the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error), obtained comparing simulated and observed values. Subsequently, the developed neuro-fuzzy model was applied to generate other weather variables, such as relative humidity, solar radiation and wind velocity.

However, usually for simplicity the correlation coefficient is assumed to be a constant in many models, although financial quantities are correlated in a strongly nonlinear way in the real market. This work provides a new time-dependent correlation function, which can be easily used to construct dynamically (time-dependent) correlated Brownian motions and flexibly incorporated in many financial models. The aim of using our time-dependent correlation function is to reasonably choose additional parameters to increase the fitting quality on the one hand, but also add an economic concept on the other hand. As examples, we illustrate the applications of dynamic correlation in the Heston model. From our numerical results we conclude that the Heston model extended by incorporating time-dependent correlations can provide a better volatility smile than the pure Heston model.","[Teng, L.; Ehrhardt, M.; Guenther, M.] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Fak Math & Nat Wissensch, Lehrstuhl Angew Math & Numer Anal, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Wuppertal,"Teng, L (通讯作者)，Berg Univ Wuppertal, Fak Math & Nat Wissensch, Lehrstuhl Angew Math & Numer Anal, Gaussstr 20, D-42119 Wuppertal, Germany.",teng@math.uni-wuppertal.de; ehrhardt@math.uni-wuppertal.de; guenther@math.uni-wuppertal.de,"Teng, Long/AFR-5264-2022","Teng, Long/0000-0002-1540-621X",European Union in the FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN Program [304617],European Union in the FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN Program,"The work was partially supported by the European Union in the FP7-PEOPLE-2012-ITN Program under Grant Agreement Number 304617 (FP7 Marie Curie Action, Project Multi-ITN STRIKE-Novel Methods in Computational Finance).",,14,4,4,1,1,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2194-1009,,978-3-319-33446-2; 978-3-319-33445-5,SPRINGER P MATH STAT,,,2016,165,,,,,,437,449,,10.1007/978-3-319-33446-2_21,0.0,,,13,Economics; Mathematics; Statistics & Probability,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BM3QG,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000462538500021,0

The developments regarding foreign-currency mortgage loans, popular in Central and Eastern Europe in recent years, illustrate how incorrect mortgage choices may have detrimental effects on borrowers and their families. Taking a sceptical approach toward mandated pre-contractual disclosure as a protection measure for borrowers, the paper advocates neutral counselling of mortgage applicants in case they are offered risky types of mortgages. Drawing on the experience of an American mortgage counselling programme, a set of recommendations is made regarding the design of a possible neutral mortgage counselling scheme.

Drawing on eight years of field research, we compare the engagement of shifting networks of Russian private sector, NGO, governmental and local community actors in implementing select social and environmental standards and how this impacts the effectiveness of the FSC in tackling local community and environmental concerns. Our case study suggests that much of the parameter-setting for what is addressed in certification's sites of implementation happens outside of formal standards-setting processes. In regard to environmental standards, strong and stable transnational environmental networks have been relatively successful in protecting high conservation value forests. However equivalent multi-level networks are lacking for key social standards. While a national social NGO has had some success in promoting procedural equity through community participation, we find no evidence that certification was addressing local community concerns for distributive equity.

In responding to labour market changes, declining union membership and hostile governments and employers, peak union bodies have developed new ways to strengthen the collective ability of their affiliated unions to successfully represent members at the workplace level. They have embraced local-level strategies that tap into community concerns and are aimed at capacity building across the labour movement. The resulting grass-roots organisations have the potential to shape both the workplace and the public domain. We explore one example of this approach: the establishment of Local Union Community Councils by Unions NSW. We argue that although peak bodies are well placed to spearhead community campaigning, the grass-roots councils being created will need to progress through several stages of development, if they are to become self-sustaining organisations, contributing effectively over the long term to community mobilisation and stronger, more coordinated union campaigns.","[Barnes, Alison; Balnave, Nikola] Macquarie Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University,"Balnave, N (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",nikki.balnave@mq.edu.au,,"Balnave, Nikola/0000-0003-3950-046X; Barnes, Alison/0000-0002-0920-2990",Macquarie University Faculty of Business and Economics Research Starter Grant [AUD5000],Macquarie University Faculty of Business and Economics Research Starter Grant,The research underpinning this article was funded by an AUD5000 Macquarie University Faculty of Business and Economics Research Starter Grant.,,44,5,5,1,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Individuals are allowed to respond to health shocks in two ways: They can directly pay for their health care expenses (self-insure) or they can rely on health insurance contracts. There are two possible insurance options, one through formal contracts and another through informal care provided by family. Formal contracts may be affected by asymmetric information problems whereas informal insurance depends on social ties (cohesion) and on bequeathable wealth. I estimate the model on SHARE data using simulated method of moments for four levels of wealth in a sample of single retired Europeans. Counterfactual experiments show that health, medical spending, and health insurance are indeed the main drivers of the slow wealth decumulation in old age. I also find that social cohesion rises with age, declines with wealth, and is higher in Mediterranean countries than in Central European and Scandinavian countries. Finally, high social cohesion appears typically associated with increased life expectancy.","[Dobrescu, Loretti I.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Dobrescu, Loretti I.] ARC Ctr Excellence Populat Ageing Res, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Dobrescu, LI (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Australian Sch Business, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW 2052, Australia.",dobrescu@unsw.edu.au,,"Dobrescu, Loretti Isabella/0000-0003-4533-9561","European Commission [SHARE-I3 RII-CT-2006-062193, COMPARE CIT5-CT-2005-028857]",European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Loretti I.

It presents the componential theory of learning in coaching and the underlying componential model of creative learning, highlighting some ideas and showing some possibilities of using them for creating and implementing a creative learning environment necessary for the success of both design and scenario work. The benefits of other methods and tools of educational science and psychology are also briefly described. Finally, possibilities arising from the new as well as the usual perspectives on design and scenario work for educational science and psychology - more precisely, coaching and creativity research - are dealt with. In the last section of the article, general principles used are highlighted and summarized. Some connections to fundamental questions of the role of sciences, arts, theory and practice as well as of the location of design and scenario work are discussed. Thereby, a possible solution to the related controversy is initially proposed. Overall, this article shows some of the areas in which educational science and psychology, on the one side, and design and scenario work, on the other, can be of mutual benefit. It aims to initiate further discussions about connections among the mentioned fields, and seeks to suggest some possibilities for interdisciplinary research and utilization of its results.

While educational opportunities for women, as well as political empowerment, are linked to a variety of positive outcomes, the impact of economic rights is mixed. Toward better understanding these issues, we focus on the role of women's rights in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI). Though foreign capital plays a key role in the development strategies of many countries, and many of the growth areas in FDI rely heavily on women's labor, extant literature on the determinants of FDI largely ignores gender. To gain insight into these issues, we examine the impact of women's political, economic, and educational rights across four different types of US FDI into the developing world. We find a mixed relationship between women's rights and FDI that varies across industrial sectors.","[Blanton, Robert G.] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA; [Blanton, Shannon Lindsey] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Honors Coll, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham,"Blanton, RG (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama Birmingham, 423 Heritage Hall, Birmingham, AL 35233 USA.",rgblanton@uab.edu; slblanton@uab.edu,,"Blanton, Shannon/0000-0001-5280-0454; Blanton, Robert/0000-0001-7667-2725",,,,,64,22,24,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In the case of the Mediterranean, most farms have their installations in coastal waters, hence this is relatively easy to perform. Low magnitude environmental conditions (winds, waves and currents) as well as easy and quick access ensures high consumption rates and smooth operation. Nevertheless, as competition for these waters increases the option of moving to offshore waters is seen as a solution. Moving further away from shore means exposing installations to harsher environments and lower degree of onshore monitoring. As a result, environmental conditions must now be monitored on-site, especially the ones affecting operations and feeding planning. For this reason, this article presents a feed management system powered by a stand-alone renewable energy sources system. The system provides energy independence and mobility by wirelessly transmitting important parameters onshore. An investment appraisal cost model is also described. The model compares the system's costs over the fish feed cost saved by a priori feeding planning through better monitoring of on-site conditions. It concludes that such synergies have profitable potentials.","[Vassiliou, Vassos; Charalambides, Marios; Menicou, Michalis; Chartosia, Niki] Frederick Res Ctr, CY-1036 Nicosia, Cyprus; [Tzen, Eftihia; Evagelos, Binopoulos; Papadopoulos, Panagiotis] Ctr Renewable Energy Sources & Saving, Wind Energy Dept, Pikermi, Greece; [Loucaides, Alexandros] Seawave Fisheries Ltd, Zygi, Larnaca, Cyprus",,"Vassiliou, V (通讯作者)，Frederick Res Ctr, 7 Yianni Frederickou Str, CY-1036 Nicosia, Cyprus.",eng.vv@fit.ac.cy,"Chartosia, Niki/AAR-2388-2020","Chartosia, Niki/0000-0002-3825-4722; Charalambides, Marios/0009-0002-6089-1434; Menicou, Michalis/0000-0003-3527-7619",Republic of Cyprus through the Research Promotion Foundation's DESMI; European Regional Development Fund of the EU,Republic of Cyprus through the Research Promotion Foundation's DESMI; European Regional Development Fund of the EU(European Union (EU)),This research was co-funded by the Republic of Cyprus through the Research Promotion Foundation's DESMI 2009-2010 call and the European Regional Development Fund of the EU,,31,11,11,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

In this paper, we study the effect of CMS-reported star ratings on MA plan enrollment. We formulate a discrete choice demand model for differentiated MA plans and estimate the model with market-level plan enrollment data. We identify separate enrollment effects for each star level using a regression discontinuity research design that exploits plausibly random variation around star thresholds. The results suggest that the 2009 published star ratings directed beneficiaries away from low-rated plans more than actively toward high-rated plans. When we repeat the analysis for 2010 published quality stars, we find no significant effects. We present suggestive evidence that supply-side responses to the star rating system may explain the one-time enrollment response to CMS-published quality stars.","[Darden, Michael] Tulane Univ, Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [McCarthy, Ian M.] Emory Univ, Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Tulane University; Emory University,"Darden, M (通讯作者)，Tulane Univ, Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA.",mdarden1@tulane.edu,,"McCarthy, Ian/0000-0001-7942-3468",,,,,28,18,26,0,18,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

We rely on data from the 2009 and 2010 survey waves of the German socio-economic panel (N = 12,000), including information on health-related, demographic and psychographic factors as well as monetary donation behavior and volunteer work. We propose a propensity score matching approach to control for the healthy donor effect related to the health requirements for active blood donations. We estimate two separate models and quantify selection biases between (1) active and inactive blood donors and (2) active donors and non-donors. Our results reveal that active donors are more satisfied with their health status; after controlling for selection effects, however, the differences become non-significant, revealing selection biases of up to 82 % compared with non-donors.

Our methodological approach reveals and quantifies selection biases attributable to the healthy donor effect. These biases are substantial enough to lead to erroneous statistical artifacts, implying that researchers should rigorously control for selection biases when comparing the health outcomes of different blood donor groups.","[Shehu, Edlira; Clement, Michel; Langmaack, Ann-Christin] Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Shehu, Edlira; Clement, Michel; Langmaack, Ann-Christin] Univ Hamburg, Res Ctr Hlth Mkt, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany; [Hofmann, Annette] Hamburg Inst Risk & Insurance, HSBA Hamburg Sch Business Adm, D-20457 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg; University of Hamburg,"Shehu, E (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Mkt, Welckerstr 8, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",edlira.shehu@uni-hamburg.de; Annette.Hofmann@hsba.de; michel.clement@uni-hamburg.de; ann-christin.langmaack@uni-hamburg.de,"Clement, Michel/GQQ-1785-2022","Clement, Michel/0000-0001-6769-6709; Shehu, Edlira/0000-0002-1807-0731",,,,,47,13,13,0,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The Test of Understanding in College Economics (TUCE) is used to measure learning outcomes. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) in-class demonstrations have a positive effect on student learning, with the exception of African-American students; (2) female students perform better having participated in online discussions; and (3) traditional pen-and-paper recitation questions teach to the test but do not impart as much economic intuition as the two alternative pedagogical methods.

Futures studies, while an eclectic multidisciplinary field, can reasonably be classified as primarily a social science and as such can involve human subjects in its research. Moreover much of the field is oriented toward applied, prescriptive pathways toward preferred futures that can involve influencing public policy and thus have significant social ramifications. This work investigates the extent to which futures studies research is involving human subjects, and, if so, whether informed consent practices are being applied to such futures studies research. The study proceeds to report the results of a poll of World Futures Studies Federation and Association of Professional Futurists members to gauge the nature of their research with emphasis on the use of human subjects and submission of proposed research to IRB evaluation. The piece concludes with a discussion on the expansion of the concept of informed consent to include engaging the public-at-large in the long-term effects of policy initiatives as a key element of the futures studies field and the representation of futures perspectives on institutional review boards particularly those involved in research on groups and communities.

We find that, depending on whether programs are sponsored by industry, environmental groups, or a government, they have strikingly different incentives to grade or compete. Industry sponsors are indifferent about both; environmentalist sponsors optimally grade or compete with other environmentalist sponsors only if consumer preferences for green consumption are skewed in a specific way; and government sponsors' decisions depend on the relative importance of private vs. public benefits generated by the green market. We find also that it is no accident that green markets frequently have an environmentalist program competing with an industry one. For each of the cases examined, our analysis is consistent with casual empirical evidence. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We use high-frequency purchase data from a large panel of US households between 2004 and 2011 to examine how alcohol demand changes over the business cycle in a dynamic panel-data estimation framework. We find strong evidence that demand for packaged alcohol is procyclical. Changes in the state-level unemployment rate and personal per capita income between the most recent business cycle peak and trough imply a 6.5 percent decrease in the demand for packaged alcohol (ethanol by volume). The results also show that the decline in alcohol expenditures is primarily due to a decrease in quantity rather than an overall decrease in the price per ounce of ethanol purchased. Moreover, we improve on the related literature methodologically by accounting for consumption dynamics, as long-run demand for alcohol may differ from short-run demand because of habit formation in the quantity and type of alcohol consumed. Our results also indicate that failing to account for consumption dynamics will tend to understate the long-run association between macroeconomic conditions and alcohol demand.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Dunn, Richard A.] Univ Connecticut, Coll Agr & Nat Resources, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Dunn, Richard A.] Univ Connecticut, Coll Liberal Arts & Sci, Dept Econ, Storrs, CT USA; [Tefft, Nathan] Bates Coll, Dept Econ, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",cotti@uwosh.edu,,,,,,,26,12,14,0,9,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

One of the goals of the conservation easement program we study is to protect contiguous habitat. We identify endogenous spatial interactions among conservation easements and government protected land, independent of spatially correlated landscape features and local economic shocks that influence easement enrollment. We present evidence that easements increase the likelihood of subsequent easements on neighboring land. Government-protected land appears to have little effect on the location of conservation easements. These results imply that conservation agencies have leveraged past conservation investment to enroll more contiguous habitat in permanent easements through a combination of targeting and positive social interactions among neighboring landowners.

This concept of forecast encompassing is used to examine the out-of-sample forecasting ability of these financial variables as well as of the FCI, while also controlling for data mining.","[Thompson, Kirsten; van Eyden, Renee; Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Thompson, K (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",kirsten.thompson@lantic.net,"Van Eyden, Renee/AAO-3991-2021","Van Eyden, Renee/0000-0002-6238-6215",,,,,22,6,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

An almost complete neglect of the parliamentary opposition in the comparative political economy suggests that only office-holding matters, but we disagree. We argue that opposition parties of the Left constrain Right governments' welfare state policies, while opposition parties of the Right have no similar effect on Left governments. This is the asymmetric opposition-government response mechanism. Through the compilation of an extensive dataset, we test the mechanism across 23 countries from 1980 to 2007 and find strong evidence for the existence of the mechanism. This demonstrates that parties matter to policy formation not only as yielders of office power, but as agenda setters too.","[Jensen, Carsten; Seeberg, Henrik Bech] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Jensen, C (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",carstenj@ps.au.dk,"Seeberg, Henrik/ABB-8718-2020","Seeberg, Henrik/0000-0003-4501-4097; Jensen, Carsten/0000-0002-4346-031X",,,,,58,27,29,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

We deal with potential confounding problems by taking advantage of a large number of control variables, as well as by estimating community fixed effect models. All in all, although alcohol prices do appear to influence consumption behaviour in Russia, in most cases the size of effect is modest. The finding that two particularly problematic drinks-cheap vodka and fortified wine-are substitute goods also suggests that increasing their prices may not lead to smaller alcohol consumption. Therefore, any alcohol pricing policies in Russia must be supplemented with other measures, such as restrictions on numbers of sales outlets or their opening times.","[Goryakin, Yevgeniy] Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Goryakin, Yevgeniy] UKCRC Ctr Diet & Act Res CEDAR, Cambridge, England; [Roberts, Bayard; McKee, Martin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res & Policy, European Ctr Hlth Soc Transit, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of East Anglia; University of Cambridge; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Goryakin, Y (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Norwich Med Sch, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",y.goryakin@uea.ac.uk,"McKee, Marc D/E-2187-2011; Goryakin, Yevgeniy/E-4658-2015; McKee, Martin/E-6673-2018","McKee, Marc D/0000-0001-8349-965X; Goryakin, Yevgeniy/0000-0002-3063-6099; McKee, Martin/0000-0002-0121-9683; Roberts, Bayard/0000-0003-4482-5859","European Union [HEALTH-F2-2009-223344]; Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence","European Union(European Union (EU)); Centre for Diet and Activity Research (CEDAR), a UKCRC Public Health Research Centre of Excellence","We are grateful to David Leon and Katie Cole for their comments and contributions to this manuscript.

Applying such an approach in the forest sector may have important policy implications. The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of a carbon tax on imported forest products using Taiwan as an example. Taiwan relies on foreign imported timber and such consumption of harvested wood products (HWPs) lengthens the storage of carbon beyond the life of the tree. This study investigates the impacts of implementing a carbon tax on seven types of HWPs by applying the ARDL approach to imported timber demand functions in Taiwan. The empirical results show that the volumes of imported HWPs as well as carbon dioxide are significantly reduced once a carbon tax is implemented. These empirical outcomes provide some important forest policy implications for countries importing wood products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We describe a model of bilateral trade between a small country and a large trading partner, in which the small country suffers from a domestic commitment problem in trade policy. This problem arises because investors in the import-competing sector lobby the government to enact and maintain protectionist policies. We show that a reciprocal trade agreement, in which the large country lowers its tariffs conditionally on the small country doing the same, creates a carrot and stick' mechanisms that helps the small country to overcome its commitment problem. If capacity in the import-competing sector can only be reduced gradually, the agreement may need to allow the small country to delay the implementation of its trade liberalization commitments, in line with SDT provisions in the WTO. Our analysis suggests that, if reconciled with the principle of reciprocity, SDT can help developing countries to liberalize and improve their trading prospects.","[Conconi, Paola] Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium; [Conconi, Paola] Ctr Econ Policy Res, London, England; [Perroni, Carlo] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; University of Warwick,"Conconi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles ECARES, Brussels, Belgium.",pconconi@ulb.ac.be; C.Perroni@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,32,13,13,2,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2015,14,1.0,,,,,67,86,,10.1017/S147474561400041X,0.0,,,20,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CE2HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351637400005,0

Using longitudinal household survey data from Western Kenya, we estimate the effects of health status on investments in soil quality, as indicated by households' agricultural land fallowing decisions. We first show that this effect is theoretically ambiguous: while health improvements lower discount rates and thus increase incentives to conserve natural resources, they also increase labor productivity and make it more likely that households can engage in labor-intensive resource extraction activities. We find that household size and composition are predictors of whether the effect of health improvements on discount rates dominates the productivity effect, or vice-versa. Since households with more and younger members are better able to reallocate labor to cope with productivity shocks, the discount rate effect dominates for these households and health improvements lead to greater levels of conservation. In smaller families with less substitutable labor, the productivity effect dominates and health improvements lead to greater environmental degradation (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Women's intentions were more influenced by norm pressures than men's intentions. In the youngest and oldest age cohorts, the norm pressures were clearly the most dominant explanatory factor. The more urban the residential area of the forest owner, the more important were the norm pressures from outside. From the policy point of view, the responsiveness and need for professional advice of the younger (new), urban and female forest owners are worth noting: the most important referent was the extension personnel of the local forest management association.

It is an important source of information for the forestry and wood industry sectors. This paper compares the Wood Balance and Wood Resource Balance modeling tools widely used in Germany today, lists the differences between the two and shows why the Wood Resource Balance in its current form is susceptible to misinterpretation. To avoid possible misinterpretation, a proposal is presented for an enhanced Wood Resource Balance. The term Wood Market Balance is proposed for the enhanced model to differentiate it from the already existing models. The Wood Market Balance presents an analysis of wood use at the place of consumption (material and energy uses) in contrast to the Wood Resource Balance which looks at wood input into the industry. Based on the current Wood Resource Balance, the proportion of wood used for energy has been substantially underestimated. The figure derived for Germany for 2010 and commonly referred to in public debate was approximately 50%. The proposed Wood Market Balance, however, indicates that the proportion of wood used for energy purposes is actually higher at roughly 61%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

As our article describes this was primarily caused by discrepancies between supply and demand on oil market. However we argue that market factors only created environment and provided first impetus but geopolitics inherently bound to this subject played its role in further development. We believe that Saudis decision that led to decline in oil prices was intended to help to fulfill multiple of its own goals as well as some of that of Saudis allies.

The negotiators in the Doha Agenda chose formulas that are ideal from an economic efficiency viewpoint in that they most sharply reduce the highest-and most economically-costly tariffs. When the political support that gave rise to the original tariffs is considered, however, this approach appears to generate very high political costs per unit of gain in economic efficiency. The political costs associated with the formulas appear to have led to strong pressure for many, complex exceptions, which both lowered and increased uncertainty about members' market access gains. Where tariff cuts focus on applied rates, it seems likely that a proportional cut rule would reduce the political costs of securing agreements. However, detailed examination of the Doha proposals with their product exceptions suggests that negotiators are likely to find cuts with exceptions politically attractive but economically costly when cuts are based on bound tariffs with different degrees of binding overhang.","[Laborde, David] IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA; [Martin, Will] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); The World Bank,"Laborde, D (通讯作者)，IFPRI, Washington, DC 20006 USA.",D.Laborde@cgiar.org; wmartin573@gmail.com,"Laborde, David/D-6408-2015","Laborde, David/0000-0003-3644-3498",,,,,22,6,6,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2015,14,1.0,,,,,45,65,,10.1017/S1474745614000366,0.0,,,21,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CE2HT,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351637400004,0

Compared with the compensation agreements reached in early cases, the compensation agreements entered into in US-Section 110(5) Copyright Act, EC-Hormones, US-Upland Cotton and China-Publications have made some developments to counteract those constraints. Such developments challenged systematic aspects of the current compensation mechanism, i.e., the application of MFN provisions, the temporary nature of compensation, and at the same time, embodied institutional innovations, i.e., introduction of monetary compensation, recourse to Article 25 on arbitration to determine the level of compensation. Compensation agreements reached in those cases have relieved or solved the deadlock of the compliance problems in sensitive disputes and shed some light on the reform of the compensation mechanism. Members should not wait for the successful conclusion of the Doha Round negotiations, but ought to fully utilize the existing WTO mechanisms to improve the efficiency of the compensation mechanism.","[Li, Xiaoling] China Youth Univ Polit Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Chen, Yusong] China Minist Commerce, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Youth University of Political Studies,"Li, XL (通讯作者)，China Youth Univ Polit Studies, Beijing, Peoples R China.",linglan7@163.com; yusongchen@126.com,,,,,,,33,1,1,0,5,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Long-term improvements in the overall health and wellbeing of the population can now be more easily achieved by encouraging people towards a healthier, more active life-style using innovative prevention and monitoring tools and technologies. Among many other given benefits, wearable technology entails the potential to deliver public health support on a previously unimaginable scale, for example by helping individuals autonomously manage their eating, sleeping and physical activity and reducing pressure on their personal health and the healthcare systems created to support them. Behavioral economics provides the means to potentially increase awareness, reduce disparities, inform people and motivate them in this regard. Focusing on the relatively predictable mind paths and mental shortcuts (heuristics) humans employ to make decisions, the emerging field of behavioral economics can provide valuable insights for policy makers when developing strategies to motivate people in leading a healthier life. The present paper aims to show how various concepts in behavioral economics may be used to influence people's behaviors, determining healthier habits and positive life-style attitudes. Moreover, it provides an overview on how wearable technology can be employed by policy makers and health practitioners to make recommendations and improve the decisions making, monitoring and feedback. The conclusions of the paper summarize some of the downsides, limitations and technical challenges when implementing modern wearable technologies into everyday life and list several recommendations and future research questions.","[Neatu, Alina Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Neatu, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",alina_neatu@yahoo.com,,,"European Social Fund, through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) under the coordination of The Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Ministry of Labour, Family and Equal Opportunities, project POSDRU [159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund, through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) under the coordination of The Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Romanian Ministry of Labour, Family and Equal Opportunities, project POSDRU","This paper was co-financed from the European Social Fund, through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development (SOP HRD) 2007-2013 under the coordination of The Bucharest University of Economic Studies and The Romanian Ministry of Labour, Family and Equal Opportunities, project POSDRU number 159/1.5/S/138907 Excellence in scientific, interdisciplinary, doctoral and postdoctoral research in economic, social and medical fields - EXCELIS.",,21,0,0,0,9,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,196,203,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200025,0

Trade theory suggests that the effect of the new law would be to reduce the flow of illegally sourced fiber into the United States, increasing prices. Monthly U.S. import data on tropical lumber (January 1989-June 2013) and hardwood plywood (January 1996-June 2013) quantity and unit value were used to estimate alternative statistical models that quantify the impact of the 2008 Lacey Act Amendment on import prices and import quantities of products from potential source countries. Results show that the Amendment's quantity effects are generally negative and double in magnitude in percentage terms than the price effects, consistent with expectations of the effects of a backwards shift in foreign supply against an elastic import demand. Models indicate that there have been double-digit percentage increases in prices and decreases in quantities of tropical lumber imports from Bolivia, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Peru. Similarly large changes in hardwood plywood import prices and quantities from Brazil, Indonesia, and Malaysia have occurred, while smaller, and in some cases statistically insignificant, changes have been observed for hardwood plywood imports from China, Ecuador, and Taiwan.

Age dimension of long-term unemployment indicates, that distribution of risks of a long-term unemployment has a different intesity of impact on distinct age categories. Higher rate of a long-term unemployment of young people (in comparison with other age categories) is closely related with the process of transition from school to the labor market. The problem which occures the most is the lack of professional experience or inappropriate field of study which focus is not demanded on the market. Negative development of unemployment is the problem in almost all countries of the European Union, not just in Slovakia. The main aim of this article is to evaluate the present development of unemployment in Slovakia and to predict the future development of this issue. Unemployment is quantified by development of rate of unemployment which is provided by the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic and the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family. Both institutions provides the rate of unemployment based on different methodologies. Partial goal of this articel is to discover how is the unemployment influenced by gender. Objects of investigation are young unemployed people who are divided into three age groups: 15-19, 20-24, 25-29. Research is carried out in the period from 1994 to 2013. For the future prediction are used linear regression model, moving average and exponential balancing. Young people represent one third of overall unemployment. They have more difficult conditions to entry the labour market nowadays. Number of registered unemployed persons to 29 years is still rising. Development of average rate of unemployment of young people in selected age groups follow the development of total average rate of unemployment of citizens of Slovak republic. The average rate of unemployment of young people oscillated in given period around a hundred and fifty percent of its value. The highest rate of youth unemployment occurred in year 2011 when it reached 37,77%. In the same year unemployment in Slovakia was 13,6%, while this rate reached the peak in the year 2001 (19,2%). By analysis of the unemployment rate by gender we discovered that in the age groups 15-19 years and 20-24 years the unemployment rate is higher for men. During 1994-2013 it has a growing trend. In the age group of 25-29 is the higher female unemployment rate with declining trend.","[Richterova, Lucia; Hoskova, Elena; Zentkova, Iveta] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Richterová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",xrichterova@is.uniag.sk; elena.hoskova@uniag.sk; iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,919,927,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800088,0

The main purpose of an economic evaluation within HTA may be seen in measuring, valuing and comparing the costs and consequences of alternatives to support economic judgments about an intervention or a program. Technological innovations are associated with a significant public budget impact; hence, a high attention is paid to their cost-effectiveness. Cost analyses, the core of these studies, require detailed, exact and true inputs. In order to calculate the production function, physical inputs (amounts of the production factors) are necessary; these are subsequently valued by their prices. In the Czech Republic, such data are, as a rule, considered quasi confidential from the part of healthcare providers, and also (public) health insurance companies are not very open to share their records. Two main reasons may be that (1) in many cases, reimbursement of health care does not correspond to real costs of the respective intervention, and (2) such analytical data are often not monitored nor recorded, so that the institutions do not know them. This paper discusses possible sources of cost data, their availability, reliability, and how to substitute the missing data by information from open sources.

The results indicated that heads of households from the control communes assessed the level of satisfaction of the needs of the selected groups as higher.","Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Pod, Biala Podlaska, Poland",Pope John Paul II State School of Higher Education in Biala Podlaska,"Siedlecka, A (通讯作者)，Pope John Paul II State Sch Higher Educ Biala Pod, Biala Podlaska, Poland.",a.siedlecka@wp.pl,,,,,,,7,1,1,0,1,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-190-6,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,40.0,,,,,64,71,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010100006,0

Not all households, however, are the same. We can divide them according to the number of household's members, type of living, income group or structure of the members. In the last few years, the increasing amount of the single-person households has become a significant issue in Slovakia. In 2011, ratio of single-person households was more than 25 % in Slovakia. It is an interesting phenomenon influencing not only labour market (paid work), but also unpaid work activities performed in the free time. Unpaid work includes many activities that individuals perform every day in their households and for the society for free. In Slovakia, there has not been, however, any official statistical research conducted concerning unpaid work activities till now. Starting from 2012, interdisciplinary team of researchers from the Faculty of Economics, Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica, Slovakia, has conducted several original primary researches on the unpaid work in Slovakia. Researches already confirmed that unpaid work in Slovakia covers approximately 30 % of Gross Domestic Product (which is comparable with other countries of the European Union and rest of word). Researches also showed that individuals spent in average 25.8 hours per week by unpaid work (it is approximately 222 minutes per day). However, extent of the performed unpaid work activities vary according to the gender, place of living and structure of the households 'members. The aim of this paper is to present results of our unique research from 2013, focusing on the unpaid work activities performed in households in Slovakia. Within the research, we questioned 1892 households from which almost 25 % were single-person households. In this article we present results concerning particularly single-person households. Besides other particularities, we stress importance of the gender and place of living of the single-member households. To test our hypothesis, we have used non-parametric tests, mostly Mann-Whitney Test. We test hypothesis on the probability level a = 0.05.

This contribution expands former analyses and provides a deeper analysis of population income development in Slovak republic by occupation and gender in years 2009 - 2013. The population income is represented by average monthly gross income in the given year per employee and by median of gross monthly income per employee in the time series. The employees are divided according to the Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic in the following types: Legislation and management, Science and mentation, Technics, healthcare and pedagogy, Offices, Services and business, Qualified work in agriculture and forestry, Craftsmanship and other qualified employment, Using machines and devices, Elementary and auxiliary work, Army. The goal of this article is not only to identify inequality in income distribution of employees by occupation types, but also the rate of inequality of income distribution between males and females. The data source are Statistical Office of the Slovak Republic, and the Survey on wage structure for the years 2009-2013. The indicators of income inequality from mathematical-statistical methods, regression analysis were also applied. The income trend analyses results point out income growth in all types of employment in reference period. The major income growth trend was observed in Legislation and Judiciary. The gross monthly income growth was 54 EUR per year estimated by linear regression model with 96 percent certainty. The incomes in legislation were higher within all observed types of employment. The lowest statistically significant income growth rate was in services & sales and unqualified workforce. The average annual income growth of these sectors reached 16 EUR (with 82 percent and 99percent certainty). The income of unqualified workforce belonged to the lowest within observed types of employment. The income trend analysis points out that the income inequality among particular types of employment deepened in period 2009-2013. This fact was further verified by unequal income distribution rate. The second power of variance coefficient, Theil index, median and average ratio, modified index of income inequality were used. Calculated coefficients of income inequality rate did not verify the theory of income inequality deepening in Slovak Republic. The income inequality distribution decreases when average income trend is taken into account. The income inequality distribution increases when income median analysis is used. Further, income inequality distribution development observation between males and females in all sectors excluding services and sales employees was provided. Income inequality distribution in all areas was decreasing in observed period, except of services & sales employees and professional science & mentation employment.","[Zentkova, Iveta; Hoskova, Elena] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Zentková, I (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",iveta.zentkova@uniag.sk; elena.hoskova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,3,0,0,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1207,1214,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800117,0

This substitution effect is imprecisely estimated but economically significant, implying that a $1.00 increase in UI benefits reduces DI expenditures by 15 cents.

Integration is seen as a process of joint knowledge production and mutual learning. Examining experiences from the ELaN project, we ask: How did integration take place? How was integration supported and hampered? What has to be considered when planning such a process? Highlighting emergent challenges and opportunities for interdisciplinary integration via scenario development, we demonstrate how content and presentation of the scenarios were modified on the basis of inputs from involved researchers of different disciplines. Through an iterative process, the originally qualitative and rather general scenarios of land use changes have been enriched by quantitative data from different sub-projects and presentation of narrative stories complemented by GIS maps, leading to better integration of results from the sub-projects. Our results show that scenario development processes have to be planned carefully if they aim at integrating interdisciplinary knowledge. In the ELaN consortium, lack of resources available to a sub-project were compensated for by referring to other additional expertise and resources throughout the process. We reflect upon such modifications and identify success factors for the organization of such processes, concluding that scenarios are suitable for interdisciplinary integration in three ways: a) scenarios facilitate the compilation and recombination of existing knowledge and create a new, commonly shared frame for formerly separated knowledge; b) joint scenario development fosters social integration among researchers with different disciplinary backgrounds and supports group building processes and; c) scenarios are able to link new results of different sub-projects and researchers into a joint product which, ultimately, strengthens the integrative character of the project as such.

Evidence from the clean water act,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND MANAGEMENT,,,English,Article,,,,,,Environmental compliance; Water pollution abatement costs; Ambient environmental quality; Effluent limits; Community characteristics; Overcompliance,COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS; POLLUTION REGULATION; ENFORCEMENT; INDUSTRY; REGULATIONS; PERFORMANCE; MATTER,"In this paper we show that plants respond to downstream ambient water quality after controlling for permitted levels of pollution. We find if past water quality declines by one percent, plants reduce current pollution by 0.35 percent. The magnitude of this coefficient is comparable to the coefficient on permitted discharge levels i.e. regulatory stringency itself. Results are consistent with two mechanisms. First, a decline in water quality may lead to more stringent permits that would raise the cost of abatement of a plant significantly. Second, the plant is likely to be subject to increased public pressure in response to poor water quality. Indeed, as expected, the impact of water quality becomes stronger in locations with higher median household income, higher percent carpooling to work, or lower percent of manufacturing employment but surprisingly with lower median age of residents, lower percent with bachelor's degree or higher percent of families with children.

This paper reviews studies in economics on efficient design of policies for forest carbon sequestration and compares their findings against design systems in practice. Specific design problems are associated with the heterogeneity of landowners, uncertainty, additionality, and permanence in carbon projects. Different types of discounting of the value of the forest carbon sink compared with emissions abatement are suggested in the literature for management of most design problems, together with optimal contract design and emissions baselines for managing additionality and permanence in carbon sequestration. Design systems in practice, where forest carbon corresponds to 0.5% of all carbon volume subject to a pricing mechanism, mainly rely on additionality tests by approved standards on a project-by-project basis, and on buffer credits for management of permanence. Further development of forest carbon sinks as offsets in voluntary and compliance markets can be facilitated by applying tools for contract design and offset baseline management recommended in the literature.

Incorporating a discrete choice experiment into an economic evaluation",HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Economic evaluation; Discrete choice experiment (DCE); Willingness to pay (WTP); Quality adjusted life year (QALY); Cost-benefit analysis (CBA); Randomised controlled trial (RCT),HEALTH-CARE; STATED PREFERENCE; MANAGEMENT,"Background: Economic evaluation focuses on Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs) as the main valuation method. However, it is well known that factors beyond health related quality of life are important to patients and the public. Whilst discrete-choice-experiments (DCE) have been extensively used to value such factors, their incorporation within an economic evaluation framework is limited. This study is the first to incorporate patient preferences for factors beyond QALYs into an economic evaluation and compare results with the standard cost-per-QALY approach, using randomised-controlled-trial (RCT) participants. Methods: Costings, clinical-effectiveness (appropriateness-of-treatment), QALYs and patient satisfaction data were collected at baseline and 12-month follow-up for a new pharmacy-service within a randomised-controlled-trial. Trial participants who replied to the follow-up survey and had not subsequently withdrawn from the study were mailed a DCE questionnaire at 24-months. WTP for the standard and new service was derived from the DCE. Results from QALYs and the DCE were compared. Results: At 12 months, costs, clinical-effectiveness and QALYs did not differ between the intervention and control; however there was a significant increase in satisfaction in the intervention. The DCE valued this increased satisfaction in the intervention (positive net-benefit). The longer the time patients experienced the new service the greater the reported net-benefit. Conclusion: When incorporating a DCE into an economic evaluation a number of questions are raised: what factors should be valued, whose values (trial-groups vs. all-trial-population) and when should they be elicited (still-receiving-the-intervention or afterwards). Consideration should also be given to status quo bias.","[Tinelli, Michela] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth & Social Care, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Ryan, Mandy] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Econ Res Unit, Polwarth Bldg,Foresterhill Campus, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland; [Bond, Christine] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Polwarth Bldg,Foresterhill Campus, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Aberdeen; University of Aberdeen,"Tinelli, M (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Hlth & Social Care, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",m.tinelli@lse.ac.uk,"Bond, Christine/ABF-5390-2020; Tinelli, Michela/C-3008-2016","Bond, Christine/0000-0003-0429-5208; Tinelli, Michela/0000-0002-8816-4389",Department of Health for England and Wales; Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Medical Research Council (MRC); Chief Scientific Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorate; Chief Scientist Office [HERU1] Funding Source: researchfish,Department of Health for England and Wales(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council (MRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Chief Scientific Office of the Scottish Government Health and Social Care Directorate; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland),"The Medman study was funded by the Department of Health for England and Wales and managed by a collaboration of the National Pharmaceutical Association, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the Company Chemist Association and the Co-operative Pharmacy Technical Panel, led by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee.

The company car market is the driving force of changes in European car fleets and one of the main channels for the penetration of low emission vehicles. Policies in support of low emission vehicles through this channel have been popular. This paper introduces an approach to estimate the welfare effects of policies linking company car tax base rates with vehicles' environmental impact. The approach is applied to evaluate the effects of tax advantages for electric company cars in the Netherlands. We find that the welfare losses caused by these policies are substantial, and even outweigh the foregone tax revenue. This result also holds if we assume that there are substantial future benefits from the adoption of electric company cars, e.g. in terms of positive network externalities, technological innovation and concomitant environmental benefits.

Given the uneven roll-out of the NCMS across rural counties, we are able to deploy its implementation as a natural experiment in order to obviate problems of adverse selection that typically plague research on the effects of health insurance. We find that, among children, the NCMS has the greatest positive effect on infants between birth and 5 years of age. Also, with respect to female nutritional status, our models show that the NCMS has the greatest effect on women of childbearing age (aged between 16 and 35), indicating that women who benefit from the NCMS benefits may, in turn, give birth to healthier babies. Thus, taken together, our findings indicate that the NCMS plays an important role in health dynamics in rural China.","[Peng, Xiaobo] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Liangxiang Univ Town, Inst Econ, Grad Sch, Beijing 100836, Peoples R China; [Conley, Dalton] NYU, Dept Sociol, 6 Washington Sq North, New York, NY 10003 USA",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; New York University,"Peng, XB (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Liangxiang Univ Town, Inst Econ, Grad Sch, Beijing 100836, Peoples R China.",xiaobopeng1212@163.com; conley@nyu.edu,,,"China Scholarship Council [201, 206, 010, 152]; project Research on Payment Mechanism Innovation and Public Hospital Reform in China''; National Social Science Foundation of China [14BGL145, 13ZD042]; significant project Research on Establishing Security System of Social Fair and Maintaining Social Fair and Justice''; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2015M571199]",China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); project Research on Payment Mechanism Innovation and Public Hospital Reform in China''; National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); significant project Research on Establishing Security System of Social Fair and Maintaining Social Fair and Justice''; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation),"Xiaobo Peng is indebted to Qixiang Sun, her dissertation advisor.

It begins with the author's personal work reminiscences as a touchstone for reflecting on continuity and change in women's working lives. A first job in sheep-shearing sheds illustrates the insecurity and hard physical and emotional labour associated with manual work. Despite strides in Australian women's qualification levels, discrimination is being refreshed and remade'. Examples include recent Australian reversals in paid parental leave policy and the role of sexual harassment in patrolling work boundaries. The institutional basis of unequal pay and inflexible work/family time allocation is demonstrated in the Productivity Commission's 2015 Workplace Relations agenda. This recommends reduced Sunday penalty rates that will disproportionately affect feminised, low-paid retail and hospitality work and rejects any strengthening of parents' statutory right to request flexible work arrangements. Three remedies are proposed - creative approaches to research, campaigning and political action.","[Pocock, Barbara] Univ S Australia, Ctr Work Life, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",University of South Australia,"Pocock, B (通讯作者)，Univ S Australia, City West Campus,North Terrace, Adelaide, SA 5000, Australia.",barbara.pocock@unisa.edu.au,,,,,,,16,7,7,0,31,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study aims at developing a new classification system with well-defined constructs for patients' and persons' self-reports on health and healthcare. A literature research and evaluation by the Reported Health Outcomes (RHO) Group were used to develop this classification system. The new classification system includes patient- and person-reported preferences, outcomes, experiences, and satisfaction related to healthcare and health outcomes. Moreover, the most constitutive methods to measure these four categories - preferences, outcomes, experiences, and satisfaction - have been described in this article. Even though the value of patients' and persons' perspectives on healthcare is increasingly being recognized, its measurement and implementation presents a lasting challenge to researchers, clinicians, patients, and the general population.","[Klose, K.; Kreimeier, S.] Univ Bielefeld, Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, POB 10 01 3133501, Bielefeld, Germany; [Klose, K.; Aumann, I.; Damm, K.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Tangermann, U.] Hannover Med Sch, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Carl Neuberg Str 1, D-30625 Hannover, Germany",University of Bielefeld; Leibniz University Hannover; Hannover Medical School,"Damm, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Ctr Hlth Econ Res Hannover CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",kd@cherh.de,,"Kreimeier, Simone/0000-0002-4832-7833",Open Access fund of Leibniz University Hannover,Open Access fund of Leibniz University Hannover,"The publication of this article was funded by the Open Access fund of Leibniz University Hannover.

Charter attendance also boosts SAT scores sharply and increases the likelihood of taking an Advanced Placement (AP) exam, the number of AP exams taken, and AP scores.

Whether at a macroeconomic level or within individual organisations there are numerous examples of this, such as the economic crash of 2008, the causes of which had many parallels with those that caused the great depression 80 years previously. On the other hand however, overly-relying on the past as a guide to the future has its own obvious dangers not least that important future events may have no past precedent. As such, the present paper firstly provides a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of using the past as a guide to the future. It then examines the role of history in scenario work, arguing that history should receive greater emphasis as part of the scenario planning process. We suggest changes to the standard Intuitive Logics (IL) approach to scenario planning which would render learning from history a more central component of the scenario process, in contrast to its current peripheral role. Rather than diminishing scenario planning's ability to facilitate a consideration of how the future may differ from the past, we show how a greater emphasis on history can enhance consideration of the causality of future change. An adapted IL that has more emphasis on historical analysis can augment scenario planning's effectiveness as a tool for consideration of the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, the exact implications of complexity science for FS remain somewhat opaque. This paper explicitly sets out the challenges for FS that arise from six complexity science concepts: (1) irreversibility of time (2) path dependence 3) sensitivity to initial conditions (4) emergence and systemness (5) attractor states (6) complex causation. The discussion highlights the implications of these challenges for FS tools such as horizon scanning and weak signals, and sets out the benefits of overcoming the challenges to create an explicitly complexity-orientated FS. The discussion concludes with a set of questions summarising the challenge for FS from complexity science with the aim of stimulating a discussion as to how they can be met.

However, ADR has not been operational so far under the DSU. The SPS Committee recently adopted a new mediation procedure under Article 12.2 of the SPS Agreement to facilitate a mutually agreed solution by the consulting Members. The Member participation in the mediation procedure is voluntary, and the consulting Members may decide the confidentiality of the information delivered or communications created during the mediation. In addition, the mediation procedure does not constitute a legally binding agreement, and the consulting Members are free to decide the acceptability of the mediation result. The role of the Facilitator is to encourage and facilitate exchange between the consulting Members, suggest possible ways to resolve the concerns, and issue a written factual report on the mediation.

The VPAs are bilateral agreements between the European Union (EU) and timber producing countries. VPAs constitute a cornerstone in ELT's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) programme, the most important tool for the EU to address illegal logging problems. The EU requires that national VPA negotiations include participation by the relevant stakeholders. Based on primary data, we compare the VPA negotiations in Cameroon (2006-2009) with three different 'ideal' models of participatory policy-making: the rationalist, the communicative incremental and the mixed model, which we expect have different implications for legitimacy. We conclude that the Cameroonian process is closest to a rationalist model with elements of the mixed model, and that this has increased legitimacy and support only to a limited extent. For future processes in other countries, we recommend stronger elements of the mixed model, and more careful considerations about stakeholder identification processes; how to adapt policy-process to specific contexts; and how to strengthen communication and information flows. Considerations about these elements could also strengthen the applicability of the ideal models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By using the semi-parametric estimation technique developed by Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) to estimate Total Factor Productivity (TFP)we find that exporters display a productivity advantage compared to their domestic counterparts. We seek to distinguish between self-selection and learning by exporting through matching techniques and we find that the most productive firms self-select in activities in international markets, including importing. Learning effects (when TFP is used as outcome) are present on a narrow sample of companies, although in most of the cases are positive and significant when using labour productivity. Stronger evidence for positive effects of international trade is found for importers, which suggests a possible learning by importing phenomenon manifested in Romanian.","[Altar, Moisa; Cazacu (Bancu), Ana-Maria] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania; [Altar, Moisa] Romanian Amer Univ FINSYS, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Altar, M; Cazacu, AM (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.;Altar, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Amer Univ FINSYS, Bucharest, Romania.",altarm@gmail.com; ana02mary@yahoo.com,,,"Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI [PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-1054]","Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI","This work was supported by a grant of the Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, CNCS - UEFISCDI, project number PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-1054.",,25,0,0,0,13,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In this regard, companies that offer distinguished and useful services to customers have more loyal customers rather than their competitor. Understanding the impact of consumer response to innovations on their loyalty is crucial for service providers in the field of digital products. Therefore, the aim of this study is the investigation of the impact of Innovation in Electronic Service on brand equity and customer loyalty in Samsung International Corporation. In this regard, data from 384 users of Samsung mobile phone who have used the services of this company was collected and tested through structural equation modeling. The findings of the study confirmed the impact of customized services and technology leadership on the brand equity, while direct impact of service innovation on brand equity was not found significant.

Integrative complexity measures an individual's level of complexity when thinking about an issue. This, in turn, illustrates the diversity of arguments people recognize about the subject. It is the capacity and willingness to acknowledge the legitimacy of competing perspectives on the same issue and forge conceptual links among these perspectives. This has significant implications for agencies in policy development and subsequent public acceptance. Households were surveyed in counties adjacent to three study areas in northern Colorado and southern Wyoming. Regression moderation analysis examined the interrelationships among basic beliefs, attitudes, and integrative complexity. Results suggest that integrative complexity moderated the relationship between basic beliefs and attitudes toward prescribed fire. We discuss how this methodology can contribute to a better understanding of public perceptions regarding proposed or subsequent strategies and policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It includes the calculation of the partial sub indices reflecting the innovation potential components in the regions (resources, infrastructure and effectiveness of innovation) as well as the composite index evaluation based on them. Principal components analysis of the variables characterizing small and medium-sized enterprises density in a region and these enterprises contribution to regional employment allows obtaining generalized characteristic of the level of small and medium-sized enterprises development. By the values of resource and effectiveness components of the innovation potential the typological groups of Russian regions were highlighted. The analysis reveals a significant moderate positive relationship between the level of small and medium-sized enterprises development (in particular, the groups of micro and small enterprises, medium-sized enterprises) and the composite index of innovative potential as well as sub-indices characterizing its components. For mediumsized enterprises this relationship with the resource and effectiveness components is higher because medium-sized enterprises are more involved in innovation activities. Currently, the contribution of small enterprises to innovative development of Russian regions is negligible, so the level of small entrepreneurship development depends mostly on regional infrastructure than on other aspects of innovation. Finally, practical recommendations were developed to stimulate entrepreneurial activity taking into account regional specificities.","[Dubrova, Tatiana; Ermolina, Anna; Esenin, Michail] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia",Plekhanov Russian University of Economics,"Dubrova, T (通讯作者)，Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia.",,"Cherviakova, Anna/AFK-0144-2022",,Russian Humanitarian Science Foundation [16-02-00716],Russian Humanitarian Science Foundation,The research was supported by the Russian Humanitarian Science Foundation (project No 16-02-00716),,14,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,865,872,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200113,0

However, crucial questions about trends of corporatism and its impact cannot be tested because time-variant indexes are out of date or cover only a small sample of countries. In this study, a corporatism index is developed and applied to 42 countries on an annual basis from 1960 to 2010. The application of this index demonstrates that there is no decline of corporatism over the past five decades. However, the model states - above all Sweden - reduced corporatist arrangements. In contrast, other countries, such as in the Benelux region, increased their degree of corporatism and new corporatist states like Slovenia and South Africa emerged. The index developed in this article may be a helpful tool for many scholars in the fields of political economy and macro-comparative politics. It makes a dynamic analysis concerning the status of corporatism as dependent and independent variable possible.","[Jahn, Detlef] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Polit Sci, Greifswald, Germany",Universitat Greifswald,"Jahn, D (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Dept Polit Sci, Greifswald, Germany.",djahn@uni-greifswald.de,,,,,,,92,81,82,2,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Although the Turkish economy is highly reliant on oil, we find that oil price does not lead either electricity or market indexes. This might be attributable to sluggish integration of financial markets in Turkey compared to developed markets. Natural gas price leads electricity index in the pre-2008 period. Its significance is reduced following the decline in natural gas usage in electricity production.

It is shown that the adaptive expectations formulation implies a high degree of inertia even when a high correction factor is assumed. In contrast, the rational expectations and the recursive least squares learning algorithms exhibit a much faster return to equilibrium in case of a shock. The paper also emphasizes the importance of the initial conditions in case of the learning algorithm for the behaviour of macroeconomic variables: if more preliminary periods are allowed so that the initial values are closer to the coefficients coming from the rational expectations solution, the predicted path of the variables is much closer to the one under rational expectations.","[Pop, Raluca-Elena] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Econ Cybernet & Stat Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Pop, RE (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Econ Cybernet & Stat Doctoral Sch, Bucharest, Romania.",pop_ralucaelena@yahoo.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,0,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,340,346,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300054,0

Of 39 land grant universities surveyed, only 21% exhibited increasing enrollment growth. The average enrollment per program is 100 students. Possible reasons for decreasing enrollment are: ineffective or no recruiting, not attracting as many female majors, increasing admission standards, bad publicity primarily based on jobs and low starting salary, and not appealing to the new Millennial student. Additionally, there is a trend to merge horticulture departments into plant, soil and/or environment departments, such that in 2014 only 31% of the universities offering horticulture degrees have departments with horticulture in the department name. An effort to make horticulture an attractive major for the current Millennial student is required. This can be achieved by offering specializations in the areas that are growing, namely entrepreneurship, business, food and nutrition, environment and natural resources. There may be a need to offer alternative teaching approaches to effectively recruit Millennial students. Many of the current students are attracted to emerging pedagogical approaches, including distance education, blended delivery, flipped courses, etc. These decreasing enrollment trends cannot be achieved by academe alone, and partnering with public horticultural institutions, horticultural societies, and leading horticultural and allied industries may be needed. Total faculty numbers are exhibiting a slight decrease and there is a trend to hire fewer tenure-track professorial- ranked faculty and greater numbers of non-tenure track professorial- ranked, instructor, lecturer or part-time faculty. The peak faculty age is increasing, with a large number approaching retirements. Funding for faculty research is changing dramatically. Appropriated funding allocated to faculty has decreased greatly; thus faculty must generate significant funds to cover expenses for their research, graduate students, technical support staff, travel, operating expenses, and increasingly a portion of their salary to maintain 12-month appointments.","[Reed, D.

The results of this study suggest that managers' success in stock valuation primarily depends on the correct understanding of influential resources and it is recommended that managers increase the value of their company's stock by the prober use and combination of factors effective in stock valuation according to the information of the company.

The error correction model indicates that although the adjustments to the equilibrium occurred through the call rate during the global financial crisis, they were processed through the RP rate in later periods.

Due to global warming, externality problems from CO2 emissions have gained increased interest. With two externality problems, a first-best optimum can be achieved by using two regulatory instruments. However, solving the open-access externality problem also affects CO2 emissions. By using a bio-economic model covering Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the Faroe Islands, it is shown that regulations of the open access externality problem have a large effect on both economic performance and CO2 emissions, while an additional CO2 regulation only has minor effects. The second-best solution achieved by only regulating open access reduces emissions by approximately 50% compared to current fisheries, with the exception of Iceland, which already has a well-developed fisheries management system.","[Waldo, Staffan] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Scheelevagen 15D, S-22007 Umea, Sweden; [Jensen, Frank; Nielsen, Max] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark; [Ellefsen, Hans] Univ Faroe Isl, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Torshavn 100, Denmark; [Hallgrimsson, Jonas] Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, Saemundsdargata 101, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Hammarlund, Cecilia] Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Scheelevagen 15D, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Hermansen, Oystein] Nofima, Food Res Inst, Munibakken 9-12, N-9291 Tromso, Norway; [Hermansen, Oystein; Isaksen, John] Nofima, Food Res Inst, Munibakken 9-12, N-9291 Tromso, Norway",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences; University of Copenhagen; University of Iceland; Lund University; Nofima; Nofima,"Waldo, S (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Scheelevagen 15D, S-22007 Umea, Sweden.;Jensen, F; Nielsen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Food & Resource Econ, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark.;Ellefsen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Faroe Isl, Dept Hist & Social Sci, Torshavn 100, Denmark.;Hallgrimsson, J (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Fac Econ, Saemundsdargata 101, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.;Hammarlund, C (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, AgriFood Econ Ctr, Scheelevagen 15D, S-22007 Lund, Sweden.;Hermansen, O (通讯作者)，Nofima, Food Res Inst, Munibakken 9-12, N-9291 Tromso, Norway.;Hermansen, O; Isaksen, J (通讯作者)，Nofima, Food Res Inst, Munibakken 9-12, N-9291 Tromso, Norway.",staffan.waldo@slu.se; fje@ifro.ku.dk; max@ifro.ku.dk; hans.elleflsen@fi.fo; jhh4@hi.is; cecilia.hammarlund@agrifood.lu.se; oystein.hermansen@norfima.no; john.isaksen@norfima.no,"waldo, staffan/AHA-9201-2022; Nielsen, max/F-4544-2015",,"Nordic Council of Ministers; Swedish Research Council, Formas [229-2009-616]; European Commission [265863]","Nordic Council of Ministers; Swedish Research Council, Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","We acknowledge input from Ola Flaaten, Nguyen Ngoc Duy, Dadi Mar Kristofersson, Marko Lindroos, Anton Paulrud, Fredrik Salenius, and Daniel Schutt.

For other health measures (self-reported general health, long term or limiting illnesses), blood pressure and health behaviours (smoking and drinking) there were small to no improvements.

In Jamaica in particular, the legacy of slavery has made female labour an integral part of the workforce for centuries - whereas large-scale female participation in the developed countries can only be measured in decades. The authors find that the country's large, undifferentiated pools of unskilled labour ironically translate into lower levels of occupational segregation, with women outpacing men in the professional categories.","[Ricketts, Heather E.; Bernard, David V.] Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol Psychol & Social Work, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Ricketts, HE (通讯作者)，Fac Social Sci, Dept Sociol Psychol & Social Work, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",heather.ricketts@uwimona.edu.jm; dv@dvbernard.com,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Labor market studies using the more recent Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data are subject to less measurement error and also yield higher bias-corrected estimates than do studies based on earlier fatality rate measures. These results are borne out by the findings for a large sample of all VSL estimates based on labor market studies using CFOI data and for four meta-analysis data sets consisting of the authors' best estimates of VSL. The confidence intervals of the publication bias-corrected estimates of VSL based on the CFOI data include the values that are currently used by government agencies, which are in line with the most precisely estimated values in the literature.","[Viscusi, W.

We describe how the framing of CBFM in technical and procedural terms, and the subsequent construction of expertise by implementers through training, combine with existing signifiers of social stratification to shape struggles over participation and access to benefits from forest use and management. We also describe how the perceived necessity of expertise is not questioned by village residents, only the exclusive and anti-democratic consequences of the way it comes to be reproduced. Based on our study, we call for a careful reconsideration of the framing of participatory forestry approaches as professionalization to strike a balance between the need for expertise and the costs and potential excluding effects associated with meeting this need.

We focus on unions' role as potential rent-seekers in the K-12 educational landscape, and specifically how teachers' unions impact district and student outcomes. We review important methodological improvements in the identification of union impacts and the measurement of contract restrictiveness that characterize a number of recent studies. We generally find that the preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that teacher unionization and union strength are associated with increases in district expenditures and teacher salaries, particularly salaries for experienced teachers. The evidence for union-related differences in student outcomes is mixed, but suggestive of insignificant or modestly negative union effects. Taken together, these patterns are consistent with a rent-seeking hypothesis.

This paper builds on these observations by introducing engineering consulting firms as key network actors for the development of automobile industries. I will show that a country can develop an industry with greater indigenous, local technical capacity if it establishes ties to engineering consulting firms whose core task is to transfer ownership of the technology to local firms. This case suggests that the development of an automobile industry does not require reliance on multinational investment as a primary source of technology. In addition, by establishing ties to engineering consultancies, even countries isolated from global institutions can engage in more rapid technological learning and industrial upgrading when more conventional ties to sources of technology are unavailable.","[Mehri, Darius Bozorg] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Mehri, DB (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, 410 Barrows Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",darius.mehri@gmail.com,,,UC Berkeley's Dean's Normative Time Fellowship,UC Berkeley's Dean's Normative Time Fellowship,Funding for the project was from the UC Berkeley's Dean's Normative Time Fellowship.,,41,8,8,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Australia is host to a large and growing population of immigrants working without authorisation, described as the most significant problem facing Australian immigration authorities. These undocumented workers are often exploited by employers through wage theft, sexual harassment and unsafe working conditions. Yet, they are not entitled to protection under Australia's employment laws. In addition to the implications for workers, there are broader policy concerns arising from the current system of regulation that effectively rewards employers who are equally in breach of immigration law. Left uncorrected, current regulation may in fact be encouraging a race to the bottom' for employment standards and increasing undocumented immigrant work. As well as highlighting the inadequacy of the existing regulatory framework, potential avenues for addressing this are explored.","Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Work & Organisat Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Clibborn, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Business, Discipline Work & Organisat Studies, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",stephen.clibborn@sydney.edu.au,,"Clibborn, Stephen/0000-0003-0828-9446",,,,,21,32,36,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

However, SREC market prices have been extremely volatile, causing high risk to participants and potentially less investment in solar power generation. Such concerns necessitate the development of realistic, flexible and tractable models of SREC prices that capture the behavior of participants given the rules that govern the market. We propose an original stochastic model called SMART-SREC to fill this role, building on established ideas from the carbon pricing literature, and including a feedback mechanism for generation response to prices. We calibrate the model to the New Jersey market and backtest it, analyzing parameter sensitivity and demonstrating its ability to reproduce historical dynamics. Finally, we run simulations to investigate the role and impact of regulatory parameters, thus providing insight into the crucial role played by market design. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The propensity for executives to sell shares is negatively correlated with the firms' corporate governance and current operating cash flows, but the amount they sell is only positively correlated with the level of management holdings. Both the management selling decision and percentage of selling do not associate with firms' earnings and sales growth. This suggests that managers are profit makers rather than informed traders in their selling activities on the ChiNext.

Specifically, cryptographic systems need to be carefully analyzed since the introduction of quantum computational resources would render discrete logarithm and factoring based cryptographic systems like those based on Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithms woefully obsolete. These algorithms are widely used in the form of digital certificates, message encryption, and even physical authentication devices like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) badges. With this technology compromised by quantum computing, governments and other organizations would be able to eavesdrop on private citizens with relative ease. This has the potential to cause a slew of rights violations and atrocities leading to catastrophe. With compromised digital certificates 3rd parties could masquerade as trusted organizations. This would call many types of digital transactions like into question, including those related to stock exchanges, personal banking, and software verification. By eroding this previously solid foundation of trust global scale economic catastrophes are not out of the question. This paper introduces quantum computing to the study of catastrophic threats since the use of quantum technology while existing vulnerable encryption schemes are still in place raises severe safety issues. These issues are addressed here along with a proposed two-fold solution involving the development and maturation of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms coupled with government and international regulation. This regulation would promote the containment and responsible use of quantum computers in order to help alleviate some of the security issues posed by outdated cryptographic systems in a postquantum environment.

Messages decreased the percentage of students who failed to earn course credit from 15.8% to 9.3%-a 41% reduction. This reduction resulted primarily from preventing drop-outs, rather than from reducing failure or dismissal rates. The intervention shaped the content of parent-child conversations with messages emphasizing what students could improve, versus what students were doing well, producing the largest effects. We estimate the cost of this intervention per additional student credit earned to be less than one-tenth the typical cost per credit earned for the district.

In particular, we test how fat upper tailed uncertainty over the temperature change from a doubling of greenhouse gases (the climate sensitivity), affects economic growth and emissions policy. In addition, we examine whether and how fast uncertainties could be diminished through Bayesian learning. Our results indicate that while overall learning is slow, the mass of the fat tail diminishes quickly, since observations near the mean provide evidence against fat tails. We denote as tail learning the case where the planner rejects high values of the climate sensitivity with high confidence, even though significant uncertainty remains. Fat tailed uncertainty without learning reduces current emissions by 38% relative to certainty, indicating significant climate insurance, or paying to limit emissions today to reduce the risk of very high temperature changes, is optimal. However, learning reduces climate insurance by about 50%. The optimal abatement policy is strongly influenced by the current state of knowledge, even though greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are difficult to reverse. Once the mass of the fat tail diminishes, the remaining uncertainty is largely irrelevant for optimal emissions policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There are a number of explanations for this increasing gender imbalance on college campuses. This paper focuses on the role played by admissions policies that base decisions solely on applicants' high school grades. Given that females earn higher grades than males, such policies can contribute to growing female shares in admissions. To exemplify this trend, I use publicly-available data from Texas to show that the Texas Top 10% plan, which guarantees public university admission to students who graduate in the top decile of their high school class, led to an increase in the female share of accepted students. The increase was particularly large among black students, where the female share of admitted students was already highest among the major racial/ethnic groups. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

I find no change in attendance for the 17-year-olds who had a gap year in treatment: though they had previously had received Bolsa Familia until age 15, they were not eligible as 16-year-olds in 2007 and once again became eligible in 2008. My findings suggest this expansion of Bolsa Familia was sufficient to maintain youth in school who were already attending, but not powerful enough to reclaim drop-outs.

We develop modelling steps to i) simulate observation of a multi-dimensional climate system, ii) apply updating rules for beliefs about climate trends, iii) evaluate the performance of adaptive strategies, and iv) apply (i)-(iii) at the local and forest landscape scale to find and compare individual versus joint adaptive decisions. We search for optimal forest management decisions maximizing total biomass production as a measure of management performance. The results illustrate the benefits of updating beliefs to eventually utilize the positive effects and limit negative impacts of climate change on forest biomass production. We find that adaptive decision-making results in switching decisions over time and mostly differ from deterministic decisions ignoring any change in climate. Moreover, we find that the adaptation strategies are indispensable not only because of climate change but also because of the development of the forest biological system over time and the need to revisit decisions.

In 2011, research-based hatchery protocols were scaled up to produce 37,000 advanced (1-5g) black sea bass fingerlings. Based on engineering, biological, and cost data from operating the pilot hatchery, an economic analysis of a hypothetical commercial scale black sea bass hatchery operation was conducted. The financial performance of two alternative facilities that produce 97,200 5-g and 388,800 1-g fingerlings per year over a 30-year project life showed cumulative net present value (NPV) of $445,000, and $3,168,000, modified internal rates of return (MIRR) of 6.52% and 10.52%, and per unit breakeven prices of $1.67 and $0.47, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that final stocking density was critical to financial performance. Fingerlings were supplied to startup growers in NC and in VA, and market-size fish from these growout facilities were distributed (live or whole on ice) to premium-value markets on the eastern seaboard. This pilot hatchery is enabling new farmers to access fingerlings, establish growout technology and understand market value and demand.","[Watanabe, Wade O.; Carroll, Patrick M.; Resimius, Christopher M.] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Marine Sci, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA; [Dumas, Christopher F.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ & Finance, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Dumas, CF (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ & Finance, 601 South Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",dumasc@uncw.edu,,"Carroll, Patrick/0000-0002-0963-7775",North Carolina Biotechnology Center Regional Development Grant Program [2009-RDG-4005]; Marine Biotechnology in North Carolina (MARBIONC),North Carolina Biotechnology Center Regional Development Grant Program; Marine Biotechnology in North Carolina (MARBIONC),We thank the North Carolina Biotechnology Center Regional Development Grant Program Grant No. 2009-RDG-4005 for funding support for this project and Marine Biotechnology in North Carolina (MARBIONC) for providing matching funding.,,20,10,11,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

A robust non-parametric Malmquist index is applied to measure group performance. The significance of the results achieved is examined using a conditional and non-conditional subsampling bootstrapped-based methodology, enhanced by the likelihood cross validation criterion based on the k-nearest neighbors method. The sample contains information about 216 non-corporatized and 176 corporatized Portuguese hospitals for the period 2002-2009. Five models were applied, based on three study dimensions (internment, emergencies and doctor visits). The results show that although corporatized hospitals presented the highest efficiency consistency, they had also the lowest levels of productivity, while the hospitals under the traditional administrative public management system were the ones with the best average performance. However, several best practices were also found in all groups, being the limited companies were often dominated by both non-corporatized and public enterprise entities. Consistent output ranges where all groups present dominance over the others were also identified. It was possible to conclude that the more autonomy the hospital had from the Ministry of Health, the lower was its productivity.","[Ferreira, Diogo] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal; [Marques, Rui Cunha] Univ Lisbon, Ctr Urban & Reg Syst CESUR IST, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa; Instituto Superior Tecnico; Universidade de Lisboa,"Ferreira, D (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Tecn, Av Rovisco Pais, P-1049001 Lisbon, Portugal.",diogo.cunha.ferreira@tecnico.ulisboa.pt; rui.marques@tecnico.ulisboa.pt,"Ferreira, Diogo/F-2139-2018; Cunha Marques, Rui/F-6646-2010","Ferreira, Diogo/0000-0001-5418-9337; Cunha Marques, Rui/0000-0003-0344-5200",,,,,44,54,57,3,36,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Forest management entails multiple social situations such as consultations or cooperative engagements between owners and forest professionals. Successful social endeavours rest on positive social capital as operationalised via trust. Based on qualitative in-depth interviews with forest owners, managers and other forestry stakeholders, this study explores how trust influences the social relationships in a local context of Southern Swedish forestry. Most strikingly, the analysis reveals large differences in owners' trust towards two major actors: the Swedish Forest Agency (SFA) and the forest owner association (FOA) Sodra. Permanence of personnel, a client-based approach, and personal features of SFA's local forest officer lead to strong local anchoring and high trust towards SFA Sodra proved to be a trustful partner in the aftermath of calamities; however its industrial priorities seem to erode owners' trust. The empirical findings of this study demonstrate the importance of recognising personal relationships and the catalysing role of bonding social capital in order to understand the local forest management situations. Our results are useful for forestry organisations and policy-makers willing to comprehend the local context and implement best practices in small-scale forestry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Over the past decade, vaccination coverage across the continent has improved dramatically, largely as a result of the Measles Initiative, an international effort coordinating and funding national mass-immunization campaigns. We estimate the reduction in all-cause child mortality after initial country wide measles vaccination campaigns using variation in the timing of the campaigns across countries and subnational regions. This framework accounts for competing and complementary risks as well as for contemporaneous trends in mortality rates that may have biased case-based estimates. We use birth and death history data compiled from multiple Demographic and Health Surveys for 25 countries and control for country-specific trends in child mortality and time-varying factors that were associated with campaign timing. Our findings show that the Measles Initiative campaigns raised the probability of a child's survival to 60 months by approximately 2.4 percentage points for cohorts treated by the campaign. The campaigns cost approximately $109 per child life saved, remarkably low in absolute terms as well as relative to other interventions to reduce global child mortality.","[BenYishay, Ariel] Coll William & Mary, Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"BenYishay, A (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",,,"Kranker, Keith/0000-0002-9230-5906",,,,,41,7,8,0,7,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

This approach defines variables that cause changes in the level of the exchange rate and assess its effect on equilibrium exchange rate. In the case of empirical analysis, there exist a lot of econometric methods that can be used. This article is based on the (Johansen) cointegration analysis. Since principal of EER is to find lung run equilibrium, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) is constructed. Economic theory defines some variables that influence equilibrium exchange rate. The most important of them are the labour productivity, interest rates and government or foreign debt. These variables are also used in this article.

This paper analyzes the process of institutional change, the property rights system and the governance mechanism in the management of communal forests in Galicia from the approach of the New Institutional Economics (NIE). Traditionally, the Spanish legal framework did not establish the existence of communal forests, and therefore there was a process of state and individual-proprietorship of communal land. The 1957 Forestry Act legally assumed the figure of communal forests, and the 1968 Communal Forestry Act implied a new phase in the process of collective-choice institutional change. The process conduced to an institutional framework that has supported communal property rights and has implied an institutional status-quo for Galician communal forest policy since 1989.

We can say that a monopoly uses its position to reach a monopoly profit which exceeds profit on a perfect competition market. A tool to reach this goal is a market price and a monopoly is at relatively wide liberty to set this price. The very practice of defining different prices to the same products is widely implemented in a market environment and is not at all a typical attribute of monopolies only. Most companies use price differentiation of some kind whether it's a price differentiation of regional markets in a country of origin, a price differentiation between domestic and foreign markets, between wholesale and retail or simply between different customers. Bloom [2] shows, that only small percentage of companies does not use any kind of price differentiation towards its customers at all. In this article we discuss the general aspects of quantitative analysis of monopoly profit differentiation models while analyzing an optimization monopoly profit maximization model in the conditions of perfect price differentiation at a non-linear price setting more closely. This type of price differentiation is also known as second degree price differentiation. In this case a monopoly sets a differentiated price by setting different prices for different purchase volumes.","[Fendek, Michal] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-b, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia; [Fendekova, Eleonora] Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Business Econ, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; University of Economics Bratislava,"Fendek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Dept Operat Res & Econometr, Dolnozemska Cesta 1-b, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",fendek@dec.euba.sk; nfendek@dec.euba.sk,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,167,171,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900029,0

In addition, spreadsheet software is relatively easy to use, and its flexibility makes it useful in many different courses at all levels of the traditional economics curriculum. Spreadsheet programs may be used to assist with such core learning activities as exploring and analysing data, estimating and plotting regression lines, solving complex systems of equations numerically, creating large tables of simulation data, solving optimization problems or conducting statistical analysis. In combination with Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) we can create economic models that can serve as study materials for students of economic schools and help them understand the essence of economic processes taking place in enterprises.

An important tool in solving problems related to cost savings is the full costing approach, a costing method based on the calculation classification of costs, traditionally used in modern enterprises. In the constantly changing conditions of market environment, the importance of new requirements of managers for more detailed classification of cost items in their calculations is growing. Increasingly the emphasis is placed on classification of costs according to their response to changes in production volume. Improved cost management process may be realized through the variable costing approach. This type of calculation allows for an efficient way to drive the costs efficiency. It helps to achieve cost savings and improve efficiency and performance of an enterprise. The paper analyzes both costing approaches and outlines research assumptions associated with using these calculations in business practice. While verifying the research assumptions the author of the paper used outputs from the questionnaire survey that addressed representatives of various business entities. The analyzed results were evaluated and summarized in tables.

Furthermore, to outline the main elements of rural development such as improvements in rural infrastructure and the provision of local services with the objective of strengthening sustainability in rural areas. It is important to consider two factors in relation to dynamic rural development: a) agriculture alone will no longer guarantee the sustainability of rural areas, but it is essential to maintain it; and, b) significant diversity exists within rural areas. The rural areas of EU countries cover 91 percent of agricultural land, with 41.5 percent actively cultivated. However, in the rural areas of the EU-10 high unemployment persists, there is an outflow of inhabitants to cities or abroad and more of the rural population falls into poverty. Our results confirmed that rural areas are fragile when faced with socio- economic and environmental crises. Another important outcome is the fact that in economically stable EU countries, diversification represents a strong feature of rural economies, while in countries affected by the economic crisis; the number of farms with other income activities is significantly lower.","[Kapsdorferova, Zuzana; Filo, Michal; Kadlecikova, Maria] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kapsdorferová, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",zuzana.kapsdorferova@uniag.sk; maria.kadlecikova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,381,388,,,,,,8,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800038,0

J,"Klein, JT",,,,"Klein, Julie Thompson",,,Reprint of Discourses of transdisciplinarity: Looking back to the future,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Transdisciplinarity; Transcendence; Problem-solving; Transgression; Complexity; Contextualization,,"The current ascendancy of transdisciplinarity (TD) is marked by an exponential growth of publications, a widening array of contexts, and increased interest across academic, public and private sectors. This investigation traces historical trends, rhetorical claims, and social formations that have shaped three major discourses of TD: transcendence, problem solving, and transgression. In doing so, it also takes account of developments that have emerged or gained traction since the early 21st century when a 2004 issue of Futures on the same topic was being written. The epistemological problem at the heart of the discourse of transcendence is the idea of unity, traced in the West TD ancient Greece. The emergence of transdisciplinarity was not a complete departure from this historical quest, but it signalled the need for new syntheses at a time of growing fragmentation of knowledge and culture. New synthetic frameworks emerged, including general systems, post/structuralism, feminist theory, and sustainability. New organizations also formed TD advance conceptual frameworks aimed at transcending the narrowness of disciplinary worldviews and interdisciplinary combinations of approaches that did not supplant the status quo of academic structure and classification. The discourse of problem solving is not new. It was fundamental TD conceptions of interdisciplinarity in the first half of the 20th century. Heightened pressure TD solve problems of society, though, fostered growing alignment of TD with solving complex problems as well as trans-sector participation of stakeholders in society and team-based science. The discourse of transgression was forged in critique of the existing system of knowledge and education. TD became aligned with imperatives of cultural critique, sociopolitical movements, and conceptions of post-normal science and wicked problems that break free of reductionist and mechanistic approaches. It also became a recognized premise in interdisciplinary fields, including cultural studies, women's and gender studies, urban studies, and environmental studies. And, calls for TD arrived at a moment of wider crisis in the privileging of dominant forms of knowledge, human rights accountability, and democratic participation. Even with distinct patterns of definition, though, discourses are not air-tight categories. Transcendence was initially an epistemological project, but the claim of transcendence overlaps increasingly with problem solving. The imperatives of transgression also cut discourses of transcendence and problem solving. Broadly speaking, though, emphasis is shifting from traditional epistemology to problem solving, from the pre-given to the emergent, and from universality to hybridity and contextuality.

We use yearly data of sectoral employment and gross value added at the national and NUTS II regional levels for Bratislava Region (BA), Western Slovakia (WS), Central Slovakia (CS) and Eastern Slovakia (ES), classified according the NACE Rev. 2 (Statistical classification of economic activities). Specialization and industry concentration were quantified by entropy index. Selected factors effect on industry concentration development was estimated by econometric model (Vogiatzouglou 2006) modified by Konyova, Bartova (2013). We used three explanatory variables: technological differences, differences in relative factor endowments and economy of scale. Generally, the western part of the country, including Bratislava (capital) region has been more economically developed. We found, that the Slovak economy became more specialized before the SR accession to the EU. After the accession, the most diversified was Bratislava regional economy, but its specialization has been increasing. The most specialized was the Western Slovakia economy. Industry concentration had been declining significantly in the Western Slovakia, while growing in the Middle and stagnating in the Eastern, less developed part of the country and in Bratislava region. Impact of differences in relative factor endowments, scale economy and technological differences variables on sector concentration was highly significant and had, as expected, a positive effect on geographic concentration in the Eastern Slovakia region. We found negative significant effect of relative factor endowments in the Middle Slovakia and negative significant effect of scale economy in the Western Slovakia. Accession of Slovakia to the EU had statistically positive significant effect on sector concentration and negative effect on economy specialization on national level and in the Eastern Slovakia region. Development of sector concentration economy specialization in the remaining parts of Slovakia corresponded with the European Commission (2004) findings that European integration impact on specialization and concentration had been rather insignificant.","[Konyova, Veronika; Bartova, Lubica] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Konyova, V (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Nitra, Slovakia.",xkonyova@is.uniag.sk; Lubica.Bartova@uniag.sk,"Bartova, Lubica/A-9056-2016",,,,,,22,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,459,467,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800046,0

The aim of this article is to point out the benefits and evaluate the quality of management information systems on the base of requirements competitive environment. The realization of this aim is by analysis of management information systems in selected business subjects. To study this issues we used observation methods and directed interview with researchers of software companies and employees of companies who operate with information systems. In the analysis, we focused on the conception of the system, it ' s components, integrity and functional properties, quality, possibilities of development and, of course, we focused on the reliability of systems and it ' s stability. When we took measure the quality of information systems, we used objective, generally applicable and also subjective, individual criteria to determine the effectiveness of selected information systems. The important aspect of succesfull use of management information system is to create a task to build or change the company information system. However, people do not like changes and under the successful and effective implementation of management system they are apllied for changing the way of their work, and it birngs problems. For this reason, the task should be formulated to be clearly, which part of company and its relationships will be transformated and it has to be criteria for the selection of components of information systems and technology, which it will be deployed and which it will participate on the change. The example of wrong approach is the task for implementation of the management information system as a superstructure of company information system. This task is usually created by aksing of supplier from individual managers, which information is needed for their work. The list of chaotic information is emerged, which management information system is not possible to provide, becouse it does not contain this list. It does not take them from anywhere. In many cases, when the management information system was deployed before, nobody did not suppose that requirements of management on the reporting or aggregated information emerge and some management information system will be built. The results of a such implementation is dissatisfaction of managers and according to them management information system is useless and costly, a lot of amount of money and dissatisfaction of implementors who claim that manager is not able to define what they want. Management information systems represent an amount of organized processes of which main element is a human. When change the information systems and technology it is needed to explain to the people which are influenced by it in their job. For managers benefits are important which are brought by implementation of the new system and the return on investment. To qualify benefits and determine return on investment is difficult. According to the research, quatifiable benefits are in the fields of warehouse management and personal management. Qualitative benefits are in the field of quicker access to the required information, in the possibility of multidimensional analysis, multicriterial reviewes. The biggiest benefit is in the improve decission-making which leads to competitiveness in the domestic and foreign market. On the base of realised analysis we point out on the demand and possibility of quicker processing of permanently increasing number of information and their more efficient use for direction and deciding of magers using business.

In the literature devoted to the influence of FDI on economies, the research about the determinants of the geographical pattern of FDI distribution usually focuses on the factors that determine why some states manage to draw FDI in higher levels than some other states. However, not many studies deal with the GDP per capita as a determinant why some states (i. e. their economies) are more attractive to the FDI than others. Our research focused on the transitional economies of Central and Eastern Europe. Among the states studied, we have equally studied the EU members from Central and Eastern Europe, as well as the non-EU members. By using two variables, FDI and GDP per capita, this research will determine how much FDI correlate to the standard of living represented through GDP per capita for each state surveyed. Research results will show if FDI and GDP per capita are positively correlated, which represents our research hypothesis no. 1 and if that correlation is more significant in non-EU states, which represents our hypothesis no. 2. States surveyed in this research were put into three geopolitical groups: two groups of non-EU states compared to a group of more recent EU states. The methodology is based on the calculation of Pearson's correlation matrix of GDP per capita and FDI for each state and the comparison of median correlation results between the mentioned groups of states. The period surveyed was between 1994 and 2013. We have tried to find similarities and differences between these two groups of states in order to determine the influence of EU membership on the correlation between FDI and GDP per capita.","[Kurecic, Petar; Simovic, Vladimir] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Luburic, Goran] Zagreb Sch Business, Ulica Grada Vukovara 68, Zagreb, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; goran.luburic@vpsz.hr; vladimir.simovic@unin.hr,"Simovic, Vladimir/CAI-8909-2022; Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017","Simovic, Vladimir/0000-0002-6441-833X;",,,,,6,2,2,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,192,199,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000019,0

Starting from a review of current legislation, I continue the analysis with particular reference to the various types of non-bank lenders in the market and the respective different operating methods used to provide their services. The analysis shows that although each of these operators is able to provide effective solutions in terms of financial inclusion, none is able to offer actual solutions in terms of financial sustainability. No model was found to be uniquely superior to others. Moreover, despite the wide institutional variety, a best practice benchmark cannot be currently identified. Drawing on this research, I identify three main objectives of the microfinance industry: (i) Provide access to capital in order to help vulnerable individuals and families at risk of sliding deeper into poverty and social and financial exclusion; (ii) Provide financial literacy, monitoring, and tutoring in order to avoid excessive debt load; (iii) Prevent and fight the phenomena of usury. I also identify common general issues faced by microcredit: (i) The lack of new and innovative strategies of risk management that also include soft information; (ii) Developing the ability to face high costs which are mainly due to activities aimed at collecting intangible information, promoting financial literacy and guiding the beneficiary throughout the life-time of the loan; (iii) Achievement of the sustainability of the business over time. In order to address the issues highlighted in this analysis, especially achieving the financial sustainability of microfinance institutions, the intervention of the legislator is needed. Indeed, the legislator should not solely focus on the characteristics of the beneficiary but should also help design a viable  loan delivery process in order to define the key elements of the process of microcredit (i.e., monitoring, scoring, tutoring).","[Pellegrini, Francesca] Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Pellegrini, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Bologna, Italy.",francesca.pellegrin7@unibo.it,,,,,,,27,1,1,1,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,329,340,,,,,,12,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000030,0

The basic concept of regional competitiveness and comparative advantage is explained in the theoretical part of the paper. The second part is focused on the reduction of inputs' dimension and on a creation of new immeasurable factors of comparative advantages by using factor analysis. In the last part a multivariate classification of regions is realised based on created factors of comparative advantages through cluster analysis.

Compiled database contains a wide range of variables, which cover not only economic, but also social, demographic, technological and research fields. 16 variables, standing on the side of inputs. Analyses are made for year 2010, using software Statgraphics, SAS and GIS.

According to results, the most effective way how to improve comparative advantages of regions is to invest more funds in research, science and technology and higher education. On the base of multivariate classification of selected regions, the significant differences between regions are found. Great differences are especially between capital regions and other regions of Slovak Republic, Czech Republic and Romania. The most competitive regions according comparative advantages are German regions, situated in cluster The best labour market and the highest innovative potential. 6 Romanian regions, situated in cluster The lowest quality of human capital, the worst demography and the highest employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing are least competitive.","[Sojkova, Zlata; Citaryova, Eva; Palkovic, Jozef] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Sojkova, Z (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",Zlata.Sojkova@uniag.sk; xcitaryova@is.uniag.sk; jozef.palkovic@uniag.sk,"Palkovič, Jozef/IUO-3489-2023",,,,,,12,0,0,0,5,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1055,1063,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800101,0

The choice of an institution is described by the equilibrium of a mathematical model that minimizes transactions costs subject to a transacting constraint, in a manner similar to the cost-minimization model of the firm. The model introduces the notion that institutions are characterized by vertical and horizontal relationships, which affect both the production of transactions through a transactions function, and the cost of transactions, through a transactions cost function. The equilibrium illustrates that particular exogenously determined parameters affect the mix of vertical and horizontal relationships that make up the optimum governing institution. It also determines the level of transactions costs as a function of the rate of transacting. The model is used to predict how the mix of vertical and horizontal relations and, therefore, the nature of institutions, respond to changes in parameters such as the number of transactors, asymmetry of knowledge, measurability of the object of exchange, negotiating and enforcement costs, etc.","[Toumanoff, Peter] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Box 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA",Marquette University,"Toumanoff, P (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Box 1881, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",peter.toumanoff@mu.edu,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,829,834,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900142,0

The case study was undertaken within traditional communities located in Boa Vista do Ramos County, Amazonas State. With environmental issues surrounding tropical forest becoming increasingly disputed, traditional logging activities performed by locals came to be regarded as illegal. We believe that despite significant efforts to promote CFM initiatives, principally undertaken via public policy, small loggers have in fact had little success adapting to this new legal context. The results demonstrated that when small-scale loggers where supported by specific regulations and some external assistance they were able to collectivize their activities, forming the Community Association of Agricultural and Forest Products Harvesting (ACAF). After meeting challenges to strengthen their technical, social and managerial aspects, ACAF obtained environmental licenses and forest certification. However subsequent changes in forest policies lead to the termination of CFM-oriented regulations and ACAF weakened. Nevertheless, the social and human capital that had been developed in the collective ended up being successfully applied to other individual small-scale projects in the same region. We condude that despite the community loggers' success in establishing a new and more sustainable way of working, they were not able to continue these activities within this new legal environment. The policies and laws that apply to CFM are more oriented to conservation goals than to meeting the demands of producers and contributing to their livelihoods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Observed indicators are composition and volume of total government expenditures and through budget constrain also tax burden of individual taxes. These indicators are used within endogenous growth model together with capital stock and approximation of human capital. A panel regression with fixed effects is used as an analytic tool. Results show which composition of government expenditures is growth-friendly. Every policy maker must also take into consideration a trade-off between an increase of public expenditures and raising taxes to achieve a balanced government budget. For that reason impacts of various taxes on the economic growth were examined to find out which tax is strongly distortionary.

A dynamic capital adjustment model for U.S. softwood stumpage markets is developed, and compared to a traditional lagged adjustment model. The results show that timber markets in the U.S. adjusted to the large supply shock of the late 1980's over a 5 to 8 year period. Our short-run price elasticity estimates are similar to the existing literature, ranging from -0.002 to -0253, although our estimates show that the demand is substantially more elastic in the long-run, with long run elasticity estimates ranging from -0.134 to -0.506. If this adjustment in the demand function is taken into account when calculating welfare effects, the effects of the supply shock in timber markets of the late 1980's on consumer surplus declines by over 50% compared to the estimated effects when using the short-run model, and the total welfare effects decline by 37%.

Empirical investigation of this relationship in previous research was hampered by the difficulty of measuring labor demand. I construct a measure of labor demand in seven fields in the humanities and social sciences based on the annual number of job listings from 1975 to 2005. My empirical strategy relates variation over time in the number of job listings within a field to the timing of completion using student-level data on all doctorates awarded in these fields by U.S. universities. Estimates indicate that the number of job listings is not correlated with expected time to degree. This finding implies that cyclical variation in labor demand is not responsible for changes in time to degree within fields.,"[Groen, Jeffrey A.] US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA",United States Department of Labor,"Groen, JA (通讯作者)，US Bur Labor Stat, Washington, DC 20212 USA.",Groen.Jeffrey@bls.gov,"Groen, Jeffrey/S-2573-2019","Groen, Jeffrey/0000-0003-1905-7026",,,,,31,3,3,0,81,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The most obvious mechanism is through vitamin D absorption, which could explain racial disparities in birth weight because skin pigmentation inhibits this process. However, sunshine may have additional effects and is closely connected to environmental factors, season of birth, and geography. Combining daily weather data with 1989-2004 birth outcomes from the Natality Detail Files, we estimate sunshine's effects in a range of models that disentangle these confounding factors. Our results suggest that sunshine has a positive but diminishing effect on birth weight for blacks and a negative effect for whites. These findings are consistent with the presumed positive but diminishing effects of sunshine via vitamin D balanced against the possible negative effects via folic acid depletion and immune system impairment. The estimated magnitudes are in line with those found for other key factors such as feeding programs and air pollution and suggest that sunshine's effects explain a nontrivial portion of racial differences in birth weight. Implications include possible interventions (vitamin supplementation for blacks, sun avoidance for whites) and the need to include sunshine as a potentially important factor in birth outcomes research.","[Trudeau, Jennifer] Sacred Heart Univ, Dept Business Econ, Fairfield, CT USA; [Conway, Karen Smith] Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [Menclova, Andrea Kutinova] Univ Canterbury, Dept Econ & Finance, Christchurch, New Zealand",Sacred Heart University; University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; University of Canterbury,"Conway, KS (通讯作者)，Univ New Hampshire, Dept Econ, Durham, NH 03824 USA.",karen.conway@unh.edu,,,,,,,102,8,10,0,100,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Through this we show that metaphors, in conjunction with discourses, may work to: naturalise and privilege certain constructions of problems; attribute blame and responsibility; support claims about the urgency and extent of required intervention (and who should deliver it, to whom and how); influence the identification and consideration of solutions by constructing the problem in particular ways; intentionally or unintentionally result in stigmatisation and non-trivial discrimination (social and workplace); and erase or highlight the role of actors, processes, social relations and systems. Vallis has developed the analysis, the bulk of the paper, and Inayatullah has articulated the theoretical links to causal layered analaysis (CLA). While there are multiple ways to use CLA, in this paper we use CLA to map a number of issues accross perspectives and frames, and to deconstruct creating the possibility for alternative futures. We do not explore alternative or preferred futures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this article was to investigate which multiple imputation strategy is most appropriate to use for missing cost-effectiveness data in a randomized controlled trial. Three incomplete data sets were generated from a complete reference data set with 17, 35 and 50 % missing data in effects and costs. The strategies evaluated included complete case analysis (CCA), multiple imputation with predictive mean matching (MI-PMM), MI-PMM on log-transformed costs (log MI-PMM), and a two-step MI. Mean cost and effect estimates, standard errors and incremental net benefits were compared with the results of the analyses on the complete reference data set. The CCA, MI-PMM, and the two-step MI strategy diverged from the results for the reference data set when the amount of missing data increased. In contrast, the estimates of the Log MI-PMM strategy remained stable irrespective of the amount of missing data. MI provided better estimates than CCA in all scenarios. With low amounts of missing data the MI strategies appeared equivalent but we recommend using the log MI-PMM with missing data greater than 35 %.","[Vroomen, Janet MacNeil; Eekhout, Iris; Dijkgraaf, Marcel G.; van Hout, Hein; de Rooij, Sophia E.; Heymans, Martijn W.; Bosmans, Judith E.] Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center Amsterdam,"Vroomen, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Acad Med Ctr, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",j.l.macneil-vroomen@amc.uva.nl,"Vroomen, Janet MacNeil/M-5358-2017","Vroomen, Janet MacNeil/0000-0001-6400-7189; Heymans, Martijn/0000-0002-3889-0921; van Hout, Hein/0000-0002-2495-4808; Bosmans, Judith/0000-0002-1443-1026",,,,,31,28,29,0,5,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this paper, we take an entrepreneurial finance perspective to examine the investment attitudes and behaviours of business angels. These represent the biggest source of external risk capital for new and young growing companies and therefore play a critical role in entrepreneurial ecosystems. Drawing on both a detailed review of previous research on business angel investment time horizons, investor engagement and exit behaviour and new survey evidence we conclude that only a minority of angels could be defined as being exit-centric investors. It can be concluded that the majority of angels are patient investors in terms of investment intentions, engagement and exit behaviour, largely by default rather than intent. Most do not consider the exit at the investment appraisal stage nor the need for patience.","[Harrison, Richard T.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Harrison, Richard T.] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Ctr Strateg Leadership, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Botelho, Tiago] Univ East Anglia, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England; [Mason, Colin M.] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Edinburgh; University of Edinburgh; University of East Anglia; University of Glasgow,"Harrison, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Ctr Entrepreneurship Res, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.;Harrison, RT (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Ctr Strateg Leadership, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",r.harrison@ed.ac.uk,,"Harrison, Richard/0000-0002-0154-0039",,,,,89,14,15,2,49,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Now, the industry is required to submit a dossier to the GBA (the central decision body in the German sickness fund system) to show additional benefit. After granting the magnitude of the additional benefit by the GBA, the manufacturer is entitled to negotiate the reimbursement price with the GKV-SV (National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds). The reimbursement price is defined as a discount on the drug price at launch. As the price or discount negotiations between the manufacturers and the GKV-SV takes place behind closed doors, the factors influencing the results of the negotiation are not known. Objectives: The aim of this evaluation is to identify factors influencing the results of the AMNOG price negotiation process. Methods: The analysis was based on a dataset containing detailed information on all assessments until the end of 2015. A descriptive analysis was followed by an econometric analysis of various potential factors (benefit rating, size of target population, deviating from appropriate comparative therapy and incorporation of HRQoL-data). Results: Until December 2015, manufacturers and the GKV-SV finalized 96 negotiations in 193 therapeutic areas, based on assessment conducted by the GBA. The GBA has granted an additional benefit to 100/193 drug innovations. Negotiated discount was significantly higher for those drugs without additional benefit (p = 0.030) and non-orphan drugs (p = 0.015). Smaller population size, no deviation from recommended appropriate comparative therapy and the incorporation of HRQoL-data were associated with a lower discount on the price at launch. However, neither a uni-nor the multivariate linear regression showed enough power to predict the final discount. Conclusions: Although the AMNOG regulation implemented binding and strict rules for the benefit assessment itself, the outcome of the discount negotiations are still unpredictable. Obviously, negotiation tactics, the current political situation and soft factors seem to play a more influential role for the outcome of the negotiations than the five hard and known factors analyzed in this study. Further research is needed to evaluate additional factors.","[Theidel, Ulrike] Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [Von der Schulenburg, J-Matthias Graf] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Theidel, U (通讯作者)，Xcenda GmbH, Lange Laube 31, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",ulrike.theidel@xcenda.de,,,,,,,24,14,15,2,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

In this article, an innovation diffusion model implemented via system dynamics simulation is used to operationalize the link between foresight and planning. It helps company decision makers visualize the diffusion process of the innovation inhabiting the chosen technology and determine the critical parameters quantitatively through experiments and analysis. Using these results, possible paths leading to the desired future of the chosen technology can be generated and plans be prepared to guide the effective development of the technology, essential infrastructure, and key applications.

Mediating these problems requires effective and applicable policy, formulated from a sound base of evidence. Thus, the quality of information is of primary importance in formulating appropriate forest fire combating policy. While the media is obligated to provide credible information, it often does so without scientific expertise. This study indicates that most interviewed stakeholders believe that scientists can deliver reliable information in policy agenda-setting, and therefore, the voices of scientists in the media have the potential to influence policy agenda-setting through their role as issue advocates. This study, however, confirms that the news media does not recognize the knowledge of scientists as the most reliable reference in forest fire discourse. The weak knowledge utilization of news' substance is reflected in the minimal coverage of scientists in media discourses. This study examines the presentation of scientists in forest fire media discourse and stakeholders' perceptions of this presentation, in order to analyze the role of scientists in forest fire media discourse and its potential to influence and set policy agendas in Indonesia.

Learning environments in small and large public high schools in New York City,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Small schools; Learning environment; School climate; New small and old small schools,SIZE; PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION; BEHAVIOR; OUTCOMES; CHOICE,"Over the past two decades, high school reform has been characterized by a belief that smaller is better. Much of the expected academic benefit from attending small schools has been credited to their better learning environments. There is little empirical support for this claim, however, and the existing research fails to provide causal evidence. Moreover, recent studies in New York City have shown that students attending newly created small schools do better academically relative to students attending both large and older established small schools. Are these differences in academic outcomes also mirrored by differences in learning environments? In this paper, we address this question by exploring the impact of attending large compared to small high schools on students' learning environments, considering the differences between small high schools formed in two different eras with different missions and resources. We use a unique data set of school and student-level data from New York City public high school students entering 9th grade in 2008-09 and 2009-10 to examine students' attitudes about school learning environments along three dimensions: interpersonal relationships, academic expectations and support, and social behavior and safety. While OLS results show that students attending small schools (new and old) perceive better learning environments, instrumenting for selection into these schools challenges those results.

Comparative static analyses are conducted to determine the impacts of the probability of increasing and constant wildfire risk as forest stand ages, and portion of stand that is salvageable following a wildfire, on slash pine harvest decisions. Our results reveal that increasing the current risk of wildfire damage would shorten the current optimal slash pine harvest age, while increasing the future risk of wildfire losses would lengthen the current optimal harvest age. We also compare the impacts of different wildfire arrival paths (rising and constant arrival rate with stand age) on the optimal forest management of slash pine. Under the generalized model, increases in future rising wildfire risks have less impact than increases in future constant wildfire risks on the optimal harvest ages for the current crop. Increases in the current rising risk of wildfires have a similar impact on the optimal harvest age compared to increases in the current constant risk of wildfires. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Qualitative differences in the implementation of governance initiatives between the CFUGs emphasize their respective respondents' difference in satisfaction, and have policy implications.

Evidence from the early 2000s,HEALTH ECONOMICS REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medicaid; Labor supply; Food stamps,,"In the early 2000s, Arizona, Maine, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, and Vermont expanded Medicaid to cover more low-income individuals, primarily childless adults. This change provides the researcher with an opportunity to analyze the effects of these expansions on labor supply and welfare enrollment. I use a large data set of 176 counties over 7 years, including 3 years of pre-expansion period, 1 year of implementation year, and 3 years of post-expansion period. Using a difference-in-differences approach, I find the most-affected counties had a 1.4 percentage-point more decline in labor force participation rate in comparison to other counties. Furthermore, I observe a 0.32 h decrease in average weekly hours and a 1.1 % increase in average weekly wages. This indicates labor supply was affected more than labor demand. I also observe a 0.49 % increase in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) enrollment after the Medicaid expansions. These results are robust to an alternative identification of the most-affected counties, inclusion of counties from comparison states, limiting the control group to only high-poverty counties from comparison states, exclusion of county-specific time trends, and different configuration of clustered errors. My findings provide early insights on the potential effects of new Medicaid expansions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), since 82 % of those newly eligible are expected to be childless adults.","[Agirdas, Cagdas] Univ Tampa, Sykes Coll Business, Box O,401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA",University of Tampa,"Agirdas, C (通讯作者)，Univ Tampa, Sykes Coll Business, Box O,401 W Kennedy Blvd, Tampa, FL 33606 USA.",cagirdas@ut.edu,,,,,,,9,3,3,0,6,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We estimate time series of habit levels and develop an indicator (the hardship index) to describe the economic hardship of consumers. The higher the level of the index, the worse off consumers are. As a rational response to such a bad situation, some consumers might commit suicide.

Using the state average and standard deviation in NAEP test scores in 4th, 8th and 12th grades, we estimate the impacts of state entry-age policies on educational achievement and test score dispersion in the state. The estimation results from the baseline state and time fixed effects model show that a one month earlier cutoff increases average state reading and math scores of 4th graders by 21.7 and 13.6 percent of a standard deviation, respectively. Eighth graders' average score increases in math and science are 12.4 and 24.3 percent of a standard deviation, respectively, while the effect on reading score significantly decreases. We find no effect of kindergarten entry date on educational outcomes in 12th grade. We also find that an earlier kindergarten entry date generally reduces the standard deviation of state test scores. Robustness checks support these findings and suggest no evidence of endogeneity of the policy changes. Our findings provide novel evidence that early school start cutoffs have improved state-level achievement measures over the past 40 years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The time horizon, i.e. the future time period for which effects are included in the analysis, is seldom longer than 40-50 years, and nuclear waste is the only area in which a time horizon longer than 100 years is used regularly. Discount rates for non-commercial purposes vary between 2 per cent and 4 per cent, with 4 per cent as the most common rate. The differences between policy areas appear to be unsystematic and insufficiently justified. We suggest that there may be a need for coordination and, possibly, harmonization, of the choices of time horizons and discount rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

That change has profound implications for the global economy and for international political economy scholarship. This article explains how that change occurred in order to explore how the incorporation of regulation affects trade and illuminate the politics that surround the negotiation over these regulatory trade barriers. As tarts and other non-regulatory measures were reduced, the extent to which cross-national differences in regulation impeded trade became more apparent, especially to multinational firms which pushed for attenuations of these regulatory trade barriers. Once regulations became the subject of trade negotiations in the 1980s, civil society groups with a vested interested in those regulations became involved in trade politics to a greater degree than ever before. These developments have shaped the major trade negotiations underway today and are likely to remain at the centre of trade politics for the foreseeable future.","[Winslett, Gary] Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Winslett, G (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Polit Sci, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",Gary.Winslett@gmail.com,,,,,,,70,12,12,1,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

This approach is applicable to evaluate the severity of potential losses from existing data records; therefore, it is useful in many areas of economics and risk evaluation. The procedure is based on an initial parametric model assumption and then a nonparametric correction is introduced. In addition, a second correction is proposed so that the value at risk estimator is asymptotically optimal. Our procedure allows smoothing the tail behavior of the empirical distribution. Due to the lack of sample information for extreme values, smoothness in the tail cannot he achieved if classical nonparametric estimators are used.

In the context of a larger nationwide study, we aimed to assess the total annual direct and indirect costs associated with CP in Portugal. A population-based study was conducted in a representative sample of the Portuguese adult population. The 5,094 participants were selected using random digit dialling and contacted by computer-assisted telephone interviews. Questionnaires included the brief pain inventory and pain disability index. Estimates were adequately weighted for the population. From all CP subjects identified, a subsample (n = 562) accepted to participate in this economic study. Mean total annualised costs per CP subject of (sic) 1,883.30 were observed, amounting to (sic) 4,611.69 million nationally, with 42.7 % direct and 57.3 % indirect costs, and corresponding to 2.71 % of the Portuguese annual GDP in 2010. Only socio-demographic variables were significantly and independently associated with CP costs, and not CP severity, raising the possibility of existing inequalities in the distribution of healthcare in Portugal. The high economic impact of CP in Portugal was comprehensively demonstrated. Given the high indirect costs observed, restricting healthcare services is not a rational response to these high societal costs; instead improving the quality of CP prevention and management is recommended.","[Azevedo, Luis Filipe; Costa-Pereira, Altamiro; Dias, Claudia Camila] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Informat & Decis Sci CIDES, Rua Dr Placido Costa S-N, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal; [Azevedo, Luis Filipe; Costa-Pereira, Altamiro; Dias, Claudia Camila] Univ Porto, Ctr Res Hlth Technol & Informat Syst CINTESIS, Oporto, Portugal; [Azevedo, Luis Filipe; Costa-Pereira, Altamiro; Mendonca, Liliane; Castro-Lopes, Jose M.] Portuguese Natl Pain Observ, OBSERVDOR, Ctr Nacl Observacao Dor, Oporto, Portugal; [Castro-Lopes, Jose M.] Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Expt Biol, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal; [Castro-Lopes, Jose M.] Univ Porto, Inst Mol & Cell Biol IBMC, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Azevedo, LF (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Fac Med, Dept Hlth Informat & Decis Sci CIDES, Rua Dr Placido Costa S-N, P-4200319 Oporto, Portugal.",lazevedo@med.up.pt,"Dias, Claudia Camila/N-7130-2014; Azevedo, Luís/J-7819-2012; Costa-Pereira, Altamiro/I-5987-2012; Castro-Lopes, Jose/J-9346-2013","Dias, Claudia Camila/0000-0001-9356-3272; Azevedo, Luís/0000-0002-8421-2937; Costa-Pereira, Altamiro/0000-0001-8467-6398; Castro-Lopes, Jose/0000-0002-0357-7409; Mendonca, Liliane/0000-0003-1057-7893",Portuguese local office of Grunenthal; Portuguese local office of Pfizer; Portuguese local office of Janssen-Cilag,Portuguese local office of Grunenthal; Portuguese local office of Pfizer; Portuguese local office of Janssen-Cilag,"This work was financially supported by equal unrestricted research grants from the Portuguese local offices of Grunenthal, Pfizer, and Janssen-Cilag and support obtained through a protocol established between the Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, and the Directorate-General of Health (Direccao Geral de Saude, DGS) and the Central Administration of the National Health System (Administracao Central do Sistema de Saude, ACSS) of the Portuguese Ministry of Health (Ministerio da Saude) as part of the National Program for Pain Control (Programa Nacional de Controlo da Dor).

Based on this conceptual background, the aim of this study is twofold: 1) to directly address the issue of fractal dimension estimation by discussing some estimators which are more frequently used in literature and, respectively, 2) to provide empirical evidences for the potential fractal properties from nine important emergent markets.

The formation of the knowledge economy is one of the trends of recent decades, when there is the increasing role of knowledge and information in the world economic system. The main mechanism of functioning of the new economy is the market of intellectual property, where the income is intellectual rent. Intellectual rent is an important structural element in the development of modern economy based on knowledge, as there is a gradual replacement of natural-resource rents that makes intelligent income is a determining factor of social development. The ability to generate innovations and to obtain excess profits at the expense of appropriation of the intellectual rent is of great importance to create and maintain competitive advantages of the company in a new economy. Thus, in today's economy intellectual rent takes on a special role in long-term socio-economic development of the country and its regions, as is one of the indicators of optimal use of factors of production and sustainability of existing rent relations. The purpose of the study. The article is aimed at studying and systematization of methodical approaches to assessment of intellectual rent. Methods. The article makes use of empirical methods in the study of intellectual rent, General scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, and methods of statistical information processing.

In addition, a survey was conducted to gather data on the students' personal characteristics to determine their effect on the learning process. Retained learning prevailed for most items, followed by zero learning and positive learning. To determine which factors influence beginning students' acquisition of economic knowledge and lead to positive learning, regression analyses were conducted, and the findings are discussed critically.","[Happ, Roland; Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, Olga; Schmidt, Susanne] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Law Management & Econ, Jakob Welder Weg 9, D-55099 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, O (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Dept Law Management & Econ, Jakob Welder Weg 9, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",troitschanskaia@uni-mainz.de,"Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, O./AAM-8286-2020","Zlatkin-Troitschanskaia, Olga/0000-0002-7431-9538",,,,,31,14,15,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Currently the passengers have much wider choice to select the departure airport and route as well, which leads to airport substitution. Phenomenon, that airports should take into consider is called Airport traffic leakage. It represents the situation when decrease of the volume of passenger occurs on small airports at the expense of large airports with extensive services. The aim of this paper is to describe the competitive position of airports in the Czech Republic and its neighboring areas by using various analyzes. Commonly used method how to measure competition between airports is to create lists of airports ranked by total number of transported passengers or cargo and number of aircraft movements at the airport. More sophisticated method used in the paper is based on geographical overlaps between airport catchment areas by using isochrones maps. Isochrones maps gave us a rough estimation of what airports in the country might compete with each other based on travel times between airports. To validate the dependence between transportation performances of various airports was also used correlation analysis because it allowed verification of the dependence on the basis of numerical calculations, and therefore gave more reliable results than other methods.","[Hermankova, Lenka; Melichar, Vlastimil] Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Hermánková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Melichar, Vlastimil/W-9412-2018","Melichar, Vlastimil/0000-0001-8232-1614",,,,,10,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,27,34,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200004,0

The paper shows that the US designers of the ITO preferred and pursued formal voting equality because they reasoned it served the institution's intended functions and purposes better than weighted voting. But, as the negotiations undermined US priorities, particularly on balance of payment (BOP) questions, the designers presented a proposal for mirroring the IMF's weighted voting at the ITO. They, however, returned to their original proposal of voting equality when the ultimate draft of the ITO reflected their key preferences without resorting to weighted voting. By closely tracing the drafters' thinking throughout the evolution of the negotiations, the paper contributes to understanding the design of multilateral institutions as well as US behavior in the creation of the post-war multilateral system.","[Kaya, Ayse] Swarthmore Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA",Swarthmore College,"Kaya, A (通讯作者)，Swarthmore Coll, Dept Polit Sci, Swarthmore, PA 19081 USA.",akayaor1@swarthmore.edu,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2016,15,1.0,,,,,25,49,,10.1017/S1474745615000506,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372460500003,0

As for the group attributes of cross-border M&As, shareholders of small firms with high ROA do not like cross-border M&As, because the shareholders of small acquiring firms with sufficient internal growth factors are reluctant to transfer their present wealth to shareholders of foreign target firms. We also verify that the diversification effect with regard to cross-border M&As is accompanied by the diversification discount, but that firms with ample internal funds due to their high ROA like entering into new industries through cross-border M&As. Lastly, when target companies are listed in countries with highly uncertain GDP growth rates, acquiring firms' value decreased.","[Kim, Byoung-jin; Jung, Jin-young] Inha Univ, Sch Business Adm, 6-103,Inharo 100, Inchon, South Korea",Inha University,"Jung, JY (通讯作者)，Inha Univ, Sch Business Adm, 6-103,Inharo 100, Inchon, South Korea.",jyjung@inha.ac.kr,,,Inha University Research Grant,Inha University Research Grant,We appreciate the Inha University Research Grant.,,43,2,2,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This industry is also important for the Czech economy as an appreciable source of income for the state budget in terms of tax collection. Specifically, it is revenue 4.61 billion CZK / year on excise duty and the estimated 11.75 billion in VAT in the year 2014. Over 93% of the beer production is produced by industrial breweries which total number is 47 in the country. The article analyses the development of the brewing industry in the Czech Republic based on the latest available data from the accounting statements of 20 industrial breweries. All of the key factors are considered, especially, the factors affecting consumption and financial stability and prosperity of brewing industry. The analysis includes prediction of future developments in the susceptibility to bankruptcy through the bankruptcy model called Karas & Reznzkova Index. Ability to create economic value added is then predicted using a financial model called IN05 Index with an updated threshold for credibility prediction. The analysis shows that the average ROE in the industry was 10.27% from 2012 to 2014 but the average increase of ROE between 2012 and 2014 was 0% and from 2013 to 2014 even a decrease of minus 0.10%. This implies that brewing industry is stagnating. Models Karas & Reznakova Index and IN05 Index indicate more comprehensive view allowing to predict the future. 17 from 20 tested breweries should gain positive economic value added one year later with a probability of 74.35% according to IN05 Index. However two of them also show symptoms of distress according to Karas & Reznakova Index. One of them shows distress with probability 15.57% and the second one with a probability of 30.59%. Three remaining breweries with negative economic value added should be financially stable with a ROE below the boundaries of implied cost of equity. From this we can deduce the positive development of this industry for the future.","[Kubenka, Michal; Myskova, Renata; Felgrova, Monika] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kubenka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Myskova, Renata/HLP-5625-2023",,SGS,SGS,This contribution was made with the financial support of SGS 2016.,,9,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,197,204,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200026,0

This presents a challenge to national forest agencies charged with the task of translating forest policy into practice. Drawing on interviews with forest consultants employed by the Swedish Forest Agency, this paper discusses the challenges present in everyday advisory practice, how they are dealt with, and possible implications for forest policy. Four main challenges are identified: climate change; the heterogeneity of forest owners; resource constraints and funding cutbacks; and competing and conflicting advice. The analysis finds that the forest consultants have developed the following professional capacities to meet these challenges: articulating uncertainties, advocating risk diversification, and using historical references to handle the long-term risk associated with climate change; contextualizing the advice to meet the needs of a heterogeneous group of forest owners; and organizational decoupling, whereby consultants prioritize advisory activities at the expense of other tasks. The study concludes by discussing the implications of these strategies for the forest consultants and forest policy but also what can be learned from the Swedish experience. (C) 2015 The Authors.

We find that there has been a significant increase in dividend payout levels which coincide with improvements in legal shareholder protection. State controlled firms are more frequent dividend payers as compared to other majority owned firms. We also find that dual share firms, in which corporate charters protect minority interests, have a higher dividend pay probability; while firms reporting according to US GAAP, which may be less likely to manipulate earnings, have a lower dividend payout.","[Liljeblom, Eva; Maury, Benjamin] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Stat, POB 479, Helsinki 00101, Finland",Hanken School of Economics,"Liljeblom, E; Maury, B (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Finance & Stat, POB 479, Helsinki 00101, Finland.",eva.liljeblom@hanken.fi,"Liljeblom, Eva/M-8099-2015","Liljeblom, Eva/0000-0003-4924-6426",Academy of Finland (the Russia in flux-program),Academy of Finland (the Russia in flux-program),Financial support from the Academy of Finland (the Russia in flux-program) is gratefully acknowledged.,,45,14,15,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Based on (1) to (3), as the ratio of defense spending increases, an arms race, higher economic growth and lower inflation coexist in China and Japan.

The vegetal production, follows the evolution previously presented as globally. In case of livestock production, timid increases were noted in the case the years 2013 and 2014. As a result, the average period was above par compared to 2012 and below par compared to 2014. Evolution of production provided by agriculture services has been an ascending one, dynamics being dominated by the values of above par indices used. Nationally, total agricultural production structure is dominated by vegetable sector with 65.86%, followed at a considerable distance by livestock production sector with 33.10%, and agriculture services sector with 1.04%. The regional structure of total production highlights the fact that - under zonal report - the largest share is held by the South Region, followed by the North-East and South -East Region.","[Medelete, Dragos Mihai; Panzaru, Radu Lucian] Univ Craiova, Fac Agron, Craiova, Romania",University of Craiova,"Medelete, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Craiova, Fac Agron, Craiova, Romania.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,873,880,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100114,0

Effectiveness of net working capital investments is only one from possible explanations of liquidity measures in enterprises. Too small net working capital leads some enterprises to negative changes in their sale levels and as effect to weaker profits. Destruction of cash revenues creation possibilities is dangerous for them and is hard to rebuild possibilities to create cash revenues. Financially efficient working capital decisions predicts that before the crisis, during the crisis and after the crisis phases are connected with higher levels of working capital in processing enterprises. Investments in liquidity are a hedging instrument against individual risk sensitivity that is higher in crisis affected times. The paper aim is to compare real economy data with financially efficient working capital decisions predictions. The financially efficient working capital decisions model expected that liquidity measures like current liquidity indicator should be treated as forecasting indicator about future risk sensitivity of the entities.

This article aims to demonstrate the significant socio-economic impacts of tourist activity on the local economy of a selected city listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic. To meet these goals, primary data were collected through observation, structured interviews and field observations. In addition to statistical methods such as time series analysis, index analysis, correlation analysis was also used to measure the number of jobs generated by tourism, which is one of the main benefits of tourism to the local economy. The analysis shows that tourism generates significant revenue for the local economy of the city of Cesky, Krumlov. The most important socio-economic contribution is employment: tourism directly employs 3,700 persons in the Cesky Krumlov City, considering both the seasonality of the work and structure of the accommodation establishments, which have 4,582 beds. Tourism is a prominent business activity influencing the labor market while contributing to creation of tax income within the framework of the city budget tax revenue. Tourism has a significant impact on the city budget revenues in the form of local taxes and fees. The most important are incomes from the local fee for accommodation and the local fee for a spa or leisure stay. In 2000-2014, more than 1.92 million EUR were collected in the Cesky Krumlov City by these two aforementioned fees alone.","[Plzakova, Lucie; Kalabisova, Jana; Tittelbachova, Sarka; Studnicka, Petr] Inst Hospitality Management Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",,"Plzáková, L (通讯作者)，Inst Hospitality Management Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Plzáková, Lucie/AAE-4027-2021","Plzáková, Lucie/0000-0002-0750-7643",public funds of Cesky Krumlov Municipality; Institute of Hospitality Management in Prague [MECK-PSCR1VSH-2014],public funds of Cesky Krumlov Municipality; Institute of Hospitality Management in Prague,"The above study was possible due to the project which was supported by public funds of Cesky Krumlov Municipality and private sources come from the local entrepreneurs.

The knowledge base provides a controlled vocabulary and allows storing information retrieval. The semantic catalogue facilitates the access to data sources adapted to user's and agent's needs. The reasoner analyzes the information in the knowledge base thus replying to the user queries. In addition, the reasoner aims at adding automatically new data sources in the semantic catalogue.

Generally, it is accepted that the implementation of high performance working practice, which contains different forms of incentive compensation, leads to the higher level of organizational outcomes (financial-in terms of profitability, market share and sales; organizational-in terms of productivity, quality, and HRM outcomes-in terms of turnover, satisfaction, absenteeism, and engagement). These researches are usually based on the exploration of managerial compensation and profitability. On the other hand, there are fewer researches on the relations regarding the usage of performance-based pay for all categories of employees and organizational results. The aim of this research is to explore the differences between the levels of profitability and productivity in relation with the usage of different elements of performance-based pay for employees. The research was conducted on the basis of Cranet project results in the Republic of Serbia in 2015. The methodology of the research included the development of research hypotheses on the basis of past researches and HR theory on employees' compensation and implementation of several statistical techniques (descriptive statistics, Spearman's Rho correlation, ANOVA tests and Welch ANOVA test). Results indicate that there are positive relations between incentives and profitability and productivity of organizations in Serbia and statistically significant differences between the level of profitability and productivity regarding the usage of incentives for all categories of employees. Organizations that reward their employees with bonuses on individual and team level have higher level of organizational outcomes.","[Slavic, Agnes; Berber, Nemanja] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Slavic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ, Subotica, Serbia.",slavica@ef.un.ac.rs; berber@ef.un.ac.rs,"Berber, Nemanja/JFS-1642-2023; Berber, Nemanja/C-8235-2018; Slavic, Agnes/ABB-9227-2021; Slavić, Agneš/AAM-3260-2020","Berber, Nemanja/0000-0002-1433-6416; Slavić, Agneš/0000-0001-8730-9884",,,,,22,0,0,0,8,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,327,337,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100030,0

The environment can be perceived as a multidimensional construct composed of several dimensions like uncertainty, dynamics, complexity and heterogeneity. In scientific studies, environmental uncertainty is one of the frequently cited and further analysed dimensions. It not only represents an intervening variable, but also a variable influencing business performance in the form of both primary performance measures, like revenues or profits, and secondary measures, including innovation output. Thus the measurement of environmental uncertainty becomes important not only from a scientific study point of view, but also from the business perspective, because the perceived dynamics of the environment influence managerial decision making. The aim of this study is to verify the factors influencing the level of perceived environmental attributes. With this verification, the predicted influence of these factors on the perception of the environment can be eliminated. Perceived measure, therefore, mirrors reality. The influencing factors involved in the model are the age of the business, the size of the company, competitive pressure, the economic situation of the company, features of the industrial market structure and finally the industry itself. The hypotheses are tested using a sample of 228 multinational subsidiary companies active in the Czech Republic. The results indicate that uncertainty is not influenced by the features of a company such as age and size, but mainly by the economic situation of the company. The market structure influences perceived uncertainty, but the direction of the impact is not definite. Based on these results, we suppose that perceived environmental uncertainty is influenced marginally by market structure and it cannot be considered to be a good estimate of industry uncertainty. A bivariate analysis and regression analysis were used to test the hypotheses.","[Svandova, Eva; Jirasek, Michal] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Svandová, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Švandová, Eva/AAE-2416-2020; Jirásek, Michal/M-3479-2016; Svandova, Eva/C-7492-2015","Jirásek, Michal/0000-0002-0407-4045;",Masaryk University,Masaryk University,The paper was supported by the Masaryk University research project: Innovation capability as the basis for measurement of organizational innovation performance.,,15,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,701,708,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200092,0

This paper considers the case of Turkey which has a fast growing economy, and where the government has given permission to a Russian company to build a large plant in Mersin, Southern Turkey. Nuclear projects have unique features such as expensive set-up costs, long and expensive decommissioning processes (much longer than construction periods) and the issue of safe disposal of large quantities of highly radioactive wastes, some of which will remain active for many thousands of years, that may create environmental problems especially for future generations. The main focus in this paper is on the role of discounting in economic appraisal of nuclear projects in Turkey and elsewhere. Here we use three discounting methods in economic appraisal of the Turkish plant; standard discounting, the UK government's method of declining discount rate and the intergenerational discounting method. The first two tend to yield somewhat favourable results under the assumption of no interruption in supply due to technical reasons or a major accident. The intergenerational discounting method, on the other hand, which treats all generational cohorts involved equitably, does not yield results as favourable as the other criteria.

We find that students in schools in the highest quartile of minority enrollments have teachers with value-added estimates that are about 0.11 of a student-level standard deviation lower than their peers in schools in the lowest minority quartile. However, neither teacher mobility patterns nor between-school differences in teacher qualifications seems responsible for this sorting. Though the highest minority schools face higher teacher turnover, they do not disproportionately lose their highest value-added teachers, nor are teachers with high value-added systematically migrating to lower-minority schools. Instead, teachers in the highest minority schools have lower value-added on average, regardless of experience.

While a universal PPL scheme become operative in 2011 under the Australian Labor Party, alternative policies continued to be proposed by the leader of the Liberal Party. These ranged from an expanded, comparatively generous PPL scheme, to one which would maintain the status quo, to a scheme with lesser provisions than are currently available. This article examines the PPL policy which would have provided the most generous entitlements to employees, and considers how public servants may have fared had it been introduced. The proposal would have meant that public servants would no longer have been able to access PPL provisions in their industrial instruments, but would only have been entitled to the legislated provisions. This article assesses whether public servants may have gained or lost under such a change, and then considers the broader issue of the most appropriate avenues to regulate public sector employment conditions. While a rare opportunity for enhanced PPL has been lost, this may be the best outcome in ensuring that unions can continue to bargain collectively for this important provision and ongoing improvements to it.","[Williamson, Sue] UNSW Canberra, Canberra, BC 2610, Canada",,"Williamson, S (通讯作者)，UNSW Canberra, Sch Business, POB 7916, Canberra, BC 2610, Canada.",s.williamson@adfa.edu.au,,"Williamson, Sue/0000-0001-9061-7466",,,,,40,7,7,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Those weights are used in making decisions about promotion, tenure, and annual raises. Presumably, raising the teaching weight should encourage faculty to increase time on teaching. Using survey data from U.S. faculty in 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010, researchers show that at different schools teaching weights overlap extensively but vary, and that within different types of schools, those weights vary systematically based on class sizes in principles and intermediate theory courses, school or enrollment size, and for faculty who are assigned to teach principles classes. If departments and schools use teaching weights as a discretionary policy, successful implementation likely depends on adapting the policies to fit school, department, and faculty characteristics.","[Harter, Cynthia L.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA; [Harter, Cynthia L.] Eastern Kentucky Univ, Ctr Econ Educ, Richmond, KY USA; [Schaur, Georg] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN USA; [Watts, Michael] Purdue Univ, Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Eastern Kentucky University; Eastern Kentucky University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Harter, CL (通讯作者)，Eastern Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Richmond, KY 40475 USA.",cynthia.harter@eku.edu; gschaur@utk.edu,,"Harter, Cynthia/0000-0002-7010-9728",,,,,12,1,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

It documents a historical and institutional process in which the Chinese state refashioned itself as a shareholder and institutional investor in the economy and resorted to financial means to manage its ownership, assets and public investments. I demonstrate that financialization of economic management in the Chinese state contain three processes: the introduction of shareholder values by the state to managing its asset, the expansion of state asset management bodies and the provision of structured investment vehicles by these institutions to fund fixed asset investment. By uncovering the mutually leveraging effect between sovereign power and finance, this study illustrates a politically endogenous model for the rise of finance in state-directed economies.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Wang, YY (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",yingyao.wang@yale.edu,,,,,,,74,96,109,0,51,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Cities have enormous potential to reduce pressures on the environment while enhancing wellbeing for their inhabitants by acting both on the UES supply and demand sides. In this study we focus on the demand side by exploring the feasibility of self-sufficient cities under an environmentally radical, utopian scenario that implies the optimisation of UES demand by individuals, i.e. the minimum possible consumption of provisioning UES, a reduced need for regulating LIES and the adequate fulfilment of cultural UES demand for a reasonable human wellbeing. Definitions of optimal demand are provided for a set of essential UES by 2050: food supply, freshwater supply, urban cooling, air purification, carbon sequestration, flood prevention, physical recreation and mental recreation. Operational LIES demand indicators are identified for these UES. Based on these, we show the current average ecosystem service demand values in European cities, the current most exigent demand values and propose optimised future demand values. These utopian values intend to serve as benchmarks towards optimised LIES demand that will make cities more self-sufficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Contrasting Chile's seemingly rigid regulatory framework with its actual labour market flexibility, the authors stress the importance of employment conditions in assessing labour market performance. They empirically explore the effects of individual and job characteristics on employment and income-generating capabilities, whose most powerful determinant, they find, is employment under an open-ended contract.

We analyze longitudinal data from students who spent their academic careers in North Carolina public secondary schools and attended North Carolina public universities. Our results suggest that although the proportion of female math and science teachers at a school has no impact on male students, it has a powerful effect on female students' likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM degree, and effects are largest for female students with the highest math skills. The estimates are robust to the inclusion of controls for students' initial ability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We find that, while higher prices reduce smoking across the board, this reduction occurs through different behavioral mechanisms in lower versus higher income countries. Specifically, cigarette prices reduce smoking rates by deterring initiation in LMICs while in UMICs they act primarily by promoting cessation. Because current smoking rates are relatively lower in LMICs and relatively higher in UMICs, this differential mechanism underscores the adaptability of tobacco prices as a tool for regulating tobacco use across countries at different levels of development; it shows that prices can be used to sustain the relatively low rates of smoking in LMICs by preventing entry of new smokers, and can reduce the relatively high rates of smoking in UMICs by encouraging exit of existing smokers. Using split-population duration models and controlling for fixed and time-varying unobserved country characteristics, we estimate that the price elasticity of initiation in LMICs is -0.74 and the price elasticity of cessation in UMICs is 0.51.","[Kostova, Deliana] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Chaloupka, Frank J.] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Chaloupka, Frank J.; Shang, Ce] Univ Illinois, Inst Hlth Res & Policy, Ctr Hlth Policy, Chicago, IL USA",Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Kostova, D (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",kiv0@cdc.gov,"Shang, Ce/L-3617-2016",,,,,,27,25,26,0,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Only a simultaneous assessment of all relevant treatment alternatives avoids comparing average cost-effectiveness ratios and allows a truly incremental analysis. Two issues arise if the analysis is probabilistic, namely, the occurrence of output correlations and difficulty in presenting the results. I have examined the role of output correlations using a screening model with eight alternatives and have shown that specifically cost-cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)-QALY correlations between alternatives have a major impact on decision uncertainty, as measured by the probability of the cost-effectiveness and expected value of perfect information. In particular, the latter strongly depends on between-alternative output correlations. This analysis shows that both the expected value of perfect information plots and acceptability curves/frontiers are sensitive to output correlations and thus appropriate for presentation of multiple alternatives. To avoid confusing statistical significance and economic importance I propose that acceptability curves be augmented by incremental net-benefit density plots at a given willingness to pay threshold.","Lek Pharmaceut Dd, Sandoz Dev Ctr, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",Novartis; Sandoz,"Naversnik, K (通讯作者)，Lek Pharmaceut Dd, Sandoz Dev Ctr, Verovskova 57, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",klemen.naversnik@gmail.com,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

However, few decentralisation initiatives in developing countries have led to more democratic governance of natural resources. India's Recognition of Forest Rights Act (RFRA), 2006, was enacted as a result of democratic processes driven by demand for recognition of forest rights by forest dwellers. RFRA represents a political, demand-based effort to reform forest governance through a provision of rights to forest-dependent people. India also continues to operate the joint forest management (JFM) programme, a more traditional state-initiated decentralisation effort. The two parallel forest reform programmes being carried out in the same landscapes provide a unique opportunity to study democratisation of forest governance in the country with the world's largest number of forest-dependent people. We examine JFM and RFRA on the criteria of delegation of power and authority, downward accountability and impact on forest-dependent poor to understand the substantively different spaces that they open for democratic forest governance. We find that the implementation of the RFRA has been strongly opposed by powerful interests, and its more radical provisions related to community rights over forests have largely remained unimplemented. However, our findings, drawing from both primary and secondary sources, also bring out the potential of the RFRA to hold the forest bureaucracy accountable to forest-dweller communities and its ability to shift tangible legal powers and authority to forest dwellers.

The policy change forced schools to add varying levels of generally low-achieving students to their testing pools, altering accountability incentives. I provide evidence that the elimination of exemptions caused significant test score increases for initially low-achieving students and narrowed the black-white test gap. I show that the measured effects were not caused by changes in classroom composition. Rather, benefits flowed to low-achieving students because Texas' accountability standard was low relative to the skills of its students. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Richardson, J.

In order to reach this goal, the following intellectual traditions are introduced to review the philosophical and historical contexts that affect the very foundations of futures studies: (a) religions, (b) utopias, (c) historicism, (d) science fiction, and (e) systems thinking. The first phase (beginning in 1945 to the 1960s) was the era of scientific inquiry and rationalization of the futures characterized by the prevalence of technological forecasting, the rise of alternative futures in systematic ways, and the growth of professionalization of futures studies. In the first phase, futures had become objects of rationalization removed from the traditional approaches such as utopia, grandiose evolutionary ideas, naive prophecies, science fiction, religious attitudes, and mystical orientation. The second phase (the 1970s and the 1980s) saw the creation the global institution and industrialization of the futures. This era was marked by the rise of worldwide discourse on global futures, the development of normative futures, and the deep involvement of the business community in futures thinking. In the second phase, futures studies-industry ties were growing and the future-oriented thoughts extensively permeated the business decision-making process. The third phase (the 1990s - the present) reflects the current era of the neoliberal view and fragmentation of the futures. This phase is taking place in the time of neoliberal globalization and risk society discourses and is characterized by the dominance of foresight, the advance of critical futures studies, and the intensification of fragmentation. In the third phase, futures practice tends to be confined to the support of strategic planning, and hence is experiencing an identity crisis and loss of its earlier status of humanity-oriented futures.

Existing approaches for identifying weak signals in strategic decision making use environmental scanning procedures based on standard filtering algorithms. These algorithms discard patterns with low information content; however, they are not able to discard patterns with low relevance to a given strategic problem. Idea mining is proposed as an algorithm that identifies relevant textual patterns from documents or websites to solve a given (strategic) problem. Thus, it enables to estimate patterns' relevance to the given strategic problem. The provided new methodology that combines weak signal analysis and idea mining is in contrast to existing methodologies. In a case study, a web-based scanning procedure is implemented to identify textual internet data in the field of self-sufficient energy supply. Idea mining is applied for filtering and weak signals are identified based on the proposed approach. The proposed approach is compared to a further - already evaluated - approach processed without using idea mining. The results show that idea mining filtering improves quality of weak signal analysis. This supports decision makers by providing early and suggestive signals of potentially emerging trends, even with only little expressive strength. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose, a two-stage decision making procedure is proposed. In the first phase, the approach provides aggregate valuation of investment alternatives which are divided into bad and good ones. Then an investment portfolio is made from the selected alternatives during the second phase. The proposed procedure offers the complex view of the investment in contrast to the current approaches solving rather only the partial fragments of an investment process. The concept accepts the elements of uncertainty, as inaccurate input data, approximate preferences about a relevance of criteria or a final value of particular portfolio characteristics. These vague elements are expressed by the (triangular) fuzzy numbers. For the first phase, the fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method is proposed. The algorithm is based on modifications of the current concepts ELECTRE I and III. In terms of the second phase, the fuzzy multiple objective programming method is introduced which is educed from the fuzzy method KSU-STEM.

Food processing using local materials was envisaged to have the potential to generate employment and income opportunities for smallholder farmers, and hence contributing to poverty reduction and food security. The PNG food manufacturing sector is small, and is dominated by foreign companies using primarily imported ingredients. The objective of this study was to assess the challenges and opportunities for developing a locally-owned food processing sector in PNG, using sweetpotato as a test case. Sweetpotato was chosen because it is the main staple crop in PNG and is grown by smallholder farmers across the country all year round. Consequently, the socio-economic impact could be significant if an efficient sweetpotato processing sector could be established. The impact could be even greater if the associated technology spilled over to other food crops (cassava, yam and taro) and South Pacific countries. Research methods used included: technical trials to improve sweetpotato flour processing efficiency and flour quality; sweetpotato product development; and a review of sweetpotato processing R& D in PNG. Results showed that, although there is a niche market for sweetpotato products, sweetpotato flour, as a raw material for commercial food processing, is not versatile functionally or cost competitive, compared with wheat and corn (for flour production), potato (for fries/ chips), and cassava (for starch). Limited R& D resources can be better spent on improving the value chain of fresh sweetpotato roots. However, if the PNG government is determined to develop a food processing industry, sweetpotato processing can be used as a pilot both to build research and development capacity in food processing, and to develop an enabling environment necessary for small to medium size agroenterprise development.","[Chang, Hui-Shung Christie] Univ New England, Inst Rural Futures, Armidale, NSW, Australia; [Mais, Anton] Natl Agr Res Inst, Lae, Papua N Guinea",University of New England,"Chang, HSC (通讯作者)，Univ New England, Inst Rural Futures, Armidale, NSW, Australia.",hchang@une.edu.au; anton.mais@nari.org.ph,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,341,350,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000031,0

Through a close engagement with Michel Foucault's lectures at the College de France from 1975 to 1979, concerning the dual problematics of liberalism and biopolitics, we argue for theorizing economic rhetoric as a governmental problem of order, or taxis, which arranges value among divergent subjects beyond the dichotomies of material/cultural and global/local. This approach toward rhetoric, we further contend, takes as its strategic form what Foucault and Agamben have called a dispositif. We demonstrate this premise through a case study of Stephen Dubner and Steven Levitt's notion of freakonomics, suggesting that it can be understood as a rhetorical dispositif working within the broader political rationality of neoliberal governmentality. We end by gesturing toward a rhetoric of the common as an alternative to the dispositif of freakonomics.","[Chaput, Catherine] Univ Nevada, Dept English, Reno, NV 89557 USA; [Hanan, Joshua S.] Univ Denver, Dept Commun Studies, Denver, CO USA",Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno; University of Denver,"Chaput, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nevada, Dept English, Reno, NV 89557 USA.",cchaput@unr.edu,"Hanan, Joshua/G-4999-2013",,,,,,67,8,12,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

It also deepened inefficiencies by using healthcare resources, expressed with continuing growth of Slovak hospitals' indebtedness. One form of increasing the efficiency of the health system is the development of day surgery, which has been stagnating in Slovakia for 15 years of its existence and this development represents 7 % of total numbers. The aim of the study was to investigate the system of day surgery in Slovakia, assess the reasons for its stagnation and propose optimal solutions for its elimination. The structure of day surgery performance was analyzed on patients under the age of 18 from database of the National Health Information Center, which we have gained through our contractual cooperation. In 2012, we analyzed a mutual dependency among duplicate characteristics of day surgery data. In testing, we compared real absolute calculations with the so-called expected absolute calculations that would be visible in case of questioning independence. We used the statistical software SPSS, version 19 for data processing. The analysis confirmed the uneven development of day surgery performances and revealed the causes of its low level of development. The given status is influenced by the fact that conditions for day surgery provision in junior group are stricter as in the adult group. We specified some critical areas in the system of day surgery as well as evaluated their impacts on the development of day surgery on the basis of our present analyses and systematic study of the conditions of day surgery development in Slovakia. In conclusion, there have been proposed options for setting optimal strategy that supports the development of day surgery in Slovakia regarding the identified regional discrepancies. We combine the issue of day surgery of a national aspect with international aspects, especially with the conceptual and methodological problems in the area of day surgery reporting, which have been already announced by international institutions, such as Eurostat, OECD and WHO.","[Gavurova, Beata; Soltes, Vincent] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk; vincent.soltes@tuke.sk,"Šoltés, Vincent/AAA-2329-2020; Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",VEGA Project [1/0929/14],VEGA Project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This research paper is made possible through the support from VEGA Project No. 1/0929/14 Multidimensional economic and financial evaluation of the implementation process and the use of one day health care and quantification of the financial impact on the health system in the Slovak Republic.,,37,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,188,202,,,,,,15,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500023,0

We use a global partial equilibrium model of world agricultural markets to examine the trade and welfare effects of delayed adoption of new biotech crop varieties due to the timing of regulatory decisions. We,find that a three-year delay in the adoption of new biotech crop varieties significantly decreases overall welfare in agricultural markets and also results in a substantial redistribution of economic surplus from consumers to producers. We additionally find that consumers in major importing countries, where the regulatory decisions in question characteristically originate, pay a particularly high price in terms of foregone benefits.","[Kalaitzandonakes, Nicholas; Zahringer, Kenneth A.] Univ Missouri, Econ & Management Agrobiotechnol Ctr, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA; [Kruse, John] WAEES, Columbia, MO USA",University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Columbia,"Kalaitzandonakes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Missouri, Econ & Management Agrobiotechnol Ctr, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Columbia, MO 65211 USA.",KalaitzandonakesN@Missouri.edu; ZahringerK@Missouri.edu; JKruse@waees-llc.com,"Zahringer, Kenneth/R-4223-2019",,,,,,64,1,1,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The model is tested with new Finnish data specifically collected for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that compatibility is the main driver of retail investor investment intentions and that investment intentions are stronger, when not only economic, but also functional and emotional value is expected from investing. Further findings suggest that expected effort needed, psychological risk, and the risk of being cheated by unethical actors, in addition to financial risk contribute negatively to investment intentions.

While we support the thesis that transdisciplinarity is still not mainstream and is rarely supported per se by funders of research, this paper examines the extent to which UK research policy has embraced the concept of transdisciplinarity. Five empirical case studies provide data about the interrelationship between the interdisciplinary and impact or knowledge exchange aspirations of Research Council UK (RCUK) investments. We find evidence that, to an extent, UK research funding policy is achieving some elements of transdisciplinarity in practice, if not in name. Drawing on broader debates about the limitations of knowledge mobilisation and the challenges of conducting interdisciplinary research, we reflect on how the situation has changed since our original 2004 paper. The evidence suggests that the absence of the 'transdisciplinary' label is not necessarily impeding the framing of research funding schemes oriented towards societal issues. Nevertheless, several areas where capacity-building is required, including training for early career interdisciplinary researchers; improved research leadership skills; and the capacity to evaluate the quality of transdisciplinary processes and to learn from such evaluations, are identified.

Although identification of ecosystem service trade-offs has received increasing analytical attention, the policies and mixes of policies generating the trade-offs have remained outside the focus. To advance the policy relevance of ecosystem service trade-off analysis, we analyse the coherence of Finnish policies affecting forest bioenergy and carbon sequestration, two contrasting means to use forests for climate change mitigation. In particular, we focus on the interactions that different policy outputs have with respect to these two ecosystem services. The analysed policy outputs represent different foci and levels and rely on different mechanisms. We identify the direct and indirect impacts that the policy outputs have on the supply and demand of the services by utilizing natural science and policy assessment approaches. We find forest bioenergy, representing a tangible ecosystem service exchanged in the market, to be governed more positively and with more explicit instruments compared to carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration policies remain at a higher level of abstraction, stating merely strategic objectives, possibly because these markets are only emerging and remain political and highly uncertain. Our analysis shows that trade-offs between the two ecosystem services are generated by policies supporting bioenergy, whilst general policies advance both services. The entire mix of policy outputs and its differentiated impacts on ecosystem services should be thoroughly considered when assessing the strategies for mitigating climate change and designing new policy instruments.

The main purpose of this study is to estimate the costs related to hypertension and the economic impact of increasing adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy in five European countries (Italy, Germany, France, Spain and England). A probabilistic prevalence-based decision tree model was developed to estimate the direct costs of CV related to hypertension (CV defined as: stroke, heart attack, heart failure) in five European countries. Our model considered adherence to hypertension treatment as a main driver of blood pressure (BP) control (BP < 140/90 mmHg). Relative risk of CV, based on controlled or uncontrolled BP group, was estimated from the Framingham Heart Study and national review data. Prevalence and cost data were estimated from national literature reviews. A national payer (NP) perspective for 10 years was considered. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to evaluate uncertainty around the results (given as 95 % confidence intervals). The model estimated a total of 8.6 million (1.4 in Italy, 3.3 in Germany, 1.2 in Spain, 1.8 in France and 0.9 in England) CV events related to hypertension over the 10-year time horizon. Increasing the adherence rate to anti-hypertensive therapy to 70 % (baseline value is different for each country) would lead to 82,235 fewer CV events (24,058 in Italy, 7,870 in Germany, 18,870 in Spain, 24,855 in France and 6,553 in England). From the NP perspective, the direct cost associated with hypertension was estimated to be a,not sign51.3 billion (8.1 in Italy, 17.1 in Germany, 12.2 in Spain, 8.8 in France and 5.0 in England). Increasing adherence to anti-hypertensive therapy to 70 % would save a total of a,not sign332 million (CI 95 %: a,not sign319-346 million) from the NPs perspective. This study is the first attempt to estimate the economic impact of non-adherence amongst patients with diagnosed hypertension in Europe, using data from five European countries (Italy, France, Germany, Spain and England).","[Mennini, F.

However, whether such an improvement was translated into cost savings remained unclear. We therefore conducted a cost analysis of glatiramer acetate versus interferon-beta in these patients with multiple sclerosis and spasticity. Methods: This cost analysis encompassed data from the observational Escala Study, which included patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and spasticity whose treatment had been switched from interferon-beta to glatiramer acetate. Costs prior to starting glatiramer acetate (interferon-beta period) were compared to the subsequent six months on glatiramer acetate (glatiramer acetate period). The analysis was carried out following the recommendations for conducting pharmacoeconomic studies and from the Spanish National Health System perspective. Costs associated with multiple sclerosis treatment, spasticity treatment and relapse management were expressed in 2014 euros ((sic)); a 7.5 % discount was applied-when needed-as stipulated in Spanish law. Results: The management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, spasticity and relapses accounted for a 6-month cost per patient of 7,078.02(sic) when using interferon-beta and 4,671.31(sic) when using glatiramer acetate. Switching from interferon-beta to glatiramer acetate therefore represented a cost saving of 2,406.72(sic) per patient in favour of glatiramer acetate, which resulted from savings in treatment costs, relapse management and spasticity treatment of 1,890.02(sic), 430.48(sic) and 86.21(sic), respectively. The ratio of the costs during interferon-beta was 1.5 times the costs during glatiramer acetate; thus, a fixed budget of 5,000,000(sic) would enable 1,070 patients to be treated with glatiramer acetate and only 706 patients with interferon-beta. Conclusions: The treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with glatiramer acetate entailed cost savings when compared to interferon-beta in patients with spasticity, which not only resulted from its lower costs of therapy and relapse management but also from its favourable effect on reducing spasticity. Thus, glatiramer acetate may be regarded as a more efficient alternative than interferon-beta from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System.","[Sanchez-de la Rosa, Rainel] TEVA Pharmaceut, Med Dept, Calle Anabel Segura 11, Madrid 28108, Spain; [Garcia-Bujalance, Laura] TEVA Pharmaceut, Market Access & Regulatory Dept, Madrid 28108, Spain; [Meca-Lallana, Jose] Hosp Clin Univ Virgen Arrixaca, Neurol Dept, El Palmar 30120, Spain",Hospital Clinico Universitario Virgen de la Arrixaca,"Sánchez-de la Rosa, R (通讯作者)，TEVA Pharmaceut, Med Dept, Calle Anabel Segura 11, Madrid 28108, Spain.",rainel.sanchez@tevaes.com,,,TEVA Pharma SLU,TEVA Pharma SLU(Teva Pharmaceutical Industries),"This study was funded by TEVA Pharma SLU.

We highlight the importance of fire-driven ecosystem services (FDES) through investigating 557 rural households' livelihood spread across 14 villages in the Chittoor District of Andhra Pradesh. Results show that regular forest burning procures valuable forest products like fuel wood and fodder grass, mainly serving domestic purposes. We discuss the tradeoffs that would result from an alteration of the existing fire scenario with respect to FDES, the likely impact on local economies, and possible management options.

Institutional mechanisms that govern access are difficult to untangle in the context of informal trade. This paper analyzes institutions and how they regulate access to commercialize woodfuel in two areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). A review of empirical data (surveys and interviews) and secondary data on wood energy value chains in the DRC is used to examine the ways that woodfuel institutions affect access to resources and to markets. The main findings are that existing formal mechanisms regulating access to the woodfuel trade are hardly enforced. Informal, socially embedded institutions generally govern access, and the trade is open to less privileged and rural actors. People who benefit from these informal arrangements have many vested interests, and current production patterns are unsustainable and not sufficiently mitigated by these institutions. New strategies are required that promote the positive aspects of informality, while supporting initiatives that contribute to long-term resource sustainability and meet the high levels of urban demand, given the lack of alternative energy sources.

It was followed by increase of public funds in form of CAP subsidies. Their main aim is to support farm income as well as rural development. The aim of this paper is to analyze the impact of the CAP on the economy of farms based on an analysis of a dataset of agricultural farms operating in Slovak regions. Our analysis was based on the database of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural development for agricultural farms over the period 2009-2012. The database contained individual data including balance sheets and income statements for each farm. For our analysis, data were selected according to the 8 Slovak regions. Administratively, Slovakia is divided into 8 sections (regions), which correspond roughly to the areas surrounding the eight largest cities, and are named after them. Each of these administrative units consists of several districts, approximately on the scale of counties. Slovakia is perceived as a leader among the European countries due to its size of farms. Despite of a high concentration of farms - up to 90% of the utilized agricultural land is farmed by large farms - the Slovak agriculture is considerably less productive. The Slovak agricultural farms in our sample displayed low profitability measured by profit per hectare. The farms in LFA regions have better profitability, because they gain higher subsidies per hectare and their production is less demanding on costs and are less dependent on sales. On the other hand after integration into EU in 2004 the majority of farms generate profit. Increase in subsidies was followed by lower ability to generate profit without subsidies. Based on our analysis we conclude that farms in Slovakia are, by achieving their individual target - profit, dependent on CAP with increasing tendency. In terms of food self-sufficiency, should the state endeavour that the ability of farms to outreach profit is pegged to market success and not only to public resources eligible regardless of market output.","[Serences, Peter; Toth, Marin; Rabek, Toms; Cierna, Zuzana; Rasovska, Adriana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Serences, P (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",peter.serences@uniag.sk; marian.toth@uniag.sk; tomas.rabek@uniag.sk; zuzana.cierna@ubiag.sk; xpelikanova@is.uniag.sk,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019",,,,,,8,2,2,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,989,997,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800095,0

For food purposes can be achieved quality of final products (eg. Frying and cooking oils, 100% fats, margarines, low-calorie fats, phospholipids, lecithin, tocopherols and phytosterols) with significant positive effects on the quality of food and nutrition. In terms of non-food use of canola the great importance especially in feed and oleo-chemistry. In the EU and the USA are vegetable oils (mainly rapeseed, sunflower and soya) used in the manufacturing process of transport fuel. The EU is currently the main producer of methyl esters of fatty acids with standardized quality of biofuels (biodiesel) for diesel engines in the world. Implementation of agricultural products as raw materials for the production of renewable motor fuels is not without obstacles. Opponents often argue lower yield of pure energy and has adverse economic balances due to the costly conversion process, especially for bioethanol. It is also necessary to take into account the development of renewable raw materials are not without some support, both at the national and the European Union. Includes area, from research and development, marketing guidance to investment to ensure and create new jobs in rural areas. In the context with these facts arises a lot of research and moral questions concerning adequate choice of using canola. All these aspects then have their full economic impacts in areas with significant motivation of the producers themselves. Through the different approaches and strategic objectives of agricultural policies in different regions of the world there is also a difference in the focus of the development of the producers in the world. Aim of the paper is to characterize the broader context of current changes in conditions, which are affecting producers involved in the canola commodity chain in the EU in comparison with canola producers in selected global production centres. Methodologically the analysis is based on a comparison of development canola exports, production costs and prices in the EU and in selected global production centres. General considerations based on the theory of agribusiness, are applied and documented examples of the factors influencing the development of production costs for producers of canola. Analyses are based on the results of processing data from professional publications and resources focusing on the theme followed.","[Tamas, Vojtech] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Tamas, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",vojtech.tamas@mendelu.cz,,"Tamas, Vojtech/0000-0003-3430-7767",,,,,6,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1105,1109,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800107,0

To tackle this problem, countries have introduced courses that integrate aspects of VET and academic study, which provide the dual purpose of preparing students for work and vocational study and providing university pathways for more academic students in the VET track. In this study we assess the latter purpose by examining the outcomes of university aspirants who take these courses in their final year of school. Using rich survey and administrative data from Australia and propensity score matching we find that these courses are associated with lower academic performance and a lower chance of attaining a university offer. Decomposition results show that poor performance in integrated courses is the main driver, which points to potential tension between the two purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using data from the American Community Survey, I test whether individuals adjusted their income in order to qualify for the subsidies. I find clear evidence of income manipulation around the threshold of 300 percent of federal poverty level (FPL), and some evidence of income manipulation around 150 percent of FPL. The higher threshold determines the eligibility for any insurance subsidy, and the effect is concentrated among wage workers. The lower threshold determines whether the individuals pay zero or positive out-of-pocket premiums, and the effect is concentrated among the self-employed. I also use a structural model to estimate the labor supply elasticity with respect to the wage rate based on the changes of income, and assess the social welfare impacts. The results suggest that the labor supply elasticity is close to zero, and the welfare loss is modest relative to the size of the program.","[Shi, Julie] Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Shi, J (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jshi@pku.edu.cn,,,"National Institute of Mental Health [R01 MH094290]; National Institute of Aging [P01 AG032952]; Research Seed Funding at the School of Economics, Peking University","National Institute of Mental Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)); National Institute of Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Research Seed Funding at the School of Economics, Peking University","I am grateful to Randall Ellis, Albert Ma, Thomas McGuire, Jonathan Gruber, Mark Duggan, Anthony Howell, Keith Ericson, Kevin Lang, Tim Layton, Daniele Paserman, Daria Pelech, Johannes Schmieder, Aaron Schwartz, Jacob Wallace, Qiang Wang, Yi Yao, Wesley Yin, and Castiel Chen Zhuang for their comments.

The study shows that the gender gap in poverty in Europe is considerably higher when computed through FDR. Indeed, since the ARPR constitutes a proxy of the household's average conditions, it levels down gender inequalities within the household and also variations in individuals' incomes over time.

Based on a foresight analysis, it has been identified on the one hand that it is necessary to achieve greater productivity and competitiveness and on the other hand, collective intentionality towards progress must be encouraged. Using these analyses, new Colombian scenarios are discussed, taking into account intentionality towards entrepreneurship and innovation. Following the entrepreneurship research, it is suggested that innovative entrepreneurial activity is linked to long-term economic growth. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify the role of innovative entrepreneurship in Colombian business cycle scenarios using system dynamics (SD) modelling. Here, we approach futures studies, testing dynamic hypotheses concerning development based on societal and socioeconomic integration, in which innovative entrepreneurship is highly relevant. The model, supported by circular flow analysis and Schumpeterian theory, shows how this type of entrepreneurship contributes to sustainable economic growth during the simulation period (2003-2032).

Some of the debate is an outgrowth of the lack of causal knowledge of the impacts of expenditures on student outcomes. To help fill this void, we examine the causal impact of capital expenditures on school district proficiency rates in Michigan. For the analysis, we employ a regression discontinuity design where we use the outcomes of bond elections as the forcing variable. Our results provide some evidence that capital expenditures can have positive effects on student proficiency levels. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It identifies the major issues relating to circumvention and anti-circumvention in the GATT/WTO negotiations which have led to the failure of WTO members to conclude uniform rules on anti-circumvention. The article argues that multilateral anti-circumvention rules are necessary to standardize national anti-circumvention laws and practice and discipline unilateral use of anti-circumvention measures. The article further argues that Australia's anti-circumvention law and practice, as reflected in its first anti-circumvention investigation, may have violated WTO rules and is likely to lead to increasing protectionism to cost of WTO members and Australia's FTA trading partners. Australia's unjustified use of anti-circumvention measures is unlikely to foster the development of its import-competing industries and may provoke retaliation by other countries.","[Zhou, Weihuan] Univ New S Wales, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney,"Zhou, WH (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",weihuan.zhou@unsw.edu.au,"Zhou, Weihuan/HDM-5765-2022","Zhou, Weihuan/0000-0003-3200-5271",,,,,59,5,5,1,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2016,15,3.0,,,,,495,522,,10.1017/S1474745615000762,0.0,,,28,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DP6IM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378600800005,0

An empirical challenge surrounding this research is to address the omission of unobserved factors affecting both maternal depression and child outcomes. By implementing bounding, an underutilized estimation technique not previously applied to maternal depression studies, I am able to generate ranges of the causal impact of maternal depression on child test scores and socioemotional outcomes. Primary findings include moderately-sized reductions in children's socioemotional measures and slight reductions in children's test scores when a mother reported any level of depression in single-period analyses, an increase in magnitude of the findings for kindergarten students as severity of depression increased, and larger impacts on reading scores of third graders when their mother was depressed in multiple time periods.

Pointing to the difference in the trends of the college wage premium in the two countries as a proximate cause, this study assesses the importance of the supply factor as a determinant of the college wage premium. The wage differential between college and high-school graduates decreased slightly from 0.35 to 0.34 log point in Japan, while it increased from 0.43 to 0.65 log point in the US between 1986 and 2008. During this period, the number of college graduates grew twice as fast in Japan as in the US. Estimations of labor demands for different educational backgrounds and simulations based on counterfactual supply trends reveal that the more rapid increase of college graduates in Japan than in the US explains about 60% of these contrasting trends. The difference in post-war fertility trends largely explains the difference in the supply increase of college graduates between the two countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mixed forests may increase the multifunctionality, providing a wide range of ecosystem services such as hazard protection, carbon sequestration, nature conservation and landscape values. Before undertaking a process of conversion of monocultures into mixed forests it is important to learn about perceptions of local stakeholders for mixed forests in comparison to monocultures, in order to understand their needs and identify possible sources of conflicts. In the present work, we investigate the personal perceptions about the effectiveness of mixed forests when compared to monocultures, in terms of provisioning of ecosystem services, with the aid of an ordered logit model. In addition, we highlight the fact that belonging to a particular category of organized stakeholders contribute to perceive mixed forests positively, compared to non-organized local dwellers. Results show that people acknowledging the importance of some non-productive forest ecosystem services are more likely to prefer mixed forests. Moreover, personal attitudes towards ecosystem services seem to be much more related to the degree of preference for mixed forests than other socio-economic variables, such as gender and education. Finally, another evidence of this contribution is that belonging to a precisely defined group of stakeholders considerably increases the probability to prefer mixed forests, compared to ordinary citizens.

In parallel, the key challenge of the pulp and paper industry (PPI) is how to achieve a transformation towards a bioeconomy, as well as to realize the necessary new green innovations. Climate change, material resource scarcity and ecosystem decline are among the ten major sustainability megaforces identified by KPMG (2012), globally influencing business environments. However, the relative importance of these megaforces in the context of pulp and paper sector transformation is yet unknown. We therefore investigate the significance of these megaforces and their relation to the drivers of sustainability-related investments in the European pulp and paper sector, and identify threats and opportunities that these business environmental changes may bring about. Our results are based upon a three-round dissensus-based Delphi approach carried out with a sample of 30 high-level European PPI experts collected in 2014. The panelists identified a greater demand for energy, volatility in the fossil fuel markets and increasing material resource scarcity as the most significant sustainability megaforces shaping European PPI over the next 15 years. However, all the megaforces - except for global ecosystem decline and water scarcity- were perceived more as opportunities rather than threats to European PPI business, indicating that designed energy and environmental policies have the potential to advance a paradigm change towards a bioeconomy rather than curbing the future of the European PPI.

Data on demographic characteristics, healthcare resource utilization, informal care, labor productivity losses, and HRQOL were collected from the questionnaires completed by patients or their caregivers. HRQOL was measured with the EuroQol 5-domain (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. A total of 162 patients (67 Germany, 34 Sweden, 33 Italy, 23 United Kingdom, 4 France, and 1 Bulgaria) completed the questionnaire. Excluding Bulgarian results, due to small sample size, country-specific annual health care costs ranged from a,not sign18,913 to a,not sign36,396 (reference year: 2012). Estimated direct healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign11,068 to a,not sign22,138; direct non-healthcare costs ranged from a,not sign7837 to a,not sign14,155 and labor productivity losses ranged from a,not sign0 to a,not sign8715. Costs are also shown to differ between children and adults. The mean EQ-5D index score for JIA patients was estimated at between 0.44 and 0.88, and the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale score was estimated at between 62 and 79. JIA patients incur considerable societal costs and experience substantial deterioration in HRQOL in some countries. Compared with previous studies, our results show a remarkable increase in annual healthcare costs for JIA patients. Reasons for the increase are the inclusion of non-professional caregiver costs, a wider use of biologics, and longer hospital stays.","[Kuhlmann, A.; Schmidt, T.; Treskova, M.; von der Schulenburg, J.

This article discusses the legal and economic aspects of the recently enacted data localization requirements in the Russian Federation, as well as the consequences for costs, uncertainty, and the hampering of business activities that may arise if they are applied unaltered.

BWS aims at the analysis of preferences regarding a set of attributes, their levels or alternatives. It is a stated-preference method based on the assumption that respondents are capable of making judgments regarding the best and the worst (or the most and least important, respectively) out of three or more elements of a choiceset. As is true of discrete choice experiments (DCE) generally, BWS avoids the known weaknesses of rating and ranking scales while holding the promise of generating additional information by making respondents choose twice, namely the best as well as the worst criteria. A systematic literature review found 53 BWS applications in health and healthcare. This article expounds possibilities of application, the underlying theoretical concepts and the implementation of BWS in its three variants: 'object case', 'profile case', 'multiprofile case'. This paper contains a survey of BWS methods and revolves around study design, experimental design, and data analysis. Moreover the article discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of BWS distinguished and offered an outlook. A companion paper focuses on special issues of theory and statistical inference confronting BWS in preference measurement.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Kaczynski, Anika] Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Zurich, Switzerland; [Johnson, F.

Such policies are tools for economists and policy-makers to correctly direct the economy and facilitate the growth and development of the country. Accordingly, it is critically important for policy-makers in the area of economy to study the efficiency and the effectiveness of such policies. IS-LM-AS is a popular model for analysing these policies within past decades. However, it is not the best model for analysing these policies regarding the advancement of macroeconomics and more precise models presented by economics. IS-MP-AS (Romer, 2000) is a new model solving some of the ordinary problems of IS-LM-AS at the same time having some superiorities. Failing to optimally use monetary and financial policies, Iran could have not properly developed despite of plentiful natural and human resources. The analysis of policies and their efficiency and effectiveness is, therefore, highly significant in Iran. This paper studies the application of IS-MP-AS to Iran's economy and looks at monetary and fiscal policies in this framework. Results show that monetary and fiscal policies are highly efficient and effective in Iran's economy and affect the country's natural income. According to the research findings, Iran's GDP is negatively associated with expectation inflation, budget deficiency to GDP ratio, and coin prices and positively related to oil incomes and exchange rates. This can be explained by these five variables. (C) 2016 The Authors.

In South Africa, mopane worms (Imbrasia belina) have become an important source of food and cash income for rural people living in or near the mopane woodlands. However, the continued over-exploitation and commercialisation has implications for long term management of the mopane woodlands in the northern parts of South Africa. This study used a cross-sectional dataset collected from a survey of 120 households in Limpopo province in an effort to identify socio-economic factors influencing mopane worm commercialisation and intensity of commercialisation. The Household Commercialisation Index (HCI) and the Double Hurdle Model were used for the analysis. Result shows that about 63% of mopane worm harvested is sold within a production year which implies high level of commercialisation. The result of the Double Hurdle Model showed that gender, education, household size, quantity harvested, social capital, distance, transportation and information impact on households' decision-making to commercialised mopane worm. Furthermore, household age, gender, education, exogenous income, price, quantity of marketable surplus, absence of institution/law and transportation are statistically significant factors influencing the intensity of mopane worm commercialisation in the study area. This therefore suggests that, in order to achieve a balance between sustainable harvesting of mopane worm and improving the livelihoods of the rural poor that depends on it for food and income, there is a need for policy makers to focus on the dynamics in household socio-economic conditions. Implications for policy were discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Baiyegunhi, L. J. S.; Oppong, B.

Successful duration of project activities is measured by the EVA tools, where the Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled (BCWS) is a key parameter. The BCWS is created by work effort in a project activity. Therefore, work effort has a hidden influence on EVA. Consequently, in the real world of human resources, the BCWS is not usually linear in time. To express the BCWS parameters, nonlinear mathematical models are used in this paper, describing the course of different work contours incorporating the Student Syndrome phenomenon. The paper presents a proposal of the application of mathematical models for different courses of work contours during project planning.

The results show an increase in the asynchronous approval across the majority of country pairs. However, focusing only on commercialized events and considering only regulatory approval differences in which the importers are more stringent than the exporters, the asynchronous approval is considerably lower, and the result indicates that the major trade leaders have synchronized their approval status for GMOs over time. Some countries, such as Norway, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey seem to face the highest potential for trade disruption, while the opposite holds for Japan and South Korea.","[De Faria, Rosane Nunes] Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Econ, Sorocaba, Brazil; [Wieck, Christine] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany",Universidade Federal de Sao Carlos; University of Bonn,"De Faria, RN (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Sao Carlos, Dept Econ, Sorocaba, Brazil.",rnfaria@ufscar.br; christine.wieck@ilr.uni-bonn.de,,"Wieck, Christine/0000-0002-5791-6111",,,,,39,7,7,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2016,15,1.0,,,,,85,108,,10.1017/S1474745615000336,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372460500005,0

The article discusses various approaches to the study of tourism sustainability, their relationship with spatial concepts. In order to introduce into use and to assess such complex concepts as sustainability or sustainable development, the article uses well-known structures, such as prism of sustainability. In particular, the indicators proposed by the United Nations (UN CSD), the World Tourism Organization were considered. The analysis allowed to define stability of the system as its ability to remain relatively unchanged (to keep its structure and functional features) within certain time frame despite external and internal disturbances. At the same time, one can distinguish three types of sustainability, related to spatial factors: 1) positional stability - relatively static notion and it reflects fixity of the elements of the system in a given area, it is connected with the existence of systems and their components; 2) structural stability - a concept that reflects the links (real and potential) between the elements of the system or different systems and has a static-dynamic nature; 3) functional stability defines the dynamics of systems, the actual existence of spatial interactions between elements of the system and other systems.","[Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz K.; Ulengov, Ruslan A.; Ismagilova, Liliya R.] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia",Kazan Federal University,"Gabdrakhmanov, NK (通讯作者)，Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia.",,"Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/V-8823-2019; Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/AAZ-5861-2020; Ulengov, Ruslan A/L-8763-2013; Ismagilova, Lilya/L-4890-2013","Gabdrakhmanov, Niyaz/0000-0001-7336-4890; Ismagilova, Lilya/0000-0002-1640-3387",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,585,589,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200076,0

An inefficient transportation system disrupts supply chain and imposes severe damages to it. This paper investigates a transportation model with a limited number of vehicles with different capacities. The vehicles are used to handle raw and semi-finished materials from contractors' warehouses to the main factories and to transport finished products to the warehouses of the distribution companies. The main purpose was to cover all transportation requests in a manner that it results in a reduced transportation cost, a reduced use of rental vehicles, and a reduced stopping duration of vehicle in destinations through the optimal use of available resources. In the considered model, first, a web-based system was designed in order to enable the registration of handling requests in the system with the purpose of compensating vehicle shortage. The handling requests are confirmed by drivers and transportation companies through SMS, email, and internet. Then, the proposed model performs network routing in order to completely cover the transportation network and to reduce transportation costs and vehicles stopping duration in destination. Finally, the model was run in different conditions, and the possibility of increasing vehicles with the purpose of reducing costs was studied. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Though great progress China has made in forest certification in recent years, the certified forest area and its ratio should be enlarged and raised urgently compared with that of other regions and countries such as five BRICKS nations, APEC countries and the G20. It's promoted worldwide for not only improving the credibility of certified institutions and the reputation of sylva of its country, but also playing a significant role in biological conservation, production safety of cutting sections and the environmental risk control in forest management. With the forest certification highly valued by the government, China Forest Certification Council (CFCC) has been established and increasingly improved with ten years' development. In February 2014, CFCC achieved mutual recognition with Program for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), marking the formal presence of CFCC in global arena. The forest certification presents favorable opportunities for China to participate in forest products transactions. In this paper, both the forest certification development in China and the influences of forest certification development on the international (especially China's) forest product trade were analyzed. Considering the major shares China has in global forest product trade, the influences that the forest certification development may have on China's foreign trade of forest products should be fully recognized and utilized.","[Hou, Fang-miao; Wen, Ya-li] Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Beijing Forestry University,"Hou, FM (通讯作者)，Beijing Forestry Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing, Peoples R China.",houfangmiao@sina.com,"Wen, Ya/HLP-9685-2023",,,,,,8,0,0,0,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-368-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,473,481,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BF8YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385266400085,0

Furthermore, they must prepare a domestic or commercial landscape design plan. In the last academic year the class was invited to develop landscape design proposals for Beech Hill College in Monaghan. Ordnance survey maps of the site were obtained in preparation for the site visit and meeting with the School Principal who outlined the specific requirements. The students were sub-divided into three working groups and assigned a specific area of the school campus to survey and evaluate existing vegetation. Each student created design proposals, drew cross sections and a planting plan for their areas. At the end of the semester each student presented their work to peers, staff and the School Principal and was given immediate feedback. Student response to the project was highly positive and in comparison to previous years, the design proposals were suitable for implementation. Students participated in individual and group work, developed critical thinking skills, presentation skills, and all transferable skills required of university graduates. Engaging in a live project for a school campus emphasised their contribution to a local community.

The conventional DEA models split the DMUs into two classes - inefficient and efficient. The inefficient DMUs can be easily ranked according to their efficiency score given by the model. The efficient ones have identical efficiency scores and cannot be ranked directly according to their values. Many approaches have been proposed in the past in order to solve this problem. First of them is Andersen and Petersen model but in case of non-constant returns to scale this model need not lead always to feasible solution. The main aim of this paper is to compare various approaches with the special attention to cross efficiency evaluation models that can help to overcome this shortcoming.,"[Jablonsky, Josef] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Jablonsky, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econometr, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",jablon@vse.cz,"Jablonsky, Josef/U-2395-2018; Jablonsky, Josef/N-8711-2019","Jablonsky, Josef/0000-0003-0606-354X",Czech Science Foundation [16-01821S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"The research is supported by the Czech Science Foundation, project no. 16-01821S.",,8,0,0,0,0,"LETRA INTERACTIVE, SRO",BRATISLAVA,"NA REVINE 29-D, BRATISLAVA, 831 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-972328-0-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,177,182,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG9XU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000394099300028,0

Tourism development produces, socially, not only more jobs or the opportunity of practicing traditional trades, but also a continuous growth of professional training levels for all personnel involved in supplying tourist services. Romania's adherence to EU in 2007 has implied essential mutations in the management of tourist SMEs but also in all institutions involved in this economic sector. Romanian tourism integration in the EU would imply it becoming more efficient and in full harmony with natural and social environments. The achievements in capitalizing Romania's tourist potential are still modest and they are far from being at the required level of competitiveness standards. It is known that behind the motivation of choosing Romania as tourist destination, the center of gravity is represented by all functional elements of the offer. Following the perspective of European integration, this study is focusing on accommodation services that represent an important factor for the stimulation of tourist demand, along with accessibility, food and entertainment possibilities. The interest of this study resides in analyzing the localization of spatially eccentric Romanian tourist destinations in relation to the main demographic mass of neighboring countries, the destinations' grouping by one or more common characteristics and also in verifying if measuring accessibility is sufficient to explain on its own the tourist phenomenon in the Romanian peripheral territory. Regarding the peripherality of tourist destinations, the analysis was focused on those units located at a maximum distance of 80 km inside the Romanian border. Road accessibility was calculated from the main urban areas around Romania to peripheral tourist destinations. The difference between the results and the territorial reality seem to suggest that a simple calculation of spatial accessibility, no matter the method, is not enough when trying to explain the attractiveness or repulsiveness of some Romanian destinations.","[Munteanu, Alina; Iatu, Corneliu] Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Munteanu, A (通讯作者)，Alexandra Ioan Cuza Univ Iasi, Iasi, Romania.",,"Munteanu, Alina-Violeta/HKM-5157-2023",,,,,,4,0,0,0,5,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,207,213,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100028,0

Drawing on a case study in Finland, the paper analyses how professional foresters are invited to protect the heterogeneity of forest ecosystems while they simultaneously work to homogenise these habitats for improved productivity. To understand how formerly irrelevant biological knowledge, and related skills and expertise gain credibility in forestry decision-making in such a complex policy context, the paper adopts a two-fold theoretical approach. On one hand, it focuses on the tools and techniques which redirect expert practice, introducing new rationalities, roles and routines for professional foresters. On the other hand, it seeks to view foresters as complex sociological actors who reinvent themselves as biodiversity experts by strategically mobilising various kinds of resources to negotiate their role and status as experts. This two-fold analysis addresses how the status of biological knowledge is determined by the tension between formally configured expert rationalities and expert identities and roles mobilised through informal interactions. Three expert strategies in engaging with biodiversity are identified based on the personal histories, motivations and identities of the foresters: the ambassador, navigator and bolshie. Through these strategies professional foresters interact with each other and with landowners while implementing biodiversity policies, hence influencing the policy outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this respect, efficiency improvement in smolt production is highly important for the Norwegian salmon industry. Smolt is one of the key input factors in salmon farming. After feed, it makes up for the highest cost share. The objective of this research was to analyze the efficiency in Norwegian production of juvenile salmonids from 1988-2012. A special interest in this research was to investigate how the age of the firm affects the technological efficiency. This econometric analysis is undertaken in a stochastic cost frontier framework. The results indicate that significant technical inefficiency is present in smolt production, and that there exist productivity differences between regions. Furthermore, there seems to be a learning-by-doing effect in juvenile production because older firms perform slightly better than the new ones with respect to technical efficiency.","[Sandvold, Hilde Ness] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Sandvold, HN (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",hilde.sandvold@uis.no,,,Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),The author would like to acknowledge financial support from the Norwegian Research Council.,,22,17,18,0,6,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of crime and corruption. We show that even temporary imposition of the barriers to entry to a competitive industry may lead to permanent extortion development and substantial slow-down in the economic growth. Entry restrictions, if binding, lead to the excess profits, which create an incentive to extort. Emergence of the extorters reduces the expected profit from production, making the producers expect to get extorted in the future. If after this adaptation of expectations, the government removes the barriers to entry, only few new firms enter the market. Hence, the total number of firms on the market is lower that it would have been under no barriers to entry. The low number of firms on the market allows each producer to earn relatively high pre-extortion profits which reinforces the desire of racketeers to take part on their wealth. Consequently, the part of the population is permanently diverted from the production to rent-seeking activities, which is likely slow down economic growth even in the long run.","[Strielkowski, Wadim] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Cabelkova, Inna] Charles Univ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",University of Cambridge; Charles University Prague,"Strielkowski, W (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.",w.strielkowski@jbs.cam.ac.uk; inna.cabelkova@fhs.cuni.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019; Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Cabelkova, Inna/0000-0002-8302-1004",,,,,12,4,4,0,9,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

It counters the prevalent tendency to understand uncertainty solely in terms of an epistemological limit to knowledge. Uncertainty should rather be seen in the context of different historical ontologies of money and economic subjectivity. The article uses a historical analysis to make its point. It investigates two discourses on uncertainty in the context of financial crisis that are usually not properly distinguished: the role of uncertainty for debating the financial crisis in the 1930s and since 2008. While in the first case the financial future was defined in terms of a potential that needs to be seized and materialized by a subject that is able to posit its will through time, the current appeal to uncertainty depicts the future as a catastrophe that needs to be survived and feared by the subject. Each notion of uncertainty gives rise to very different regulatory responses. The article discusses these historical findings in regard to the critical hopes pinned on the notion of uncertainty.","[Tellmann, Ute] Univ Hamburg, Dept Sociol, Allende Pl 1, D-21046 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Tellmann, U (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Sociol, Allende Pl 1, D-21046 Hamburg, Germany.",ute.tellmann@wiso.uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,79,8,9,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The financial and economic crisis is doubtlessly one of the key factors that has affected (more than just) the Czech economy. It is possible to consider the decline of the Czech economy, measured using the constant-price GDP growth rate, to be long-lasting and relatively severe. According to the statistics, real GDP did not reach pre-crisis levels until the end of 2014. The Czech economy is currently experiencing a strong economic revival; its growth point ranges between 4 and 5%. The last time these values were recorded was during the years preceding the crisis, primarily at the end of 2008. Robust economic growth in 2015 is considered to be one of the best results within the EU only Malta's economy grew more rapidly. Obviously, this is due to exceptional factors; according to the analyst, these are primarily maintaining an undervalued currency, the striking fall in oil prices, and the utilization of European Funds. At the same time, the increase in household consumption expenditure reinforces this growth. This paper includes an analysis of Czech macroeconomic development for the period after 2008. First, comparative research on Czech economic development during the past seven years was conducted using available macroeconomic indicators.This development is depicted using time series analysis. Additionally, this article includes a comparison with the macroeconomic environment in the EU-15 and EU-28 countries.

Study found that high salary could motivate the executives to work hard, and the effect of compensation incentive would be reduced when there are uncertain factors impact executives' performance; if executives' performance could be measured effectively, increasing the rated performance standard is more conducive to motivate executives to work hard than high compensation. Finally, some suggestions are presented to improve the effect of compensation incentive for executives of state-owned enterprises in the matters of industry particularity, performance appraisal standard and the relationship between government and enterprise.","[Zhang, Hua] Zhaoqing Univ, Sch Econ & Management, City Zhaoqing, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Zhaoqing University,"Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Zhaoqing Univ, Sch Econ & Management, City Zhaoqing, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",sonicme@foxmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-368-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,349,355,,,,,,7,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BF8YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385266400064,0

Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) stands in Southern China were taken for a numerical example to analyze the effects of carbon price on the optimal management of shaft-rotation plantations. The results show that, with the current price of carbon, introducing the effects of harvesting on different carbon pools into the decision model would increase the optimal rotation age on poor (SI = 10) and medium (SI = 17) sites by one year, while it does not have any impact on the optimal rotation for good sites (SI = 21). Irrespective of site condition, the optimal rotation age is not sensitive to carbon price and interest rate. An increase in interest rate by 1% would reduce the optimal rotation age by one year. In conclusion, forest carbon trade could effectively enhance land owners' income from short-rotation forest plantations. However, it does not lead to any significant increase in forest carbon sink.

Via a review of these debates, a revision of the union renewal thesis is presented, suggesting that union renewal should be examined as a process of transition. Three analytic dimensions of renewal are identified and presented, each arising out of a consideration of the debates: union organisation, union capacity and union purpose. The proposition is that an understanding of contemporary unionism involves a consideration of the ways renewal involves a multi-faceted transition in relation to the political economy of trade unionism. The way to understand this characterisation is to reconsider theories about unions in terms of a dialectic, addressing the inter-relationships and integration of union organisation, capacities and purpose.","[Fairbrother, Peter] RMIT Univ, Int Employment Relat, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fairbrother, Peter] RMIT Univ, Global Cities Res Inst, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Fairbrother, Peter] RMIT Univ, Ctr Sustainable Organisat & Work, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Fairbrother, P (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Ctr Sustainable Organisat & Work, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",peter.fairbrother@rmit.edu.au,"Fairbrother, Peter/R-7050-2019","Fairbrother, Peter/0000-0002-8169-4811","Australian Research Council [DP 120101773, DP140102389]",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),The research that underpins this analysis is funded by two Australian Research Council awards: DP 120101773 and DP140102389.,,73,35,38,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

I demonstrate that a fail inspection rating leads to test score gains for primary school students. I find no evidence to suggest that fail schools are able to inflate test score performance by gaming the system. Relative to purely test-based accountability systems, this finding is striking and suggests that oversight by evaluators who are charged with investigating what goes on inside the classroom may play an important role in mitigating such strategic behavior. There appear to be no effects on test scores following an inspection for schools rated highly by the inspectors. This suggests that any effects from the process of evaluation and feedback are negligible for nonfailing schools, at least in the short term.","Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Hussain, I (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",iftikharhussain@sussex.ac.uk,,,,,,,54,11,16,1,59,UNIV WISCONSIN PRESS,MADISON,"JOURNAL DIVISION, 1930 MONROE ST, 3RD FL, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",0022-166X,1548-8004,,J HUM RESOUR,J.

Cost analyses were based on resource use for medical care, social care, caregiver productivity losses, and informal caregiver time reported in the resource utilization in dementia (RUD). Lite instrument and a complementary questionnaire. Multivariate regression analysis was used to model the effects of global severity and other socio-demographic and clinical variables on cost of care. The mean (standard deviation) costs per patient over 6 months for direct medical, social care, indirect and informal care costs, were estimated at a,not sign1,028.1 (1,655.0), a,not sign843.8 (2,684.8), a,not sign464.2 (1,639.0) and a,not sign33,232.2 (30,898.9), respectively. Dementia severity, as having a CDR score 0.5, 2, or 3 with CDR score 1 being the reference group were all independently and significantly associated with informal care costs. Whereas having a CDR score of 2 was also significantly related with social care costs, a CDR score of 3 was associated with most cost components including direct medical, social care, and total costs, all compared to the reference group. The costs of care for patients with AD in Spain are substantial, with informal care accounting for the greatest part. Dementia severity, measured by CDR score, showed that with increasing severity of the disease, direct medical, social care, informal care and total costs augmented.","[Darba, J.] Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Kaskens, L.] BCN Hlth Econ & Outcomes Res SL, Barcelona, Spain; [Lacey, L.] Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Res & Dev LLC, Dublin, Ireland; [Lacey, L.] Pfizer Inc, Dublin, Ireland",University of Barcelona; Pfizer,"Darbà, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econ, Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",darba@ub.edu,,,"Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development, LLC.; Pfizer Inc.","Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research and Development, LLC.; Pfizer Inc.(Pfizer)","The authors would like to thank all the health care professionals of the study centers and study participants in the project.

J,"Faye, P",,,,"Faye, Papa",,,Choice and power: Resistance to technical domination in Senegal's forest decentralization,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Forestry decentralization projects; Participation; Institutional choices; Domination; Resistance; Power struggle,,"This paper examines the contest for power over forest resources between the Forest Department and elected local government in the context of decentralized forestry in Senegal. Based on ethnographic work with a forestry management intervention purporting to implement decentralization, the paper shows that power struggles center on the formation of local authorities (institutional choice) and the technical framing of forest management. It also illuminates the ways that technical claims and politico-legal counterclaims and their supporting discourses shape these struggles. The project engendered awareness among local governments about the economic and political stakes involved in forest management, which sparked resistance to the project's technically oriented institutional choices. The paper demonstrates the effects of institutional choice legitimated by discourses that privilege technical requirements and outside expertise. Importantly, the research also indicates that power struggles over resources are dynamic. Technical discourses can be countered by arguments that evoke the need for broad-based political participation, lawfulness and democracy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

It is consequently feared that Members may forum shop' by reconstructing SPS measures as TBT regulations and hereby circumvent WTO obligations. This article revisits these assumptions in the light of recent TBT jurisprudence and explores the respective challenges of defending policy preferences under the two technical regimes. It argues that in some respects - the characterization of a measure and the chosen level of protection - the SPS Agreement provides a securer basis for Members to defend regulatory choices. While evidential burdens are more explicitly demanding under SPS rules, the challenge of justifying a TBT measure's rationality should not be understated. In light of these reflections, this article concludes that forum shopping' is an unpromising strategy for protecting controversial SPS measures.","[Downes, Chris] European Consulting Co ECCO, Etterbeek, Belgium",,"Downes, C (通讯作者)，European Consulting Co ECCO, Etterbeek, Belgium.",chris.downes@ecco-eu.com,,,,,,,79,6,6,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2015,14,4.0,,,,,553,578,,10.1017/S1474745615000178,0.0,,,26,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CW4HO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364952400001,0

To date, however, this literature has struggled to advance notions of deprivation beyond the purely economic. Focus has fallen on attempts to isolate causality using experimental and quasi-experimental approaches, yet the transfer mechanism of financial deprivation remains unclear and under-explained. Employing a multi-domain deprivation measure for Northern Ireland, this paper revisits the question and confirms a negative relationship between regional deprivation and education outcomes. Using random effects and error-component 2SLS models and employing the spatial variation of historical violence as an instrument we find no unique effect of financial deprivation over and above the effect of other deprivation metrics. This confirms the limitations of using wealth as a proxy for deprivation, whilst suggesting that policies focusing only on income redistribution will be unsuccessful in improving educational outcomes.

Recently, ADD has focused its attention on projects that are not governed by a client in order to search for innovation stimuli that come from extreme situations or far from the aim of the project. It also focuses on continuous innovation processes in which the designer is not the only creative actor of the process and often only helps draw the route of innovation, instead of drawing it alone. Although the ethical debate has always been alive in conventional industrial design, considering this renewed horizon of ADD, a particular reflection on the concepts of ethics, time and the designer's responsibility, is necessary. This paper describes the transformation of the traditional designer considered to be the demiurge of fashion and industrial products into a manufacturer of possible futures and co-author of futurist reframing.

Up to this point the literature has primarily focused on the black-white achievement gap without taking into account the underlying mobility patterns of individual students as they progress from one grade to the next. However, the degree to which policy makers and educators should be concerned about the black-white test score gap should be tied to how mobile the two groups of students are through the distribution of test scores from one grade to the next. In this paper I apply two nonparametric estimators of distributional mobility to data on test scores and track black-white differences in mobility across the entire distribution of achievement. When compared to whites, blacks tend to be less upwardly mobile and more downwardly mobile for both math and reading. This pattern is particularly prominent for reading in the very early years of schooling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Within the sub-population of patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain, three groups were analyzed in depth: patients with neuropathic back pain, patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy, and patients suffering from pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia. The central question was: On which features do patients base their assessment of pain medications and which features are most useful in the process of evaluating and selecting possible therapies? A detailed literature review, focus groups with patients, and face-to-face interviews with widely recognized experts for pain treatment were conducted to identify relevant treatment attributes of a pain medication. A pre-test was conducted to verify the structure of relevant and dominant attributes using factor analyses by evaluating the most frequently mentioned representatives of each factor. The Discrete-Choice Experiment (DCE) used a survey based on self-reported patient data including socio-demographics and specific parameters concerning pain treatment. Furthermore, the neuropathic pain component was determined in all patients based on their scoring in the painDETECT(A (R)) questionnaire. For statistical data analysis of the DCE, a random effect logit model was used and coefficients were presented. A total of 1,324 German patients participated in the survey, of whom 44 % suffered from neuropathic back pain (including mixed pain syndrome), 10 % complained about diabetic polyneuropathy, and 4 % reported pain due to post-herpetic neuralgia. A total of 36 single quality aspects of pain treatment, detected in the qualitative survey, were grouped in 7 dimensions by factor analysis. These 7 dimensions were used as attributes for the DCE. The DCE model resulted in the following ranking of relevant attributes for treatment decision: no character change, less nausea and vomiting, pain reduction (coefficient: > 0.9 for all attributes, high impact), rapid effect, low risk of addiction (coefficient similar to 0.5, middle impact), applicability with comorbidity (coefficient similar to 0.3), and improvement of quality of sleep (coefficient similar to 0.25). All attributes were highly significant (p < 0.001). The results were intended to enable early selection of an individualized pain medication. The results of the study showed that DCE is an appropriate means for the identification of patient preferences when being treated with specific pain medications. Due to the fact that pain perception is subjective in nature, the identification of patientsA ' preferences will enable therapists to better develop and implement patient-oriented treatment of chronic pain. It is therefore essential to improve the therapistsA ' understanding of patient preferences in order to make decisions concerning pain treatment. DCE and direct assessment should become valid instruments to elicit treatment preferences in chronic pain.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Juhnke, Christin] Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Nuebling, Matthias] GEB Empir Consulting MbH, Freiburg, Germany; [Junker, Uwe] Univ Cologne, Acad Teaching Hosp, Sana Klinikum Remscheid, Dept Anesthesiol Intens Care Med Pain Therapy & P, Remscheid, Germany; [Stemmler, Edgar] Pfizer Pharma GmbH, Berlin, Germany; [Kohlmann, Thomas] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany; [Leverkus, Friedhelm] Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany",University of Cologne; Pfizer; Universitat Greifswald; Pfizer,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, IGM Inst Hlth Econ & Healthcare Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020; Juhnke, Christin/AAT-1479-2021","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211; Juhnke, Christin/0000-0002-3949-0612","Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany; patient advocacy group Deutsche Schmerzliga e.V.","Pfizer Deutschland GmbH, Berlin, Germany; patient advocacy group Deutsche Schmerzliga e.V.","The authors extend their thanks to the patient advocacy group Deutsche Schmerzliga e.V. for their support in conducting this study.

Price per kilo in different size categories of the same species differs significantly. This means that the average price for a species may change due to e.g., high grading or a changing climate, which both have the potential to change the size composition of the catch. Estimates show that quantity flexibilities differ substantially across size and species, while scale flexibilities, in general, are close to homothetic. Holding total catch constant, an approximate 1% decrease in the largest size category and a corresponding increase in the smallest size category is estimated to reduce the value of an average week's catch by roughly 0.1-0.4%. The results imply that the effect of size on price is an important consideration when formulating regulations or policies to curb, for example, high grading.","Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Sjöberg, E (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, 260 S Cent Campus Dr,Orson Spencer Hall,RM 343, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",eric.sjoberg@economics.utah.edu,,,,,,,50,20,21,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

However, the (overall) unemployment rate did increase following the GFC and has still not returned to pre-GFC levels. Unemployment rates for young people went up much more dramatically and remain high. This article investigates the impact of the GFC on youth unemployment and long-term unemployment. To anticipate our results, we find that the youth unemployment rates increased significantly owing to a fall in aggregate demand, although youth wages had been falling relative to adult wages.

Drawing upon the 2010 Ecuador Household Asset Survey (EAFF) and the 2010 Ghana Household Asset Survey (GHAS), nationally representative surveys for Ecuador and Ghana, respectively, this study investigates the relationship between women's ownership of assets and physical and emotional abuse by spouses against currently partnered women over the previous twelve months. It uses the value of a woman's total assets compared to those of her partner as the main proxy for a woman's bargaining power. Differentiating between physical and emotional violence in both countries, the study finds that women's share of couple wealth is significantly associated with lower odds of physical violence in Ecuador and emotional violence in Ghana.

Most of the increase in the wealth gap was associated with a relatively rapid increase in the value of housing assets by single men over the study period. The findings of this study challenge a wider literature that tends to emphasise that men are more prepared to invest in risky' assets such as shares and that their higher wealth is due to these investment strategies. Instead, this study emphasises how, in the Australian context at least, it was higher growth rates in the value of housing assets owned by single men that improved their wealth position relative to single women over the last decade.","[Austen, Siobhan] Curtin Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Ong, Rachel; Jefferson, Therese] Curtin Univ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Bawa, Sherry] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Bawa, Sherry] Curtin Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University; Curtin University,"Austen, S (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Siobhan.Austen@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Ong ViforJ, Rachel/C-1097-2008","Ong ViforJ, Rachel/0000-0001-8557-8802; Jefferson, Therese/0000-0001-7393-7046; Bawa, Sherry/0000-0002-3346-4691; austen, siobhan/0000-0002-2367-0889","Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre; Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre; Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","This work was supported by the Bankwest Curtin Economics Centre.

But critics argue that it has delivered few benefits to the wider population. In this context, industry advocates have drawn attention to the direct and indirect impact of IT on output and employment. This article critically explores these claims by locating them in the conventional (neoliberal) narrative of India's recent economic development. It finds that industry claims are exaggerated and that IT industry demand is often linked to the creation of employment in industries dominated by informal employment arrangements. The prevalence of informal employment highlights problems of low pay and poor or hazardous working conditions. The IT industry's rise to prominence has traversed a deeply ingrained process of labour market informalisation. In exaggerating the employment-generating capacity of the IT industry, its supporters have largely ignored problems relating to the quality of employment.","Australian Catholic Univ, Inst Relig Polit & Soc, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia",Australian Catholic University,"Barnes, T (通讯作者)，Australian Catholic Univ, Inst Relig Polit & Soc, Level 6,215 Spring St, Melbourne, Vic 3000, Australia.",tom.barnes@acu.edu.au,,"Barnes, Tom/0000-0002-3768-7905",,,,,55,2,2,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study analyses the impacts of trade policy on unemployment rates in Nigeria. Using time series data from 1970 to 2010, it adopts the vector error correction methodology. In order to explore the impact of a range of variables on the relationship between trade openness and national unemployment rates, these variables, in a system of equations, include measures of trade openness, public recurrent spending on education, foreign price shocks and real gross domestic product or alternatively income per capita. The findings reveal that in the long run, real output and income per capita lead to a decline in unemployment, but trade openness policy is associated with an increase in unemployment. Foreign policy shocks, as proxied by commodity prices, also exert a positive effect on unemployment rates and do not contribute subsequently to restoring the system to equilibrium. However, the initial impact of openness and foreign price shocks captured by short-term dynamics are observed to reduce unemployment.","[Nwaka, Ikechukwu D.] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Uma, Kalu E.] Fed Univ Ndufu Alike Ikwo, Dept Econ & Dev Studies, Ebonyi, Ebonyi State, Nigeria; [Nwaka, Ikechukwu D.; Tuna, Gulcay] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Nwaka, ID (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Dept Econ, Via Mersin 10, Famagusta, North Cyprus, Turkey.",ikechukwu.nwaka@emu.edu.tr,"Nwaka, Ikechukwu D./AAE-6228-2020","Nwaka, Ikechukwu D./0000-0002-4903-3976",,,,,58,9,11,2,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Mannheim's reconceptualization of the role of the utopist as a radical/revolutionary who acts to shatter present reality and reconstruct it according to a vision of the future is evaluated in the light of K. Popper's critique of utopian engineering; also, Popper's proposal of piecemeal engineering is critiqued and found deficient. Polak's thesis of a vital image of the future is tested on the basis of J. B. Bury's idea of progress and found to be modern-born. The historic roots of the dominant utopian image of the future (within the idea of progress) are clarified as the technological/consumer society within industrial civilization. However, as this modem thesis become dystopic, an antithesis, in the form of utopian socialism, emerged to contend with the dominant utopian image of the future throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. The dialectical struggle between contending utopic images of the future within the idea of progress brought about the progressivesocialist synthesis, which in turn, opposed by reactionary neoliberalism (a counter-utopia), has realized a new, postmodern thesis - as global sustainable development - a reconstructed, 21st century utopian image of the future.

Different user groups manage and consume these touristic ES differently, resulting in discrepancies and potential conflicts. Despite the urgency to find inclusive local approaches for sustainable development, tourism studies still analyze socio-economic and ecological impacts separately and lack integrated social-ecological approaches to improve foresight in tourism planning. Based on a growing concern regarding the future of Costalegre on the Jalisco coast of Western Mexico, we analyze through interviews, surveys, and participant observation the dependence of tourism on specific ecosystem services and conduct a scenario analysis which shows present and future implications for the social-ecological system. Furthermore, this analysis shows in detail how different scenarios change ES provision and people's livelihoods. Key findings include identifying freshwater provision and cultural ES as the most important touristic ES. At a regional scale, peasants in ejidos are the main ES stewards, whereas high-class tourism facilities constitute important local stewards. Benefits, mainly access to freshwater and the beach, are unequally distributed, provoking conflicts among different ES user groups that may escalate in the near future. Improved communication between all user groups and strengthening of key political actors seem to be the most immediate recommendations to ensure the long term sustainability of this particular region. This work may contribute to improved planning and decision-making as our ES based scenarios are a first step to integrate social-ecological knowledge into improved decision-making. At a local scale, the study reveals the most likely future development options and their social and ecological consequences. It could also serve as a baseline for informed policy making.

The effects on private tutoring are particularly significant for high achievers, while the effects on self-study and leisure hours are strong for low achievers.

The authors analyze two related questions: First, they show how the procyclicality of financial factors, captured by the financial accelerator, amplifies the transmission of supply and demand shocks and impacts the intuition they get from a basic intermediate macroeconomics. Second, adopting an optimal policy perspective, they show how a policymaker may use macroprudential policy to complete monetary policy measures. Following the Mundellian Policy Assignment principle, macroprudential policy should be specialized to address the procyclicality problem to suppress welfare losses associated with the building of financial imbalances, thus helping monetary policy to concentrate on the output inflation tradeoff.","[Poutineau, Jean-Christophe; Vermandel, Gauthier] Univ Rennes, Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes,"Poutineau, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Rennes, Rennes, France.",jean-christophe.poutineau@univ-rennes1.fr; gauthier@vermandel.fr,,"Gauthier, Vermandel/0000-0001-6241-5875",,,,,14,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

The level of reusability of waste products - or green design - is a crucial choice variable in the North. This is because, in the presence of imperfect international monitoring, non-reusable waste can be illegally mixed with reusable waste. I explore the driving forces for illegal waste movement, with a particular focus on local waste regulations such as the EU's Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment. Under mild conditions, it is shown that increasingly stringent regulations in the North can induce Northern firms to reduce product reusability. Consequently, the flow of non-reusable waste to the South increases, magnifying the pollution haven effect. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The SRE as well as the above mentioned economic factors vary greatly in the European Union countries and, consequently, the occurrence of outlying observations can be anticipated in a respective analysis. In such a case, robust regression methods represent an acceptable and useful analytic tool, high-breakdown point methods allowing the detection of regression outliers, leverage points and influential observations as well. In terms of SRE level, the EU countries can be divided into three significantly different groups. The analysis, based on 2012 data, has been performed for both the whole set of EU countries and the subgroups.

In the theoretical section the focus is on the issues of immigrants and expatriates in the globally inter-connected world and the process of psychological adaptation of an individual to a foreign culture. In May 2013 semi-structured interviews were conducted with 6 Czech expatriates currently living in Zambia (5 women and 1 man). Most of the interviewees live in Zambian society for at least 2 years, and work in the development sector. The interviews were designed on the basis of the four dimensions of CCAI (Cross-cultural adaptability inventory) by C. Kelley and J. Meyers (1995). The main areas of adaptation we focused on were: the cognitions and feelings of expatriates after arrival to the host culture, the effect of time spend in the host culture on feelings and cognitions, stresses and problems in everyday life, Czech and Zambian cultural differences, and social relations with members of host culture. As a method of qualitative data analysis we used the content analysis. The results show the limited potential of full social and cultural adaptation of members of European culture to African culture, and identify the main areas, where cultural clashes, misunderstandings, and conflicts may arise. Our results show that probably the most pressing matter, and the biggest barrier to the full adaptation to the Zambian culture, lies in the area of close and intimate relationships and dyadic relationships such as differences in the concepts of friendship and love. Another important group of topics that have arisen in the process of data analysis are the differences in time perception and time management, and differences in work-related behavior. In this paper, we have identified key skills and competencies, whose training in the period before the departure should help Czech immigrants and expatriates to adapt more successfully to the African culture. These key topics are going to be applied in the following research on the adaptation of Czech immigrants and expatriates on African continent.",,,,,"Horák, Miroslav/D-8000-2018; Čeněk, Jiří/D-7919-2018","Horák, Miroslav/0000-0001-8327-8785; Čeněk, Jiří/0000-0002-2543-5532",,,,,33,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,76,88,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800009,0

Observing the recent developments in the taxation of energy, the taxation of renewable energy opened up a number of questions regarding energy policies. Of particular interest are the differences in how renewable energy is taxed, which in some member states is done against the environmental policy of EU, making the investments in these countries uncertain. As a result of uneven implementation of international standards, inefficient state support, and damaged relationships in market competition between traditional and alternative energy producers - many undesired consequences have arisen, making the viability of these tax policies questionable.","[Cindori, Sonja; Boricevic, Anamarija] Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Cindori, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Law, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",,,,,,,,4,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,395,402,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200051,0

How do the hospital admission patterns that generate waiting lists affect different patients? What are the hospitals characteristics that determine waiting times? By developing a model of healthcare provision and analysing empirically the entire waiting time distribution we attempt to shed some light on those issues. We first build a theoretical model that describes the optimal waiting time distribution for capacity constraint hospitals. Secondly, employing duration analysis, we obtain empirical representations of that distribution across hospitals in the UK from 1997-2005. We observe important differences on the 'scale' and on the 'shape' of admission rates. Scale refers to how quickly patients are treated and shape represents trade-offs across duration-treatment profiles. By fitting the theoretical to the empirical distributions we estimate the main structural parameters of the model and are able to closely identify the main drivers of these empirical differences. We find that the level of resources allocated to elective surgery (budget and physical capacity), which determines how constrained the hospital is, explains differences in scale. Changes in benefits and costs structures of healthcare provision, which relate, respectively, to the desire to prioritise patients by duration and the reduction in costs due to delayed treatment, determine the shape, affecting short and long duration patients differently.","[Dimakou, Sofia] Technol Educ Inst Athens, Dept Business Adm, GR-12243 Athens, Greece; [Dimakou, Ourania] Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Russell Sq, London WC1, England; [Basso, Henrique S.] Banco Espana, Res Dept, Madrid 24014, Spain",University of West Attica; University of London; Banco de Espana,"Dimakou, O (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Dept Econ, Russell Sq, London WC1, England.",od1@soas.ac.uk,,"Dimakou, Ourania/0000-0002-3362-5256",,,,,21,4,4,3,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Websites of the surveyed communes and Local Action Groups (LAGs) of the surveyed communes were also important sources of information. In the light of the analysis, the integrated model of sustainable development was considered in creating the optimal development of communes located within environmentally valuable areas. It has been shown that local authorities aiming at the implementation an integration of the model of sustainable development are characterized by a higher level of environmental competitiveness. It was pointed out that the implementation of this model suffers such difficulties as shortage of social capital. The implementation of the integrated model of sustainable development also requires changes in attitudes and openness of local authorities towards the widely implemented strategy of intersectoral cooperation. The surveyed governments have taken action to the creation of the integrated model, e.g. widespread participation in LAGs, the first experience in cross-sectoral cooperation outside the LAG in clusters, the implementation of the model is, thus, in the early stages.

In this article, it is recognized that from little more than thirty years, Mexico's tax system has been characterized by low tax burden, high evasion and tax inefficiency, and very high tax inequity. These features are related to the neoliberal economic policy that has prevailed since the beginning of the eighties: a weak and permissive, flexible and deregulated state, and highly disciplined. Now, in the same way that Mexico retained throughout his life traces of an adverse economic policy, also suffers the fate and future of their economic development.

The approach overcomes the drawback of universal solvers, which often fail in solving large instances of the p-median problem due to big demands on memory and computational time. The radial approach uses an approximation of a common distance by some pre-determined distances given by so called dividing points. Covering formulation of the problem enables the implementation of the solving technique in the frame of commercial optimization software to obtain near optimal solution in a short term. Regardless of this approximate approach effectivity, huge instances of the p-median problem resist to attempts to solve them by the approach due to big size of the model, which depends on the cardinality of the possible service center location set. Suggested sequential method is based on successive reduction of the cardinality. At each step of the method, the radial formulation of the p-median problem is solved for such system of radii, which balances the cardinality of the possible service center location set.","[Janacek, Jaroslav] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia; [Kvet, Marek] Univ Zilina, Fac Secur Engn, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina; University of Zilina,"Janácek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",jaroslav.janacek@fri.uniza.sk; marek.kvet@fbi.uniza.sk,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,315,320,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900054,0

It is very important to continuously develop and adapt management system as external conditions and strategy, which they are decided to apply. Process management is among current management methods, management theorists that are considered to be the most complete and most effective ways to manage costs. The result of such management is cost saving, which is create by effectively setting process consisting of specific activities. Process management brings to company not only a picture of the current status, but also helps to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and costs of individual processes. The aim of this article is to quantify the cost effectiveness through the model of process costs and identify problematic activities with low cost effectiveness. In examining of this issues we used basic methods as analysis, synthesis, comparison, deduction, further methods of observation and controlled interviews with workers. Model of process costs was used by quantifying the costs. This model examines the expenditure processes, the set of activities which are changing inputs into outputs. This model is built on knowing how much it cost not the outputs of the processes, but the processes themselves. Process costs are total resources for the implementation of the concrete process. According to British Standard BS 6143, this consists of the following costs: 1. compliance costs-the total cost of conversion of inputs to outputs in a certain process, which is implemented in the most effective manner, 2. costs of non-conformity-losses caused by waste of time, material and other capabilities associated with the generation of disagreement within the process. Costs of non-conformity in the process are unnecessarily expended costs. In connection with the model of process costs and also for quantify of costs and cost effectiveness of specific activities were used indicators of the overall process costs and cost effectiveness. The article presents the results of the analysis of process management in a selected company, where we focused on quantifying the cost effectiveness in the process of establishment data services by application of model of process costs. To monitor processes in the company uses a management information system that is set so that allows you to capture details of individual costs. We selected process related to data services, and we have identified activities that are spent highest costs. Subsequently, we determined cost effectiveness and additional calculations we determined the proportion of the costs of specific activities, on the total cost of the process. The result is a definition of the activities with the highest effectiveness and problematic activities with low effectiveness of utilization costs. Based on the results we put forward the manager, a specific actions that should be solved. In conclusion, we note that the model of process costs is able to identify the problematic activities in terms of utilization costs. In our opinion, the current period is very needed for companies to search the ways of reducing costs, respectively finding problem areas and here it is possible to apply the model of process costs, which can help to ensure long-term competitiveness.","[Lateckova, Anna; Stuchly, Peter; Galisova, Veronika] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Enterprises Informat Syst, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Látecková, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Enterprises Informat Syst, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",anna.lateckova@uniag.sk; peter.stuchly@uniag.sk; xhanova@uniag.sk,"Látečková, Anna/AAP-9060-2021","Látečková, Anna/0000-0002-0682-5025",,,,,12,0,0,0,8,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,582,587,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800056,0

Even the small number of private businessman or businesswoman who was doing business did not have an appropriate legality from the Serbian regime installed in the economy of Kosovo then.

Internal motivation, teacher's personality, education methods, education environment and other incentives belong to motivation factors influencing the student's learning. The article focuses on the assessment of student's motivation in the subject of Basics of Accounting at a bachelor study, as well as the determination of motivation factors affecting students. The basic information source of article's content solution represents a questionnaire survey aimed to confirm or refute the hypothesis of the survey. The survey was conducted on a representative sample of respondents created by available and random selection, representing 87 students of the first year of full-time bachelor study at the Faculty of Economics and Management, Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra. Standard methods of scientific work as selection, analysis, synthesis and deduction are used in the article. Individual items of scale questionnaire and the differences between these items were assessed by means of selected statistical methods, namely the selection of descriptive characteristics such as point and interval estimation of average, standard error of estimate of mean and standard deviation, as well as non-parametric tests: Mauchly's sphericity test and Friedman test to determine the significance of differences between items of the questionnaire. Based on the statistical assessment of the questionnaire outcome, it results that previously acquired knowledge and skills from completed basic economic subjects partially helped students in the study of accounting, and furthermore students used their skills and talents in the study. The subject Basics of Accounting was studied without adequate motivation and as a last resort. Lectures on and exercises in accounting, its scope and content were partially motivating for students. Students' interest in accounting was partially conditioned by the teacher's personality. Students seek information from other than recommended literary sources, as well use expert advice for the study of accounting. Attending the subject Basics of Accounting is for students a motivation with respect to their future position. Students should partially decide to pass this subject again. Based on the obtained results we conclude that the hypothesis is partially confirmed by the survey. The results of testing the differences between individual questionnaire items showed that there were statistically significant differences between these items and thus dependence was found between them. The essential condition for learning is the motivation that affects the results of learning in different situations. Motivation determines intrinsic activation of students resulting from their needs and is relevant to their claims. Motives present the intrinsic motives or incentives, activities designed to achieve a specific objective. They can be considered as the reasons for student's behaviour. For each individual there are many different motives that are interrelated and constitute a form of hierarchy. It is important to choose a correct school for a successful study. The student should choose a school based on how he/she may develop and on factors which may satisfy his/her needs for self-realization. An important motivating factor for the choice of school and future job are skills and talents of student, interest in an area and the perspective of a future career in a department.","[Vanova, Alexandra Ferenczi; Greganova, Radomira Hornyak; Varyova, Ivana; Kosovska, Iveta] Slovak Univ Agr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Vanová, AF (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",alexandra.ferenczi@uniag.sk; radomira.greganova@uniag.sk; ivana.varyova@uniag.sk; iveta.kosovska@uniag.sk,"Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/K-5532-2018; Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/ABA-8584-2021; Ferenczi Vanova, Alexandra/P-4099-2018","Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/0000-0001-7433-2014; Hornyak Greganova, Radomira/0000-0001-7433-2014; Ferenczi Vanova, Alexandra/0000-0003-1598-5271",,,,,9,0,0,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,202,211,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800020,0

However, the existence of noise which may mask or mimic the deterministic structure of the time series, can lead to spurious results. In this work, EMD (Empirical Mode Decomposition) is specially developed for analyzing such nonlinear and non-stationary data. Thus, the major of this study is to integrate PSR, EMD and NN techniques optimized by particle swarm optimization to attempts to increase the accuracy for the prediction of stock index.

With 70% forest cover, only 5% of the forest area is designated to commercial management. Recent analyses advocate for increasing forest utilization to decrease the country's dependence on imports of forest-based products, particularly charcoal, as a mean to diversify the national economy. This study examines how increasing the forest area under commercial management might allow for sustainable charcoal production in Bhutan. Using an optimization model, cost efficient locations of charcoal production sites were identified at subnational level. Simulation results show that at a discount rate of 12% charcoal production is profitable in eleven of the nineteen districts. Domestic charcoal production has the potential to offset up to 61% of charcoal imports, requiring an increase in utilized forest area from 5% to 15% of total forest area. Charcoal production would represent a high value-added activity, with an average value-added share of 50.8%. Transportation and labor costs have only minor effects on profitability, comprising 11.7% and 2.5% of output value, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses confirm the results that using a decentralized approach, Bhutan can increase commercial forest management without jeopardizing its highly acclaimed forest conservation agenda.

The three types of REITs are timber REITs, which focus on timberland management; specialized REITs, which focus on properties that are specialized in a single use; and common REITs, which consist of all REITs except specialized REITs. Results from the intertemporal CAPM demonstrate that REITs behave like procyclical small and value stocks. Results from multivariate GARCH model show that the conditional volatilities of REITs rise more after good news and REITs as a whole respond positively to past shocks. Despite being a part of specialized REITs, timber REITs have large market capitalizations and no excess returns, and are insensitive to recessionary shocks.

Without means to adequately capture that value, societal ES values have little influence on landowners' management decisions, leading to inefficiencies in forest-based ES provision. To understand these inefficiencies, we employ data envelopment analysis (DEA) to assess three types of efficiency - technical, allocative and total profit - of planted pine forests using loblolly pine (Pines taeda L.) in the Southern US as an example. Field data from n = 28 plots are used to assess stand level efficiency in the production of timber, carbon sequestration, and species richness considering inputs such as site index, age and number of trees, precipitation and temperatures. Given the impacts of climate change on key inputs, we also assess efficiency under climate scenarios representing moderate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions pathways. We find that 96% of forest plots are technically efficient in providing timber, carbon sequestration and species richness and 75% are allocative or total profit efficient With climate change, allocative or total profit efficiency remains similar to the initial conditions, and total profit substantially increases (42.8% and 45.6% for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).

Furthermore, existing models are also static in nature-predicated on problematic assumptions regarding the constant supremacy of the DSS compliance objective-what leads them to overlook important shifts amidst the multiple and conflicting goals of the DSS that take place over time and across disputes. Building on the goal-based approach developed in the social sciences, the article introduces a multidimensional framework for analyzing the DSS effectiveness, using the multiple, conflicting and shifting goals set for the system by WTO Members as key effectiveness benchmarks. The article then turns to closely examine the novel concept of 'goal-shifting' - essential for effectiveness assessment - and through interview-based analysis of different categories of WTO disputes shows how the DSS goals change with time and context, as a consequence of the changing modalities in which the system operates.","[Agon, Sivan Shlomo] Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel",Bar Ilan University,"Agon, SS (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Ramat Gan, Israel.",sivanshlomo@gmail.com,,,,,,,71,3,3,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2016,15,4.0,,,,,671,701,,10.1017/S147474561600001X,0.0,,,31,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DY8BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385352300006,0

In our sample of the 100 largest forest product companies in 2012, 40 have timberland ownership and 51 are integrated into timberland by ownership or leasing arrangements. The descriptive analysis indicates that the vertical integration strategies vary between companies from different regions. Despite recent timberland divestments in North America and the Nordic countries, the area reported for timberland in ownership and control among the top 100 companies has increased between 2007 and 2012 due to growth in emerging countries. The results of logistic regression analysis indicate that larger, more profitable and pulp-production oriented companies are more likely to be vertically integrated into timberland. The underlying reason can be that the pulp producers are financially more vulnerable to the risks associated with a reliable flow of raw material to their mills. In a dynamic market situation with increasing competition over arable land, more research is required to understand the interplay between global strategies across different forest industry companies, and between forestry and other forms of land use.

The study finds that nonprofits are as responsive as for-profits to quality disclosure: quality improves along the reported dimensions and diminishes along the unreported ones. Further tests show that nonprofits may respond to donations and fail to mimic for-profits when competing with them. These findings suggest that donor response may be the motive for nonprofits to respond to quality disclosure in the same way as for-profit alternatives.","[Lu, Susan F.] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA",Purdue University System; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; Purdue University,"Lu, SF (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",lu428@purdue.edu,,,,,,,68,13,14,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Their awareness of pests and knowledge of how they spread is likely to be a key component of effective detection, eradication and management measures, but very little is known about awareness levels of this stakeholder group. To address this important evidence gap, a questionnaire survey of tree professionals was carried out across nine European countries. Results from 392 tree professionals show relatively low levels of self-reported awareness for a number of pests and pathogens. Levels of awareness rise with increasing age as well as frequency of visits to forests. Awareness also appeared higher where pests were present in the respondent's country. There was a high level of support for purchasing plant material from accredited sources. Barriers to changing behaviours include financial and resource pressures but also the perceived behaviour of others. Tree professionals utilise multiple sources to gain information about tree pests but the internet was the most popular. A considerable amount of pest information is already available online and this study recommends that different approaches to raising awareness be trialled, including the use of experienced tree professionals as knowledge brokers and exploring new ways of using digital technologies as a learning tool.

Previous literature has concluded that part-time workers suffer a wage penalty, but its magnitude varies across studies and countries. The part-time penalty is the otherwise unexplained element of the gap between full-time and part-time hourly earnings. One potential factor accounting for international differences in this penalty is the coverage of collective bargaining. This article outlines research examining wage differences between part-time and full-time male and female workers in Spain, a country with a very high level of coverage of collective agreements but very heterogeneous regional labour markets. Results are obtained using an econometric decomposition specifically adapted to matched employer-employee data. They show that intra-firm wage differentials for part- and full-time workers with the same characteristics are negligible. But results that are perhaps less expected are those based on the regional analysis - an unprecedented perspective compared with the previous literature. These results show that despite very significant differences in economies and labour markets, observed wage gaps between part-time and full-time workers in each Spanish region are also mainly explained by different endowments of individual, job and firm characteristics. Overall, our evidence highlights the over-riding role of wage setting mechanisms, specifically collective bargaining coverage, in minimising inter-regional differences in the wage penalty of part-time workers.","[Ramos, Raul] Univ Barcelona, Appl Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Sanroma, Esteban] Univ Barcelona, Appl Econ, Dept Econ, Barcelona, Spain; [Simon, Hipolito] Univ Alicante, Appl Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Alicante, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona; Universitat d'Alacant,"Ramos, R (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Econometria Estad & Econ Aplicada, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",rramos@ub.edu,"Ramos-Lobo, Raul/L-3287-2013; Sanroma, Esteban/P-6337-2014; Simon, Hipolito/K-8807-2014","Ramos-Lobo, Raul/0000-0003-0047-0793; Sanroma, Esteban/0000-0002-1965-6582; Simon, Hipolito/0000-0001-7668-307X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-41022-R, ECO2013-41310-R, 2014 SGR-420, CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under grants ECO2013-41022-R, ECO2013-41310-R, 2014 SGR-420 and CSO2014-55780-C3-2-P (National R&D&I Plan).",,44,1,2,1,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This paper investigates the attainment consequences of sector choice and peer quality among recent high school graduates. Using data on all Preliminary SAT (PSAT) test-takers between 2004 and 2006, we develop a novel measure of peer ability for most two-year and four-year colleges in the United Statesthe average PSAT of enrolled students. We document substantial variation in this measure of peer quality across two-year colleges and nontrivial overlap between the two-year and four-year sectors.

The growth model developed in this paper is an extension of the basic Solow model and includes a simple climate model. Even though the model is very simple it is very powerful in its predictions. Students use the model to explore various scenarios illustrating how economic activity today will inflict damages from higher temperatures on future generations. But students also observe that future generations will be richer than today's generation due to productivity growth and population stabilization. Hence, the richer future generations will not be as rich as they would be without climate change. Since the cost of action is absorbed by the current generation and the benefits of action accrue to future generations students can conduct a cost-benefit analysis and explore the importance of the discount rate.

However, only few studies have focused on how neoliberalization has influenced the social constructions of natural resources policy. This study aims to understand how forest policy has a contested meaning among different stakeholders. This study identifies five discourses among the stakeholders who were involved in the congressional discussion of the Native Forest Law (NFL). The main difference among the discourses is whether the target of the NFL should be the individual or should it be some collective entity. The property rights discourse, articulated by the forest industry, embraced free-market ideals. The abandoned forest discourse, articulated by government officials, made interesting parallels between the situation of the forests and the specific political conditions of Chile after Pinochet's dictatorship. The environmentalist discourse advocated for conservation through regulation, while the local development discourse, articulated by some NGOs, embraced egalitarian ideals. The peasant discourse, uttered by organizations that have the closest contact with native forest, uttered ambivalent identities. Given that the Constitution of Chile only acknowledges individuals' rights, peasants' organizations only get to claim political power when they articulate themselves as individual owners. In this way, the neoliberal reforms are influencing the construction of subjectivities in the Chilean forestry discourses. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
