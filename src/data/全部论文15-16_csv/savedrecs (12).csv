In the literature, there exist a few methods to estimate the size of the shadow economy. The labour approach method, used in estimating the size of employment in the shadow economy in Czech Republic in this paper, assumes that the official rate of labour participation ( activity rate) is constant, any change being considered to be due to activities from shadow economy. The results revealed the inverse relationship between activity rates and employment in the shadow economy, as was expected. If the rate of activity increases, employment in the shadow economy decreases. The lowest activity rates were detected from 2008 to 2011. In the same period was the amount of the employment in the shadow economy highest. Specifically there was activity rate around 58,5 % with 267 thousand persons employed in the shadow economy in 2008. By 2011, the activity rate fell to 58,3 % with 291 thousand persons employed in the shadow economy.","[Jajkowicz, Ondrej] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Jajkowicz, O (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Natl Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",ondrej.jajkowicz@vsb.cz; michaela.ticha@vsb.cz,"TICHÁ, MICHAELA/ABF-8233-2020; Tichá, Michaela/AAD-3063-2019","TICHÁ, MICHAELA/0000-0003-4721-1529;","VSB - Technical University SGS grant [SP2016/101]; Monetary, Fiscal and Institutional Aspects of Economic Policy in Selected Countries","VSB - Technical University SGS grant; Monetary, Fiscal and Institutional Aspects of Economic Policy in Selected Countries","This paper was financially supported within the VSB - Technical University SGS grant project No. SP2016/101: Monetary, Fiscal and Institutional Aspects of Economic Policy in Selected Countries.",,10,0,0,0,2,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,267,273,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200028,0

(2012) and Lucotte (2012) emphasize that in emerging countries, the adoption of inflation targeting (IT) monetary policy and its discipline character allow intensifying their efforts to collect tax revenue and/or expenditure rationalization, and allows the reduction of their budget deficits (Kadria and Ben Aissa, 2014). Nevertheless, the lag in the effect of monetary policy contains vital information for the policy evaluation (Fang and Miller, 2011). Hence, our contribution to the previous literature is then to evaluate the time varying treatment effect of the IT's adoption by emerging countries on their budgetary discipline in terms of reducing or mastering the public deficit. To do this, we used the propensity score matching approach in order to take account of this lag effect or from this effect throughout time. Our empirical analysis, conducted on a sample of 41 economies (20 IT and 21 non-IT economies) for the period from 1990 to 2010, shows that the lag in the effect of IT on public deficit performance proves to be shorter and gradual for emerging countries that have adopted this monetary policy framework. Our conclusions corroborate the literature disciplining effect of IT on fiscal policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The highest number of planned hunting of deer was recorded in Plzensky region, fallow deer, moufflon and wild boar in Stredocesky region and roe deer dominated in Jihocesky region. High concentration of hoofed game was evaluated on the basis of planned annual hunting of game per hectare of hunting area. The highest number of planned hunting per hectare then was recorded for deer and moufflon in Karlovarsky region, fallow deer in Stredocesky region, roe deer in Kralovehradecky region and wild boar in Liberecky region. Using the example of Stredocesky region in terms of real hunting during last 10 years a growing trend of population of deer, fallow deer, moufflon and wild boar was demonstrated. The slight decline was recorded in population of roe deer.

Therefore this research is focused on the decision-making framework development with Lean and Green Manufacturing tools and End-of-Life scenario consideration. A specific mechanism was developed for used industrial equipment life cycle extension in order to save money, nature, and society. The proposed framework makes business more profitable by including an innovative approach of using complex TRIZ to make it more universal and easy to use for the largest variation of used industrial products. To achieve this aim the Green Matrix was elaborated on the basis of the TRIZ Contradiction Matrix and Green Engineering principles. Much attention was paid to the remanufacturing process in the decision-making framework to assess the moment condition of equipment. An integrated method for evaluating the remanufacturability of the used industrial equipment is proposed, in which the technological, economic and environmental assessment of spent industrial products is analyzed in terms of remanufacturing. Development of an approach for used industrial product assessment improves company inventory controllability and utilization that in turn minimizes environmental impact and resource consumption during the entire product cycle.","[Karaulova, Tatjana; Bashkite, Viktoria] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Karaulova, T; Bashkite, V (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, Ehitajate Tee 5, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",tatjana.karaulova@ttu.ee; viktoria.bashkite@gmail.ee,"Karaulova, Tatjana/G-7354-2016","Karaulova, Tatjana/0000-0002-4467-9161",Estonian Ministry of Education and Research [B41],"Estonian Ministry of Education and Research(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia)",This research was supported by Estonian Ministry of Education and Research for targeted financing scheme B41.,,29,12,13,4,25,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Design/methodology/approach - Typical distribution networks are identified and modeled through interviews with logistics companies in Korea. CO2 emission is calculated for the distribution network models to evaluate the environmental impact of different network designs. In addition, economic and customer service performances are evaluated to provide realistic and balanced solutions to supply chain managers. Findings - It is suggested that hybrid networks combining Hub-and-Spoke (HS) and Point-to-Point (PP) networks with a small number of sub-terminals are the most effective in both environmental and customer service aspects, whereas HS network is the most cost-effective. Research limitations/implications - The analysis in this study is based on certain assumptions, and hence full application of these results to specific cases is limited. The combination of PP network with HS network is suggested, forming a hybrid network, and CO2 mitigation policies need to consider support schemes that can influence a firm's decision making in relation to network design. Originality/value - Little attention, however, has been paid to the environmental impact of distribution network design in the exiting literature. This study is a rare attempt at evaluating the environmental impact of distribution network design and may provide valuable implications to policy-makers and practitioners in logistics and manufacturing companies.","[Kim, Hyo-Joo] Ocean Export Dept, Agility, South Korea; [Woo, Su-Han; Lai, Po-Lin] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, Seoul, South Korea; [Seo, Yong-Won] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University; Chung Ang University,"Woo, SH (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Int Logist, Seoul, South Korea.",shwoo@cau.ac.kr,,"Lai, Po-Lin/0000-0001-5940-864X; Woo, Su-Han/0000-0003-4196-6795",,,,,33,2,2,0,6,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The greater the size of the recessionary shock the lower the optimal promised rate and the higher the optimal threshold (i.e. the higher the probability of delivering the promised rate).

Furthermore, even for very large recessionary shocks it is not optimal to make unconditional promises.","[Lucia Florez-Jimenez, Maria] Minist Hacienda & Credito Publ, Bogota, Colombia; [Parra-Polania, Julian A.] Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia",Banco de la Republica Colombia,"Parra-Polania, JA (通讯作者)，Banco Republ, Bogota, Colombia.",jparrapo@banrep.gov.co,"Parra-Polania, Julian/G-4239-2016","Parra-Polania, Julian/0000-0003-3344-5949",,,,,18,4,4,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Because of the strong influence of both these factors on the standard of living, we have tried to answer the following question: In what time frame is the interaction between these two factors most prominent? Taking into account the data of the level of corruption (as measured by the Corruption Perception Index (CPI) and economic development (as measured by the movement of GDP per year), in the time period from 1995 to 2011, we divided the research results into three time zones: zone 1 - which covers the time period of the first five years (short-term impacts), zone 2 - which covers the time period of the next five years (medium-term impacts), and finally zone 3 - which covers the time period of the last five years (long-term impacts). Based on the research results, we have come to conclusion that the strongest causality between these two factors are in zone 2, the so-called medium-term framework. The empirical findings of this article suggest that further research in this direction is necessary, if we take into account the fact that corruption is present in almost all countries of the world.","[Lucic, Danilo; Radisic, Mladen; Dobromirov, Dusan] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Lucic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Tech Sci, Dept Ind Engn & Management, Novi Sad, Serbia.",lucic.danilo@gmail.com,,,"Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [47,005]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","The authors acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, within the Project No 47,005.",,60,14,21,1,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

The purpose of the simulation model is to simulate the behavior of the real system. The simulation model mimics when they run the substantial sites of the modelled system. The key to creating a simulation model is to understand the relationships and constraints of the modelled object. In the context of the research the simulation model is used for diseases in old age, particularly dementia. A tool for the simulation model is a software called STELLA, which meets the requirements for this area. The created and proposed model shows a number of benefits that are important for the expression of the economic aspects of diseases in the old age.

Some consequences of the globalization process can be predicted and measured, however, the globalization process of a worldwide range is very complex, it depends on economic characteristics and widely on political decisions, therefore, its consequences cannot be clearly anticipated. EU countries belong to a group of highly developed countries, yet differ from each other in many aspects. Globalization, on the one hand, is a process which provides the EU countries with many benefits, on the other hand though, it can also cause threats. The article focuses on the advantages and the negative effects of globalization. The aim of the article is to study the correlation between the selected economic values and the social and economic development for the EU countries. The article attempts to verify the statement, that the socio-economic development has a significant influence on the process of globalization.

For that purpose the import dependence of energy resources (overall and in terms of natural gas) of the EU and SEE is analyzed. The possible solutions for energy diversification are presented in the light of the projected gas pipeline projects linking the European continent with the Caspian and Asia Minor regions, passing through SEE region. EU's chances of obtaining energy security through self-sufficiency are low so new routes of gas pipelines are urgently needed. The region of SEE is even more problematic, as it is highly dependent on solid fuels and does not have the infrastructure to provide itself and to transit natural gas. On the other hand, it could be a part of the solution, as any energy diversification for Europe through the Caspian and Asia Minor is possible with transmission through SEE countries.

Since detecting structural changes in individual attitudes requires long periods of time, we used repeated cross-sectional data from the General Social Survey (GSS) cumulative Datafile that include twenty cross-sectional surveys and span a period of over thirty years (1978-2010). A multilevel logistic model with time-varying slopes and two independent levels of variation allowed us to capture temporal patterns net of age and cohort effects. Despite an overall flat trend in demand for redistribution, we find that driving factors in shaping redistributive preferences have changed considerably over time. These changes are little influenced by birth cohort. Specifically, personal income is a strong predictor, with the poor-rich gap increasing over time. Elderly people are more adverse to redistribute than they were in the past. Large changes also characterize the effects of education, ethnic bonds and self-declared party identification. Over time, highly educated people have increased their probability to be in favor of redistribution while the less educated have become less prone. Ethnicity mattered more in the 1970s than in the 2000s and it is increasingly mediated by the political party affiliation of individuals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A signed jump variation is added as an additional explanatory variable in the volatility equation according to the sign of return. These forecasting performances of models with jumps are compared with those without jumps. Being applied to the Chinese stock market, we find that the jump variation has a significant in-sample predictive power to volatility and the predictive power of the negative one is greater than the positive one. Furthermore, out-of-sample evidence based on the fresh model confidence set (MCS) test indicates that the incorporation of singed jumps in volatility models can significantly improve their forecasting ability. In particular, among the realized variance (RV)-based volatility models and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) class models, the heterogeneous autoregressive model of realized volatility (HAR-RV) model with the jump test and a decomposed signed jump variation have better out-of-sample forecasting performance. Finally, the use of the decomposed signed jump variations in predictive regressions can improve the economic value of realized volatility forecasts.","[Pu, Wang; Chen, Yixiang; Ma, Feng] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University,"Ma, F (通讯作者)，Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Chengdu, Peoples R China.",mafeng575@gmail.com,"Pu, Wang/P-4918-2019","Pu, Wang/0000-0002-5191-764X; Ma, Feng/0000-0002-6539-0965","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71371157, 71372109, 71401077]; Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education [14YJC790073]; Young Scholar Fund of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan province [15QNJJ0032]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education; Young Scholar Fund of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan province,"The authors are grateful for the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71371157, 71372109 and 71401077], the Humanities and Social Science Fund of Ministry of Education [grant number 14YJC790073] and the Young Scholar Fund of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan province [grant number 15QNJJ0032].",,53,27,29,3,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

With a rigid monetary system of the currency board and the deterioration of the economic performance of economic entities, credit expansion is being limited, and, despite the extremely high liquidity, this makes it difficult to access funds for financing of businesses, particularly in the case of short-term financial sources. In addition to traditional banking products, companies may use different instruments to finance their transactions, without the intermediary role of banks. These instruments include factoring. Factoring is a very common form of financing in the world, which is based on the purchase of receivables by the seller on the basis of goods sold with deferred payment or credit to the customer. Factoring can ease the problem of insufficient information openness in borrower's business environments that have weak information infrastructure if factors develop a proprietary database. The legislation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and surrounding regions has just begun the process of activating this specific form of financing. Bearing in mind the development of traditional business ties among countries in this community, it is expected that factoring can significantly contribute to increasing trade, increasing the turnover coefficient and thus GDP growth, thanks to more efficient financing and the fact that international factoring is legally equated with domestic factoring. The main objective of this paper is to review the legal basis for the use of mechanisms factoring in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the surrounding region, institutional basis for the implementation of a factoring contract and the estimated effects of the use of factoring in terms of increasing the degree of liquidity of economic entities and increasing the turnover coefficient.","[Ricka, Zeljko; Alihodzic, Almir] Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Zenica,"Ricka, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Zenica, Fac Econ, Zenica, Bosnia & Herceg.",revicon.tz@gmail.com; almir.dr2@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,298,307,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600029,0

While FITs are often regarded as the most effective RES support scheme, regulators around the world continuously review their FIT schemes in the light of budget constraints and evolving policy goals. We assess the impact of adjustments to FIT schemes by quantifying the relationship between FIT levels, i.e., the guaranteed amount paid per quantity of electricity produced and the propensity to invest in RES. Through a regime switching model, we quantify the impact of regulatory uncertainty induced by regulators considering moves from a FIT scheme to a more market-oriented regulatory regime. Our focus is on market-independent, fixed FITs, the dominant scheme in Europe receiving increasing attention globally. We find that RES investment projects under market-independent, fixed FIT schemes become now-or-never decisions and derive FIT thresholds required to induce investment. We show that uncertainty regarding future regulatory regimes delays or even reduces investment activity for FIT levels near electricity market prices and high probabilities of an imminent regime switch.

Further and mainly, the paper concentrates on the analysis of the single banking resolution and its supporting legislation in the form of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD). The BRRD's main innovation, the bail-in principle of resolving failing banks is assessed, both in terms of clear advantages as compared to the classic public bailout, and of potential drawbacks, especially concerning the contagious effects and adverse impact on specific groups of creditors with political repercussions. The European bail-in is also compared to the US Dodd-Frank Act solution, yet there has not been found any straight forward inspiration for the European scheme. Finally, the need for a common fiscal backstop is identified given the resource inadequacy of the current single resolution fund, especially if a major systemic crisis occurs. Thus, various arrangements of the fiscal backstop are proposed; it is argued that the European Stability Mechanism would serve the backstop purpose better than the options involving national budgets.","[Saroch, Stanislav; Famfule, Jan] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Saroch, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, W Churchill Sq 1938-4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",saroch@vse.cz; famj00@vse.cz,,,"Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague [IG210014]","Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague","This research was conducted under the project of the Faculty of International Relations, University of Economics, Prague, grant no.

Using these covariance matrix forecasts, we implement three risk-based portfolios: the global minimum variance portfolio, the equal risk contribution portfolio and the most diversified portfolio. There is evidence that the portfolio performance improves by using TSC or RTSC estimators as compared to the daily-returns-based estimator.

If we want to return a part of the population back into the productive labor process, which is biologically determined in humans, we will have to perform a deep reaching biofile transformation of the human culture. It means that we will have to create purposeful technology gaps for human participation in the abiotic production, which could possibly be fully automated, and at the same time it is high time to start considering how to return a part of the human population from large cities back to the country, where they could care for animals, soils, forests and the beauty of the landscape. This could alleviate the problem, which is not being considered these days, and which consists in the fact that a part of the population cannot have the required biological and sociocultural prerequisites for the intellectually demanding work in the tertiary sector.","[Smajs, Josef] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Smajs, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 507-41a, Brno, Czech Republic.",Josef.Smajs@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2036,2042,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800253,0

We construct the characteristic function of a coalition S for various coalition formation rules and we examine the corresponding cores. We first show that the.-core is non-empty provided each player's payoff decreases in the sum of all players' strategies. We generalize this result by showing that if S believes that the outside players form at least l(s) = n - s - (s-1) coalitions, then S has no incentive to deviate from the grand coalition and the corresponding core is non-empty (where n is the number of players in the game and s the number of members of S). We finally consider the class of linear aggregative games (Martimort and Stole 2010). In this case, if S believes that the outsiders form at least (l) over cap (S) =n/s - 1 coalitions [where (l) over cap <= l(s) <= l(S)] a core non-emptiness result holds again.","[Stamatopoulos, Giorgos] Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece",University of Crete,"Stamatopoulos, G (通讯作者)，Univ Crete, Dept Econ, Rethimnon 74100, Greece.",gstamato@uoc.gr,,"Stamatopoulos, Giorgos/0000-0003-1761-9216",,,,,12,4,4,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

National economies as well as the global economy are subject to fundamental changes in structure and functioning of the economy, both on the national and the trans-national levels. In order to resolve the current problems, new approaches need to be adopted. They include especially the development of a systematic perspective on new phenomena, the development of mutual connections and relationships, the need for interdisciplinarity and holistic approach, and the creation of architecture of mutual connections and relationships. The issue of globalisation is very extensive; therefore, it is not feasible to deal with a wide range of problems within this paper. We will focus on two important areas: technological change and issues of environmental damage. Within the framework of global economy, the topic of technological change includes two important processes happening in the present, more specifically the already mentioned technological change, as well as the processes of globalisation. The issue of environmental damage is characterised by the conflict between economy and nature.

Possible obstacles in education can arise from age, gender, disability, language skills, low social status, income etc. All students from under-represented groups have an equal right to access to education and the subsequent labour market that such education provides. The majority of students with disabilities are included in mainstream preschools, schools and universities. Depending on the type of disability (hearing impairments, visual impairments, psychological disorders, mobility difficulties etc.), students need more or less support. This paper will explore the model of support provided by assistants for students with disabilities at different levels of education. The model includes personal teaching assistants in preschools and schools and peer-teaching assistance at the university level. The quality of training for teaching assistants in preschools and schools was evaluated using a sample of 90 assistants participating in the 20-hour course. The initial motivation of assistants was estimated by an open-ended question survey. A content analysis of teaching assistant reports shows that motivation for this job is not only current unemployment, but also the gathering of social skills, job experience and enjoyment. The results were positive, with an emphasis on the high quality of the curriculum and the usefulness of lifelong learning. Interviews with peer assistants at the university emphasised the importance of training supported by information and communication technology. Students with disabilities also need access to the internet, high quality digital learning materials and different assistive technology. Quality of support provided by assistants also depends on their training and any aversion of inclusion students with disabilities within the mainstream education system. Inclusion is good way of preparation in terms of human capital management for the future labour market. Further research will be focused on measuring the usefulness and practical implementation of the results.","[Vidacek-Hains, Violeta; Kozina, Melita; Kirinic, Valentina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat Varazdin, Zagreb 41000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Vidacek-Hains, V (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Org & Informat Varazdin, Zagreb 41000, Croatia.",vvidacek@foi.hr; melita.kozina@foi.hr; valentina.kirinic@foi.hr,"Kozina, Melita/IQS-5334-2023",,,,,,29,1,1,1,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,126,135,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500011,0

In this article, we investigate whether the most recent global financial crisis (GFC) had any positive impact on the G7 (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) indices. To conduct the analysis we employ the mean-variance (MV) analysis, CAPM statistics, Hurst exponent, runs test, multiple variation ratio test and stochastic dominance (SD) tests. Our MV and CAPM results conclude that most of the G7 stock indices are significantly less volatile. The results from Hurst exponent, run tests and multiple variation ratio confirm that efficiency improved in the post-GFC period. Finally, our SD results conclude that there is no arbitrage opportunity and the markets are efficient due to the GFC, and, in general, investors prefer investing in the indices after the GFC. Overall, we conclude that the GFC led to markets that are more efficient and mature, confirming that crises can also have positive impacts on stock markets. These findings provide important information for investors and market regulators.","[Vieito, Joao Paulo] Polytech Inst Viana Castelo, Dept Econ & Finance, Sch Business Studies, Viana Do Castelo, Portugal; [Wong, Wing-Keung] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Zhen-Zhen] NE Normal Univ, Sch Math & Stat, Changchun, Jinlin Province, Peoples R China",Polytechnic Institute of Viana do Castelo; Hong Kong Baptist University; Northeast Normal University - China,"Wong, WK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",awong@hkbu.edu.hk,"Wong, Wing-Keung/AAI-9296-2020; Wong, Wing-Keung/JCN-7787-2023; Vieito, João Paulo/AAE-1207-2020","Wong, Wing-Keung/0000-0001-6755-572X; Vieito, João Paulo/0000-0002-0899-4930","Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG2/14-15/040, FRG2/14-15/106]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [12502814, 12500915]; Northeast Normal University",Hong Kong Baptist University; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); Northeast Normal University,"This research is partially supported by the Hong Kong Baptist University [FRG2/14-15/040], [FRG2/14-15/106]; Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (Project Numbers [12502814], [12500915]); Northeast Normal University.",,52,15,17,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To present the paradox, we expand the switching price elasticity theory developed by Greenhut-Hwang-Ohta to show that the after-tax profit may very well increase in a monopoly or a tight-knit cartel. The result is not an artifice or a mathematical oddity; it happens if demand curve is continuously and increasingly more convex. We show that after-tax profit can actually increase in a monopoly or monopoly-like market without resorting to conjectural variation or product quality often used in oligopoly. To verify the paradox, simple numerical examples and commonly-used mathematical demand functions are employed.","[Yang, Chin W.] Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Clarion, PA 16214 USA; [Cheng, Hui Wen; Chi, Ching Wen] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan; [Huang, Bwo-Nung] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan; [Huang, Bwo-Nung] Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Ctr IADF, Chiayi 621, Taiwan; [Huang, Bwo-Nung] Natl Chia Yi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Clarion University of Pennsylvania; Ming Chuan University; National Chung Cheng University; National Chung Cheng University; National Chiayi University,"Yang, CW (通讯作者)，Clarion Univ Pennsylvania, Clarion, PA 16214 USA.;Cheng, HW; Chi, CW (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei, Taiwan.;Huang, BN (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Dept Econ, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.;Huang, BN (通讯作者)，Natl Chung Cheng Univ, Ctr IADF, Chiayi 621, Taiwan.;Huang, BN (通讯作者)，Natl Chia Yi Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Chiayi, Taiwan.",Yang@clarion.edu; hwcheng@mail.mcu.edu.tw; wenchi@mail.mcu.edu.tw; ecdbnh@ccu.edu.tw,,,,,,,51,0,0,0,2,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2016,,216,,,,,,,,,,,,41,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DM2LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376177900002,0

We find that technology adoption can take place earlier when firms engage in input outsourcing than when they produce the input in-house. Hence, the presence of vertical relations can accelerate the adoption of a new technology. We also find that particular features of a vertically related market, such as the distribution of bargaining power and the contract type through which trading is conducted, can crucially affect the speed of technology adoption.

The MODWT (Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform) is applied to US quarterly GDP data to obtain the underlying cyclical structure of the GDP components. A MATLAB program is then used to design optimal fiscal policy within an LQ tracking model with wavelet decomposition, and the results are compared with an aggregate model with no frequency decomposition. The results show that fiscal policy is more active under the wavelet-based model, and that the consumption and investment trajectories under the aggregate model are misaligned. We also simulate FHEC (Frequency Harmonizing Emphasis Control) strategies that allow policymakers to concentrate the policy thrust on tracking frequencies that are optimally aligned with policy goals under different targeting priorities. These strategies are only available by using time frequency analysis. This research is the first to construct fiscal policy in an applied optimal control model based on the short and long cyclical lag structures obtained from wavelet analysis. Our wavelet-based optimal control procedure allows the policymaker to construct a pragmatic tracking policy, avoid suboptimal policies gleaned from an aggregate model, and reduce the potential for destabilization that might otherwise result due to improper thrust and timing.

First, a 10% increase in the international price of oil-generates an increase of about 0.1 annualized percentage points in EA consumer price inflation. Second, the same increase in the oil price generates a decrease in EA gross domestic product (GDP) of around 0.1% and a trade deficit, if it is due to negative oil supply or positive oil-specific demand shocks. Third, it generates a mild EA GDP increase and a trade surplus if due to a positive RW aggregate demand shock. Fourth, the increase in the oil price over the 2004-2008 period did not induce stagflationary effects on the EA economy because it was associated with positive RW aggregate demand shocks. The drop in RW aggregate demand contributes to explain the 2008 fall in oil prices, EA GDP and inflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the theoretical framework, we place Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple's (2004) outward FDI model into Bernard, Redding and Schott's (2007) framework of international trade with heterogeneous monopolistically competitive firms and comparative advantage and show that the increase in outward FDI raises aggregate productivity in all industries through the intra-sectoral reallocation of firms, but this productivity growth is more prominent in a nation's comparative advantage industry. Using Korean industry-level data, we empirically test our theoretical predictions using the production function model as a benchmark model, followed by system GMM estimation methods for sensitivity analysis. Our empirical findings also suggest that outward FDI has a positive effect on domestic productivity and this link is more likely to take place in those sectors above average competitiveness measured as export-based revealed comparative advantage.","[Hyun, Hea-Jung] Kyung Hee Univ, Coll Int Studies, Seoul, South Korea; [Jang, Yong Joon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Kyung Hee University,"Jang, YJ (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",hjhyun@khu.ac.kr; yjjang@khu.ac.kr,"Jang, Yong Joon/AAJ-8754-2020; Hyun, Hea-Jung/AAF-7952-2021","Jang, Yong Joon/0000-0001-5338-9804; Hyun, Hea-Jung/0000-0001-5132-445X",,,,,56,7,7,1,24,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

A time-varying transition probability, the Markov-switching vector autoregressive (MS-VAR) model, is utilized for this purpose. Wald and likelihood ratio tests are computed and used as model adequacy measures. In order to analyze the link between the variables, impulse-response functions are employed. A sticky price exchange rate model is used to show the fundamentally determined rate of return of currencies. States are defined as either overvalued or undervalued, depending on the position of the observed exchange rate compared to its fundamentally determined rate. The model is applied to four major currencies: the Australian Dollar, the Canadian Dollar, the Japanese Yen, and the British Pound. Transition between the states is linked to the risk-adjusted excess return (the Sharpe ratio) of the debt and equity markets of the respective currencies in order to understand whether over- and undervaluation is connected to the returns in these markets. The results provide evidence that the relationship between economic fundamentals and nominal exchange rates are subject to change depending on the over- or undervaluation of the currencies relative to their fundamentally determined rate of return. An extension of this result shows that the Sharpe ratios of debt and equity investments in the currencies influence the evolution of the transitional dynamics of the exchange rates' deviation from their fundamental values.

The large model space that typically arises can be effectively analyzed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

The model sheds light on how various sanctioning regimes induce conformity and by whom, and on phenomena such as societal polarization and unimodal concentration. In strict societies, individuals will tend to either fully conform to the social norm or totally ignore it, while individuals in liberal societies will tend to compromise between these two extremes. Furthermore, the degree of strictness determines whether those who nearly agree with the norm or those who strongly disagree with it will conform. The degree of liberalism similarly determines which individuals will compromise the most. A number of empirical predictions, and several methods of how to test them, are suggested.

In developing countries, a sustainable and inclusive process of development also requires the generation of high productivity activities and quality employment. By focusing on the Indian case, this paper shows that even if a developing country manages to reduce its balance-of-payments constraint, concentrated improvements in productivity and employment may remain at the industrial level. Furthermore, a reduction of the balance-of-payments constraint may be more the result of an improvement in the net exports of services than an improvement in the external competitiveness of merchandise exports. Such a services-led reduction of the balance-of-payments constraint may not address the problem of generating large-scale quality employment and making the growth process more inclusive.",,,"Nabar-Bhaduri, S (通讯作者)，Grinnell Coll, Econ, Grinnell, IA 50112 USA.",,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

J,"Oates, WE; Schwab, RM",,,,"Oates, Wallace E.; Schwab, Robert M.",,,The Window Tax: A Case Study in Excess Burden,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The window tax provides a dramatic and transparent historical example of the potential distorting effects of taxation. Imposed in England in 1696, the tax-a kind of predecessor of the modern property tax-was levied on dwellings with the tax liability based on the number of windows. The tax led to efforts to reduce tax bills through such measures as the boarding up of windows and the construction of houses with very few windows. In spite of the pernicious health and aesthetic effects and despite widespread protests, the tax persisted for over a century and a half: it was finally repealed in 1851. Our purpose in this paper is threefold. First, we provide a brief history of the tax with a discussion of its rationale, its role in the British fiscal system, and its economic and political ramifications. Second, we have assembled a dataset from microfilms of local tax records during this period that indicate the numbers of windows in individual dwellings. Drawing on these data, we are able to test some basic hypotheses concerning the effect of the tax on the number of windows and to calculate an admittedly rough measure of the excess burden associated with the window tax. Third, we have in mind a pedagogical objective. The concept of excess burden (or deadweight loss) is for economists part of the meat and potatoes of tax analysis. But to the laity the notion is actually rather arcane; public-finance economists often have some difficulty, for example, in explaining to taxpayers the welfare costs of tax-induced distortions in resource allocation. The window tax is a textbook example of how a tax can have serious adverse side effects on social welfare. In addition to its objectionable consequences for tax equity, the window tax resulted in obvious and costly misallocations of resources.","[Oates, Wallace E.; Schwab, Robert M.] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Oates, WE (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",oates@econ.umd.edu; schwab@econ.umd.edu,,,,,,,26,24,26,3,33,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Using comprehensive panel data, we furthermore shed light on the role of real income and working hours as mechanisms that may explain changes in drinking patterns pre to post the collapse. The unique panel data is from 2007 to 2009, incidentally before and after the crisis hit, and was collected as a postal survey by The Directorate of Health. We specifically explore four outcomes: Frequency of any alcohol consumption, frequency of binge drinking, binge drinking participation and alcohol dependence, using pooled OLS and linear probability models. We find that women tend to decrease their frequency of any alcohol consumption and frequency of binge drinking more than men between waves but men show a stronger negative response to the crisis in binge drinking participation and alcohol dependence. Changes in individual income explain most of men's reduction in drinking, but women's drinking responses are not operating through labor-market mechanisms to the same extent. Other factors in the demand function for alcohol that changed during the crisis seem to play a greater role, most notably the real price of alcohol, which increased considerably following the economic collapse.","[Olafsdottir, Thorhildur; Asgeirsdottir, Tinna Laufey] Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",University of Iceland,"Olafsdóttir, T (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",tho32@hi.is; ta@hi.is,"Ásgeirsdóttir, Tinna Laufey/ISA-3677-2023","Olafsdottir, Thorhildur/0000-0003-2003-9984",Edda Center of Excellence and Icelandic Research Fund [130611-051]; University of Iceland Research Fund,Edda Center of Excellence and Icelandic Research Fund; University of Iceland Research Fund,"Financial support from the University of Iceland Research Fund, Edda Center of Excellence and the Icelandic Research Fund (Grant Number 130611-051) is gratefully acknowledged.

To make the results for these markets directly comparable with those for other developed markets we incorporate four developed countries as well: Austria (also representing the geographic, but not the socio-economic CEE region), Germany, United Kingdom, and the USA. We find that the Central and Eastern European stock market indexes investigated have shown continuous development in terms of a weak form of market efficiency during the past two decades. The results of the runs tests show that the null hypothesis of randomness can be rejected typically prior to 2000; however, since then, the daily returns of the indexes follow a random walk process. We find that, in the case of the largest CEE stock exchange, the Warsaw Stock Exchange in Poland, this development was quicker. The results of the variance ratio analyses coincide with these findings: comparing the test results for 1991-2003 and 2004-2011, the non-unit variance ratios disappear or at least their significance levels decrease. It is an interesting fact that both runs tests and variance ratios indicate higher efficiency for the indexes calculated in USD instead of local currencies.","[Bota, Gabor; Ormos, Mihaly] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary",Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Bóta, G (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Dept Finance, Magyar Tudosok Krt 2, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",bota@finance.bme.hu; ormos@finance.bme.hu,"Bota, Gabor/GYU-0015-2022; Ormos, Mihály/E-1051-2011","Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636",,,,,27,4,4,0,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2015,42.0,4,,,,,685,708,,10.1007/s10663-014-9272-0,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CR6UV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361484200001,0

In a choice problem, an aspiration is the most desired alternative there (available or not). In our design, we endogenously derive both aspirations and a subjective similarity notion that operates between an aspiration and other alternatives. We find that (i) choice reversals are more likely when an unavailable aspiration alternative is added into the environment than when an unavailable non-aspiration alternative is added, (ii) an available option is more likely to be chosen when there is an unavailable aspiration that is similar to it compared to when there is no such option in the environment, (iii) choices are better explained by a similarity-based procedure when the subjective similarity notion that is derived in a separate part of the experiment is used rather than the Euclidean distance.

The model accurately predicts India's long-run growth transitions over the period 1953-2007, with the first phase (1980-2002) being technology' driven and the second phase (2003-2007) capital accumulation driven. Given the complementary nature between technological progress and capital accumulation, one of the main challenges facing Indian policy makers in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis is to maintain high saving/fixed investment rates. The analysis also provides a critique of the total factor productivity view' of India's growth performance.","Univ Porto, Ctr Econ & Finance, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Nell, KS (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Ctr Econ & Finance, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",knell@fep.up.pt,,"Nell, Kevin/0000-0001-9243-476X",,,,,71,4,4,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2015,66.0,4,,,,,565,605,,10.1111/meca.12082,0.0,,,41,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CS8YL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362375700001,0

If this were the case then we should expect that poor voters be indifferent as to which broker they deal with, since they could expect the same minimum price from any broker. On the contrary, evidence of long-term broker-client relationships suggests that clients do care about who their broker is. The formal model in this paper, in correspondence with evidence drawn from 120 interviews with brokers, illuminates the reason why clients care about who their brokers are. Brokers are uncertain about voters' reservation values. Due to this uncertainty, the more resources brokers obtain, the more they transfer to clients to assure their votes. Given this uncertainty over reservation values, voters benefit from brokers' abilities to access more resources. These dynamics account for party machines' frequent electoral hegemony.","[Rodrigo Zarazaga, S.

An alternative indicator is countrywide inflation, whose quality and real-time availability have improved substantially. Given these competing measures, two policy questions arise: What have been the implications for national inflation of targeting Lima's inflation? Would shifting to a national aggregate significantly affect the workings of monetary policy in Peru? To answer these questions, we estimate a large, but parsimonious, error correction model and investigate how regional shocks propagate across the country. The results indicate that a shock to Lima's inflation is transmitted fast and strongly elsewhere in the country, whereas the effects of shocks in other regions are limited and short-lived. This constitutes supporting evidence to the view that by targeting Lima's inflation, the BCRP has effectively, albeit indirectly, targeted national inflation.","[Winkelried, Diego] Univ Pacifico, Acad Dept Finance, Lima 11, Peru; [Gutierrez, Jose Enrique] Superintendency Banking Insurance & Private Pens, Econ Res Dept, Lima 27, Peru",Universidad del Pacifico Peru,"Winkelried, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pacifico, Acad Dept Finance, Ave Salaverry 2020, Lima 11, Peru.",winkelried_dm@up.edu.pe; jgutierreza@sbs.gob.pe,,"Winkelried, Diego/0000-0002-9388-2617",,,,,16,2,2,0,15,UNIV CEMA,BUENOS AIRES,"AV CORDOBA 374, BUENOS AIRES, C1054AAP, ARGENTINA",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

Separate estimates of a Heckman selection model for Austria and Switzerland based on comparable firm-level data and variable specification show for both countries that the OLI model is well-suited to explain not only the propensity to invest in R&D abroad but also the related choice between an equity-based and a non-equity governance mode. Moreover, the research reveals that foreign R&D activity is positively related to firm performance and that this relationship is stronger in the case of an equity-based mode of governance, however only in the Swiss case.

The results reveal a relatively successful adjustment to the increase in pension age. The age gap between take-up of normal and early retirement (old-age) pension has not widened and the increase in the statutory pension age has moved exit from employment proportionally towards a later age. At the same time, a marked increase in the take-up of incapacity pensions, accelerated during the economic recession, has significantly reduced the overall effect of pension age reform.","[Puur, Allan; Leppik, Lauri; Klesment, Martin] Tallinn Univ, Estonian Inst Populat Studies, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University,"Leppik, L (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ, Estonian Inst Populat Studies, EE-10120 Tallinn, Estonia.",leppik@tlu.ee,"Leppik, Lauri/JXN-9449-2024; Klesment, Martin/HHS-0394-2022","Klesment, Martin/0000-0001-6460-0839",Estonian Ministry of Education and Science [SF0130018s11]; Estonian Science Foundation [8904],"Estonian Ministry of Education and Science(Ministry of Education and Research, Estonia); Estonian Science Foundation",This article has benefited from support for research theme SF0130018s11 by the Estonian Ministry of Education and Science and the Estonian Science Foundation grant no. 8904.

We show that in the absence of fiscal policy considerations, taking part in a large monetary union is counterproductive for a small economy. Nevertheless, once the role of fiscal policy is properly incorporated, taking part in the monetary union becomes desirable from a social perspective. Following these results, we explore the prospects of engaging both economies in fiscal coordination and on how different schemes of policy synchronization can provide the grounds to make cooperation beneficial for the members of a monetary union. We find that when monetary and fiscal authorities cooperate and attempt to exploit externalities for their own benefit, a Pareto efficient outcome can be achieved if fiscal policy in the monetary union is coordinated by a central authority and such authority acts as a the Stackelberg leader vis-a-vis the central bank. Our analysis suggests that this regimeis superior to (i) a monetary union in which fiscal authorities conduct their policy in an independent or (ii) coordinated fashion, (iii) a regime where both authorities internalize the effects of their own externalities by allowing the central bank to act as Stackelberg leader and (iv) a regime in which the small open economy decides to stay out of the monetary union.","[Cabral, Rene; Garcia Diaz, Rocio] Tecnol Monterrey, EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Cabral, Rene; Garcia Diaz, Rocio] Tecnol Monterrey, Dept Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Tecnologico de Monterrey,"Cabral, R (通讯作者)，Tecnol Monterrey, EGADE Business Sch, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rcabral@itesm.mx,"Cabral, Rene/D-8131-2016",,,,,,30,7,7,0,10,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

This paper shows that when we focus on the most vulnerable workers, part-time females, the NMW appears to be associated with reductions in employment retention. These negative impacts were evident when the NMW was introduced and also when it was increased faster than average wages in the mid-2000s.

We incentive-compatibly elicit preferences over voluntary contribution mechanisms with and without reward and punishment options and then randomly assign subjects to play in one of the four institutions. We find that payoffs are significantly greater when punishment is allowed but that only a small minority of participants prefers such an environment. Somewhat surprisingly, preferences over institutions are generally independent of individual characteristics. Conversely, individual characteristics, including institutional preferences, are significantly predictive of behavior in the public goods game. For instance, risk-averse individuals preemptively punish more often. This suggests that when studying sanctions and rewards, it is important to consider individual attitudes toward risk and uncertaintyalthough they may not affect the original selection into institutions.","[Drouvelis, Michalis] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Jamison, Julian C.] Consumer Financial Protect Bur, Res Off, Washington, DC 20552 USA",University of Birmingham,"Drouvelis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, Edgbaston B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",m.drouvelis@bham.ac.uk; juli-son@gmail.com,"Drouvelis, Michalis/N-9153-2015","Drouvelis, Michalis/0000-0002-0157-5274",,,,,47,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

The harvest decisions are well below the individually optimal ones, suggesting significant non-pecuniary motivations. The participants display more pro-social behaviour than similar studies have shown, indicating that the forest specific framing influences participants' behaviour. We tested three different conservation treatments: command and control (CAC), payment for environmental services (PES) and community forest management (CFM). CFM is as efficient as CAC in increasing pro-social forest use, despite not directly affecting the pecuniary gain. PES - as designed here - is the least effective treatment, but the results might be parameter sensitive. Women use forests more intensively than men, but are also more responsive to the treatments. The behavioural validity of the experiment is supported by strong correlation between behaviour in the experiment and in stated real life, while treatment validity cannot be tested directly.

The agents in our model are uncertain about the conduct of fiscal policy and act as econometricians by estimating fiscal policy rules that might change over time. We find that assuming that agents are not instantaneously aware of the new fiscal policy regime in place leads to substantially more volatility in the short run and persistent differences in average outcomes. We highlight issues that can arise when a policymaker wants to announce a policy change. From a methodological perspective, we introduce a novel way to model learning in the face of discrete policy changes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The regime shift vividly demonstrates that voters, given the chance, turn against leaders they perceive to be corrupt, nepotistic, or needlessly divisive, even if they deliver handsome growth figures; there are limits to gaining political legitimacy in a multi-ethnic state simply by creating cleavages between majority and minority communities. For the first time, the minority communities in Sri Lanka appear to have felt themselves part of, and potentially an important influence on, the national political scene. It is, however, difficult at this stage to predict whether the regime change would usher in an era of ethnic harmony and robust economic growth. One hope is that war-weariness and discontent with the previous regime seem to have led to a greater willingness to accommodate diverse perspectives and demands within the political system.","[Athukorala, Prema-Chandra] Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Jayasuriya, Sisira] Monash Univ, Dept Econ, Caulfield, Vic 3168, Australia",Australian National University; Monash University,"Athukorala, PC (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",prema-chandra.athukorala@anu.edu.au; sisira.jayasuriya@monash.edu,,,,,,,57,12,12,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Using a general-equilibrium life-cycle consumption model calibrated to the U.S. economy, I show that these distortions can be large enough to erase much of the traditional welfare gains from Social Security. I also find that this fact is robust within the range of labor supply elasticities usually encountered in the macroeconomic literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a panel dataset of Spanish manufacturing firms for the period 1990-2006, we follow the innovative performance of R&D active firms and observe that innovation rates change over firms' R&D histories. To explain these facts we propose a model that explicitly acknowledges the twofold composition of firms' R&D expenditures, comprising spending on both physical capital for R&D projects and payments to researchers. We regard this latter component of R&D as a source for dynamic returns to firms' R&D investments. Consequently firms' innovation outcomes clearly depend on how long they have been investing in R&D and also on whether there have been any interruptions in the temporal sequence of R&D activities. Our results suggest that R&D activities exhibit dynamic returns that are positive but at a decreasing rate, and that interruptions in R&D engagement reduce R&D efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the second part of the article, I showcase the way the economist K.

Wiechert was Kapp's teacher in high school, the Hufgymnasium in Konigsberg, during the Weimar Republic. I investigate the unpublished and unexplored Kapp-Wiechert correspondence, as well as analyze some (published and unpublished) foreign language essays written by Kapp and his wife Lore Kapp. This analysis reveals how Kapp's economics drew lasting inspiration from Wiechert's art philosophy, pedagogy, novels, and poetry. This is a case study of a poetic economics that is open to experiential knowledge, which makes it more humane, edifying, serene, and sensitive to the natural and social environment.","[Berger, Sebastian] Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University of West England,"Berger, S (通讯作者)，Univ W England, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England.",,"Berger, Sebastian/I-7820-2018",,,,,,42,2,2,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

By extending the wage gap at the mean towards the entire wage distribution using quantile regression, it enables researchers to ascertain the direction and the proportions of differences in characteristics and returns to these characteristics at different parts of the wage distribution. This line of research has been prominent in western society but has not yet been explored in the context of the Malaysian labor market. To fill the gap, this paper examines the gender earnings gap in Malaysia between 1994 and 2004 using Malaysia Population and Family Survey data. The gender earnings differential, as measured by the log percentage point is 53% in 1994. The difference reduces to 45% for a restricted sample and 42% for the unrestricted sample in 2004. However, it was found that the gender wage gap reduces as we move up the wage distribution. This suggests that women suffer from a sticky floor effect, i.e., the gender wage gap is bigger at the bottom of distribution. More importantly, the observed gender wage differentials do not reflect differences in the productive characteristics of the workers. In fact, it accounts for very little, if any, of the gap in Malaysia. However, the extent of the price effect is larger at the bottom end of the distribution than at the top.","[Ching, Goy Siew] Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Social Sci, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia; [Johnes, Geraint] Univ Lancaster, Dept Econ, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",University of Malaysia Sarawak; Lancaster University,"Ching, GS (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sarawak, Fac Social Sci, Kota Samarahan 94300, Sarawak, Malaysia.",scgoy@fss.unimas.my; g.johnes@lancs.ac.uk,"Johnes, Geraint/G-3671-2013","Johnes, Geraint/0000-0002-8148-0629",,,,,41,3,3,0,8,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Overoptimistic individuals overestimate their own abilities or prospects. In contrast, overprecise individuals place overly narrow confidence intervals around forecasts, thereby underestimating uncertainty. These biases can lead consumers to misforecast their future product usage, or to overestimate their abilities to navigate contract terms. In consequence, consumer overconfidence causes consumers to systematically misweight different dimensions of product quality and price. Poor choices based on biased estimates of a product's expected costs or benefits are the result. For instance, overoptimism about self-control is a leading explanation for why individuals overpay for gym memberships that they underutilize. Similarly, overprecision is a leading explanation for why individuals systematically choose the wrong calling plans, racking up large overage charges for exceeding usage allowances in the process. Beyond these market effects of overconfidence, this paper addresses three additional questions: What will firms do to exploit consumer overconfidence? What are the equilibrium welfare consequences of consumer overconfidence for consumers, firms, and society? And what are the implications of consumer overconfidence for public policy?","[Grubb, Michael D.] Boston Coll, Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA",Boston College,"Grubb, MD (通讯作者)，Boston Coll, Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02167 USA.",michael.grubb@bc.edu,,"Grubb, Michael/0000-0001-9885-2225",,,,,69,67,72,2,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our results indicate that estimates for which the 95% confidence interval includes zero are less likely to be reported than estimates excluding negative values of the SCC, which might create an upward bias in the literature. The evidence for selective reporting is stronger for studies published in peer-reviewed journals than for unpublished papers.

A modified present-value analysis,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price-rent ratio; Unobserved component model; Present-value model,STOCK; FUNDAMENTALS,"We consider which factors determined the price-rent ratio for the housing market in 18 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) and at the national level over the period of 1975-2014. Based on a present-value framework, our proposed empirical model separates the price-rent ratio for a given market into unobserved components related to the expected real rent growth and the expected housing return, but is modified from standard present-value analysis by also including a residual component that captures non-stationary deviations of the price-rent ratio from its present-value level. Estimates for the modified present-value model suggest that the present-value residual (PVR) component is always important and sometimes very large at the national and MSA levels, especially for MSAs that have experienced frequent booms and busts in the housing market. In further analysis, we find that house prices in MSAs that have larger PVR components are more sensitive to mortgage rate changes. These are also the MSAs with less elastic housing supply. Also, comparing our results with a recent statistical test for periodically-collapsing bubbles, we find that MSAs with large estimated PVR components are the same MSAs that test positively for explosive sub-periods in their price-rent ratios, especially during the 2005-2007 subsample. Our approach allows us to estimate the correlation between shocks to expected rent growth, the expected housing return, and the PVR component. We find that the expected housing return and movements in the PVR component are highly positively correlated implying an impact of the expected housing return on house prices that is amplified from what a standard present-value model would imply. Our results also show that most of the variation in the present-value component of the price-rent ratio arises due to the variation in the expected housing return. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We measure individual stocks' misvaluation based on their pricing deviation from fundamental values, following Rhodes-Kropf et al. (2005. J. Finan. Econ. 77 (3), 561) and Chang et al. (2013. J. Bank Finance, forthcoming), and find that the measure has strong and robust return predictive power in the Chinese market. We further form a misvaluation factor and find that misvaluation comovement and systematic misvaluation exist in the Chinese market. A comparison of our results with those of Chang et al. (2013. J. Bank. Finance, forthcoming) reveals that the misvaluation effect is much stronger in the Chinese market than in the U.S market This evidence is consistent with the notion that the Chinese market is much less efficient than the U.S. market Finally, we show that the return predictive power of misvaluation has weakened since China launched its split-share structure reform in 2005, which could result from the fact that the reform helps to promote market efficiency.

Fixed broadband is nearly ubiquitous and most people have access to four or more mobile broadband providers. Growth in fixed broadband usage is leveling off, while mobile broadband usage growth remains robust. Blacks and Hispanics generally have fewer fixed broadband options but more mobile broadband providers available. Gaps in broadband usage overall (fixed and mobile combined) for minorities persist and are quite large. Matching estimators show that lagging broadband adoption among minority groups is not fully accounted for by demographic and economic characteristics. Mobile broadband holds particular promise for minorities regarding healthcare and e-health, and these communities have relatively greater reliance on mobile forms of broadband. Two important findings are that 1) blacks are more likely to access the Internet using a mobile phone than whites (after controlling for demographic differences between the groups), and 2) there is no significant gap in mobile broadband usage between minorities and whites by either of the two measures of usage considered. Implications of the findings for policy toward spectrum allocation and wireless taxes are discussed.","Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Malibu, CA 90263 USA",Pepperdine University,"Prieger, JE (通讯作者)，Pepperdine Univ, Sch Publ Policy, 24255 Pacific Coast Highway, Malibu, CA 90263 USA.",jprieger@pepperdine.edu,"Prieger, James E./AAJ-2620-2020","Prieger, James E./0000-0002-5521-5557",,,,,54,28,35,0,45,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

Prompted by these revivals, the present study re-examines an inter-war conviction that the Depression had its origins in uneven technological progress and monopolistic competition. Effectively reversing the induced roundaboutness view of the Austrian thesis, these writings noted a conflict between the resulting need for monetary accommodation and its potentially destabilising distributional consequences. A common framework permits the extent of similarity in inter-war and contemporary American experience to be assessed, with the comparison drawing attention to the 1990s' NASDAQ boom and the subsequent financial behaviour of the US corporate sector. Consistently with the earlier literature but contrary to recent conclusions, financial sector excess is seen as an aggravating factor, rather than an initiating cause of the recession.","[Snowden, Nicholas] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",Lancaster University,"Snowden, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England.",n.snowden@lancaster.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,1,1,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In multi-scale analysis, bivariate empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) is employed to decompose the two series of market returns at different time-scales. In causality testing, a linear and nonlinear integrated Granger test is formulated to investigate the relationship among each pair of matched components on a similar time-scale. With the European Union emission allowance (EUA) futures and Brent futures as study samples, some interesting findings can be obtained. (1) At the original data level (without multi-scale decomposition), this study finds evidence supporting a neutrality hypothesis, i.e., no Granger causality between the carbon and crude oil markets. (2) On small time-scale (within one week excluding non-work days), the two markets might be uncorrelated and driven by their own respective supply-demand disequilibriums. (3) For medium time-scale (above one week but below one year), there is a strong bi-directional linear and nonlinear spillover effect between the two markets, due to certain extra factors with medium-term effects, e.g., significant events and policy changes. (4) For long time-scale, the long-term trends of the two markets appear an obvious linear relationship. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Improved cooking stove (ICS) technologies appear to be an obvious solution in many cases. Indeed we find that users of a very simple ICS in urban Burkina Faso need between 20 and 30 percent less firewood compared to traditional stoves, making the investment highly profitable. In spite of these high returns and great efforts made by the international community to disseminate ICSs, take-up rates are similar to many other high-return innovations strikingly low; in our case a mere 10 percent. When exploring adoption decisions of households, we find suggestive evidence that a major deterrent to adoption is the upfront investment costs. They seem to be much more important than access to information, taste preferences, or the woman's role in the household. These findings suggest that perhaps more direct promotion strategies such as subsidies would help households to overcome liquidity constraints, and would hence improve adoption rates.

A priori, it is indeterminate whether migration and remittances strengthen or weaken the degree of private transfers in these communities. From a policy perspective, public income redistribution programs would have an important role to play if migration reduced the extent of private transfers. Using household survey data from rural Kyrgyzstan, we find that household with migrant members (as well as households receiving remittances) are more likely than households without migrants (without remittances) to provide monetary transfers to others and to receive non-monetary (i.e. unpaid labor) transfers from others. This suggests that migrant households, through their access to remittance income, insure their social networks against shocks or redistribute income to poorer households in the community and receive labor transfers in return. This implies that migration is unlikely to lead to a weakening of private transfers.

Under this view, changes in productivity cause changes in expectations. I investigate an alternative interpretation whereby changes in expectations cause changes in productivity. I present a model where firms adopt the technology of a deterministic frontier, and where self-fulfilling expectational-shocks unleash a frenzy of adoption through which firms increase productivity. Consistent with the news evidence, stock prices and aggregate activity boom, yet TFP increases with a lag. Simulations using i. i.d. expectational-shocks yield moments consistent with the data, and qualitatively capture both high-frequency boom-busts and lower-frequency fluctuations. Finally, estimating a Beaudry-Portier style VECM on the simulated model output to identify a news shock recovers impulse response functions largely consistent with the Beaudry and Portier (2006) results.

In our model, only the lowest-cost firms participate in the global economy exactly along the lines of Melitz (). In addition to differing in their productivity, firms differ in their skill intensity. We model skill-biased technology as a correlation between skill intensity and technological acumen, and we estimate this correlation to be large using firm-level data from Chile in 1995. A fall in trade costs leads to both greater trade volumes and an increase in the relative demand for skill, as the lowest-cost/most-skilled firms expand to serve the export market while less skill-intensive non-exporters retrench in the face of increased import competition. This mechanism works regardless of factor endowment differences, so we provide an explanation for why globalization and wage inequality move together in both skill-abundant and skill-scarce countries. In our model countries are net exporters of the services of their abundant factor, but there are no Stolper-Samuelson effects because import competition affects all domestic firms equally.","[Harrigan, James; Reshef, Ariell] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Harrigan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",james.harrigan@virginia.edu,,,Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia,Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia,"We thank the Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia for support.

The switching cost is 0.8% of the deposit's value, which leads the static model to bias the demand estimates. The dynamic model shows that the price elasticity over a long time horizon is larger than the same elasticity over a short time horizon. Counterfactual experiments with a dynamic monopoly show that reducing the switching cost has a comparable competitive effect on bank pricing as a result of reducing the dominant position of the monopoly.","[Ho, Chun-Yu] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Ho, CY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Econ, Shanghai 200052, Peoples R China.",chunyu.ho@sjtu.edu.cn,,"Ho, Chun-Yu/0000-0002-4498-9610",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71301103],National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"I thank Kenneth Wolpin (the editor) and the two anonymous referees for their detailed comments and suggestions, which substantially improve the article.

We document that users click ads in a nonsequential order and that the clickthrough rates depend on the identity of competing ads. We estimate a dynamic model of utility-maximizing users that rationalizes these two facts and find that 51 percent more clicks would occur if ads faced no competition. We demonstrate that optimal matching of advertisements to positions raises welfare by 27 percent, and that individual-level targeting raises welfare by 69 percent. Revealing the quality of the advertiser prior to clicking on a sponsored link raises welfare by 1.6 percent.","[Jeziorski, Przemyslaw] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Segal, Ilya] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Stanford University,"Jeziorski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, 2200 Piedmont Ave, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",przemekj@haas.berkeley.edu; ilya.segal@stanford.edu,,,Toulouse Network for Information Technology,Toulouse Network for Information Technology,The authors are grateful to Microsoft Corp. for providing the data and computing facilities and hosting them during the summer of 2008.

In such auctions, precautionary bidding predicts that under expected utility, DARA bidders reduce their bids by more than the appropriate risk premium. Because the degree of riskiness of an auctioned good and bidders' levels of risk aversion are difficult to observe in field settings, we conduct experimental auctions that allow us to identify the precautionary premium directly. We find strong evidence for precautionary bidding. The effect is robust to changes in experimental design features.

Even if the mean of the ex ante distribution of consumer values is the same as that ex post, the shape of the distributions may differ, generating a difference between the surplus each product can extract. If, for example, consumers differ only in ex ante disease risk, then a monopolist would have more difficulty extracting surplus with a preventive than with a treatment because treatment consumers, having contracted the disease, no longer differ in disease risk. We show that the ratio of preventive to treatment producer surplus can be arbitrarily small, in particular when the distribution of consumer values has a Zipf shape and the disease is rare. The firm's bias toward treatments can be reversed, for example, if the source of private information is disease severity learned ex post. The difference between the producer surplus earned from the products can result in distorted R&D incentives; the deadweight loss from this distortion can be as large as the entire producer-surplus difference. Calibrations for HIV and heart attacks based on risk factors in the U.S. population suggest that the distribution of disease risk is sufficiently Zipf-similar to generate substantial differences between producer surplus from preventives and treatments. Empirically, we find that proxies for the Zipf-similarity of the disease-risk distribution are associated a significantly lower likelihood of vaccine development but not drug development.","[Kremer, Michael; Snyder, Christopher M.] Harvard Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Brookings Inst, Ctr Global Dev,Dartmouth Coll, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brookings Institution; Dartmouth College; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kremer, M (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Natl Bur Econ Res, Brookings Inst, Ctr Global Dev,Dartmouth Coll, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,72,22,23,1,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

However, a certain conceptual inflexibility arises when the distinction is applied to complex social situations. This article examines the main approaches to inclusion/exclusion in the sociological tradition, systems theory and the theory of new inequalities. On this basis, five interrelated situations of inclusion and exclusion are constructed: self-inclusion/self-exclusion, inclusion by risk/exclusion by danger, compensatory inclusion, inclusion in exclusion and sub-inclusion. They are illustrated with specific examples to refine an analytical approach to problems of inclusion and exclusion, with a view to contributing to sociological analysis and to assessing the consequences of public and private decisions.","[Mascareno, Aldo; Carvajal, Fabiola] Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile",Universidad Adolfo Ibanez,"Mascareño, A (通讯作者)，Adolfo Ibanez Univ, Sch Govt, Santiago, Chile.",aldo.mascareno@uai.cl; fabi.casep@hotmail.com,,"Mascareno, Aldo/0000-0002-5803-863X","project Redes [130008]; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) [1140344, 1110437]; Nucleo Milenio Modelos de Crisis, ICM-Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio [NS130017]","project Redes; National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT)(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Nucleo Milenio Modelos de Crisis, ICM-Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio","This article forms part of the research activities of projects Redes 130008, National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development (FONDECYT) 1140344, 1110437, and Nucleo Milenio Modelos de Crisis (NS130017), ICM-Iniciativa Cientifica Milenio.",,61,8,10,1,9,COMISION ECONOMICA PARA AMERICA LATINA Y EL CARIBE,SANTIAGO,"CASILLA 179-D, SANTIAGO, 00000, CHILE",0251-2920,1684-0348,,CEPAL REV,Cepal Rev.,AUG,2015,,116,,,,,127,141,,,,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY1FT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366152800007,0

When transport costs are low, unilateral dumping by the foreign firm arises; otherwise, reciprocal dumping occurs.

We focus on determining whether exchange rate arrangements and capital regulations influence capital inflows and housing prices. Our results show that an arrangement to restrain the fluctuation of the exchange rate and capital controls has the potential to raise housing prices in Asia. The strong prospect of the Chinese yuan's appreciation also pushed up housing prices in China. Another expected reason for the increase in capital inflows into Asian markets is the expansion of global liquidity. Such capital flows often have a sensitive reaction to market sentiment, and an increase in asset market volatility caused by the liquidity squeeze decreases Asian housing prices. These results suggest the need to review capital controls and future exchange rate system options for Asian countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We find that if taxpayers' incomes are correlated (e.g., when they are subject to a common shock) the optimal audit probability for low declarations is an increasing function of the average declaration, as the latter is an informative signal of the realized level of income. Since a taxpayer's optimal declaration is an increasing function of the probability of an audit, the optimal auditing rule creates incentives for taxpayers to coordinate their declarations. The resulting coordination game features multiplicity of equilibria and thus strategic uncertainty about the equilibrium that will be selected. When we add a source of fundamental uncertainty (about the type of agency taxpayers face), the situation can be realistically modeled as a global game.

Of these three types of earnings comparisons, the group upward comparison is the most malleable to societal characteristics. Past studies on earnings fairness cannot explain workers' strong feelings of injustice in the most recent recession, in which the unemployment rate has been high, but the strong feelings of injustice can be explained by the group upward comparison in this study.

Furthermore, results of decomposing the marginal effects into conditional and unconditional elasticities indicate that it is not the case that schools with predominantly white student bodies have the least severe punishments and schools with more minority students have the most severe punishments.

This essay examines how Taiwan achieved latecomer upgrading, by exploring the process by which its latecomer firms entered high-tech and modern services. It is found that the latecomer firms, called second movers here, entered high tech when the product just turned mature, and relied upon a different set of capabilities from those of the first movers in the advanced countries. The findings challenge prevalent orthodoxy, which includes open markets, increased foreign investment, small firms, and diminished state intervention. In reality, large domestically owned second movers rather than foreign enterprises or small networked firms have led Taiwan's entry into mature high tech. In the meantime, the government intervention has not been lessened, but has been adapting to the changing environment, in promoting high-tech industry and modern services.","Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei 115, Taiwan",Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chu, WW (通讯作者)，Acad Sinica, RCHSS, Taipei 115, Taiwan.",wwchu@sinica.edu.tw,,,,,,,16,7,7,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

It is shown that while productivity and demand shocks do not induce any changes in productive relations and linkage effects, shocks in the productivity of R&D increase both backward and forward linkages. Key sectors are characterized as having high forward and backward linkages, which are consistent with the definition of key sectors in the existing empirical studies. However, vertical specialization generates not only sectors with high backward and low forward linkages, but also sectors with low backward and high forward linkages. As a consequence of this vertical specialization, the latter sectors become key sectors, in the sense that they have significant effects on business fluctuations. This implies that general-purpose technology sectors emerge, and sector-specific policies for these sectors play a critical role in economic development and growth.","Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan",Kobe University,"Harada, T (通讯作者)，Kobe Univ, Grad Sch Business Adm, Kobe, Hyogo 657, Japan.",harada@people.kobe-u.ac.jp,,,"Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26380506] Funding Source: KAKEN","Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This paper was financially supported by Graduate School of Business Administration, Kobe University.",,28,14,14,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

These data show significant price uniformity, especially within the same geographical area of the town. Approximately one-third of gas stations responded within a day to targeted competitors' price changes, indicating some evidence of price matching behavior in the industry. Additionally, there is some, but discontinuous, geographical price propagation, testifying to the presence of a weak domino effect.

Findings support that either certified or uncertified voluntary abatement can be sustained in the long run as a result of market incentives, but not simultaneously. When certified abatement takes place in the long-run, it results in an improvement in the state of the natural capital as compared to situations where abatement is not certified. However, certification practices that are not attractive enough for companies to subsist in equilibrium can generate transitional dynamics eroding conservation outcomes. Moreover, given the endogenous nature of environmental conservation on firms' abatement decisions, temporary policies increasing the state of the environment can change the long-term incentive structure of the system favoring certification of abatement. A context of applicability of the model is illustrated by tourism uses of natural resources.","[Blanco, Esther] Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Blanco, Esther] Indiana Univ, Vincent & Elinor Ostrom Workshop Polit Theory & P, Bloomington, IN 47408 USA; [Lozano, Javier] Univ Balearic Isl, Dept Appl Econ, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain",University of Innsbruck; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Universitat de les Illes Balears,"Blanco, E (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Dept Publ Finance, Univ Str 15-4, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",esther.blanco@uibk.ac.at; javier.lozano@uib.es,"Blanco, Esther/K-9124-2014; Lozano, Javier/K-8970-2017","Blanco, Esther/0000-0002-4887-5717;",University of Innsbruck,University of Innsbruck,"We received helpful comments from John Maxwell, Carmen Arguedas, participants in the Fourth World Congress of Environmental and Resource Economists.

Areas with a 1% higher number of composer births nowadays show an up to 0.29% higher supply of classical concerts and 0.16% more opera performances. Classical concerts and opera performances have also rather bigger audiences and obtain greater revenues in provinces that have been culturally active in the past. Today, those provinces also exhibit a somewhat lower supply of other forms of entertainment (e.g., sport events), thereby implying a tantalizing divergence in societies' cultural preferences that is attributable to events rooted in the past.

In addition, we clarify the relationship between different approaches to measuring the level of spending diversity. A number of indices are employed, including measures based on joint probabilities, distances and the concept of entropy.

First, we find evidence of a long-run cointegration relationship between oil spot and futures prices. Moreover, the short-run causality is more significant in shorter maturity pairs versus longer maturity pairs in the vector error correction framework. Second, the results from wavelet coherency analysis show significant dynamic correlations between variables in the time-frequency domain. Third, the illustration of the phase-difference series around zero suggests that spot and futures prices contribute to the dynamics of the long-run equilibrium. Fourth and finally, we provide reasons for the structural changes in oil prices and also recommend investment strategies corresponding to risk diversification.

Recent empirical studies emphasize that the multiplier is endogenous to the level of economic activity, increasing during recessions and declining in expansions. Here, we propose a plausible explanation for this established fact based on the procyclicality of capitalists' propensity to save. Then, using a standard Kaleckian model of growth and distribution, we perform some simple simulations showing that fiscal multipliers increase during turbulent times.

Correspondingly, bank regulations including Basel III intend to create a strong financial sector. However, the higher capital requirements may also worsen the access to finance especially during the transition period. Using data on firm-bank relationships in Germany between 2005 and 2007, we show that the debt ratio of banks is related to the bank loan risk. In order to assess the potential effect of tighter capital requirements due to regulatory changes, we analyze industry specific responses of loan conditions to bank debt levels. Our findings imply that manufacturing, and to a lesser extent wholesale and retail trade, will potentially face a more restricted access to bank loans after the tightening of capital requirements.","[Fidrmuc, Jarko; Siddiqui, Martin] Zeppelin Univ Friedrichshafen, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Fidrmuc, Jarko] Inst East & Southeast European Studies IOS, D-93047 Regensburg, Germany; [Fidrmuc, Jarko] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO Vienna, Vienna, Austria; [Fidrmuc, Jarko] Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic; [Schreiber, Philipp] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany",Zeppelin University; Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; Charles University Prague; University of Mannheim,"Fidrmuc, J (通讯作者)，Zeppelin Univ Friedrichshafen, Seemoser Horn 20, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany.",jarko.fidrmuc@zu.de; phschrei@mail.uni-mannheim.de; martin.siddiqui@zu.de,,"Fidrmuc, Jarko/0000-0003-2662-1991",,,,,40,3,3,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

To explain these correlations, I then develop an intergenerational life-cycle model of human capital accumulation and earnings that features progressive taxation, public education expenditure, and borrowing constraints among the determinants of earnings persistence. I calibrate the model to U.S. data and use it to decompose the contributions to earnings persistence from different model elements and to quantify how earnings persistence in the United States changes as I introduce tax and education expenditure policies from other countries. I find that individual investments in human capital account for 73% of the estimated intergenerational earnings persistence in the United States. Taxation, through its impact on investments in human capital, can explain 50% of the variation between the United States and 10 other countries, whereas borrowing constraints, which have received much attention in the literature, have a limited impact on earnings persistence.","Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Holter, HA (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",hans.holter@econ.uio.no,,"Holter, Hans/0000-0003-1592-2406","Handelsbanken Research Foundations, Browaldhstipend; Research Council of Norway [191884/V10, 219616]; Oslo Fiscal Studies Program","Handelsbanken Research Foundations, Browaldhstipend; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway); Oslo Fiscal Studies Program","I thank Jose-Victor Rios-Rull, two anonymous referees, Dirk Krueger, Iourii Manovskii, Petra Todd, Alexander Bick, Se Kyu Choi, Andrew Clausen, Flavio Cunha, Jesus Fernandez-Villaverde, Nils Gottfries, Jeremy Greenwood, John Knowles, Kei Muraki, Serdar Ozkan, Laurent Simula, Panos Stavrinides, Serhiy Stepanchuk, and Bo Zhao for many helpful discussions and suggestions.

Many environmental policies de facto require firms to eco-innovate to comply with policy requirements, while the overlap between policy-driven and market-driven eco-innovation strategies is increasingly important for many firms. Barriers to eco-innovation can then emerge as a critical factor in either preventing or stimulating EU strategies, policy implementation, and the green strategies of firms. In this paper we focus on EU-27 SMEs. We single out and explore different firm profiles, considering eco-innovation barriers and engagement. Our analysis is based on a particularly suitable dataset: the Eurobarometer survey on Attitudes of European entrepreneurs towards eco-innovation. We identify six clusters of SMEs. These clusters include firms facing either 'Revealed barriers' or 'Deterring barriers', 'Cost deterred' firms, 'Market deterred' firms, 'Non eco-innovators', and 'Green champions'. The clusters display substantial differences in terms of eco-innovation adoption. We show that our taxonomy has little overlap with sector classifications. This diversity should be taken into account for successful environmental and innovation policies.","[Marin, Giovanni; Zoboli, Roberto] Natl Res Council Italy, IRCrES CNR Res Inst Sustainable Econ Growth, Milan, Italy; [Marin, Giovanni] OFCE SciencesPo, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Marzucchi, Alberto; Zoboli, Roberto] Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Int Econ Inst & Dev, Milan, Italy",Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Ricerca sulla Crescita Economica Sostenibile (IRCRES-CNR); Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Marzucchi, A (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Milan, Dept Int Econ Inst & Dev, Milan, Italy.",giovanni.marin@ircres.cnr.it; alberto.marzucchi@unicatt.it; roberto.zoboli@unicatt.it,"Kadi, Alaa J./C-5045-2017; Zoboli, Roberto/F-5974-2015; Marin, Giovanni/A-1917-2014","Zoboli, Roberto/0000-0003-4662-5949; Marin, Giovanni/0000-0002-7396-1561; Marzucchi, Alberto/0000-0002-4161-8734",PRIN-MIUR [2010S2LHSE]; 7th Framework Progamme project EMInInn [283002],"PRIN-MIUR(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); 7th Framework Progamme project EMInInn","We are grateful to the participants of the EU-SPRI Conference (University of Manchester, June 2014) and the 2014 Conference of the Italian Association of Environmental and Resource Economists (University of Milan, February 2014) for providing feedback on preliminary versions of the manuscript.

A common feature of energy prices is that conditional mean and volatility are driven by seasonal trends due to weather, demand, and storage level seasonalities. This paper follows and extends the Ederington and Salas (2008) framework and considers seasonalities in mean and volatility when minimum variance hedge ratios are computed. Our results show that hedging effectiveness is much higher when the seasonal pattern in spot price changes is approximated with lagged values of the basis (futures price minus spot price). This fact remains true for short (a week) and long (one, three and six months) hedging periods. Furthermore, volatility of weekly price changes also has a seasonal pattern and is higher in winter than in summer. A simple volatility seasonal model that is based on sinusoidal functions on the basis improves the risk reduction obtained by strategies in which hedging ratios are estimated with linear regressions. Seasonal hedging strategies, linear regression based strategies, or even a naive position, perform better than more sophisticated statistical methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The connection between the two could be particularly relevant for an emerging economy like China because the supply of financial services provided by banks may act as a constraining factor. Foreign bank presence may then enable and foster FDI and not simply result from it. Our estimates demonstrate that FDI across regions in China is increasing in the existing network of regional branches of foreign banks, which itself is driven (and, therefore, instrumented) by the timing of the regional phasing out of the local limits for foreign banks on local currency business. The effect of foreign bank presence on FDI is particularly strong for some specific sectors (farming, manufacturing, construction, transportation, wholesale/retail trade and real estate) if those sectors are strongly represented in the source economies.","[Ongena, Steven] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland; [Qi, Shusen] Maastricht Univ, Dept Finance, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Qin, Fengming] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Dept Finance, Jinan 250100, Peoples R China",University of Zurich; Maastricht University; Shandong University,"Ongena, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland.",steven.ongena@bf.uzh.ch; qsststs@gmail.com; fmqin@sdu.edu.cn,,"Ongena, Steven/0000-0002-8381-0062",,,,,38,3,3,2,27,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2015,23.0,4,,,,,40,59,,10.1111/cwe.12120,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN3MG,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358330100003,0

However, in contrast to the assumptions of trade partners, this paper finds that the Chinese economy has not benefited from the lower exchange rate of the RMB, and no direct linkages exist between the RER and growth in the long run. Interestingly, it appears that the Chinese economy is stimulated by the expansion of exports and inflow of foreign capital according to the empirical evidence, which also suggests that the long run equilibrium RER is jointly determined by the foreign trade, foreign reserves and the foreign direct investment In addition, the 2005 RMB policy reform did not show any significant impact on the RER, but instead contributed to the steady economic growth. It is clear that after the 2008 world crisis, the RMB exchange rates were largely dependent on the enhancing of the national strength and inflow of foreign capital, rather than the slow increase in foreign trade. As for policy implications, China may insist on the managed floating exchange rate policy making limited adjustments to the currency's daily floating range in response to the pressures from trade partners.

In the model, firms differ in their ability to monitor workers who have an incentive to shirk. As high quality output requires high worker effort, it is firms with better monitoring ability that upgrade their quality. Indeed, these firms upgrade their quality to such a degree that they also end up paying higher wages to induce even more worker effort. Trade liberalization can induce greater or smaller wage inequality but always enlarges the welfare inequality as higher wages go hand in hand with even greater effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

There is no evidence of a Kuznets curve with respect to non-agricultural employment. There is some evidence in terms of urbanization, though this is not robust. There is robust evidence on the role of national governments and education in shaping the path of inequality in the region. Government involvement reduces inequality.

We find that the sign-up rate drops by two-thirds if we do not mention monetary rewards. Appealing to subjects' willingness to help research has no effect on sign-up. We then invite the so-recruited subjects to the laboratory to measure their pro-social and approval motivations using incentivized experiments.

We find no evidence of racial discrimination, either in initial hiring or through the season, in a context where employers are fully aware of current and prospective workers' productivity.

In each period, the official chooses how much rent to appropriate from a social endowment. Announcement of this choice is followed by an election between the official and a randomly selected challenger, with the winner becoming the official in the next period. We vary two features of the setting: (a) the discount factor, and (b) whether candidates can make costless, non-binding campaign promises about their behaviour if elected. Consistent with the model's predictions, both raising the discount factor and introducing campaign promises lead to lower rent appropriation by officials and worse electoral outcomes (other things equal) for incumbents. Campaign promises, despite being cheap talk, have real effects: promising less appropriation is rewarded by voters, but breaking such promises is punished. Finally, we find a weak positive association between campaign promises and officials' subsequent behaviour. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis uses a nonlinear New Keynesian model with technology and discount factor shocks. Specifically, we investigate why technology shocks may have unconventional effects at the ZLB, what factors affect the likelihood of hitting the ZLB, and the implications of alternative monetary policy rules. We initially focus on a New Keynesian model without capital (Model 1) and then study that model with capital (Model 2). The advantage of including capital is that it introduces another mechanism for intertemporal substitution that strengthens the expectational effects of the ZLB. Four main findings emerge: (1) In Model 1, the choice of output target in the Taylor rule may reverse the effects of technology shocks when the ZLB binds; (2) When the central bank targets steady-state output in Model 2, a positive technology shock at the ZLB leads to more pronounced unconventional dynamics than in Model 1; (3) The presence of capital changes the qualitative effects of demand shocks and alters the impact of a monetary policy rule that emphasizes output stability; and (4) In Model 1, the constrained linear solution is a decent approximation of the nonlinear solution, but meaningful differences exist between the solutions in Model 2.

Using monthly data from December 1997 to December 2011, the empirical results derived from the CCF approach of Cheung and Ng [Journal of Econometrics 72 (1996) 33-48] suggest that there is causality-in-variance from exchange rate returns to central bank intervention, but not vice versa. These findings are robust in the sense that they hold in cases where the returns were measured from either the spot rate or the forward rate. Therefore, we conclude that the Indian central bank has intervened in the foreign exchange market to respond to exchange rate volatility, although the volatility has not been influenced by central bank intervention in the form of net purchases of foreign currency in the market.","Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, Seto, Aichi 4890863, Japan",,"Inoue, T (通讯作者)，Nanzan Univ, Fac Policy Studies, 27 Seirei Cho, Seto, Aichi 4890863, Japan.",tinoue@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [24530339]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530339] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",The author would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their many helpful comments and suggestions.

In this model, there are two types of jobs that differ in output per hour, and workers are also heterogeneous with respect to preferences for the working hours. This heterogeneity may generate mismatch between worker's preference and job's type. Because worker's preference is changed by exogenous shocks, workers can eliminate mismatch by two ways: (i) moving to a suitable job by a job-to-job transition and (ii) waiting to change their preference. Those ways are consistent with empirical findings (e.g., Euwal, 2001; Johnson, 2010; Reynolds and Aletraris, 2006). The model shows that job-to-job transitions are less frequent than its efficient level, and hiring subsidies can lead to socially efficient allocation of workers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"van Ours, JC",,,,"van Ours, Jan C.",,,The Great Recession was not so great,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Great Recession; Unemployment; Employment,OKUNS LAW; UNEMPLOYMENT; OECD,The Great Recession is characterized by a GDP decline that was unprecedented in the past decades. This paper discusses the implications of the Great Recession analyzing labor market data from 20 OECD countries. Comparing the Great Recession with the 1980s recession it is concluded that there is a high cross-country correlation of the unemployment rates over the two recessions indicating that some labor markets are more vulnerable to fluctuations in economic growth than others. Young workers are the most affected by the Great Recession both in terms of unemployment rates as well as employment rates. For prime age workers employment rates were also affected but for older workers the Great Recession did not have a large impact. To analyze how economic growth and labor market institutions have affected unemployment two types of models are estimated. The main conclusion is rather straightforward and has a one size fits all character: to reduce unemployment and create jobs economic growth is needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Both price series are tested for unit roots using the Harris (2009) procedure to endogenously identify structural breaks related to deregulation associated with FERC Order No. 636. The endogenously determined structural breaks are then used in the Saikkonen and Ilitkepohl (2000a, 2000b, 2000c) maximum likelihood approach to test cointegration of the series. Tests show cointegration of the two price series for all 50 states. Estimates of the long-run relationship in the pre- and post-structural break periods result in mixed evidence about the degree of perfect market integration induced by deregulation, although the magnitude and variation of parameters indicate increased integration. A vector error correction model is used to infer causality in the short and long-run dynamics for the pre and post-structural break periods for each state. The post-break period exhibits bidirectional causality in both short and long-run dynamics for all states, an indication of greater downstream integration of the natural gas market.

In contrast, this study addresses the demand side of renminbi internationalization, by providing an in-depth analysis of renminbi use in ordinary foreign economies from both economic and political perspectives, with a particular focus on South Korea, China's next-door neighbor. The study finds that sustainable indigenous market forces facilitating renminbi use in South Korea remain weak, despite the country's close economic ties with China. This research also shows, however, that the Korean Government has itself recently been able, through its policy measures, to generate new domestic support for greater use of the renminbi.

We use much more recent and complete data than previous studies, and we innovate by estimating hires and separations separately for open-ended contract workers. Focusing on open-ended contracts for France yields a picture strikingly close to the US labor market. Our results downplay the hypothesis, previously stated in the literature, that downsizing French firms would adjust through reduction in hiring because of the rigidity of employment protection legislation. Such results call for more work to be done on the impact of employment protection legislation on labor flows. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we characterize the outcome functions that are implementable for an uninformed principal and an informed agent if, having observed the agent's contract choice, the principal can offer a new menu of contracts in its place. An outcome function can be implemented in this setting if and only if it is optimal for the principal for some belief over agent types which is more pessimistic, in the sense of the likelihood ratio order, than the prior. Furthermore, the outcome function cannot be too sensitive to variations in the agent's type. We show that the direct revelation mechanism which implements such a function when renegotiation can be prevented will also implement it in any equilibrium when it cannot, so the standard contract is robust to renegotiation.

Besides considering that labor diffuses from regions with higher density to regions with lower density of labor, we consider that workers move from regions with lower density of capital to regions with higher density of capital, and that the labor force grows following a logistic law. Through stability analysis, we show that the introduction of capital-induced labor migration in the Solow model is a necessary condition for reaching an unstable regime that can generate a rich spatio-temporal dynamics. Numerical simulations show that, depending on the migration intensity and on the size of the economy, this modified Solow model can develop, endogenously, four kinds of behavior for the economy: (i) convergence to a homogeneous steady-state; (ii) convergence to a non-homogeneous steady-state; (iii) development of periodic spatio-temporal cycles; and (iv) development of irregular and aperiodic spatio-temporal cycles.","[Juchem Neto, Joao Plinio] Univ Fed Pampa UNIPAMPA, BR-97546550 Alegrete, RS, Brazil; [Ruiz Claeyssen, Julio Cesar] Univ Fed Rio Grande Sul UFRGS, Inst Matemat, BR-91509900 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa; Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul,"Neto, JPJ (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Pampa UNIPAMPA, Campus Alegrete,Av Tiaraju 810, BR-97546550 Alegrete, RS, Brazil.",plinio@unipampa.edu.br; julio@mat.ufrgs.br,"Neto, Joao Plinio Juchem/AAE-1750-2020; Claeyssen, Julio C.R./L-2572-2014","Neto, Joao Plinio Juchem/0000-0002-7640-6539;",Petrobras [PFRH-PB 216],Petrobras(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Amapa (FAPEAP)Petrobras),"The authors would like to acknowledge the referees for providing comments and suggestions that greatly helped us to improve the original manuscript.

Individual electricity indicators are modeled by allowing for apparent heterogeneous transitions. Log t convergence test results indicate that all 109 countries converge to a common stochastic trend for electricity intensity while per capita electricity consumption is better explained by a multiple-component model. In the case of 24 advanced economies, there is a strong tendency towards a common component for both indicators. The application of clustering algorithm confirms the presence of club convergence for per capita electricity consumption. In terms of clustering pattern, per capita electricity consumption appears to be remarkably similar to per capita income, widely used measure of economic development. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

People may intend to donate, but because of the transaction costs of doing so, postpone making the payment until they are less busy, and having postponed making the donation once, keep postponing. We conjecture that transaction costs will have a greater effect on donations if the solicitation is received when the opportunity cost of time is high. We find evidence of a transaction cost reducing donations, with the size of this effect depending on the opportunity cost of time, but no statistically significant evidence that giving people more time to donate increases procrastination and thus reduces donations.

The proposed LIML routine corrects small sample biases and constrained search inefficiencies. Previously used estimates are shown to overestimate the median elasticity of substitution by over 35%. Applied to US import data from 1993 to 2007, the biases of the standard estimates translate into an understatement of consumer gains from product variety by a factor of 6.

PTA membership only guarantees welfare gains for countries that are too poor to import the goods rich countries produce.

Hourly and daily wages suggest flexible arrangements, whereas the monthly payment system may be used to develop a stable relationship. Using original data from a sample of domestic workers in Portugal, we offer empirical evidence on predictors of four types of arrangement that combine formality and stability. The results from multi-nomial logistic regression indicate that the wage level is a crucial predictor of the type of contract. Households seem to make a trade-off between stable contracts and high-level wages. However, the odds of being given a formal and stable contract increase when domestic workers have specific skills or are responsible for care, and there are trust-related issues. Our findings suggest that the use of flexible and informal labour has its limitations even in an activity perceived as non-skilled.","[Suleman, Fatima] Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, DINAMIACET IUL, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Suleman, F (通讯作者)，Inst Univ Lisboa ISCTE IUL, Ave Forcas Armadas, P-1649026 Lisbon, Portugal.",fatima.suleman@iscte.pt,"Suleman, Fátima/AAG-1548-2020","Suleman, Fatima/0000-0002-5963-2892","FCT-Foundation of Science and Technology, of Ministry of Education and Science [PTDC/JUR/65622/2006]; FCT; FLEX FCT; [PTDC/EGE-ECO/108547/2008]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/108547/2008, PTDC/JUR/65622/2006] Funding Source: FCT","FCT-Foundation of Science and Technology, of Ministry of Education and Science; FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FLEX FCT; ; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT))","Instituto Universitario de Lisboa (ISCTE-IUL), DINAMIA'CET-IUL, Lisbon, Portugal.

In multi-hospital kidney exchanges pairs are pooled from multiple hospitals, and each hospital is able to decide which pairs to report and which to hide and match locally. Modeling the problem as a maximum matching on a random graph, we first establish that the expected benefit from pooling scales as the square-root of the number of pairs in each hospital. We design the xCM mechanism, which achieves efficiency and incentivizes hospitals of moderate-to-large size to fully report their pairs. Reciprocal pairs are crucial in the design, with the probabilistic uniform rule used to ensure incentive alignment. By grouping certain pair types into so-called virtual-reciprocal pairs, xCM extends to handle 3-cycles. We validate the performance of xCM in simulation, demonstrating its efficiency and incentive advantages over the Bonus mechanism (Ashlagi and Roth, 2014). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

These fuels have recently been certified for use in aircraft and could potentially provide greater environmental benefits than aviation biofuels approved previously. Due to uncertainties in the commercialization of AF technologies, we consider a range of assumptions concerning capital costs, energy conversion efficiencies and product slates. In 2030, estimates of the implicit subsidy required to induce consumption of AF jet fuel range from $0.45 to $20.85 per gallon. These correspond to a reference jet fuel price of $3.23 per gallon and AF jet fuel costs ranging from $4.01 to $24.41 per gallon. In all cases, as renewable jet fuel represents around 1.4% of total fuel consumed by commercial aviation, the goal has a small impact on aviation operations and emissions relative to a case without the renewable jet fuel target, and emissions continue to grow relative to those in 2005.

The major difference is the following: philosophers and philosophically oriented economists, such as Hilary Putnam and John Davis, see the positive-normative distinction in economics as following from the logical positivist position, and they interpret comments made by economists as reflecting scientific methodological positions that have long since been repudiated by philosophers of science. This article argues that economists' use of the positive-normative distinction developed from the Mill-Keynes methodological tradition, which did not hold logical positivist views. Instead, it had pragmatic purposes and was designed to encourage economists to be more modest in their claims for the implications of economic theory. We conclude by arguing that economist's current use of the positive-normative distinction is problematic, as Davis suggests, but that the best way forward is not to eliminate it, but to reposition it within the Mill-Keynes tradition from which it initially developed. Doing so avoids the problems of associating it with logical positivism, while simultaneously using the distinction to remind economists about the limitations of applying economic theorizing to real world problems.","[Colander, David; Su, Huei-Chun] Univ Coll London, Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Colander, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll London, Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",colander@middlebury.edu,,,,,,,35,25,26,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The results are not sensitive to circumstances such as adding time-varying country fixed effects into the gravity and controlling for infrastructure measures. The results do not seem to be resulting from some small subset of the data and the results are robust to considering zero trade flows. Furthermore, our results are not driven by the time series variation of the panel data either.

Using persistence profile analysis, we find that the Term Structure and a modified Fisher equation are maintained in the US model, and, the Term Structure, Fisher equation and Interest Rate Parity are maintained in the Canadian model. Then we use the model to examine the transmission of US monetary policy into the Canadian economy. The results show that the responses of the Canadian macro variables to the US monetary policy shock are very similar to the responses of the US macro variables to the same shock: after a contractionary US monetary policy shock, output falls quickly and shows a U-shaped response, inflation falls with a delay, short-term interest rate jumps and then gradually declines and long-term interest rate increases for one year and then gradually declines. Our results show that interest rate-path-through is the major mechanism by which US monetary policy shocks are transmitted into the Canadian economy. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The optimal contract has two main components: an incentive component corresponding to a non-tradable equity position and a variable salary component indexed to the aggregate wage bill and to aggregate dividends. Tying a manager's compensation to the performance of her own firm ensures that her interests are aligned with the goals of firm owners and that maximizing the discounted sum of future dividends will be her objective. Linking managers' compensation to overall economic performance is also required to make sure that managers use the appropriate stochastic discount factor to value those future dividends. General equilibrium considerations thus provide a potential resolution of the pay for luck puzzle. We also demonstrate that one sided relative performance evaluation follows equally naturally when managers and shareholders are differentially risk averse. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We show that if deforestation occurs from some initial state, then it must occur in finite time along every optimal path so that zero forest cover is the globally stable optimal steady state. We develop a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for deforestation. Deforestation is less likely if the immediate profitability of timber harvest, the benefits from stocks of standing forests and the timber content of trees are higher. We characterize the minimum forest cover along optimal paths (when deforestation is not optimal). We design a simple linear subsidy on standing forest biomass that can motivate a private owner (who does not take into account the external benefits from standing trees) to conserve forests.

Hence, the recent policy debate has focused on the effectiveness of macroprudential tools and their interaction with monetary policy. This article aims to contribute to the macroprudential policy literature by presenting a formal comparative analysis of three macroprudential tools: (i) reserve requirements, (ii) capital requirements, and (iii) a regulation premium. Using a new Keynesian general equilibrium model with financial frictions, I find that capital requirements are the most effective macroprudential tool in mitigating the negative effects of the financial accelerator mechanism. Deriving welfare-maximizing monetary and macroprudential policy rules, I also conclude that irrespective of the type of the shock affecting the economy, use of capital requirements generates the highest welfare gains.","Univ York, DERS, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Tavman, Y (通讯作者)，Univ York, DERS, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",yt594@york.ac.uk,,,,,,,27,6,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

This article allows for these issues when characterizing EU biodiesel industry price dynamics. While Brazilian and US ethanol markets have been thoroughly investigated, less attention has been paid to EU biodiesel markets. Pure EU biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices are the object of our research. Two different methods are applied to model these data: a parametric approach and Long et al's (2011) semiparametric approach. Empirical results suggest significant asymmetries in volatility spillovers between pure biodiesel and rapeseed oil prices.

The NMCM works both in a rational expectation environment and in a learning environment. We show that a learning environment (where agents take time to adapt to the new situation) appears well suited to capture the gradual wage and price adjustment of Germany and Spain. By contrast a rational expectation model appears more appropriate to describe the abrupt wage adjustment which took place in the Baltic States in 2008-09. The two environments appear to reflect the institutional differences between Germany and Spain on the one-hand and the Baltic States on the other hand. Moreover, in the learning environment, GDP and employment gains are delayed with respect to a rational expectation setting, but they are more long-lasting. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To curb these excesses when effort cannot be monitored, competing output-sharing partnerships can form. With the right-sized groups, aggregate effort falls to the socially optimal level. We investigate this theory experimentally and find that while it makes correct qualitative predictions, there are systematic quantitative deviations, always in the direction of the socially optimal investment. Using data on subjects' conjectures of each other's behavior we investigate altruism, conformity and extremeness aversion as possible explanations.

The fraction of skilled workers rises with economic growth.

But when increasing the mean level of education of their population, developing countries face a trade-off: should they focus on increasing the level of already educated children or try to put more children into school and diminish illiteracy rates? In other words, should countries favor a more unequal or a more equal distribution of human capital? This paper empirically explores this question by analyzing the relation between distribution of education and income per capita with panel data from 29 Indian States. Using two different measures of the distribution of education and dealing with the high correlation between the mean education level and its distribution, this paper provides evidence that there is a negative relation between equality of education and income per capita. This result is robust to the use of the system GMM estimator. However, the relation is non-linear and depends on the level of development. This paper also gives a first insight into the channels which are at stake and shows that several mechanisms explain the impact of the distribution of education. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a new methodology to analyze competition on a torus and show that there is a fundamental conflict of interests between consumers and producers over the standardization decision. Consumers prefer standardization with full compatibility because it offers more variety that confers a better match with their ideal specifications.

A robust political economy is one that channels the actions of self-interested individuals with limited information to promote economic progress. In the right institutional context, SEZs tend to promote economic growth. In the wrong institutional context, they can cause resource misallocation and rent-seeking. Policy makers introducing SEZs must overcome the knowledge problem to avoid misdirected economic planning. Yet, the scheme can only fulfill its purpose if it also prevents destructive rent-seeking behavior, both from businesses and from government authorities. The political economy framework of SEZs can be applied to judge their potential efficacy, something that orthodox studies of country features such as natural resources, infrastructure, and zone location fail to do. The Indian and Chinese experiences with SEZs illustrate these points.","[Moberg, Lotta] Geroge Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA USA",,"Moberg, L (通讯作者)，Geroge Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",lmoberg2@gmu.edu,,,,,,,97,60,68,0,79,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We carry out a comparative analysis for the last 50 years, with two model specifications, assuming country differences in the parameters associated with R&D effort. In the first one, the technological frontier position is determined by the country with the highest productivity, the United States. Alternatively, in the second specification, we alter the definition of the technological frontier, allowing it to transcend the leader. The empirical analysis leads to very different outcomes. The first specification estimation, using GMM techniques, indicates that American researchers are more technology growth enhancing than their European counterparts. In contrast, the results obtained for the second, using Kalman's filter, show that when using an alternative definition of technological frontier, it is possible to observe a boost in innovation that reduces the dispersion among countries. Then, the leading European countries can take advantage; in this case, Germany exhibits the best performance, followed by the US.","[Perez, Patricio; Fernandez, Adolfo C.] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, Appl Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain; [Bengoa, Marta] CUNY, Colin Powell Sch Civ & Global Leadership, Grad Program Econ, New York, NY USA; [Fernandez, Adolfo C.] UNED Cantabria, Ctr Asociado, Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria; City University of New York (CUNY) System; Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Fernández, AC (通讯作者)，UNED Cantabria, Ctr Asociado, Santander, Spain.",patricio.perez@unican.es; mbengoa@ccny.cuny.edu; adolfocosme.fernandez@unican.es,,"Fernandez Puente, Adolfo Cosme/0000-0003-4739-3377",,,,,42,0,0,0,22,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We postulate that gender norms are associated with identity and the reference group that people compare themselves with. We find that the reference group plays a pivotal role in understanding how feelings of labor deprivation are generated and this can explain the apparent mismatch between objective conditions of deprivation and subjective feelings of deprivation related to joblessness among young men and women. It can also potentially help governments design public policies that address objective conditions of deprivation, such as unemployment, with a better understanding of subjective implications.","[Serajuddin, Umar; Verme, Paolo] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Verme, P (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",pverme@worldbank.org,"verme, paolo/P-5228-2019","verme, paolo/0000-0002-8754-1138",,,,,39,4,4,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

Meanwhile, the power of the new test can be substantially better than the two-step classical Vuong test and is not dominated by the one-step classical Vuong test. An extension to moment-based models is also developed. I apply the new test to the voter turnout data set of Coate and Conlin (2004) and find that it can yield model comparison conclusions different from those of the classical tests.

This paper explains this behavior with a model of demand learning in which an exporter's profitability on the demand side is determined by a time-invariant firm-destination appeal index, and transient firm-destination-year preference shocks. New exporters must learn about their appeal indices in the presence of these shocks, and respond to fluctuations in demand by adding and dropping products more frequently than older exporters because they have less information about their attractiveness to consumers. Calibrated to match cross-sectional and dynamic moments of the distribution of sales and scope, the model quantitatively accounts for two thirds of the extent of product switching. The model further predicts that in response to a decline in trade costs, existing exporters add new products and new exporters enter a destination. Counterfactual implies that the contribution of product adding to export growth resulting from a fall in trade costs is substantially larger than the contribution of exporter entry.

Our results demonstrate that neither of the ECFA programs has a substantive effect. We find that the ninth-grade program had at most only a small (and likely negligible) effect on matriculation to high school. The seventh-grade program had no effect on either dropout rates during junior high school or on educational performance as measured by a standardized math test. The seventh-grade program did increase the plans of students to attend high school by 15%. In examining why ECFA was not able to motivate significant behavioral changes for ninth graders, we argue that the competitiveness of the education system successfully screened out poorer performing students and promoted better performing students. Thus by the ninth grade, the remaining students were already committed to going to high school regardless of ECFA support. In regards to the results of the seventh grade program, we show how seventh graders appear to be engaged in wishful thinking (they appear to change plans without reference to whether their plans are realistic).

This means that the author avoids results that are sensitive with respect to assuming either Cournot or Bertrand competition.","[Vetter, Henrik] Statsbiblioteket, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark",,"Vetter, H (通讯作者)，Statsbiblioteket, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.",hv@statsbiblioteket.dk,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,3,DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O,WARSAW,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics-Kiel,FEB 5,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,20155.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-5,0.0,,,20,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4BG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356896900001,0

Rapid growth of this segment is accompanied with claims about its relative resilience to financial crises as compared to conventional banking. However, little empirical evidence is available to support such claims. Using data from Pakistan, where Islamic and conventional banks co-exist, we compare the behaviour of Islamic and conventional banks during a financial panic. Our results show that Islamic bank branches are less prone to deposit withdrawals during financial panics, both unconditionally and after controlling for bank characteristics. The Islamic branches of banks that have both Islamic and conventional operations tend to attract (rather than lose) deposits during panics, which suggests a role for religious branding. We also find that Islamic bank branches grant more loans during financial panics and that their lending decisions are less sensitive to changes in deposits. Our findings suggest that greater financial inclusion of faith-based groups may enhance the stability of the banking system.","[Farooq, Moazzam] Cent Bank Oman, Muttrah, Oman; [Zaheer, Sajjad] State Bank Pakistan, Karachi, Pakistan; [Zaheer, Sajjad] Iqra Univ, Karachi, Pakistan",Iqra University,"Zaheer, S (通讯作者)，State Bank Pakistan, II Chundriagar Rd, Karachi, Pakistan.",sajjad.zaheer@sbp.org.pk,,,UK's DFID,UK's DFID,"Address for correspondence: State Bank of Pakistan, I.

We present evidence of two mechanisms for our observed associations - that languages serve as cultural markers for origin country norms or that features of language directly influence cognition and behavior.

The framework is an SVAR model with an exogenous global block consisting of GDP growth in the two major international economies and world commodity price inflation; regional influences are controlled through the inclusion of Australian GDP growth, while the domestic block consists of GDP growth, inflation, interest rates and changes in the real exchange rate. Using a sample period from 1986 to 2011, we find that although growth spillovers to New Zealand GDP are substantially greater from the US than from China, nevertheless growth in China induces larger responses in the New Zealand real exchange rate than does the US. Commodity price responses to growth in each of the large economies are also explored, while time-varying estimates provide some evidence of increasing responses of commodity prices and the New Zealand real exchange rate to growth in China.

Instead, the composition of budget consolidation is decisive in reducing default risk.

The paper tries to identify some of the factors that can explain the differences between MS in terms of recent distribution and the evolution over time of the distribution of DPs, comparing results of different regression models. The analysis has confirmed that the concentration of direct payments is very heterogeneous across EU Member States and that it reaches very high values in some of them. This is even truer when, as in this paper, non-beneficiary farms are accounted for in the analysis of the DP distribution. The results support the idea that a large part of the concentration of the DP support is generated by the way land is distributed among farms.

The empirical results show that oil price changes displayed asymmetric adjustments within different regimes and were more sensitive to the movement of interest rates than inflation rate. In addition, high inflation rate would give rise to low oil price persistence, and expansionary monetary policy would bring about higher oil price persistence. Moreover, when the short- and long-term interest rates were over their threshold values, the persistence effects of oil price changes were opposite. In the present relatively low US interest rates, adopting either an inflation-targeting policy or/and a debt-financing policy to stimulate economic growth, the timing is appropriate and the effect will be positive and expected because of low persistence of oil price changes.","[Wu, Po-Chin; Liu, Shiao-Yen] Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Chungli, Taiwan; [Pan, Sheng-Chieh] China Univ Technol, Dept Tourism & Leisure Management, Hsinchu, Taiwan",Chung Yuan Christian University,"Wu, PC (通讯作者)，Chung Yuan Christian Univ, Dept Int Business, Chungli, Taiwan.",pochin@cycu.edu.tw,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

When incentive schemes contractually reward workers for easily observed measures, such as quantity produced, the standard model predicts that unrewarded dimensions, such as quality, will be neglected. Yet, there remains mixed empirical evidence in favor of this standard principal-agent model prediction. This article reconciles the literature using both theory and empirical evidence. The theory outlines conditions under which principals can use a piece rate scheme to induce higher quantity and quality levels than analogous fixed wage schemes. Making use of a series of complementary laboratory and field experiments we show that this effect occurs because the agent is uncertain about the principal's monitoring ability and the principal's choice of a piece rate signals to the agent that she is efficient at monitoring.","[Al-Ubaydli, Omar] Bahrain Ctr Strateg Int & Energy Studies, Res Dept, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Al-Ubaydli, Omar] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Al-Ubaydli, Omar] George Mason Univ, Mercatus Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Andersen, Steffen] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Econ, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Gneezy, Uri] Univ Calif San Diego, Rady Sch Management, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [List, John A.] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [List, John A.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",George Mason University; George Mason University; Copenhagen Business School; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of Chicago; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Al-Ubaydli, O (通讯作者)，Bahrain Ctr Strateg Int & Energy Studies, Res Dept, POB 496, Manchester, Lancs, England.",omar@omar.ec; sa.eco@cbs.dk; ugneezy@ucsd.edu; jlist@uchicago.edu,"Andersen, Steffen/B-1646-2014","List, John/0000-0002-1740-3848; Al-Ubaydli, Omar/0000-0002-5193-8766",,,,,29,23,25,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we examine the effect of depression during adolescence on the probability of engaging in a number of criminal behaviors later in life. In our analysis, we control for a rich set of individual-, family-, and neighborhood-level factors to account for conditions that may be correlated with both childhood depression and adult criminality. One novelty in our approach is the estimation of school and sibling fixed effects models to account for unobserved heterogeneity at the neighborhood and family levels. Furthermore, we exploit the longitudinal nature of our data set to account for baseline differences in criminal behavior. The empirical estimates show that adolescents who suffer from depression face a substantially increased probability of engaging in property crime. We find little evidence that adolescent depression predicts the likelihood of engaging in violent crime or the selling of illicit drugs. Our estimates imply that the lower-bound economic cost of property crime associated with adolescent depression is approximately 227 million dollars per year. (JEL I10, K42)","[Anderson, D.

We study an additional substitutes treatment to control for the absolute slope of the reaction functions across treatments, where we again find evidence of collusive behavior.

The findings suggest that pharmaceutical companies still rely on sales representatives to disseminate the newest information about prescription drugs to GPs. The results suggest that leading experts (i.e., opinion leaders) in the healthcare industry add significantly to increasing GPs' intentions to prescribe specific drugs to their patients. Conferences organised by local and international scientific societies are considered to be the most reliable communication channels. Local websites designed for GPs have the highest perceived value among GPs. Further, statistically significant differences among different GPs' age groups were confirmed regarding channel preference and their perceived reliability: international scientific conferences and international health journals were more popular and perceived as more reliable among younger GPs compared to more senior GPs.","[Auruskeviciene, Vilte; Butkeviciene, Jovita] ISM Univ Management & Econ, Arkliu St 18, LT-01305 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Salciuviene, Laura] Univ Lancaster, Sch Management, Lancaster LA1 4YX, England",ISM University of Management & Economics; Lancaster University,"Auruskeviciene, V (通讯作者)，ISM Univ Management & Econ, Arkliu St 18, LT-01305 Vilnius, Lithuania.",vilaur@ism.lt; jovita.butkeviciene@gmail.com; l.salciuviene@lancaster.ac.uk,,"Auruskeviciene, Vilte/0000-0002-1563-4052",,,,,52,2,2,0,8,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We match this data with unique data from Nielsen Monitor Plus on monthly DTC advertising expenditures by therapeutic category for all media types.The research strategy identifies individuals who have been diagnosed with specific chronic conditions and tracks whether adherence, as measured by purchases of specific prescription drugs within designated therapeutic classes, can be explained in part by the level and type of DTC advertising to which the individual was potentially exposed. Income has a positive effect on adherence. We find that advertising has a small negative effect on the average level of adherence. We find some suggestive evidence that this is because advertising induces less compliant individuals to start treatment. This result is consistent with research in marketing which finds higher sensitivity to advertising among consumers with less persistent purchasing patterns.","[Cardon, James H.; Showalter, Mark H.] Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA",Brigham Young University,"Showalter, MH (通讯作者)，Brigham Young Univ, Dept Econ, Provo, UT 84602 USA.",mhs@byu.edu,,"Showalter, Mark/0000-0002-8154-2703; Cardon, James/0000-0002-6405-3684","Pfizer Pharmaceutical, Inc.","Pfizer Pharmaceutical, Inc.","Partial funding for this work was provided by Pfizer Pharmaceutical, Inc.",,31,5,5,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We illustrate the application of the measures with data from Portugal, finding that: (i) 17.78% of the individuals belong to households classified as poor while 7.03% are rich and 75.19% are classified as middle class; (ii) it is necessary to redistribute 23.78% of the total income of the economy to obtain perfect equality; (iii) 2.09% of the total income in the economy is enough to eradicate poverty.","[Crespo, Nuno] Lisbon Univ Inst ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal; [Crespo, Nuno; Moreira, Sandrina B.; Simoes, Nadia] ISCTE IUL, Business Res Unit, Lisbon, Portugal; [Moreira, Sandrina B.] Polytech Inst Setubal, Dept Econ & Management, Setubal, Portugal; [Simoes, Nadia] ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa; Instituto Politecnico de Setubal; Instituto Universitario de Lisboa,"Crespo, N (通讯作者)，Lisbon Univ Inst ISCTE IUL, Sch Business, Dept Econ, Lisbon, Portugal.",sandrina.moreira@esce.ips.pt,"Crespo, Nuno/AAG-9679-2019; Simoes, Nadia/AAG-1389-2020; Moreira, Sandrina B/C-5584-2011","Crespo, Nuno/0000-0002-6546-6325; Simoes, Nadia/0000-0002-4334-4482; Moreira, Sandrina B/0000-0003-2124-8366",Fundacao para a Ciencia e para a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2011]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2011] Funding Source: FCT,Fundacao para a Ciencia e para a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We are grateful to the Office of National Statistics (INE) for kindly providing as with the survey data, and we acknowledge the financial support from Fundacao para a Ciencia e para a Tecnologia (PEst-OE/EGE/UI0315/2011).

We find that very roughly, a doubling in transaction costs would reduce trading volume by 25% to 40% in the Forex. Most importantly, this article is the first contribution to specify the trading volume of the Forex through different (low and high volatility) regimes. Our results show evidence of nonlinear patterns for trading volumes and transaction costs on the Forex. Thus, the Tobin tax would not have a monotonic impact on trading activity across market conditions. The change in elasticity between low and high volatility regimes would be slight but significantly different. We may suggest that the high-variance regime might be the fundamentalist regime and the low-variance regime might be the chartist regime. It is a first step towards understanding which categories of agents would react to the introduction of a tax. Our results seem consistent with Tobin's underlying thinking; since a tax would penalize chartists more than fundamentalists, it could reduce exchange rate volatility.","[Damette, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, F-54052 Nancy, France; [Damette, Olivier] BETA CNRS, INRA, LEF, Nancy, France; [Damette, Olivier] CAC IXXI ENS Lyon, Lyon, France; [Goutte, Stephane] Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France; [Goutte, Stephane] PSB, F-75013 Paris, France",Universite de Lorraine; INRAE; Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Paris-VIII,"Goutte, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 08, LED, 2 Rue Liberte, F-93526 St Denis, France.",stephane.goutte@univ-paris8.fr,"Goutte, Stephane/Q-2202-2019","Goutte, Stephane/0000-0002-5206-866X; Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780",,,,,47,2,2,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, the decision for fund allocation and investments in mega infrastructure pipeline projects often must be made in conditions that are much more fraught with uncertainty. The key question in such decisions is if the economic impact caused by the new project could be able to essentially boost the economy by creating new jobs and generating new income on one hand; and which are the business sectors expected to archive the benefits of this investment. This article deals with the estimation of the mega infrastructure pipeline project economic effects in economy. The methodological framework is based on input-output approach providing quantitative estimations about the economic impact of the project in terms of new income and jobs.

The interest rate effect is strong for both crops with shipping costs also affecting soybean basis and own inventory levels positively correlated with corn basis. The effect of the wedge between the price of carrying physical grain and the maximum storage rate on basis is positive for both crops.

International comparisons of earnings analyses rely almost exclusively on school attainment measures of human capital, and evidence incorporating direct measures of cognitive skills is mostly restricted to early-career workers in the United States. Analysis of the new PIAAC survey of adult skills over the full lifecycle in 23 countries shows that the focus on early-career earnings leads to underestimating the lifetime returns to skills by about one quarter. On average, a one-standard-deviation increase in numeracy skills is associated with an 18 percent wage increase among primeage workers. But this masks considerable heterogeneity across countries. Eight countries, including all Nordic countries, have returns between 12 and 15 percent, while six are above 21 percent with the largest return being 28 percent in the United States. Estimates are remarkably robust to different earnings and skill measures, additional controls, and various subgroups. Instrumental-variable models that use skill variation stemming from school attainment, parental education, or compulsory-schooling laws provide even higher estimates. Intriguingly, returns to skills are systematically lower in countries with higher union density, stricter employment protection, and larger public-sector shares. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To answer this question, a staffing model is developed to determine the number of agents required to detect a specified fraction of terror attacks assuming that the hazard functions governing attack and plot detection are proportional. Given estimates of the benefit of preventing a terror attack and the cost of counterterror agents, the staffing model can be employed to determine both the socially efficient terror plot detection level and the implied number of counterterror agents. A game-theoretic version of the model emerges if strategic terrorists select their attack rate presuming that the state will respond optimally. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate potential applications using empirical estimates of the benefit of preventing attacks and the cost of counterterror agents.","Yale Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Kaplan, EH (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci, Yale Sch Publ Hlth, Yale Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",edward.kaplan@yale.edu,,"Kaplan, Edward/0000-0002-8722-7667",Yale School of Management,Yale School of Management,Research support provided by the Yale School of Management.

We consider the fact that both the seller of the property and the real estate agent have a common goal: to sell the property at the highest possible price in the shortest amount of time. The analysis is divided into two major parts. First, we estimate a two-stage least square model to analyse which parameters affect time on the market for a property. Second, we propose a probit model that estimates the parameters that affect a revision in list prices.

Guided by firm interviews that suggested substantial heterogeneity across firms in how they responded to Walmart's entry, we develop a dynamic industry model in which firms decide whether to sell their products through Walmex (short for Walmart de Mexico), or use traditional retailers. Walmex provides access to a larger market, but it puts continuous pressure on its suppliers to improve their product's appeal, and it forces them to accept relatively low prices relative to product appeal. Simulations of the model show that the arrival of Walmex separates potential suppliers into two groups. Those with relatively high-appeal products choose Walmex as their retailer, whereas those with lower appeal products do not. For the industry as a whole, the model predicts that the associated market share reallocations, adjustments in innovative effort, and exit patterns increase productivity and the rate of innovation. These predictions accord well with the results from our firm interviews. The model's predictions are also supported by establishment-level panel data that characterize Mexican producers' domestic sales, investments, and productivity gains in states with differing levels of Walmex presence during the years 1994 to 2002.

Those students streamed into academic tracks at early ages under tracking are most likely to be admitted to college, and the competitiveness of college admissions does not affect their effort.

On average, 41% of students opt out' of the high school to which they would normally be assigned based on their residence. Students are more likely to opt out in areas where accessibility to other schools is greatest due to population density and explicit open enrolment' policies.

With the consideration of a self-fulfilling deposit insurance facility with sufficient bank reserve to meet the expected need of liquidity shock, our model suggests a counter-cyclical capital adequacy requirement in a competitive loan market. The exception might occur when the moral hazard problem becomes very unwieldy and the representative individual is rather risk averse. With regard to the closure policy, we find that it is closely related to the individual's degree of risk aversion. A counter-cyclical closure policy is recommended when the individual is highly risk averse. Otherwise, a pro-cyclical closure policy is preferred.","[Lin, Yu-Hsiu] Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan; [Hu, Len-Kuo] Natl Chengchi Univ, Dept Int Business, Taipei 116, Taiwan",National Kaohsiung University of Science & Technology; National Chengchi University,"Lin, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci, Dept Finance, 415 Chien Kung Rd, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan.",yushiu@kuas.edu.tw,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This article seeks to inform the International Accounting Standards Board's (IASB's) on-going consideration of mineral resource reporting. Listed companies are considered to evidence forms of reserve disclosure with a logistical regression approach applied to measure determinants of reporting. The risk associated with mineral reporting reserves is hypothesized as the key disclosure driver whilst controlling other relevant variables. The majority of firms disclosed reserve quantities in some form but only a minority disclosed in line with recommended practice, disclosure quality being more variable between companies. The findings indicate that a voluntary disclosure approach is ineffective, partially explained by agency related behaviour. Risk, proxied by the stage of production, drives reserve disclosure showing that producer firms are more likely to disclose reserve quantum balances and of a significantly higher quality.","[McChlery, Stuart] Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Law Econ Accounting & Risk, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland; [Kouhy, Reza] Abertay Univ, Accounting Finance & Econ, Dundee, Scotland; [Paisey, Catriona] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Hussainey, Khaled] Univ Plymouth, Plymouth Business Sch, Plymouth PL4 8AA, Devon, England",Glasgow Caledonian University; University of Abertay Dundee; University of Glasgow; University of Plymouth,"McChlery, S (通讯作者)，Glasgow Caledonian Univ, Law Econ Accounting & Risk, Glasgow G4 0BA, Lanark, Scotland.",S.Mcchlery@gcu.ac.uk,"Hussainey, Khaled/AFG-8056-2022","Paisey, Catriona/0000-0003-1851-0431",,,,,37,4,6,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

First, the locations of structural breaks are identified by Bai and Perron's (1998) method. Then, it is estimated how a hazard rate changes in duration between structural breaks by parametric duration analysis using the Weibull and the log-logistic hazard functions. This study reveals the evidence of positive duration dependence, that is, stability is destabilizing, in 13 out of 27 international stock indices and the pooled data. In other words, as one regime continues over time with unchanged parameter values, a new structural break is more likely to occur. This method discloses a lower degree of duration dependence than the duration-dependence Markov-switching model (Durland and McCurdy, 1994) that considers temporary switches between a limited number of regimes. Also, some new patterns are emerged, e. g., more predominant positive duration dependence in bear markets, the secondary stock exchanges of a country and developing countries.","[Park, Jin Suk] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham DH1 3LB, England",Durham University,"Park, JS (通讯作者)，Oxford Brookes Univ, Fac Business, Oxford OX33 1HX, England.",j.s.park@durham.ac.uk,"Park, Jin Suk/IUQ-1364-2023; Park, Jin Suk/AAD-8661-2020","Park, Jin Suk/0000-0001-5317-0378; Park, Jin Suk/0000-0001-5317-0378",,,,,43,0,0,1,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The tests performed have clearly shown that the discrimination accuracy of a model falls significantly when it is used in a different environment. This led in turn to an investigation of ways in which the discrimination capability of a model may be increased by means of the determination of new weightings for model variables and grey-zone boundaries.

The value that people provide through the application of skills, know-how and expertise define the human capital: an organization's combined human capability for solving business problems and exploiting its intellectual property. As a part of intellectual capital, human capital is inherent in people and cannot be owned by an organization. Therefore, human capital can leave an organization not only when people are practically leaving but also when the management fails to provide a setting where know-how is transmitted to other members of the organization therefore not being lost when individuals leave an enterprise. Human capital also encompasses how effectively an organization uses its or especially another people's resources as measured by creativity and innovation. This is the context in which crowdsourcing is a very recent advancement involving a large number of people all over the world interacting with enterprises and therefore creating the opportunity to generate added value. Because so many people are involved, it is difficult to manage intellectual property in this context. However, crowdsourcing being a form of outsourcing, it has the potential to reduce an enterprises operational expenses and this paper has the goal of proving that an enterprise can make use of crowdsourcing platforms in order to reduce cost while preserving intellectual property. Our research uses the questionnaire method on the largest task crowdsourcing platform (Amazon Mechanical Turk) to identify the main categories of tasks that are currently crowdsourced and whether or not this new method of completing tasks can increase enterprise profitability by reducing operating expense for enterprises in California and Romania while minimizing exposure of intellectual property. While analysing the cost of human capital we found that the location of the enterprise can significantly influence the cost of a traditional full time employee. Therefore, we had to determine which states to base our analysis upon in order to make sure that the research is conclusive. We selected two states with a high discrepancy in terms of the cost of a minimum wage employee as well as reliable access to the Internet and a high human capital per person index. We've selected Romania and California, which have been assigned the same human capital per person index, and both have very reliable access to the Internet. After analysing the data collected through our research, we found that, once applying the suggested methodology to ensure a similar quality of work and also taking into consideration additional taxes associated with the cost of full time employees, it would be beneficial for enterprises in California to use crowdsourcing in order to reduce operational expense while enterprises in Romania might not be able to benefit from substantial operational expense reduction generated by engaging in this type of outsourcing activities. Crowdsourcing is a very fast moving and entrepreneurial field and it's expected to evolve and more platforms are expected to launch in the near future.","[State, Cristina; Popescu, Dan; Toanca, Livia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"State, C (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",cristina.state@man.ase.ro; dan.popescu@man.ase.ro; liviat@outlook.com,"STATE, Cristina/AHC-1283-2022; POPESCU, DAN P./J-8620-2014; State, Cristina/AAZ-2886-2021","POPESCU, DAN P./0000-0001-7164-9155; State, Cristina/0000-0002-1514-9831",,,,,22,0,0,0,14,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,454,463,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600053,0

Large gird connected renewable energy (RE) facilities form a subset of sustainability and the clean technology sector. From a business perspective, it is important to understand what policies are available and what factors (drivers) play a key role. This study identifies five main RE policy mechanisms (Feed-In Tariffs (FITs); Tradable Green Certificates; Renewable Portfolio Standards; Bidding/Tendering and Fiscal) of which the FIT has experienced the most success in establishing a RE sector. Using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM), the study relates the policies to the drivers to identify which drivers are most effective within a RE sector. The development and analysis of the model is based on an iterative process, where the draft FCM was adapted to fit a representative model and then further validated by applying country specific examples. Results indicate that all simulations reached an equilibrium state in the FCM model. The four drivers, observed as the most influential drivers, as set out in the propositions are: big players (category: local conditions), non-RE sector (category: economics), cost competitiveness (category: financial) and risk (category: financial). These four drivers seem to play the most influential part of a RE sector when a FIT policy mechanism is deployed. It is proposed that these four drivers are best suited to model a FIT system. This study is one of the first to empirically examine how various drivers emerge and how they need to be managed when designing a RE policy mechanism. Managing the four key drivers - as identified in this study - is pivotal in establishing a sustainable RE sector.","[Treki, Adam; Urban, Boris] Univ Witwatersrand, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Treki, A (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, POB 98, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",adam.treki@mainstreamp.com; Boris.urban@wits.ac.za,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,32,2,4,1,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In order to maintain the competitiveness of innovative enterprises it is necessary to master the sophisticated methods of management in their complexity. Especially project management is becoming an instrument of strategy implementation. For successful development of companies, both in the short-term and the long-term horizon it is necessary to work with project portfolios. Nowadays, the work with project portfolios and the issues of multi-project management are globally dealt with in numerous professional studies presenting various views and hypotheses of their authors.

Measures that are considered efficient from the perspective of one EU member state may not necessarily improve the welfare at the EU level and vice versa. While common competition policy rules are often justified by referring to the core values of European integration and the Single Market, the values themselves prioritize different aspects of the ideals of free market, European solidarity, and institutional stability. Curiously, as a result, the EU practical regulations are often imposing significant costs on a local peripheral consumer while even unable of meeting the proclaimed European values. By using the case study of the Estonian national flag carrier Estonian Air the current study focuses on the question whether the EU state aid regulation is simultaneously rational and sufficiently flexible to take into account the joint values of the European single market and specific needs of peripheral member states.","[Veebel, Viljar] Estonian Natl Def Coll, Dept Strateg Studies, Tartu, Estonia; [Ploom, Illimar] Tallinn Univ Technol, Ragnar Nurkse Sch Innovat & Governance, Dept Governance, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia; [Kulu, Liina] Bank Estonia, Econ & Res Dept, Tallinn, Estonia",Estonian Military Academy; Tallinn University of Technology; Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank),"Veebel, V (通讯作者)，Estonian Natl Def Coll, Dept Strateg Studies, Tartu, Estonia.",viljar.veebel@mil.ee,"Ploom, Illimar/JUF-8007-2023; Veebel, Viljar/AAD-2852-2019","Ploom, Illimar/0000-0003-2950-7553; Veebel, Viljar/0000-0002-9122-0134",,,,,22,3,3,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

A stochastic production frontier and three channels of agglomeration economies consisting of specialization, diversity and competition are used. The empirical results show that the effects of specialization and diversity upon firm-level technical efficiency are positive and negative, respectively, indicating that specialization is more favourable than diversity for stimulating firms' technical efficiency. Competition has a positive sign, showing that region with high levels of competition tend to be more conducive in accelerating firm-level technical efficiency. In terms of firm location, both dummy for urban region and industrial complex turn out to be positive, indicating that firms located in both areas are experienced higher technical efficiency. Both firm size and age also have positive effect upon technical efficiency.","[Widodo, Wahyu] Diponegoro Univ, Fac Econ & Business, Semarang, Indonesia; [Salim, Ruhul; Bloch, Harry] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Diponegoro University; Curtin University,"Salim, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,"Bloch, Harry/O-1058-2019; Bloch, Harry/A-9591-2008; Widodo, Wahyu/AGP-0786-2022","Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Bloch, Harry/0000-0002-4288-6925; Widodo, Wahyu/0000-0003-1466-779X",,,,,61,16,18,2,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We develop a new method of testing for bubbles that relates the bubble component of stock prices to the probability of bursting in the context of the Weibull distribution. There were several eruptions and subsequent collapses of seeming bubbles over the past three decades: 1987 (Black Monday), 2000 (information technology (IT) boom) and 2007 (housing market boom). Using US monthly data for the S&P 500 and NASDAQ series, we have found that the S&P 500 series contained an explosive bubble only during the boom of the housing market that occurred before the 2007 global economic crisis, and the NASDAQ market contained an explosive bubble during the surge of stock prices peaking in 1987 and 2007, although our stationarity tests fail to detect the bubbles. No bubble was found in both the S&P and NASDAQ series during the 2000 IT boom. Our evidence corroborates the criticism that the traditional unit root and cointegration tests may not be able to detect some important class of bubbles.","[Yuhn, Ky-Hyang] Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA; [Kim, Sang Bong] Hansung Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Nam, Joo Ha] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University; Hansung University; Sogang University,"Yuhn, KH (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Coll Business, Dept Econ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",yuhn@fau.edu,,"Kim, Sang Bong/0000-0002-3646-4208",,,,,40,5,9,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It predicts that the potential growth rate of per capita GDP adjusted by purchasing power parity averages at 6.02 percent from 2015 to 2035, while the potential GDP growth rate of 2015 would still be above 8 percent, which implies that the realized rate of growth has not reached its potential since 2012. Besides, based on the per capita GDP projected and on cross-country comparison, the paper plots the trajectory of structural change of the Chinese economy from 2015 to 2035. The result shows that: (i) the value-added share of primary industry will drop more rapidly than the employment share; (ii) the value-added share of secondary industry will decline and employment share will present an inverted U shape whose turning point will probably come between 2020 and 2025; (iii) both the value-added and employment share of tertiary industry will increase continuously.","[Zhang, Jun; Xu, Liheng; Liu, Fang] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University,"Zhang, J (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",junzh_2000@fudan.edu.cn; 12210680129@fudan.edu.cn; 12110680009@fudan.edu.cn,"LIU, FANGCHAO/D-8137-2017",,,,,,28,8,9,0,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2015,23.0,1,,,,,21,46,,10.1111/cwe.12098,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CA4CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348852000002,0

A key issue arises from these emerging democracies, or countries in transition', about what types of government institutions will be adopted by the new democracies. The previous literature on advanced democracies shows the economic structure of a nation impacted its choice of electoral rule system. This paper looks at what determines electoral rule choice in transitional nations. Using a panel database with 65 transitional countries with data for 18 years (1995 to 2012), this paper tests the argument that more coordinated market economies (CMEs) tend to adopt more proportional representative electoral rule systems during a political transition. Findings show that countries characterized as CMEs due to widespread primary education, which supports co-specific assets, and prominent industrial sectors have more proportional electoral rule systems.","[Clement, Jessica] Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France",,"Clement, J (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, Ctr Econ Sorbonne, Paris, France.",jessica.clement@univ-paris1.fr,,"Clement, Jessica/0000-0002-4034-3206",Pantheon-Sorbonne Masters in Economics PhD scholarship,Pantheon-Sorbonne Masters in Economics PhD scholarship,"I am grateful for the helpful comments from Bruno Amable, Elvire Guillaud, and Thibault Darcillon and for the funding from the Pantheon-Sorbonne Masters in Economics PhD scholarship.",,37,0,0,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

We exploit novel data for individual taxpayers collected in 2014 by Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue to estimate a binary probit regression model. Our results are generally in line with the findings of the modern empirical literature on tax morale in other countries. Overall, groups with lower labor force participation show more positive attitudes toward tax compliance. Educated respondents exhibit higher tax morale than the illiterate, but only for those with very low or very high educational attainment is tax morale higher than for those with bachelor's degrees. Tax morale is highest in major industrialized population centers that serve as seats of government. Females show generally higher tax morale than males, however, their attitudes tend to worsen with age to such an extent that elderly females have lower tax morale than elderly males. Our findings on gender suggest potential gains from increasing female labor force participation rates. More generally, addressing the current failures of tax administration and dealing with horizontal inequity arising from administrative weaknesses may contribute materially to improving voluntary compliance.

In this paper, we study the effect of the employer mandate in the Massachusetts health insurance reform on part-time work using a difference-indifferences strategy that compares changes in part-time work in Massachusetts after the reform to changes in various control groups. We find strong evidence that the Massachusetts employer mandate increased part-time employment among low-educated workers and some evidence that it increased part-time employment among younger workers. Our estimate of a 1.7 percentage point increase in part-time employment among workers without a college degree suggests that lower-skilled workers may be vulnerable to having their hours cut so that employers do not have to offer them health insurance.

Specifically, we identify suitable parameter combinations by using a series of maximum-likelihood estimates and appropriate goodness-of-fit tests to avoid arbitrariness with respect to the fitting of the Pareto distribution. Our results suggest that the alleged non-observation bias is considerable, accounting for about one quarter of total net wealth in the case of Austria. The method developed in this paper can easily be applied to other countries where survey data on wealth are available.","[Eckerstorfer, Paul] Natl Council Austria, Parliamentary Budget Off, Linz, Austria; [Halak, Johannes; Kapeller, Jakob; Springholz, Florian] Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria; [Schuetz, Bernhard] Univ Linz, Dept Econ, Linz, Austria; [Wildauer, Rafael] Kingston Univ London, Dept Econ, London, ON, Canada",Johannes Kepler University Linz; Johannes Kepler University Linz,"Kapeller, J (通讯作者)，Univ Linz, Dept Philosophy & Theory Sci, Altenbergerstr 69, A-4040 Linz, Austria.",jakob.kapeller@jku.at,"Wildauer, Rafael/HJP-5578-2023; Kapeller, Jakob/AAP-1109-2020","Wildauer, Rafael/0000-0001-6395-6286;",Austrian Chamber of Labor,Austrian Chamber of Labor,"We thank Rene Boheim, Bettina Csoka, Yannis Dafermos, Pirmin Fessler, Paul Hofmarcher, Peter Lindner, Maria Nikolaidi, Martin Riese, Matthias Schnetzer, Stefan Steinerberger, and Engelbert Stockhammer for valuable comments.

We analyze assignment models of the level of pay, and static and dynamic moral-hazard models of incentives, and compare their predictions to empirical findings. We make two broad points. First, traditional theories find it difficult to explain the data, suggesting that compensation results from rent extraction by CEOs. However, more modern shareholder value theories, that arguably better capture the CEO setting, do deliver predictions consistent with observed practices, suggesting that these practices need not be inefficient. Second, seemingly innocuous features of the modeling setup, often made for tractability or convenience, can lead to significant differences in the model's implications and conclusions on the efficiency of observed practices. We close by highlighting apparent inefficiencies in executive compensation and additional directions for future research.","[Edmans, Alex] CEPR, London Business Sch, London, England; [Edmans, Alex] European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium; [Gabaix, Xavier] Harvard Univ, NBER, Dept Econ, CEPR, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London Business School; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Corporate Governance Institute; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Edmans, A (通讯作者)，CEPR, London Business Sch, London, England.;Edmans, A (通讯作者)，European Corp Governance Inst, Brussels, Belgium.",,"Edmans, Alex/F-9562-2011; Gabaix, Xavier/B-8227-2008",,,,,,204,91,106,5,63,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

The estimated intergenerational income elasticity is 0.43 and 0.51 for cohorts educated prior to and after the market reform respectively, and reaches 0.71 among households with above average income in the post-reform era. Besides the conventional channel of education, this paper estimates the contribution from social capital and ownership of work unit across cohorts and income groups. There is weak evidence that prior to market reform, ownership of work unit contributes most to the intergenerational income persistence for households with below average income, while social capital leads the three contributors in households with above average income. However, in the post-reform era, parents with below average income invest statistically significantly in children's education which contributes most to the intergenerational income persistence. The leading contributor in families with above average income shifts to social capital. Possible explanations for such a shift lie in the ability and incentive of parents from different income categories to invest in their children. The results are tested through a series of robustness checks, and provide empirical support for promoting policies on the equality of opportunity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper analyzes the economic effects of R&D tax credits by firm size. It mainly aims to compare the results of tax policies oriented towards LEs to those towards SMEs. In order to estimate the impact numerically, we use a computable general equilibrium model, which incorporates some essential characteristics of knowledge. First, we introduce a social accounting matrix that differentiates between SMEs and LEs in manufacturing industries. Then, a knowledge-based macroeconomic model estimates outcomes for policy scenarios regarding tax incentives. The results show that SMEs support more rapid growth than do LEs when the same volume of tax credits is offered to both enterprise types. We suggest that the intensity of knowledge spillovers induced by SMEs is driving this result.","[Hong, Chanyoung] Korea Inst S&T Evaluat & Planning, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Jeong-Dong] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Lee, JD (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program, Seoul, South Korea.",leejd@snu.ac.kr,,,"Korea government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) under the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013R1A2A2A03014744]","Korea government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) under the National Research Foundation of Korea","This work was supported by the Korea government (Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning) under the National Research Foundation of Korea grant [NRF-2013R1A2A2A03014744].",,32,9,9,3,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

One explanation for this pattern is that the consumption taxes are generally more enforceable in these economies. This paper studies the optimal combination of a linear consumption tax with a non-linear income tax for redistributive purposes. In our model, households might not comply with the income tax code by reporting income levels that differ from their true income. However, the consumption tax is fully enforceable. We derive a formula for the optimal income tax schedule as a function of the consumption tax rate, the recoverable elasticities, and the moments of the taxable income distribution. Our equation differs from those of Mirrlees (1971) and Saez (2001) because households face a consumption tax and they respond to income tax not only through labor supply but also through mis-reporting their incomes. Both aspects are empirically relevant to our calibration of the optimal top rate in the Russian economy. We then characterize the optimal mix between a linear consumption tax rate and a non-linear income tax schedule. Finally, we find that the optimal consumption tax rate is non-increasing in the redistributive motives of the social planner. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

More specifically we estimate the tax elasticities of sectoral output growth and public expenditure. The unique features of this paper are twofold: First, we develop a simple analytical model for tax revenue performance taking into account some structural features pervasive in most developing countries with large informal sectors. Second, we test the model predictions on Ugandan time series data using ARDL bounds testing techniques. Results indicate that dominance of the agricultural and informal sectors pose the largest impediments to tax revenue performance. In addition development expenditures, trade openness, and industrial sector growth are positively associated with tax revenue performance. We propose policies to support the development of value added linkages between agricultural and industrial sectors while emphasizing the need to unlock the potentially large contributions of the informal sector with a view of widening the tax base.","[Mawejje, Joseph; Munyambonera, Ezra Francis] Ctr Econ Policy Res, 51 Pool Rd,Makerere Univ Campus,POB 7841, Kampala, Uganda",,"Mawejje, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, 51 Pool Rd,Makerere Univ Campus,POB 7841, Kampala, Uganda.",jmawejje@eprcug.org,,"Mawejje, Joseph/0000-0002-3301-7226",,,,,45,14,14,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

In these patience auctions, participants bid the smallest future sum they would prefer -or- the longest time they would wait for a reward, rather than receive a smaller, immediate payoff. The most patient bidder receives the delayed reward; all others receive the immediate payoff. These auctions allow us to compare discounting when participants' attention is focused on the temporal versus monetary dimension of delayed rewards. We find that the estimated parameters in the three most commonly used discount functions (exponential, hyperbolic, and quasi-hyperbolic) differ across these two bidding methods (time-bids vs. money-bids). Specifically, our participants tend to show more impatience under time-bids. Furthermore, we find that people are more likely to exhibit exponential (as opposed to hyperbolic) discounting and exhibit less present bias under time-bids, compared to money-bids. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to directly compare time versus money preference elicitations, within the same subjects, using an incentive-compatible mechanism.","[Olivola, Christopher Y.] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Posner Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Wang, Stephanie W.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4715 Wesley W Posvar Hall,230 South Bouquet St, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Olivola, CY (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Tepper Sch Business, Posner Hall,5000 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",olivola@cmu.edu; swwang@pitt.edu,"Olivola, Christopher/A-5630-2010","Olivola, Christopher/0000-0002-3359-3055",Russell Sage Foundation; Society for Judgment and Decision Making,Russell Sage Foundation; Society for Judgment and Decision Making,"We would like to thank Abhijit Banerji, Roland Benabou, Colin Camerer, John Doyle, Jacob Goeree, Jens Grosser, David Hardisty, Joel Huber, Eric J.

Daily closing prices of the benchmark stock market indices of the aforementioned countries are considered from the end of October 2000 to the end of May 2015. After detrending the global factors from return series, the pair-wise time varying correlations are obtained by consistent Dynamic Conditional Correlation (cDCC) modeling, which is a class of Multivariate GARCH models. In contrast to the previous literature, our analysis reveals that most of the rating related announcements do not have a significant effect on the pair, wise correlations.

In particular, if network compatibility effects between firms are sufficiently asymmetric, the Cournot equilibrium is more efficient than the Bertrand equilibrium in terms of larger consumer, producer and total surpluses. Then, we consider an endogenous choice of the strategic variables, price and quantity. If the degree of network compatibility effects of the rival firm is larger (smaller) than the degree of product substitutability, then choosing prices (quantities) is a dominant strategy for the firm. Thus, if the network compatibility effects of both firms are larger (smaller), the Bertrand (Cournot) equilibrium arises. Furthermore, if the network compatibility effects between the firms are sufficiently asymmetric, the firm with a larger (smaller) network compatibility effect than a certain level of product substitutability chooses quantities (prices). In this case, the Cournot-Bertrand equilibrium arises, which is less (more) efficient than the Cournot equilibrium in terms of consumer (producer) surplus.","[Toshimitsu, Tsuyoshi] Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan",Kwansei Gakuin University,"Toshimitsu, T (通讯作者)，Kwansei Gakuin Univ, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan.",,,,,,,,24,7,7,0,18,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1352-4739,1468-5876,,JPN ECON REV,Jpn.

Our finding is that the market-wise adaptation of strategy-proof and non-wasteful rules yields a strategy-proof rule with the following efficiency property: no strategy-proof rule Pareto-dominates the rule. Such rules are abundant as they include the market-wise use of the well-known priority-based rules of the top trading cycles and the deferred acceptance. This result gives theoretical support to the independent operation of markets observed in real-life markets as well as our practice in Market Design that separately treats each market for its design.

The scenarios reflect different U.S. natural gas resource outlooks, market conditions, changing U.S. environmental regulations, and possible changes in geopolitical conditions that affect the global natural gas demand and supply. U.S. LNG exports respond to market conditions under each scenario and are free from any artificial limits. In the near-term, U.S. LNG exports are uncompetitive in the Reference case and in the long-run U.S. LNG exports are significant when U.S. natural gas resources are plentiful. However under demand shocks (increase demand in Asia) or supply shocks (reduction in Russian supplies) or persistence of oil-indexed pricing cases, U.S. LNG exports become competitive to varying degrees. U.S. exports depend not only on U.S. economics but also on how U.S. prices change relative to price changes in other regions of the world. We conclude that limiting U.S. LNG exports is inconsistent with simulated uncertainties, and it should be left to the market to determine the levels and destination of exports. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows that an increase in the intra-brand elasticity of substitution can lower output VAT evasion when under-reporting of final sales and input VAT credits occur jointly. Because of the improvement in VAT compliance, equilibrium prices will fall and VAT revenues will rise both in the short and in the long run. Disentangling the love of variety and the elasticity of substitution utility parameters, it turns out that, in a symmetric general equilibrium solution with free entry and exit of firms, an increase in the substitution elasticity is welfare improving when love of variety is not too strong.

The identification uses the Two Control Zones (TCZ) policy implemented by the Chinese government in 1998, in which tougher environmental regulations were imposed in TCZ cities but not others. Our difference in-difference-in-differences estimation explores three-dimension variations; specifically, city (i.e., TCZ versus non-TCZ cities), industry (i.e., more polluting industries relative to less polluting ones), and year (i.e., before and after the TCZ policy). We find that tougher environmental regulation leads to less foreign direct investment. Meanwhile, we find that foreign multinationals from countries with better environmental protections than China are insensitive to the toughening environmental regulation, while those from countries with worse environmental protections than China show strong negative responses.

We use the Prometeia overlapping generation model for Italy, Germany, and France which are modeled as open economies in capital markets. Our projections provide a core-periphery structure in which Germany, the most abundant human capital country, shows the highest but a decreasing growth rate due to pronounced aging, and finances capital accumulation processes in France and Italy. We find that financial trends are reversed in the late 2010s when Italy begins to over-save as the gap in human capital endowment, and then in productivity, becomes larger compared to the other two countries. This leads to a reduction in physical capital accumulation and innovation processes in Italy. We employ fiscal experiments to correct the long-run divergent behavior of countries in order to get a more homogeneous growth rate path among countries. We also measure the impact of taxation on net-wealth in Italy, and evaluate the internal and spillover effects.","[Catalano, Michele; Pezzolla, Emilia] Prometeia Assoc Previsioni Econometr, Via Marconi 43, I-40122 Bologna, Italy",,"Catalano, M (通讯作者)，Prometeia Assoc Previsioni Econometr, Via Marconi 43, I-40122 Bologna, Italy.",michele.catalano@prometeia.com,,"Catalano, Michele/0000-0002-4228-5070",,,,,39,10,11,3,31,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,NOV,2016,43.0,4,,,SI,,757,800,,10.1007/s10663-016-9351-5,0.0,,,44,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,EA1SI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386371800005,0

This motivates us to construct a dynamic model for implied volatility surface, which not only captures cross-sectional information of implied volatilities with different strikes and maturities, but also describes how the implied volatility surface evolves over time. In this paper, we use nonlinear parametric function to capture single implied volatility surface, and model the dynamics of implied volatility surface by modeling the dynamics of function coefficients. We introduce unscented Kalman filter to propagate the nonlinear system, which is constructed by the nonlinear parametric function and the dynamics of its coefficients. A dynamic approach is proposed to provide optimal estimation of model parameters and efficient forecast of future implied volatility surface. It shows that our model has a better description of implied volatility surface dynamics than other similar models, and can be used to do volatility surface forecast. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

People tend to interact with similar others (homophily). They also tend to treat others of shared social identity more favorably (in-group bias). While both phenomena involve some degree of discrimination towards others, a systematic study of their relations and interplay is yet missing. In this paper we report the findings of an experiment designed to address this issue. Participants are exogenously and randomly assigned to one of two groups. Subsequently they play a sequence of eight games with either an in-group or an out-group member. In treatment EXO in- and out-group matches are formed exogenously, while in ENDO participants can choose between in- and out-group matches. We find strong evidence of in-group bias in EXO, and strong evidence of homophily in ENDO. In-group biases, however, either decrease or disappear altogether under endogenous matching. We show that self-selection of homophilous agents into in-group matches cannot explain this fact. We also find that homophily is strongly correlated with risk aversion, and we build on this evidence to derive a rationale for both the existence of homophily and the disappearance of in-group biases under endogenous matching.

A common assumption in this literature is that firms are evenly spaced on the circle, even when entry is allowed. We characterize conditions for even spacing to be an equilibrium, using a two-stage (location-then-price) circular model with general transport cost function. Under duopoly competition, we characterize a mild sufficient condition-the first derivative of transport cost is concave (together with an assumption governing the transport cost difference to the two firms). If one only considers pure strategy equilibrium in prices, this sufficient condition is weakened to the first derivative of transport cost being 1-concave. These conditions ensure that firms' profits are concave in their prices when firms are evenly spaced and that even spacing maximizes profits. Under oligopoly competition ( firms), we characterize a necessary condition for even spacing to be an equilibrium. This necessary condition requires a firm's profit to be concave in location at the symmetric location. It involves the third derivative of transport cost function, so having convex transport cost in general is neither necessary nor sufficient to determine equilibrium location choice. Our results have implications for studies employing circular models, especially in terms of welfare analysis which depends on firms' location choices.","[Gong, Qiang] Zhongnan Univ Econ & Law, Wenlan Sch Business, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Liu, Qihong] Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA; [Zhang, Yi] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA",Zhongnan University of Economics & Law; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Liu, QH (通讯作者)，Univ Oklahoma, Dept Econ, Norman, OK 73019 USA.",qliu@ou.edu,,"Liu, Qihong/0000-0002-9143-5311",,,,,30,5,5,3,22,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

To help elucidate potential drivers behind such debates, this article builds on social identity theory to develop a theoretical framework linking jurisdictional identification and preferences towards intra-federation redistributive financial flows. We show that federal, rather than local, identification can lead individuals to shift their redistribution preferences against their narrowly-defined personal economic interest. In contrast to predictions of standard models, the sign and strength of this effect depends crucially not only upon individuals' characteristics, but also upon the social groups (i.e. regions) to which they belong. We furthermore illustrate that federal, rather than regional, identification should be more widespread in poorer and/or more populous regions within a federation, but less common in regions which are very homogeneous internally or very dissimilar from the rest of the federation.

I show that when single district elections are used to fill a legislature, we get back to a world where the median voter matters. An extreme policy will generally only come about if it is preferred to a more moderate policy by the median voter in a majority of districts. The mere existence of a centrist party can lead to moderate outcomes even if the party itself wins few seats. I also show that, while some voters in a district will not vote for their nationally preferred party, in many equilibria they will want the candidate for whom they vote to win that district. This is never the case in single district elections. There, some voters always want the candidate they voted for to lose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We analyze data on weekly output, individual characteristics, and coworker composition for all weavers in an urban Chinese textile firm during a 53-week period. The firm adopts relative performance incentives in addition to piece rates to encourage competition in the workplace. We find that social identity has a significant impact on competition: a weaver only competes against coworkers with a different social identity, but not against those sharing her own identity. The results are mainly driven by urban weavers competing aggressively against rural coworkers. Our results highlight the important role of social identity in mitigating or enhancing competition.

The dataset contains 175 countries. The results show that governments in countries with Christian majorities implement stricter anti-trafficking policies than governments in countries with Muslim majorities. The differences between countries with Christian and Muslim majorities are pronounced in dictatorships but less so in democracies. For example, the 3P Anti-Trafficking Policy Index in a dictatorship with no Muslims was by 1.9 points higher than in an otherwise identical but purely Muslim dictatorship (on a scale from 3 to 15). The association between religion and the overall 3P Anti-trafficking Policy Index is driven by protection and prevention policies. As compared to prosecution policies that mainly target the perpetrators of human trafficking, protection and prevention policies mainly protect the victims of human trafficking, i.e. predominantly women. The conclusions are consistent with other empirical findings regarding the association between religion, political institutions, and human development.","[Potrafke, Niklas] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Schackstr 4-1, D-80539 Munich, Germany; [Potrafke, Niklas] Ifo Inst, Ifo Ctr Publ Finance & Polit Econ, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Schackstr 4-1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.;Potrafke, N (通讯作者)，Ifo Inst, Ifo Ctr Publ Finance & Polit Econ, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",potrafke@ifo.de,,,,,,,115,9,9,0,24,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Using a multi-country and multi-industry dataset, the present paper shows that the macroeconomic situation of China's partners has a great influence on the probability of trade frictions arising with China. Moreover, the more powerful the industry is, the more likely it is to take trade remedy actions against China. The empirical results reveal that China has been hurt under the operating mechanism of the WTO, and the number of free trade agreements is negatively related to the initiation and approval of trade remedy actions. Basically, the determinants for countervailing and double remedy measures are identical, while they are different from determinants of antidumping measures. Accordingly, strengthening communication with trade partners will alleviate friction between China and its trade partners. Meanwhile, making use of foreign lobbies' power, actively integrating into the international trading system and participating in regional trade agreements are effective ways for China to deal with the new normal of trade frictions.","[Tian, Xiangyu] Shanxi Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Taiyuan, Peoples R China; [Xie, Shenxiang] Shandong Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Int Econ & Trade, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qi] Bank China, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaosong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Shanxi University Finance & Economics; Shandong University of Finance & Economics; Bank of China; Renmin University of China,"Wang, XS (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",T7668002@163.com; xieshx@sdufe.edu.cn; lucky_qi@yeah.net; xiaosong10@sina.com,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [13XNI006]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473254, 71673280]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [15JGB080]; Youth Talents Project of Beijing Federation of Social Science Circles [2014SKL012]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9122005]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Social Science Foundation; Youth Talents Project of Beijing Federation of Social Science Circles; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),"The study was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (13XNI006), National Natural Science Foundation of China (71473254, 71673280), Beijing Social Science Foundation (15JGB080) and Youth Talents Project of Beijing Federation of Social Science Circles (2014SKL012).

In this paper, we present a detailed review of China's privatisation programmes from its Share Issue Privatisation (SIP) to its Non-tradable Share (NTS) reform. The SIP was a primary offering process with state-owned enterprises (SOEs) issuing new shares to private investors, but after their Initial Public Offering (IPO) approximately two-thirds of the shares remained non-tradable and were mainly held by the government. The SIP achieved only limited success because of its partial trading and partial privatisation, which led to the implementation of the NTS reform in 2005. The NTS reform aimed to dismantle the split share structure and provide opportunities for improving corporate governance and further privatisation. The review shows that the NTS reform has yielded greater success in improving firm performance and corporate governance than the SIP.","[Xie, Feng; Chi, Jing; Liao, Jing] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey, New Zealand",Massey University,"Xie, F (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Massey, New Zealand.",J.Liao@massey.ac.nz,,"Liao, Jing/0000-0003-1968-5794",,,,,71,1,1,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

If advertiser values for ad opportunities are positively correlated, second-price auctions for impressions can be inefficient and expose brand advertisers to adverse selection. Bayesian-optimal auctions have other drawbacks: they are complex, introduce incentives for false-name bidding, and do not resolve adverse selection. We introduce modified second bid auctions as the unique auctions that overcome these disadvantages. When advertiser match values are drawn independently from heavy-tailed distributions, a modified second bid auction captures at least 94.8 percent of the first-best expected value. In that setting and similar ones, the benefits of switching from an ordinary second-price auction to the modified second bid auction may be large, and the cost of defending against shill bidding and adverse selection may be low.","[Arnosti, Nick] Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Beck, Marissa] Charles River Associates Inc, 5335 Coll Ave,Suite 26, Oakland, CA 94618 USA; [Milgrom, Paul] Stanford Univ, 579 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Charles River Associates; Stanford University,"Arnosti, N (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Management Sci & Engn, 475 Via Ortega, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",nicholas.arnosti@gmail.com; mbeck@crai.com; milgrom@stanford.edu,"Arnosti, Nick/AFT-9436-2022; Milgrom, Paul/AAF-3285-2019","Arnosti, Nick/0000-0002-6685-1428; Milgrom, Paul/0000-0002-1919-4138","National Science Foundation [1525730]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1525730] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Paul Milgrom and Marissa Beck were coinventors of the MSB auction design.

This paper proposes a new model of intertemporal choice. In this model, a decision maker cannot increase his/her satisfaction when a larger payoff is split into two smaller payoffs, one of which is slightly delayed in time. The model can rationalize several behavioral regularities such as a greater impatience for immediate outcomes. An application of the model to intertemporal consumption/saving reveals that consumers may exhibit dynamic inconsistency. Initially, they commit to saving for future consumption, but, as time passes, they prefer to renegotiate such a contract for an advance payment. Behavioral characterization (axiomatization) of the model is presented. The model allows for intertemporal wealth, complementarity and substitution effects (utility is not separable across time periods).","[Blavatskyy, Pavlo R.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",Murdoch University,"Blavatskyy, PR (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, 90 South St, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia.",P.Blavatskyy@murdoch.edu.au,,,,,,,36,10,12,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The empirical tests show that gender neutral family migration cannot be rejected against the alternative of husband centered migration. Couples are more likely to migrate if household earnings potential is disproportionally due to one partner, and families react equally strongly to a male and a female relative advantage in educational earnings potential. These results are driven by households with a strong relative advantage to one of the partners while results are less clear for small dissimilarities within the couple, suggesting that gender identity norms may play a role when the opportunity costs of adhering to them are small.

We demonstrate that emission fees entail a negative effect on firms' profits, since they increase unit production costs. However, fees can also produce a positive effect for a relatively inefficient firm, given that environmental regulation mitigates its cost disadvantage. If such a disadvantage is sufficiently large, we show that the positive effect dominates, thus leading this firm to actually favor the introduction of environmental policy, while the relatively efficient firm opposes regulation. Furthermore, we show that such support can originate from polluting companies.","[Munoz-Garcia, Felix] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, 103G Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA; [Akhundjanov, Sherzod B.] Utah State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 4835 Old Main Hill, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Washington State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Muñoz-García, F (通讯作者)，Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, 103G Hulbert Hall, Pullman, WA 99164 USA.",fmunoz@wsu.edu; ahundjanov@gmail.com,,"Munoz-Garcia, Felix/0000-0001-6727-3618",,,,,37,5,5,2,16,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Yet, relatively little is known about the local economic development outcomes induced by successful attraction of new establishments. The empirical challenge lies in correctly identifying the counterfactual outcome. This article tests for induced economic development in winning counties using a set of highly incentivized large plants. The article makes a methodological contribution by comparing difference-in-differences results from a natural experiment ( in which counterfactuals are losers reported by Site Selection magazine) with a geographically proximate matching control by design strategy. Estimates are sensitive to identification strategy, with distributional and placebo tests suggesting geographically proximate matching as preferable to the natural experiment. The preferred estimates indicate successful attraction of a large new plant induces modest increases in new economic activity that does not generate fiscal surplus for winning counties.","[Patrick, Carlianne] Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Patrick, C (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",cpatrick@gsu.edu,"Patrick, Carlianne/S-7410-2019","Patrick, Carlianne/0000-0001-5793-1955",,,,,88,21,25,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0095-2583,1465-7295,,ECON INQ,Econ.

Additionally, we identify changes in the long-term growth trends of these economies in a way similar to that described by Ben-David and Papell (1998) in their study of 74 countries, but now using the panel stationarity test with multiple breaks of Carrion-i-Silvestre et al. (2005). With this in mind, we define twelve different kinds of breaks, defined to compare average growth rate pre-break versus the average growth rate post break. The analysis examined whether the slowdown in member economies of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) occurred before, concurrent with or after the slowdown in the Least Developed Economies (LDE). We also look at some of the causes of the slowdowns and meltdowns in Latin American Economies (LAE), including some that were internal, some external, some common to various economies, and some peculiar to just one.","[Salvador Hernandez-Veleros, Zeus] Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Inst Ciencias Econ Adm, Econ, Pachuca, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Hidalgo,"Hernández-Veleros, ZS (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Estado Hidalgo, Inst Ciencias Econ Adm, Econ, Pachuca, Mexico.",zshveleros@yahoo.com,,,,,,,38,0,0,0,4,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

Subjects interact in groups of three, bargaining over the distribution of payments which occur at regular time intervals. During a given interval, payments occur if and only if a majority is in agreement about their allocation. Aside from these rules, we purposefully impose little structure on the bargaining process. We investigate the frequency and stability of different types of agreements, as well as transitions between them. Two-thirds of payments involve divisions where one player receives nothing, almost half of which are equal splits of the entire surplus between two players. The most stable division is the three-way equal split. Transitions between agreements are frequent and are generally consistent with myopic payoff maximization, in the sense that subjects do not accept short-term losses. We also find that transitions between coalitions are not Markovian. In particular, players more often forgo short-term gains in order to remain in a coalition if it has proven stable in the past.

We identify two basic types of corporate control exercised by the state over enterprises through ownership (in the case of majority ownership) and non-ownership tools (in the case of minority ownership). Consequently, we distinguish between two types of state enterprises: state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and state-controlled enterprises (SCEs). In post-communist economies, SCEs mainly originate from so-called reluctant privatisation, in which the transfer of ownership rights takes place without the appropriate transfer of control rights. We discuss the tools of non-ownership control used by the state. Our estimates of the real share of state enterprises in the Polish economy (which include both SOEs and SCEs) show that it is almost two times higher than the formal share (only SOEs). The share of state enterprises is also highest in the group of Poland's largest and most important firms. We conclude that the real importance of state enterprises in the Polish economy is much higher than might be expected if only the formal share of state ownership is taken into account.","[Baltowski, Maciej] Maria Curie Univ, Dept Theory & Hist Econ, Lublin, Poland; [Kozarzewski, Piotr] Univ Comp Sci & Econ, Dept Econ, Olsztyn, Poland",Maria Curie-Sklodowska University,"Kozarzewski, P (通讯作者)，Univ Comp Sci & Econ, Dept Econ, Olsztyn, Poland.",piotr@kozarzewski.org,"Kozarzewski, Piotr/IAM-3296-2023",,,,,,28,21,21,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,SEP,2016,28.0,3,,,,,405,419,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1196885,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DT2HI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000381301000008,0

Focusing the attention on cooperative banks, we specifically test whether managers take more risks in highly concentrated markets (i.e. monopoly) than in partially competitive markets (i.e. duopoly). The evidence shows that in more concentrated markets, management efficiency generates a decrease in risk-taking (rejecting the bad management hypothesis) with respect to the partially competitive markets. Results are consistent with the idea that banks with less local competition are able to increase their profits by indulging more freely in rent-seeking behaviour, minimizing their risk-taking and, consequently, improving the quality of their assets through additional screening processes. The financial crisis does not seem to affect the conduct of management in terms of bank investment decisions and risk-taking. A series of robustness tests generally confirms our findings.","[Barra, Cristian; Bimonte, Giovanna; Zotti, Roberto] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno,"Barra, C (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Giovanni Paolo II 132, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy.",cbarra@unisa.it,"Barra, Cristian/AAW-2918-2021; Zotti, Roberto/JUU-2335-2023; Bimonte, Giovanna/AFR-4887-2022","Bimonte, Giovanna/0000-0003-0205-2704; Barra, Cristian/0000-0001-8108-3888",,,,,60,7,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The first is that the credit nature of money has macroeconomic significance. The second is that financial development can be bad for economic growth. The third is that macroeconomic models need to be explicitly monetary macroeconomic models. It is argued that in each of these three areas, there has been a recent shift in mainstream economic opinion. This suggests new opportunities for meaningful debate between heterodox and orthodox schools on money and finance. It is further argued, following Skaggs (2003), that a common meeting ground could be an 'accounting view' of economics. This is a mode of macroeconomic analysis which explicitly uses accounting definitions, identities (that credit is also debt, or that flows of a variable affect the stock of that variable) or accounting methods (e.g. decomposing different kinds of liabilities, or linking flows of liquidity to flows of transactions) to structure and direct the analysis. The accounting view is highly pluralist yet clearly defined. I discuss its applications to each of the three views.","[Bezemer, Dirk J.] Univ Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Bezemer, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",d.j.bezemer@rug.nl,,,,,,,114,17,18,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Since its inception, the credit derivatives market has grown to a peak of $64 trillion in 2008 in terms of gross notional values (Cont, ). However, after the onset of the GFC, this market has decreased to a large extent. While there is evidence that promotes the risk reduction properties of CDSs, there is a growing body of research post GFC that identifies destabilising effects of these instruments. In this paper, I review the relevant scholarly literature and provide evidence of how the views on CDSs have changed post GFC due a deeper investigation of issues such as systemic risk, regulatory arbitrage, information asymmetry and risk-taking, among others, in the banking industry. This paper provides a survey of the literature of views for' and against' the use of CDSs during pre and post GFC periods and finally concludes that in comparison to the pre GFC period, post GFC there is a significant increase in the literature that highlights the detrimental nature of CDSs.","[Dias, Roshanthi] Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Swinburne University of Technology,"Dias, R (通讯作者)，Swinburne Univ Technol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",rdias@swin.edu.au,,,,,,,101,2,2,2,24,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

The severity of the departure is quantified by a threshold map , which is monotone with respect to set inclusion. We derive an axiomatic characterization of the model, extending familiar characterizations of rational choice. We classify monotone threshold representations as a special case of Simon's theory of satisficing, but as strictly more general than both Tyson's (2008) expansive satisficing model as well as Fishburn, 1975 and Luce's (1956) model of choice behavior generated by a semiorder.

The agent can shirk, thus never proving the hypothesis, or he can avail himself of a known technology to produce fake successes. This latter option either makes the provision of incentives for honesty impossible or does not distort its costs at all. In the latter case, the principal will optimally commit to rewarding later successes even though he only cares about the first one. Indeed, after an honest success, the agent is more optimistic about his ability to generate further successes. This, in turn, provides incentives for the agent to be honest before a first success.","[Klein, Nicolas] Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada; [Klein, Nicolas] CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Universite de Montreal; Universite de Montreal,"Klein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Montreal, Dept Sci Econ, Montreal, PQ H3C 3J7, Canada.;Klein, N (通讯作者)，CIREQ, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",kleinnic@yahoo.com,,,National Research Fund of Luxembourg; German Research Fund [SFB TR-15]; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,National Research Fund of Luxembourg(Luxembourg National Research Fund); German Research Fund; Fonds de Recherche du Quebec Societe et Culture,"I am most grateful to the editor and to two anonymous referees for their many detailed and helpful comments and suggestions.

In Markov perfect equilibrium, payoffs are almost always unique, and a small advantage in self-control can result in a large advantage in payoff. In subgame-perfect equilibrium, a multiplicity of payoffs and delay can arise, despite the complete information setting. Markov perfect equilibria are the best subgame-perfect equilibria for the agent with more self-control, and the worst for the agent with less self-control.

In markets with the opportunity to violate laws and regulations, producers who are willing to cheat may crowd out more efficient producers who are honest, and buyers who are willing to cheat may crowd out honest buyers with higher willingness to pay.

Honesty reduces cheating, but the output may be less efficiently produced and less efficiently allocated among buyers. I also show that the effect of honesty depends crucially on the fraction of honest traders among both buyers and sellers.

The fact that people tend to choose a lump sum distribution even if economic reasons suggest otherwise is called the annuity puzzle. The results of a large online survey show that people behave in a time inconsistent manner: older people have a stronger tendency to choose the lump sum than younger people. This effect, and therefore, the low real life annuitization can be explained by hyperbolic discounting. The age effect is considerably stronger for participants that answer simple time preference questions inconsistently. Our findings suggest that commitment devices can help to increase annuitization rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Lagged remittances increase physical capital per worker, average years of schooling and total factor productivity, but the effectiveness of remittances varies with the income level of the recipient nation. Although remittances have increased both physical capital and total factor productivity among the upper middle income nations, among the lower middle income, they have increased only the physical capital. Meanwhile a reduction in institutional risk has encouraged investment and efficiency, but its relationship to the effectiveness of remittances has been inconclusive.","[Ssozi, John] Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Dept Econ, Waco, TX 76798 USA; [Asongu, Simplice A.] African Governance & Dev Inst, Res Dept, Yaounde, Cameroon",Baylor University; African Governance & Development Institute,"Ssozi, J (通讯作者)，Baylor Univ, Hankamer Sch Business, Dept Econ, Waco, TX 76798 USA.",John_Ssozi@baylor.edu,"Asongu, Simplice/K-3436-2014",,,,,,46,43,43,0,2,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

The analysis in this study relies on a novel methodological framework that provides consistent productivity measures in the presence of undesirable outputs, while taking into account the technological heterogeneity among different ownership types. The results show that banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) that performed better immediately before the crisis, suffered more during the crisis and early post-crisis periods. Cooperatives and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), on the other hand, were less affected by the crisis. Moreover, results indicate that the pattern of productivity growth of all ownership forms three years after the eruption of the crisis was remarkably similar to their productivity growth pattern in the very early phase of the pre-crisis period.

Focusing on the case of Beijing, we examine the effects of the individual contribution rate, firm contribution rate, life expectancy and population growth rate on the capital-labor ratio, savings, per capita consumption and pension benefits. By controlling the firm contribution rate to adjust the capital-labor ratio of the market economy to the modified golden rule level, we find the optimal firm contribution rate. We also discuss the optimal firm contribution rate in Beijing under three cases: risen life expectancy, fallen population growth rate and the joint case of risen life expectancy and fallen population growth rate, and estimate the optimal firm contribution rate in 2020s. Integrating the established effects and the current economic goals, it is concluded that it will do more good than harm to strictly implement Beijing municipal population policy, improve the living and medical conditions, reduce the firm contribution rate, and raise the individual contribution rate.","[Yang, Zaigui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Yang, Zaigui] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China",Central University of Finance & Economics; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Yang, ZG (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Insurance, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.;Yang, ZG (通讯作者)，Cent Univ Finance & Econ, China Inst Actuarial Sci, 39 South Coll Rd, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",yangzaigui@hotmail.com,,,Beijing Social Science Fund Major Program [15JGA023]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Universities of China Ministry of Education [NCET-11-0755]; Major Program of the Key Research Institute on Humanities and Social Science of China Ministry of Education [10JJD790038],Beijing Social Science Fund Major Program; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Universities of China Ministry of Education(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); Major Program of the Key Research Institute on Humanities and Social Science of China Ministry of Education,"Financial support from the Beijing Social Science Fund Major Program (15JGA023), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in Universities of China Ministry of Education (NCET-11-0755), and the Major Program of the Key Research Institute on Humanities and Social Science of China Ministry of Education (10JJD790038) is gratefully acknowledged.

The scant literature on economic growth in Iran is composed of only a few scholarly studies that investigate this nation's GDP growth. However, none of these studies has examined the causality between GDP growth and its determining elements. The purpose of this study is: (1) to determine the economic variables that contribute to Iran's GDP per capita growth over time, and (2) to examine the causality between foreign direct investment and the relevant variables that are included in the model. To achieve these goals the study uses a model that is based on the postulates of de Mello. The results indicate that: (1) the major determinants of GDP per capita growth in Iran are value added growth and domestic investment growth; (2) there is no causal relationship between foreign direct investment growth and GDP per capita growth in Iran in either direction; and (3) there is no causal relationship between foreign direct investment growth and value added growth in Iran in either direction.","[Asheghian, Parviz] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Econ, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino,"Asheghian, P (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Dept Econ, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",pasheghi@csusb.edu,,,,,,,64,6,6,0,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

We have adopted the recently developed panel data approach for policy evaluation to construct the annual agricultural growth path of Taiwan, which is mainly based on the cross-sectional correlations between the domestic and international agricultural trade markets in the absence of Taiwan's entry into the WTO. Our results have not only revealed the importance of ex post counterfactual analysis, but also provided empirical evidence that the agricultural economic shock is not as severe as predicted by many ex ante studies. Based on these results, we have concluded that the outcome may have arisen from the slow progress of achieving agricultural trade liberalization under the WTO and the Taiwanese Government's effective adoption of phase-in periods and relative adjustment policies.","[Cheng, Chia Yi; Chen, Yu Hui] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Taipei 10764, Taiwan; [Lu, Chen Fu] Agr Policy Res Ctr, Agr Technol Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Lu, CF (通讯作者)，Agr Policy Res Ctr, Agr Technol Res Inst, Taipei, Taiwan.",d98627001@ntu.edu.tw,,,,,,,41,0,1,0,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Various arguments have been put forward to explain this decline, but there is still no consensus on the most plausible explanation. This article contributes to the ongoing discussion by performing inequality decompositions by factor components. We estimate the importance of each source of income in explaining the observed decline in income inequality between 2002 and 2011 in five Latin American countries. Specifically, we explore the role of the process of formalization that has taken place in regional labor markets, separating formal and informal wages and considering self-employment incomes. In the five countries studied here informal wages and self-employment income contributed to decreasing inequality. Formal sector wages, on the other hand, fostered inequality in all countries except Bolivia.","[Amarante, Veronica] Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile",,"Amarante, V (通讯作者)，Comis Econ Amer Latina & Carib, Santiago, Chile.",,,,,,,,31,11,13,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

We use the value of sales (total revenue) as a measure of firm performance in domestic and export markets. The distinguishing feature of this paper is the use of an FDI presence measure that takes the regional dimension into account. The empirical analysis presented in this paper reveals that the presence of FDI leads to a significant positive impact on the domestic sales and export intensity of local firms in both industries. This result is found to be robust to alternative measures of FDI. Based on the result, it is recommended that, in order to maximize the benefits from inward FDI, Chinese policy-makers must encourage domestic and foreign-invested firms to locate in close geographical proximity.","[Anwar, Sajid] Univ Sunshine Coast, Sch Business, Maroochydore, Australia; [Anwar, Sajid] Univ South Australia, Sch Commerce, Adelaide, SA, Australia; [Sun, Sizhong] James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia",University of the Sunshine Coast; University of South Australia; James Cook University,"Sun, SZ (通讯作者)，James Cook Univ, Coll Business Law & Governance, Townsville, Qld, Australia.",Sizhong.sun@jcu.edu.au,"Anwar, Sajid/JBJ-1127-2023; Anwar, Sajid/F-4401-2013","Anwar, Sajid/0000-0001-9087-1309; Sun, Sizhong/0000-0001-8430-915X",University of Sunshine Coast,University of Sunshine Coast,Sajid Anwar is a professor of finance at University of Sunshine Coast.

We consider aggregate energy demand as well as final demand for petroleum, electricity, coal, and natural gas. Our findings suggest the presence of long memory in all of the components of energy demand. All fractional-difference parameters are positive and lower than 0.5 indicating that the series are stationary, although with mean reversion patterns slower than in the typical short-run processes. These results have important implications for the design of energy policies. As a result of the long-memory in final energy demand, the effects of temporary policy shocks will tend to disappear slowly. This means that even transitory shocks have long lasting effects. Given the temporary nature of these effects, however, permanent effects on final energy demand require permanent policies. This is unlike what would be suggested by the more standard, but much more limited, unit root approach, which would incorrectly indicate that even transitory policies would have permanent effects.","[Belbute, Jose Manuel] Univ Evora, CEFAGE, Dept Econ, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Evora, Portugal; [Pereira, Alfredo Marvao] Coll William & Mary, Dept Econ, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",University of Evora; William & Mary,"Belbute, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CEFAGE, Dept Econ, Ctr Adv Studies Management & Econ, Evora, Portugal.",jbelbute@uevora.pt,"Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/P-6256-2019","Belbute, José Manuel Madeira/0000-0001-8738-0592; Belbute, Jose/0000-0002-6877-0218",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; FEDER/COMPETE [UID/ECO/04007/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),"We would like to thank the participants of the 9th Annual Meeting of the Portuguese Economic Journal (Azores, 2015), the Associate Editor and two anonymous journal referees, as well as Rui Pereira for very helpful comments and suggestions.

We argue that this is often the case with agents who visit museums only while on holiday and results from a temporary lack of substitute experience goods or compliance with a must-do list. If such agents behaved according to Stigler and Becker's rational addiction theory, they would also visit museums while at home. However, most do not, which makes them constantly occasional consumers. We indirectly test for the presence of constantly occasional museum attendance by tourists, using data from a survey conducted in 2012 at Vittoriale, the most popular museum at Lake Garda, a renowned Italian tourist destination. By applying multiple correspondence analysis to a question on motivations to visit the museum, we obtain two dimensions of motivation: one based on a search for knowledge and the other based on a more recreational attitude. Identification of the latter is a new finding in itself. We include these dimensions as regressors in a model used to explain museum attendance. We find, as expected, that light consumption negatively affects attendance. We therefore argue that empirical analyses of museum attendance should not disregard light motivation as a possible driver.","[Brida, Juan Gabriel] Free Univ Bolzano Bozen, Piazza Univ 1, I-39100 Bozen Bolzano, Italy; [Nogare, Chiara Dalle] Univ Brescia, Via S Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy; [Scuderi, Raffaele] Univ Enna Kore, Cittadella Univ, I-94100 Enna, Italy",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Brescia; Universita Kore di ENNA,"Scuderi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Enna Kore, Cittadella Univ, I-94100 Enna, Italy.",raffaele.scuderi@unikore.it,"NOGARE, Chiara DALLE/AAM-3311-2021; Brida, Juan Gabriel/H-3727-2015; Nogare, Chiara Dalle/E-8175-2018","NOGARE, Chiara DALLE/0000-0001-9502-0319; Brida, Juan Gabriel/0000-0002-2319-5790; Scuderi, Raffaele/0000-0001-5373-3775","Autonomous Province of Bolzano project, Le attrazioni culturali e naturali come motore dello sviluppo turistico.

Mobile network operators typically commercialize usage-based plans that include an access fee, a usage allowance (number of GB included in the tariff plan), and a penalty system should consumers exceed the contracted allowance. Our empirical model shows that the prices of these plans are lower than those of unlimited contracts, and that they depend on the type of penalty that is used. The prices also reflect service characteristics, including the technology provided, the download speed, and telephone call allowances. Plans that bundle mobile broadband plans with smartphone devices have longer contract duration and may be more expensive than plans that only include a SIM card. Specifically, broadband service plans are priced higher when they include an iPhone or a Samsung smartphone. The paper also discusses the impact of market structure and entry regulation on prices.","[Calzada, Joan] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Martinez-Santos, Fernando] Competit & Markets Author, Dept Polit Econ, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain; [Martinez-Santos, Fernando] Univ Barcelona, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Martínez-Santos, F (通讯作者)，Competit & Markets Author, Dept Polit Econ, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.;Martínez-Santos, F (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Avinguda Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",calzada@ub.edu; fmartinezsantos@hotmail.com,"Calzada, Joan/R-8242-2018","Calzada, Joan/0000-0002-2976-1677","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO/FEDER, UE) [ECO2015-69193R]; Catalan Government [SGR2009-1066]","Spanish Ministry of Economics and Competitiveness (MINECO/FEDER, UE); Catalan Government","We thank two anonymous referees as well as Joan Ramon Borrell, Xavier Fageda, Lukasz Grzybowski, Teodosio Perez-Amaral and Carlos Velasco for their useful comments.

The empirical investigation is conducted in three steps. In the first step, the research is carried out at the national level, and it provides an overall view of the evolution of carbon dioxide emission in China. In step two, the database is divided into smaller spatial groupings so as to investigate the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and geographical location. In the third step, the evolution of carbon dioxide emission in the key cities and in other non-key cities is examined, along with its implications for environmental protection.

It is a first attempt to compare marginal effects of various harmonised competitiveness indicators (HCIs) on both exports and imports of both goods and services across individual euro area countries. We find evidence that HCIs based on broader cost and price measures have a larger marginal effect (with some exceptions) on exports of goods. Exports of services are sensitive to HCIs in big euro area countries and Slovakia, where exports of services are also found more sensitive to competitiveness indicators based on broader price measures. Imports of goods and imports of services are quite insensitive to changes in relative prices. Finally, in some cases measures of fit indicate that a large unexplained residual part is present, implying that other non-price related factors might play an important role in driving foreign trade and policies aimed at enhancing the quality of goods traded are warranted.","[Christodoulopoulou, Styliani] European Cent Bank, Directorate Gen Econ, Sonnemannstr 20, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Tkacevs, Olegs] Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, Kr Valdemara Iela 2a, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia",European Central Bank,"Tkacevs, O (通讯作者)，Bank Latvia, Monetary Policy Dept, Kr Valdemara Iela 2a, LV-1050 Riga, Latvia.",Styliani.Christodoulopoulou@ecb.europa.eu; olegs.tkacevs@bank.lv,,,,,,,33,8,8,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2016,43.0,3,,,,,487,531,,10.1007/s10663-015-9303-5,0.0,,,45,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR9PW,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380229600003,0

However, for economists, this dataset has a number of weaknesses, including poor overlap with a key cultural dataset and reliance on sources of linguistic information of uneven quality. We address these issues by constructing a new linguistic dataset based on an authoritative source of linguistic information, the World Atlas of Language Structures. The resulting dataset has greater overlap with key sources of cultural information, is arguably less subject to selection bias, and provides more refined information regarding key dimensions of linguistic variation. We show that the variables in this dataset are significantly correlated with commonly used measures of individualism and egalitarianism. In addition, we reexamine the key results from the literature on culture and institutions, showing the causal relationship between culture and institutions is robust to the use of the new linguistic instruments.

Our model is based on properties of demand and supply for oil and it is able to reproduce historical real oil prices well. We use the model to estimate and simulate future real oil price scenarios. The results show that if we are not able to significantly increase demand elasticity, the yearly real oil price change can reach 12% in the years following the peak production level without taking a scarcity rent into account. Until peak production level is reached, the long term real oil price changes stemming from fundamental supply and demand changes are expected to be negative. Our simulation results based on an expected peak production year of 2020 and a scarcity rent of 3% suggest an expected real crude oil price of $169/bb1 in 2040. For comparison the EIA outlook predicts a real oil price of $141 /bbl for the same year.

Matching grants can give rise to optimal expenditure levels, but countries can induce bailouts. We study the characteristics of these bailouts in a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and how these characteristics are affected by the introduction of common bonds. Partial substitution of common for sovereign bonds has two implications. First, it lowers the average and marginal borrowing costs of countries which may be eligible for bailouts. This effect leads to higher borrowing in these countries irrespective of their bailout expectations. Second, the lower borrowing costs mitigate the incentives of countries to induce a bailout and, therefore, constrain the parameter set for which a soft budget constraint equilibrium exists. As a result, the introduction of common bonds can also be in the interest of those countries that provide the bailouts.","[Kalamov, Zarko] TU Berlin, Str 17 Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany; [Staal, Klaas] Karlstads Univ, Karlstad Business Sch, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden; [Staal, Klaas] Univ Bonn, IAAK, Bonn, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Karlstad University; University of Bonn,"Staal, K (通讯作者)，Karlstads Univ, Karlstad Business Sch, Univ Gatan 2, S-65188 Karlstad, Sweden.;Staal, K (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, IAAK, Bonn, Germany.",zarko.y.kalamov@tu-berlin.de; klaas.staal@kau.se,,"Kalamov, Zarko/0000-0002-1016-3415",,,,,31,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

The impact on domestic welfare of privatizing the downstream public firm is shown to contain three effects. The first is an output distortion effect, which negatively affects welfare since privatization decreases the production of final good for consumption. The second is an input price lowering effect resulting from a decrease in derived demand for the input. When the level of privatization increases, a decrease in final good production lowers input demand, causing input price to decline and domestic welfare to increase. The third is a rent-leaking effect associated with foreign ownership in the downstream private firm. The rival domestic firm strategically increases its final good production, causing profits accrued to foreign investors to increase and domestic welfare to decline. Without foreign ownership in the downstream private firm, the optimal policy toward the public firm is complete privatization as the output distortion effect is dominated by the input price lowering effect. With foreign ownership, however, complete privatization can never be socially optimal due to the additional negative impact on domestic welfare of the rent-leaking effect. We further discuss implications for domesticwelfare under different privatization schemes (e.g., selling the privatization shares to the upstream foreign monopolist or to the rival domestic firm).","[Wu, Shih-Jye] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Chang, Yang-Ming] Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Chen, Hung-Yi] Soochow Univ, Taipei 11102, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Kansas State University; Soochow University,"Chen, HY (通讯作者)，Soochow Univ, Taipei 11102, Taiwan.",hychen@scu.edu.tw,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology of the Executive Yuan, Taiwan [NSC 100-2410-H-031-027]","Ministry of Science and Technology of the Executive Yuan, Taiwan","We are grateful to co-editor Josh Ederington and two anonymous referees for insightful comments and suggestions, which led to significant improvements in the paper.

The authors first discuss different structural and consistent estimation techniques, their underlying assumptions and their impact on estimated coefficients. They then estimate the gravity model for global bilateral trade flows using various empirical methodologies. They focus on a comparison of the distance and border effects across estimation techniques. For the border effects they take into account adjacency effects as well as the distinction between intra-regional and inter-regional trade. Their findings confirm the significantly negative distance and the significantly positive adjacency effect across estimation methods, although the size of the effects varies substantially across methods. The border effects by global regions are much more sensitive - both in size and direction - to the applied estimation method. Although all estimation methods have their own merits and drawbacks, the authors provide some guidelines for future empirical research based on their findings.","[Magerman, Glenn] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Naamsestr 69,Box 3550, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium; [Studnicka, Zuzanna] ESRI Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Van Hove, Jan] Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); KU Leuven,"Magerman, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven KU Leuven, Naamsestr 69,Box 3550, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",glenn.magerman@kuleuven.be,"Studnicka, Zuzanna/AAN-7189-2020; Magerman, Glenn/AAA-2412-2022","Studnicka, Zuzanna/0000-0002-0821-2636; Magerman, Glenn/0000-0002-9727-3472",Fulbright USA; Methusalem funding at VIVES/KU Leuven; PhD Research Fellowship at KU Leuven; National Bank of Belgium Sponsorship program; Otlet-La Fontaine scholarship; Centre for Irish Studies at KU Leuven; KU Leuven Junior Mobility Program; FWO Flanders [G.0365.10N]; Flemish Government,Fulbright USA; Methusalem funding at VIVES/KU Leuven; PhD Research Fellowship at KU Leuven; National Bank of Belgium Sponsorship program; Otlet-La Fontaine scholarship; Centre for Irish Studies at KU Leuven; KU Leuven Junior Mobility Program; FWO Flanders(FWO); Flemish Government,"The authors would like to thank the Editor, three anonymous referees and Geert Dhaene, Janez Kren, Jan-Pieter Laleman, Sophie Soete and Joris Tielens for various comments and suggestions.

It follows from firms' maximizing behaviour that higher prices in the product market ought to induce more integration. Trade policy provides a source of exogenous price variation to assess this prediction: higher tariffs should lead to higher prices and, therefore, to more integration. We construct firm-level vertical integration indices for a large set of countries and industries and exploit variation in applied most-favoured-nation tariffs to examine the impact of tariffs on firm boundaries. The empirical results provide strong support for the view that higher output prices generate more vertical integration.

The sudden stop is modeled by the use of a highly nonlinear specification that captures credit constraints in a convenient way. The advantage of this approach is that the effects of the shock become highly conditional on the external debt position of the economy. A two-sector model with money-in-the-utility is adopted, thereby making it possible to study sectoral asymmetries in the adjustment process, and also the role of currency mismatch. The model is calibrated to the behavior of the Hungarian economy in the 2000s, and its crisis experience in 2008-11 in particular. Four counterfactuals are calculated: two with different exchange rate policies (a more flexible float and a perfect peg), and both of these policy regimes with smaller initial indebtedness. Overall, the model is able to fit the movements of key aggregate and sectoral macroeconomic variables after the crisis by producing a large and protracted deleveraging process. It also offers a meaningful quantification of the policy tradeoff between facilitating the real adjustment by letting the currency depreciate and protecting consumption expenditures by limiting the adverse effect of exchange rate movements on household balance sheets.","[Benczur, Peter] European Commiss, JRC, Ispra, Italy; [Konya, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary; [Konya, Istvan] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC ISPRA Site; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Central European University,"Konya, I (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Budaorsi Ut 45, H-1112 Budapest, Hungary.",konyai@ceu.hu,,"Benczur, Peter/0000-0003-4054-1541",,,,,28,1,2,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

First, we investigate the productivity ordering with respect to three international linkages; importing, exporting and investing abroad. Second, we explore whether differences in the productivity ordering across industries correlates with industry and country characteristics. Our findings support a general productivity hierarchy from importing to exporting and from exporting to investing abroad, as well as from a low to a high number of linkages (measuring the complexity of firms' international linkages). However, an industry-by-industry examination shows that the hierarchical structure is only generally upheld when it comes to the number of international linkages, while the ordering of import, export and investment linkages does not exhibit the same regularity across industries. Extending the analysis, we find that the lack of a hierarchical structure is more likely in industries focusing on larger and less distant markets.","[Gullstrand, Joakim; Olofsdotter, Karin] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, Box 7082, S-22007 Lund, Sweden; [Thede, Susanna] Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida 2080, Malta",Lund University; University of Malta,"Thede, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malta, Inst European Studies, Msida 2080, Malta.",Joakim.Gullstrand@nek.lu.se; Karin.Olofsdotter@nek.lu.se; Susanna.Thede@um.edu.mt,,,Jan.

In the literature, this rigidity is usually interpreted to reflect a cost of adjusting prices. This article shows that price rigidity can alternatively reflect optimal price setting when there are no adjustment costs, namely, if the seller is rationally inattentive. The model generates non-trivial pricing patterns that are consistent with the data and that are hard to explain with the traditional adjustment-cost model. In particular, prices are adjusted frequently but move back and forth between a few given values, hazard functions are downward sloping, and responses to persistent shocks are sluggish. These results are obtained in a model that implements rational inattention without simplifying assumptions on the functional forms of the processed signals.","[Matejka, Filip] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague,"Matejka, F (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",,"Matejka, Filip/H-2898-2014",,GACR [P402/11/P236]; CERGE-EI Foundation,GACR(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); CERGE-EI Foundation,"This research was funded by GACR grant P402/11/P236 and the CERGE-EI Foundation.

These facts also hold for a cross-section of E.U. countries. I develop a life-cycle model that explicitly accounts for this age-dependent relationship by including various types of nonpaid and paid child care. I calibrate this model to data for West Germany and use the calibrated model for policy analysis. Increasing the supply of subsidized child care for children aged zero to two generates an increase in the maternal labor force participation rate consistent with empirical evidence from other settings; however, this increase is too small to conclude that the lack of subsidized child care accounts for the low labor force participation rate of mothers with children aged zero to two. The response along the intensive margin suggests that a large fraction of part-time working mothers would work full-time if they had greater access to subsidized child care. Finally, making subsidized child care available to more women does not achieve one of the commonly stated goals of such reforms, namely to increase the fertility rate.","[Bick, Alexander] Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Bick, A (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Tempe, AZ 85287 USA.",alexander.bick@asu.edu,"Bick, Alexander G/A-9429-2012",,Cluster of Excellence Normative Orders at Goethe University Frankfurt; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD),Cluster of Excellence Normative Orders at Goethe University Frankfurt; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"I am indebted to Dirk Krueger for his guidance and advice at all stages of this project.

Empirical results indicate that, between 2005 and 2010, improving emission intensity and input intensity had helped to reduce CO2 emissions; meanwhile, capital investment explained the majority of the increases in CO2 emissions brought about by final demand, and import substitution was also observed to increase CO2 emissions.

Using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), we show that a worker with health coverage misses on average 76.54% fewer workdays than uninsured workers, after controlling for endogeneity. We develop a model that embodies this impact of health coverage in productivity. In our model, health insurance reduces the probability that a healthy worker gets sick, missing workdays, and it increases the probability that a sick worker recovers and returns to work. In our model, firms that offer health insurance are larger and pay higher wages in equilibrium, a pattern observed in the data. We calibrated the model using US data for 2004 and show the impact of increases in health costs, as well as of changes in tax benefits of health insurance expenses, on labor force health coverage and productivity.

A substantial share of participants has expectations consistent with the Fisher equation, followed by the Taylor rule and the Phillips curve. We show that having theory-consistent expectations is beneficial, as it improves the forecast accuracy. Furthermore, consistency is time varying.

While it is no surprise that the unique efficient network is the complete graph, it is interesting that any pairwise stable network features low average degree and almost 2-regular structures, even under individual risk heterogeneity, and it tends to exhibit positive assortativity in terms of risk variances.

This article examines the impact of that reform on the capital structure decisions of firms by applying a variety of trade-off and pecking-order models. Using data from 1176 non-financial Chinese listed firms during the period 2000-2012, we present empirical evidence indicating that equity tracks the financing deficit better than debt in Chinese firms, a finding which is not consistent with pecking-order theory. This phenomenon is more prominent after 2006 as share reform increases trading activity in the secondary stock market and improves the transparency of financial markets. In addition, Chinese firms have an optimal leverage ratio and they adjust below-target leverage ratios faster than above-target leverage ratios after the implementation of share structure reform, although they make symmetric adjustments towards the target leverage ratio before 2007. Finally, recent share reform has prompted Chinese firms to more quickly address the divergence of actual leverage ratios from long-term target levels, but has slowed their response to short-term target leverage divergence.","[Guo, Liang] Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Dept Accounting & Finance, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA; [Dai, Ya] United Serv Automobile Assoc, San Antonio, TX USA; [Lien, Donald] Univ Texas San Antonio, Coll Business, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX USA",California State University System; California State University San Bernardino; University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Guo, L (通讯作者)，Calif State Univ San Bernardino, Coll Business & Publ Adm, Dept Accounting & Finance, San Bernardino, CA 92407 USA.",lguo@csusb.edu,,"Dai, Ya/0000-0002-4364-7053",,,,,41,14,14,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Since the year 2000, coal has provided roughly 40 per cent of global primary energy growth. The success of coal in the primary energy mix is due to the fact that it is abundant, cheap, and most often a domestic resource. However, global coal reserves, if burnt, would surpass the remaining carbon budget for a 2A degrees C target by a factor of two. The paper shows that a carbon price of 25-100 USD per tonne of CO2 would be needed to phase out coal in the power sector, depending on the technology and the world region, even when assuming significant technological progress.","[Hecking, Harald] Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, EWI, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Hecking, H (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Inst Energy Econ, EWI, Cologne, Germany.",harald.hecking@ewi.uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,36,5,6,1,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The model estimation is achieved by representing the original model just with current and lagged observable variables. Such representation is accomplished through recursive substitution of unobservable variables with lagged observable variables. The consistent estimation of model parameters is facilitated by the classical minimum distance estimation that uses lagged variables as instruments. Conventional dynamic analyses, which include forecasting with the VAR model, are possible after model estimation. The proposed method differs from other approaches in three aspects. First, unlike a Bayesian approach, the proposed classical method does not require any specific prior distribution of coefficients. Second, an explicit identification condition is suggested for the model. Finally, the proposed method can estimate the error variance consistently, which is critical for dynamic analyses.","[Kim, Yun-Yeong] Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, 152 Jukjeon Ro, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Dankook University,"Kim, YY (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Int Trade, 152 Jukjeon Ro, Yongin 16890, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",yunyeongkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,24,0,0,1,5,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

It considers three state systems: non-statehood, authoritarian statehood, and democratic statehood. These differ in the way a public good is provided, which in turn determines growth rates. Under certain assumptions, democratic states grow faster than authoritarian ones, which in turn grow faster than non-states. All societies start with non-statehood and transition into authoritarian statehood at some point, but the timing is random. When later given the opportunity, only those societies that transitioned relatively recently to authoritarian statehood transition to democracy. When they do, they begin to grow faster, eventually overtaking older and still authoritarian states.

The mainstream of the literature has produced a wide range of studies that are largely within the theoretical framework of neoclassical economics, and they tend to conclude that FDI has contributed significantly to Chinese economic development through capital formation, export expansion, technology transfer, and the transformation of the economic structures and institutions. The objective of this paper is to assess the role of FDI in Chinese economic development with reference to the broader theoretical literature on FDI and late development, which encompasses structuralism and radical political economy along with neoclassical economics. From the perspectives of the broader literature, the analyses of the paper find that FDI in China has indeed promoted economic development in one respect (improving allocative efficiency), but has also had unfavourable effect in another respect (worsening productive efficiency), resulting in an overall impact that tends to be on the negative side. The mainstream story of China is thus judged to be partial, and the lessons to be drawn from the experience are arguably far more complex than have been hitherto perceived. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It implies that the long-term climate change mitigation challenge should be reframed as a stock problem, while the overwhelming majority of climate policies continue to focus on the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere in 2030 or 2050. An obstacle, however, to the use of a cumulative carbon budget in policy is uncertainty in the size of this budget consistent with any specific temperature-based goal such as limiting warming to 2A degrees C. This arises from uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 emissions, which is relatively tractable, and uncertainty in future warming due to non-CO2 drivers, which is less so. We argue these uncertainties are best addressed through policies that recognize the need to reduce net global CO2 emissions to zero to stabilize global temperatures but adapt automatically to evolving climate change. Adaptive policies would fit well within the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.","[Millar, Richard] Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Allen, Myles] Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Rogelj, Joeri] Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Vienna, Austria; [Friedlingstein, Pierre] Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA); University of Exeter,"Millar, R (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Phys, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.;Allen, M (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Sch Geog & Environm, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.;Rogelj, J (通讯作者)，Int Inst Appl Syst Anal, Vienna, Austria.;Friedlingstein, P (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Exeter EX4 4QJ, Devon, England.",richard.millar@physics.ox.ac.uk; myles.allen@ouce.ox.ac.uk; rogelj@iiasa.ac.at; p.friedlingstein@exeter.ac.uk,"Friedlingstein, Pierre/H-2700-2014; Rogelj, Joeri/I-7108-2012","Friedlingstein, Pierre/0000-0003-3309-4739; Rogelj, Joeri/0000-0003-2056-9061",Natural Environment Research Council [NE/I00680X/1] Funding Source: researchfish; NERC [NE/I00680X/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Natural Environment Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)); NERC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)),,,64,37,37,1,43,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

We study the interaction between these sunk costs and R&D spillovers relying on the Sutton's concept of endogenous sunk costs and show that with spillovers increasing and the effectiveness of investment in raising quality decreasing, the lower bound on concentration for an industry decreases and ultimately collapses to zero when spillovers are large enough and/or effectiveness of investment is low enough. We also show that for an intermediate range of spillovers firms do invest in R&D although the market structure becomes fragmented as market size grows (no lower bound). In the second part, we allow firms to protect their investment against spillovers and focus on the symmetric equilibria, where all firms either protect their investment or do not protect at all. We show that higher spillovers and/or lower effectiveness of investment may induce firms to protect themselves against spillovers, leading to higher investment in quality, and to more concentrated market structure. Thus, the Sutton's result on the concentration bound is preserved. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It has also been promoting greener policies for growth, of which green consumerism is a prime component. By examining the economy through the lens of household energy consumption, this paper lays out the challenges the nation must overcome through green consumption. We explore the trends in household energy use and decompose energy used indirectly by households into six factors: changes in total population, urbanization rate, energy efficiency, interindustry input mix, household consumption preferences, and per capita household consumption level. Doing so yields insights into how progress in industrial technology, household income, urbanization, and lifestyles has affected energy use in the production of goods and services used by households. It also offers policy suggestions on how China might guide lifestyle changes to effect green consumption.","[Zhang, Haiyan; Bi, Jun] Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Sch Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Haiyan] Nanjing Univ, Johns Hopkins Univ, Ctr Chinese & Amer Studies, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lahr, Michael L.] Rutgers State Univ, Bloustein Sch Planning & Publ Policy, New Brunswick, NJ 08903 USA",Nanjing University; Nanjing University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Bi, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ, State Key Lab Pollut Control & Resource Reuse, Sch Environm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jbi@nju.edu.cn,"Lahr, Michael/R-2510-2019; Lahr, Michael/HSD-9061-2023; Zhang, Haiyan/GMW-7284-2022","Lahr, Michael/0000-0002-2602-2465;","National Science Foundation of China [71433007, 71403118]; Clean Development Mechanism Project of China's National Development and Reform Commission [2013056]",National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Clean Development Mechanism Project of China's National Development and Reform Commission,This research was supported by the National Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 71433007 and 71403118] and the Clean Development Mechanism Project of China's National Development and Reform Commission [grant number 2013056].,,45,26,26,4,98,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Since then, fuelled by its rich natural resources, the country has grown steadily. The MPLA military forces were a central factor behind independence and maintain their central role to this day. Moreover, Angola's support for African peace with monitoring military missions is a clear indication that the country aims to intervene in African security and military issues, with its military capabilities funded by oil revenues.","[Barros, Carlos Pestana] Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ & Gestao, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Barros, CP (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Inst Super Econ & Gestao, Rua Miguel Lupi 20, P-1249078 Lisbon, Portugal.",cbarros@iseg.ULisboa.pt,,,,,,,33,2,2,0,12,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Colleges have fixed budgets and strict preferences over sets of students. One different feature of our model is that colleges value money only to the extent that it allows them to enroll better or additional students. A student can attend at most one college and receive a stipend from it. Each student has preferences over college-stipend bundles. Conditions that are essential for most of the results in the literature fail in the presence of budget constraints. We define pairwise stability and show that a pairwise stable allocation always exists. We construct an algorithm that always selects a pairwise stable allocation. The rule defined through this algorithm is incentive compatible for students: no student should benefit from misrepresenting his preferences. Finally, we show that no incentive compatible rule selects a Pareto-undominated pairwise stable allocation.","[Abizada, Azar] ADA Univ, Sch Business, Baki, Azerbaijan",Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; ADA University,"Abizada, A (通讯作者)，ADA Univ, Sch Business, Baki, Azerbaijan.",aabizada@ada.edu.az,,,,,,,23,21,22,0,11,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1555-7561,,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We explore information structures that differ with respect to what is commonly known about the weight that agents attach to reciprocal kindness. When the designer has no information on reciprocity types, implementability of an incentive compatible social choice function is guaranteed if it satisfies an additional insurance property. By contrast, precise information on reciprocity types may imply that all efficient social choice functions are implementable. We show how these results extend to a two-dimensional mechanism design setting where the agents have private information about their material payoff types and their reciprocity types. We also provide a systematic account of the welfare implications of intentionality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An endogenous fraction of agents hold rational expectations and the remaining agents employ an adaptive learning rule similar to Evans and Honkapohja (2001) and Brock and Hommes (1997). Three primary results follow from the finding that heterogeneous beliefs can destabilize a stationary monetary equilibrium and lead to non-linear dynamics bounded around the monetary steady state. First, heterogeneous beliefs can lead to equilibria that are welfare reducing due, in part, to a lower acceptance rate in decentralized meetings. Second, when buyers, who are uncertain about their beliefs, behave like Bayesians by placing a prior on sellers' beliefs, uncertainty impacts dynamic stability and welfare. Third, the model's unique predictions provide an explanation of new findings about the acceptance rate in monetary laboratory experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using uniquely detailed ownership data from Thailand, we find that the controlling shareholders extensively use pyramids to control banks and finance companies and assign different lending strategies across pyramidal tiers. Lower-tier banks tend to extend loans more aggressively and perform more poorly, while upper tier banks carry out more profitable investments. After the crisis hit, upper-tier banks survived and almost all lower-tier banks went bankrupt. Our results suggest that the multilayer organizational structure of bank ownership can affect a bank's lending behavior and its resistance to economic shocks.

The impact and desirability of such policies depend on the distribution of search costs. In this paper, we provide an equilibrium framework for identifying the distribution of search costs and we apply it to the Dutch labor market. In our model, the wage distribution, job search intensities, and firm entry are simultaneously determined in market equilibrium. Given the distribution of search intensities (which we directly observe), we calibrate the search cost distribution and the flow value of non-market time; these values are then used to derive the socially optimal firm entry rates and distribution of job search intensities. From a social point of view, some unemployed workers search too little due to a hold-up problem, while other unemployed workers search too much due to coordination frictions and rent-seeking behavior. Our results indicate that jointly increasing unemployment benefits and the sanctions for unemployed workers who do not search at all can be welfare-improving. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One such hidden socio-economic factor is alcohol consumption and some studies argue that there is a link between alcohol consumption and poverty. The main aim of this study is to measure the effects of alcohol consumption on the level of poverty in a systematic way. Using Sri Lanka as a case study, this article demonstrates that the consumption of various types of alcoholic beverages, particularly, the illegal beverages, has a significant positive association with the level of poverty. The findings of this study suggest that, in Sri Lanka, the consumption of illegal alcoholic beverages increases the likelihood of being in a poor household by 2-3%. The results of this study also find that households who are characterized as nonpoor but are just above the poverty line behave more like the poor rather than the nonpoor in terms of alcohol consumption. Some of the conclusions from this Sri Lankan case study can be applied to other developing countries.","[Jayathilaka, Ruwan; Selvanathan, Saroja; Bandaralage, Jayatilleke S.] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Econ & Business Stat Discipline, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Selvanathan, S (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Econ & Business Stat Discipline, Nathan, Qld 4111, Australia.",s.selvanathan@griffith.edu.au,"Jayathilaka, Ruwan/AAM-9667-2020","Jayathilaka, Ruwan/0000-0002-7679-4164; Selvanathan, Saroja/0000-0002-4129-1727",,,,,24,10,10,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

By incorporating all these features, we develop new insights into how taxes affect life-cycle labour supply. For instance, we find that labour supply elasticities vary in important ways with age, education and the tax structure itself.

The specificity of our approach is that second order beliefs are manipulated exogenously just by changing the parameters of the experimental game. In particular, we consider a simple communication game where the sender is perfectly informed about his material benefit from lying to the receiver. At the same time, the receiver knows only the ex-ante distribution of the sender's material incentives. By changing this distribution between the experimental treatments, we achieve an exogenous variation in the receiver's payoff expectations (and hence in the corresponding sender's second-order beliefs) while keeping the sender's actual material incentives fixed. The results show that the rate of lying is significantly lower when the receiver is supposed to have higher payoff expectations, however only in the case when the monetary incentives for lying are fixed at a moderate level.

We use the cultural diversity of immigrants in European countries to isolate the effect of culture from the confounding effect of the economic and institutional environment. Results suggest that culture is a significant determinant of migrants' individual environmental preferences and attitudes. Migrants from countries with higher levels of environmental preferences are more willing to trade off income for environmental quality when controlling for individual characteristics, country of residence, and country of origin macroeconomic and environmental conditions. Furthermore, culture significantly influences individual beliefs about limits to growth, the fragility of the balance of nature, and the likelihood of an ecological crisis. The result is robust to alternative definitions of the cultural proxy and points to the significance of accounting for cultural influences in the design of domestic and international environmental policy and the application of environmental valuation techniques.","[Kountouris, Yiannis] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, 14 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England; [Remoundou, Kyriaki] Aberystwyth Univ, Sch Business & Management, Aberystwyth SY23 3AL, Dyfed, Wales",Imperial College London; Aberystwyth University,"Kountouris, Y (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Environm Policy, 14 Princes Gardens, London SW7 1NA, England.",i.kountouris@imperial.ac.uk; kyr2@aber.ac.uk,"Koundouri, Phoebe/AAI-2160-2021","Koundouri, Phoebe/0000-0001-5979-6128",,,,,58,17,17,0,28,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,MAY,2016,69.0,2,,,,,369,397,,10.1111/kykl.12114,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK1VI,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374702600007,0

However, both the models and existing empirical work typically examine behavior in the cross section. To date, we know little about the dynamic aspects of family transfers. Here I examine transfers over a span of 17 years and find substantial changes in recipiency over time and a strong negative correlation between transfers and transitory income. I also find that events such as job loss and divorce are strong predictors of parental transfers and, although rare, are typically associated with larger transfers than income alone might predict. Finally, transfers are distributed unequally across siblings, and perhaps surprisingly, the distribution of transfers becomes even more unequal when examined over an extended period of time than in any single year. The evidence presented here thus suggests that dynamic analyses can provide insights into behavior that are impossible to obtain in a static context. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using instruments to address the endogeneity of commute decisions and a dataset of U.S. military commuters on 100 military bases over the period 2006-2013, we show that workplace peers positively influence one another's decisions to drive alone to work and carpool to work. All else equal, an increase in the fraction of peers who drive alone of 10 percentage points increases the probability of driving alone by 6.05 percentage points. An increase in the fraction of peers who carpool of 10 percentage points increases the probability of carpooling by 5.14 percentage points. To examine whether conventional measures of social status and seniority predict who exerts the strongest influence on others, we disaggregate the dataset into subgroups and identify which subgroups have the greatest influence and which are most susceptible to influence. Results show that in commute decisions, intra-group influence can be more important than inter-group influence. This suggests that workplace travel interventions that seek to shift employees away from driving alone or toward carpooling may be most effective if communicated by one's own peer group.

An example of this sorting by quality'' is the use of down payments to dissuade borrowers who are unlikely to repay. We study a model in which consumers have multidimensional types and a firm offers a single product of endogenous quality, as in Spence (1975). These two ingredients generate a novel sorting incentive in a firm's first-order condition for quality, which is a simple ratio. The denominator is marginal consumer surplus, a measure of market power. The numerator is the covariance, among marginal consumers, between marginal willingness to pay for quality and cost to the firm. We provide conditions under which this term is signed and contrast the sorting incentives of a profit-maximizer and a social planner. We then use this characterization to quantify the importance of sorting empirically in subprime auto lending, analytically sign its impact in a model of add-on pricing, and calibrate optimal competition policy in health insurance markets.","[Veiga, Andre] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; Microsoft Res, Cambridge, MA USA; Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",University of Oxford; Microsoft; Yale University,"Veiga, A (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",,,"Veiga, Andre/0000-0001-6839-8877",NET Institute; research program on intellectual property at the Institut d'Economie Industrielle (IDEI); Marion Ewing Kauffman Foundation; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT),NET Institute; research program on intellectual property at the Institut d'Economie Industrielle (IDEI); Marion Ewing Kauffman Foundation; Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This article replaces earlier working papers titled Multidimensional Heterogeneity and Platform Design and Multidimensional Product Design and incorporates some material from The Leibniz Rule for Multidimensional Heterogeneity.

We find that introducing flexible pension take-up can induce a Pareto improvement when the initial pension scheme contains within-cohort redistribution and induces early retirement. Such a Pareto improving reform entails the application of uniform actuarial adjustment of pension entitlements based on average lifespan.

We construct rich human capital series, where data for employees are decomposed according to their education level. In addition, we take into account possible effects due to education quality and spillovers. Our evidence shows that human capital has a strong positive association with labor productivity through upper secondary and tertiary education, while primary education exhibits a negative relationship and lower secondary education does not exhibit any association with productivity. Tertiary education spillovers along with a number of education quality indicators present a significant positive relationship with productivity. Overall, findings suggest that policy makers should account for education quality as well as spillovers and direct their efforts toward a more efficient and enhanced education system with emphasis on high education levels to improve labor productivity overall and reduce spatial productivity disparities.

Moreover, we show that if prices can be conditioned on the supply size then a dynamic competitive equilibrium always exists, while it fails to exist if prices cannot be conditioned on the supply size and the frequency of exchanges is high enough.

Information asymmetry raises the marginal cost of inducing effort, which decreases efforts and increases prices. Since all firms' prices increase, this leads to a change in the expected demand of each firm, and thus in the marginal benefit of inducing effort, which may amplify or mitigate the initial impact. As a consequence, information asymmetry may induce some firms to increase efforts and lower prices. More surprisingly, it may increase both ex post and ex ante social welfare.","[Brito, Duarte] Univ Nova Lisboa, DCSA, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-2829516 Quinta Da Torre, Caparica, Portugal; [Pereira, Pedro] AdC, Ave Berna 19,7, P-1050037 Lisbon, Portugal; [Vareda, Joao] Commiss European Communities, DG Competit, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Brito, Duarte; Pereira, Pedro; Vareda, Joao] Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE, Palacio Vimioso Gab 224,Largo Marques Marialva 8, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; University of Evora,"Brito, D (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, DCSA, Fac Ciencias & Tecnol, P-2829516 Quinta Da Torre, Caparica, Portugal.;Brito, D (通讯作者)，Univ Evora, CEFAGE UE, Palacio Vimioso Gab 224,Largo Marques Marialva 8, P-7000809 Evora, Portugal.",dmb@fct.unl.pt; pedro.br.pereira@gmail.com; joaovareda@hotmail.com,"Brito, Duarte/B-9620-2009; Pereira, Pedro/GNN-0031-2022","Brito, Duarte/0000-0003-2971-9572; Pereira, Pedro/0000-0002-9036-0354; Vareda, Joao/0000-0001-8803-0447",Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia; FEDER/COMPETE [UID/ECO/04007/2013],Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); FEDER/COMPETE(European Union (EU)),"The opinions expressed in this article reflect only the authors' views, and in no way bind the institutions to which they are affiliated.

The economy comprises two separate sectors, final output and R&D, both directly or indirectly dependent on the natural resource. Because the resource is exhaustible and it is an essential productive input, increasing returns to scale to manmade inputs are compatible with nonexplosive sustained growth. The instability problem usually associated with increasing returns is overcome thanks to the existence of imperfect markets in a decentralized economy. We find an admissible range of values for the elasticity of capital in the R&D sector under which growth is fully endogenous and saddlepath stable, with no need of exogenous population growth.","[Cabo, Francisco; Martin-Herran, Guiomar] Univ Valladolid, IMUVA, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain; [Pilar Martinez-Garcia, Maria] Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",Universidad de Valladolid; University of Murcia,"Martín-Herrán, G (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Aplicada Matemat, Ave Valle Esgueva 6, Valladolid 47011, Spain.",guiomar@eco.uva.es,"Martínez-García, María Pilar/K-7693-2014; Cabo, Francisco/J-9102-2014; Martin-Herran, Guiomar/J-5442-2014","Martínez-García, María Pilar/0000-0003-2845-9799; Cabo, Francisco/0000-0003-2958-9595; Martin-Herran, Guiomar/0000-0002-9161-2349","MEC [ECO2008-01551, ECO2011-24352]; FEDER funds; COST Action [IS1104]",MEC; FEDER funds(European Union (EU)); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"We thank an anonymous reviewer for his/her helpful comments.

We find that one-fifth of the gender gap results from the segregation of workers across firms, and another one-fifth results from job segregation. We also conclude that the 'glass ceiling effect' operates mainly through worker allocation to firms rather than occupations. Our results are based on the application of Gelbach's decomposition method to the conditional wage gap obtained from a wage equation with high-dimensional fixed effects. This approach may prove to be equally useful in applications to other problems in economics.","[Cardoso, Ana Rute; Portugal, Pedro] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal; [Cardoso, Ana Rute] Inst Econ Anal CSIC, Madrid, Spain; [Cardoso, Ana Rute] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [Guimaraes, Paulo] Banco Portugal, Praca da Liberdade 92, P-4000322 Oporto, Portugal; [Portugal, Pedro] Banco Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal",Banco de Portugal; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Institut d'Analisi Economica (IAE); Barcelona School of Economics; Banco de Portugal; Banco de Portugal,"Guimaraes, P (通讯作者)，Banco Portugal, Praca da Liberdade 92, P-4000322 Oporto, Portugal.",pfguimaraes@bportugal.pt,"Portugal, Pedro/B-2506-2014; Guimaraes, Paulo D/A-7085-2008; Portugal, Pedro/M-7216-2019; Cardoso, Ana Rute/B-5888-2009","Portugal, Pedro/0000-0001-8298-6683; Guimaraes, Paulo D/0000-0002-2992-1028; Portugal, Pedro/0000-0001-8298-6683; Cardoso, Ana Rute/0000-0002-6168-8959",Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness [CO2012-38460]; Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD [SEV-2011-0075]; Research Council of Norway [227072/F10],Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in RD; Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of the Economy and Competitiveness (CO2012-38460 to A.C.), the Severo Ochoa Programme for Centres of Excellence in R&D (SEV-2011-0075 to A.C.), and the Research Council of Norway (Europe in Transition funding scheme project 227072/F10 at ESOP to A.C.).",,41,18,26,0,40,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

J,"Driffill, J",,,,"Driffill, John",,,Unconventional Monetary Policy in the Euro Zone,OPEN ECONOMIES REVIEW,,,English,Review,,,,,,Quantitative easing; Unconventional monetary policy; Euro zone; Financial crisis; European Central Bank,,"The European Central Bank adopted a policy of quantitative easing early in 2015, long after the US and UK, and after implementing a succession of measures to increase liquidity in the Euro zone financial markets, none of which proved sufficient eventually. The paper draws out lessons for the Euro zone from US and UK experience. Numerous event studies have been undertaken to uncover the effects of QE on yields on and prices of financial assets. Estimated effects on long-term government bond yields are then converted into the size of the cut in the policy rate that would normally have been needed to produce them. From these implicit cuts in policy rates, estimates of the effect on GDP and inflation are generated. Euro zone QE appears to have had a much smaller effect on bond yields for the core members states than did QE in the US or UK. Therefore its effects on output and inflation are likely to be proportionately smaller. Its effects on long-term government bond yields in periphery members are greater. QE is compressing interest differential among Euro zone member states. The dangers of QE to which various commentators draw attention, that it creates a danger of inflation in the future, that it creates asset price bubbles, that it allows zombie firms and banks to survive, slowing down the process of adjustment, seem remote. Meanwhile it makes a useful contribution to cutting the costs of debt service and allowing member states more fiscal room for maneouvre.","[Driffill, John] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London, England",University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Driffill, J (通讯作者)，Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, London, England.",j.driffill@bbk.ac.uk,,,,,,,13,13,18,4,44,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

Our analysis delivers the following results. First, we demonstrate that transparency about the committee's future composition is typically harmful. Second, we show that short terms for central bankers lead to effective inflation stabilization at the expense of comparably high output variability. Third, larger committees generally allow for more efficient stabilization of inflation but possibly for less efficient output stabilization. Fourth, large committees and short terms are therefore socially desirable if the weight on output stabilization in the social loss function is low.

Using a unique longitudinal, multi-level survey, the Gansu Survey of Children and Families (GSCF) which was enrolled in the Gansu province, I use a quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) and find that more than 1 h of child labour in the previous time period has a negative effect on a child's academic achievement in the subsequent period after controlling for child talent. I also show that previous academic achievement has no strong significant effect on current child labour by applying a logistic model. Based on the data, the fact that those effects are not very big or not significant suggests that child labour in China is not a big problem when compared with other developing countries (Bacolod & Ranjan 2008).

We investigate a range of these behaviors, including nonrational herding, auction fever, quasi-endowment effect, and escalation of commitment. Our innovations are to more completely control for unobservables by using new data from a field experiment on eBay, and by accounting for censoring of bids below the starting price. Consistent with standard auction theory and in contrast to the predictions of the nonstandard behaviors, we find that auction starting price has no effect on bidder willingness to pay in a private-values setting.

The main objective of this paper is to make the initial attempt to study the extent to which the Malaysian Shari'ah (Islamic) investors can benefit from portfolio diversification with the Shari'ah indices of their major trading partners (China, Singapore, Japan, United States and Thailand). The relevant time-varying and timescale-dependent techniques such as, Multivariate GARCH-dynamic conditional correlation, the continuous wavelet transform and the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform are applied. Findings tend to indicate that the Malaysian Shari'ah investors who make their investments with the major trading partners like China and Singapore may not reap great diversification benefits for almost all investment horizons but may reap moderate benefits arising from Thailand and Japan up to the investment horizons of 32-64 days and longer. The evidence further suggests that the portfolio diversification benefits are greater if the Malaysian Shari'ah investors invest in the US Shari'ah stock index excepting the long investment horizons. The stock holding periods exceeding 32 to 64 days contain minimal benefits of portfolio diversification. As a policy implication, the Malaysian Shari'ah investors should carry out the reassessment of their stock exposures and investment horizons more frequently in order to gain from portfolio diversification with their trading partners.

The main result of this paper is that the accuracy of model based nowcasts is comparable to that of the nowcasts of the Czech National Bank (CNB). Moreover, combining the DFM and the CNB nowcasts results in more accurate performance than in the case of the individual nowcasts alone. Our results also suggest that foreign variables are crucial for the accuracy of the model, while omitting financial and confidence indicators does not worsen the nowcasting performance.

It investigates whether deregulation has impacted the pattern of allocative efficiency of banks and explores which bank ownership segment has been more responsive. It uses data from 1991 to 2005 and explicitly models allocative inefficiency by using the translog shadow cost-share system. Empirical results show that overregulation and imperfect market structure hampers the ability of banks to make competitive decisions. We find evidence of allocative inefficiency leading to over-utilization of labour and deposits vis-a-vis operating cost. Empirical results for time-varying allocative efficiency show declining levels of allocative inefficiency for state-owned and private banks in post-reform period. Deregulation policies induce state-owned banks to decrease over-utilization of labour relative to deposits and operating cost while private banks succeed in using operating cost closer to optimal levels. Hence, policymakers have latitude to introduce more reforms without jeopardizing allocative efficiency.","[Ahmad, Shabbir] Univ Queensland, Fac Business Econ & Law BEL, Australian Inst Business & Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Burki, Abid A.] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani Sch Human & Social Sci MGSH, Dept Econ, Lahore, Pakistan",University of Queensland; Lahore University of Management Sciences,"Ahmad, S (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Fac Business Econ & Law BEL, Australian Inst Business & Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia.",s.ahmad@uq.edu.au,,"Ahmad, Shabbir/0000-0002-3115-5238",,,,,50,2,2,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Given the many survey development choices and consequences that are particular to web -surveys, the lack of a common reporting standard on the survey administration part can make it very difficult to judge the quality and validity of results obtained in a web-based valuation survey. This paper provides such a reporting checklist for stated preference valuation surveys developed for and administered through the web. The checklist is developed based on the bulk of knowledge gained so far with web -based surveys. This knowledge is compiled based on an extensive review of relevant literature dated from 2001 to beginning of 2015 in the Scopus database. Somewhat surprisingly, relatively few papers are concerned with survey mode effects or with the new opportunities for experimentation that the web survey mode presents. In relation to this, our paper also outlines future research opportunities and directions that would seem particularly relevant to further investigate and validate the increasing use of web based questionnaires for economic valuation surveys.

In equilibrium, the first mover strategically rejects some projects that are then selected by the second mover, even when the value of the project is the same for both firms. A monopolist rejects more projects, and adopts ones of higher average quality compared to the duopolist. Duopolists select too few projects compared to their jointly optimal behavior.

We find that an increase in Brazil's tax on foreign investment in bonds causes fund managers to significantly decrease their portfolio allocations to Brazil in both bonds and equities. Fund managers simultaneously increase allocations to other countries that have substantial exposure to China and decrease allocations to countries viewed as more likely to adjust their capital controls. Much of the effect of capital controls on portfolio allocation appears to occur through signalling - i.e., changes in investor expectations about future policies - rather than the direct cost of the controls. This evidence of significant externalities from capital controls suggests that any assessment of controls should consider their effects on portfolio flows to other countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has led to substantially increased use of private loans as a supplementary source of finance for households' higher education investment. A critical aspect of the private market for student loans is that loan terms must reflect students' risk of default. College investment will therefore differ from a world in which government student loans, whose terms are not sensitive to credit risk, are expanded to no longer bind. Moreover, beyond simply crowding out private lending, expansions of the government student loan program will feed back into default risk on private loans. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative assessment of the likely effects of the private market for student loans on college enrollment. We build a model of college investment that reflects uninsured idiosyncratic risk and a well-defined life-cycle that is consistent with observed borrowing and default behavior across family income and college preparedness. We find that higher government borrowing limits increase college investment but lead to more default in the private market for student loans, while tuition subsides increase college investment and reduce default rates in the private market. Consequently, higher limits on government student loans have small negative welfare effects, while tuition subsidies increase aggregate welfare.

Focusing on youth informal sector employment strategies, the article interrogates whether youth employment strategies are simply about jobs and income, or are they linked to social transformation; and whether youth are helpless and incapacitated in the context of high unemployment or underemployment in Africa. Unemployment and underemployment constitute a challenge to different categories of youth: high unemployment is highest among urban, educated youth; and underemployment and low productivity constitute major challenges for young people active in the informal sector. Based on four case studies of youth informal sector employment activities, this article contends that important social undercurrents and realities about youth employment in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are overlooked; first, the focus on state-led interventions misses the potential to document and leverage the perspectives, capabilities and breakthroughs by youth. Young people in SSA are active agents, rather than passive recipients or helpless actors, in addressing unemployment and underemployment. Second, youth employment transcends mere wages and livelihoods to connect with social processes, including societal transformation-the progressive change in societal mind-set, values and norms, processes and outlook. Finally, all these have implications for policy and practice as it influences Africa's effectiveness or ineffectiveness in capacitating and supporting demonstrated potential for innovative problem-solving and job creation by youth. The informal sector as a whole, and youth employment strategies at a particular point in time, continue to be poorly documented and integrated into mainstream economic planning, and its growth obstructed. Thus, important partnerships, lessons and opportunities to leverage breakthroughs from youth-led activities are overlooked.","[Ismail, Olawale] Int Alert, London, England",,"Ismail, O (通讯作者)，Int Alert, London, England.",muyiwale@yahoo.com,"Ismail, Olawale/HKW-8333-2023",,African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"The author is grateful to the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) for providing financial support for the preparation and presentation of this article at the AERC Biannual Research Workshop, Lusaka, Zambia, December 2014.",,66,10,10,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

While previous results relate to the attainment of the first-best allocation for welfare, we provide a new irrelevance result in terms of the choice of strategic variable in the product market. We show that regardless of whether a public or private firm is the market leader, the leader always chooses the price contract whereas the follower is indifferent between the price contract and the quantity contract. The identity of the leader and the follower firm is therefore irrelevant for the equilibrium mode of competition.

This lens emphasizes the role played by networks in the accumulation of symbolic capital and their interaction with the historical and institutional context in the exercise of symbolic violence. The experience of P2 is then analyzed to describe, on one hand, the characteristics of the networks that are critical to its success and, on the other, the lodge's capacity to interfere with the economic and political systems within the context of the Cold War in Italy. The willingness to control and provoke institutional change expressed by P2's affiliates also shows to what extent the accumulation of social capital, in combination with other forms of capital, may represent a threat to public welfare. By illustrating the interaction between networks and the normative framework underlying our institutions, this case study suggests that the experience of P2 is not an exception in the functioning of our democracies.","[Lollo, Eleonora] Univ Aix Marseille, Marseille, France; [Lollo, Eleonora] Kedge Business Sch, Dev Econ & Business Eth, Talence, France; [Lollo, Eleonora] UMR CNRS 5062, IAO, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Kedge Business School,"Lollo, E (通讯作者)，Univ Aix Marseille, Marseille, France.;Lollo, E (通讯作者)，Kedge Business Sch, Dev Econ & Business Eth, Talence, France.;Lollo, E (通讯作者)，UMR CNRS 5062, IAO, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

In contrast to much of the existing literature, which explains the 'rockets and feathers' phenomenon as a result of retailers exercising market power, we find the opposite result: the degree of asymmetry in prices is negatively related to market power (decreases with the Lerner-Index). Our measure of (cross-product) search costs does not account for observable differences in asymmetric cost pass-through rates between products. The 'rockets and feathers' observation is better explained by product-specific differences in menu costs ('mistake costs') and costs associated with stock-outs which can lead to a loss of consumer goodwill.

J,"Lucas, D",,,,"Lucas, Deborah",,,Credit Policy as Fiscal Policy,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,IMPERFECT INFORMATION; GOVERNMENT; PROGRAMS; MARKETS,"The $1.6 trillion that U.S. households borrowed in 2010 through government-backed direct loan and loan guarantee programs most notably from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the student loan programs, and the Federal Housing Administration, but also more than 100 smaller programs provided credit subsidies and relaxed credit-rationing constraints that caused both borrowing and spending that year to be higher than they would otherwise have been. A simple theoretical model illustrates these channels. Estimates of the increases in borrowing, scaled by multipliers similar to those applied to traditional government spending and tax policies, suggest that the programs provided a fiscal stimulus of roughly $344 billion, similar to what was provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Although there is considerable uncertainty about this point estimate, its size suggests the importance of taking the stimulus and automatic stabilizer effects of federal credit programs into account, particularly during economic downturns that are accompanied by severe financial market distress. However, though credit programs are shown to be a relatively low-cost source of fiscal stimulus, to assess their overall welfare implications, these benefits must be weighed against the significant costs of the programs during more normal times, including the likelihood that lax federal credit policies were an exacerbating cause of the 2007 financial crisis.","[Lucas, Deborah] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Lucas, D (通讯作者)，MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,44,15,18,1,8,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Using household level survey data, we find that the use of fertiliser and paddy yield per hectare are not significantly different among borrowers from the cooperative society, borrowers from rice traders and non-borrowers. However, borrowers from rice traders receive lower incomes and profits compared with non-borrowers largely due to the higher interest charged. Considering that such farmers who borrow from rice traders are generally poorer in financial, physical, and human capital and would have even made lower income and profit without rice trader credit, we suggest policies to facilitate further development of credit markets for both efficiency and equity of rice production in Mwea.","[Njeru, Timothy N.] Egerton Univ, Tegemeo Inst Agr Policy & Dev, Nairobi, Kenya; [Mano, Yukichi] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Otsuka, Keijiro] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan",Egerton University; Hitotsubashi University; National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Otsuka, K (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Tokyo, Japan.",otsuka@grips.ac.jp,"Njeru, Timothy/D-5553-2016","Njeru, Timothy/0000-0003-4012-625X","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H02619, 26220503, 25101002, 26301018] Funding Source: KAKEN","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",,,35,17,19,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

I develop and solve a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that features a housing market, borrowers and savers. Borrowers can access credit markets through their housing collateral. I consider two alternative ways of introducing a macroprudential approach to enhance financial stability: one in which monetary policy, using the interest rate as an instrument, responds to credit growth; and a second one in which the macroprudential instrument is instead the loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Results show that monetary and macroprudential policies are less effective with long-term rates. However, in the short-term case, monetary policy can achieve the financial stability goal only at the expense of higher macroeconomic volatility. If the macroprudential policy is implemented using an LTV rule, financial stability improves significantly with short-term rates but just marginally with long-term ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A tax can accomplish the same given a positive externality (addiction).

Additionally, conventional energy analyses focus on the primary and final stages of energy flows, and do not capture the last stage of energy transformations to useful end-uses. We further develop previous useful work accounting methodologies by considering the sectoral breakdown of electricity end uses and efficiencies. Also, this paper is the first accounting for useful work covering a full agricultural-industrial-services economic transition, taking Portugal 1856-2009. Portuguese aggregate final-to-useful efficiency remains constant until 1920, slightly increases between 1920 and 1950 due to heating uses, soars between 1950 and 1980 due to electrification and industrialization, and stabilizes afterwards due to an increase in motorization and deindustrialization. Strikingly, along this period the ratio useful work/GDP varies by no more than 20% around its average and ends in 2009 at a value quite close to is 1856 value, around 1 MJ/2010(sic).

Using the Rural to Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) dataset we estimate a series of subjective well-being functions to simultaneously explore relative concerns with respect to income and remittances. Our results show that although rural households experience substantial welfare loss due to income comparisons, they gain well-being by comparing their remittances with those received by their reference group. In other words, we find evidence of a status effect with respect to income and of a signal effect of similar magnitude with respect to remittances.

Along with an increasing number of rural people migrating to urban area for jobs, there are a considerable number of elderly parents left behind in the rural area. The impact of migration of the adult children on the health of their left-behind parents is ambiguous. On the one hand, the additional income from the children's jobs can allow their parents to afford better health care and nutrition; on the other hand, the migration necessarily reduces the amount of time the children have to take care of their parents. This paper uses the Rural Urban Migration in China data to empirically investigate the effect of adult children's migration on the health of the left-behind parents. Based on a linear probability model with instrumental variable correction, we find that having one additional adult child migrated to an urban area increases the probability of the left-behind elderly parents being in poor health condition by about 8%. Furthermore, parents having only one child, from low-income households, or aged above 60 year are affected more. Our results point out that the parents with only one child is the most vulnerable group and highlight the importance of establishing a formal care system for the rural elderly to complement the traditional family care in rural China.

Using a panel of municipalities for the years between 1994 and 2006, we find that municipal governments of legislators' birth towns receive larger transfers per capita. Exploiting variation in birthplaces induced by parliamentary turnover for estimation, we find that this effect is driven by legislators who were born in a town outside their district of election. As a result, we argue that our findings cannot be a consequence of re-election incentives, the usual motivation for pork-barrel policies in the literature. Rather, politicians may be pursuing other personal motives. In line with this hypothesis, we find that the birth town bias essentially disappears when legislative elections are near. We explore several possible mechanisms behind our results by matching parliamentarians to a detailed dataset on local level administrators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation of exchange asymmetries for bads is a key element to distinguish between the validity of loss aversion- and attention-based theories.

We show that search frictions in the credit market can naturally explain the countercyclical bank reserves and interest spread, as well as generate endogenous business cycles driven primarily by the cyclical utilization rate of credit resources, as long conjectured by the Austrian school of the business cycle. In particular, we show that credit search can lead to endogenous local increasing returns to scale and variable capital utilization in a model with constant returns to scale production technology and matching functions, thus providing a microfoundation for the indeterminacy literature of Benhabib and Farmer (J Econ Theory 63(1): 19-41, 1994) and Wen (J Econ Theory 81(1): 7-36, 1998).","[Dong, Feng] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengfei] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wen, Yi] Fed Reserve Bank St Louis, Res Dept, St Louis, MO USA; [Wen, Yi] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - St. Louis; Tsinghua University,"Dong, F (通讯作者)，Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China.",fengdong@sjtu.edu.cn; fwang@ust.hk; yi.wen@stls.frb.org,"Wang, Pengfei/X-2272-2019; Dong, Feng/AAV-9125-2020; Wen, Yi/I-5756-2016","Wang, Pengfei/0000-0002-8686-4787; Dong, Feng/0000-0001-5085-2277; Wen, Yi/0000-0001-5658-1578",,,,,25,11,11,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Using data from the British National Child Development Study, we find that being socially maladjusted at age 11 has a negative effect on adult employment probabilities. Accounting for state dependence nearly doubles the negative effect of social maladjustment. Moreover, socially maladjusted individuals exhibit stronger state dependence than do socially adjusted individuals, suggesting that the former experience greater difficulties in finding a job when not employed. This finding is possibly due to the persistence of antisocial behavior and/or subsequent disadvantages associated with childhood social maladjustment. We also find that females are more penalized than males for low-middle levels of social maladjustment, while males suffer more in cases of higher levels. In addition, childhood social maladjustment is less detrimental to adult employment probabilities if cohort-members exhibit reduced antisocial behavioral aspects during adolescence. The estimation results are robust to exogeneity tests and the introduction of additional controls testing the role of school living environment. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at improving social skills during adolescence and favoring insertion in the labor market may be effective in both improving employment prospects and achieving social inclusion of affected individuals.

We find that innate ability and family investment in early education play important roles in explaining income inequality and intergenerational income mobility. Though children from the wealthiest families are only 136 times 'smarter' that those from the poorest, the gap in human capital expands to 2.35 at the end of compulsory education and to 2.89 at the end of non-compulsory education. One important reason for the increase is that poor families invest relatively less in children's early education than do wealthy families; therefore, their children attend lower quality schools, which results in them being much less likely to participate in higher education. By simulating policy experiments for different types of government education expenditure, we find that direct subsidies to poor parents are the most efficient and effective policy for mitigating poor families' budget constraints with regard to early-education investment in their children.

We suggest that the four 'keep factors of location' - additional investments of the automobile manufacturers, unchanged labour market regulation, changes in government policy and the existence of few alternative sites of relocation - were more dominant than the two main 'push factors of relocation' - relatively low sunk costs and low dependence on the local environment.","[Rugraff, Eric] Univ Strasbourg, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, Strasbourg, France; [Sass, Magdolna] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Pecs, Hungary",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; Hungarian Research Network; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; HUN-REN Institute of Experimental Medicine,"Sass, M (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Pecs, Hungary.",sass.magdolna@krtk.mta.hu,"Sass, Magdolna/K-3112-2016","Sass, Magdolna/0000-0002-6819-6041",,,,,61,4,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JAN 2,2016,28.0,1,,,,,16,33,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1124552,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF4SC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371339600002,0

The prominent characteristics of the C-IFOWD measure are that it is not only a generalization of some widely used distance measure, but also it can deal with interval deviations in aggregation on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy values (IVIFVs) by using a controlled parameter, which can decrease the uncertainty of argument and improve the accuracy of decision. The desirable characteristics make the C-IFOWD measure suitable to wide range situations, such as decision making, engineering and investment, etc. In the end, we introduce a new approach to group decision making with IVIFVs in human resource management.","[Zhou, Ligang; Jin, Feifei; Chen, Huayou] Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Ligang; Chen, Huayou] Univ So Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Signal & Image Proc Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Liu, Jinpei] Anhui Univ, Sch Business, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China",Anhui University; University of Southern California; Anhui University,"Chen, HY (通讯作者)，Anhui Univ, Sch Math Sci, Hefei 230601, Anhui, Peoples R China.;Chen, HY (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Dept Elect Engn, Signal & Image Proc Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",huayouc@126.com,"Chen, Huayou/JAO-4133-2023","Chen, Huayou/0000-0002-7312-0367; Jin, Feifei/0000-0002-2616-3647","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301001, 71371011, 71071002]; Higher School Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program [20123401110001]; Scientific Research Foundation of Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation [1308085QG127]; Provincial Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Colleges [KJ2012A026]; Project of Anhui Province for Excellent Young Talents in Universities",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Higher School Specialized Research Fund for Doctoral Program; Scientific Research Foundation of Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars(Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars); Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation(Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province); Provincial Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Colleges; Project of Anhui Province for Excellent Young Talents in Universities,"The work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 71301001, 71371011, 71071002), Higher School Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program (No. 20123401110001), The Scientific Research Foundation of the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (No. 1308085QG127), Provincial Natural Science Research Project of Anhui Colleges (No. KJ2012A026), Project of Anhui Province for Excellent Young Talents in Universities.

An incomes policy, focused on real increases in the minimum wage along with a credit boom, led to a decade of high consumption growth rates. High levels of consumption and exports, in turn, induced investment and stimulated manufacturing production, despite the real appreciation of the national currency. However, the Great Recession that emerged after the global financial crisis of 2007/2008 brought challenges to the Brazilian economic performance, with unpleasant consequences for the country's GDP growth. Consumption, investment and exports have decelerated, despite anti-cyclical macroeconomic policies. In this setting, manufacturing production stagnated and GDP growth slowed down substantially, while imports continued rising considerably. The aim of this paper is to provide an explanation to the slowdown of Brazilian growth rates after the Great Recession. The main hypothesis is that consumption was the main source of effective demand in the country since 2003. However, Brazil has not yet been able to sustain manufacturing and economic growth without a more active government policy to stimulate productive investment.","[Arestis, Philip] Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England; [Arestis, Philip] Univ Basque Country, San Sebastian, Spain; [Baltar, Carolina Troncoso; Prates, Daniela Magalhaes] Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, Brazil; [Prates, Daniela Magalhaes] Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",University of Cambridge; University of Basque Country; Universidade Estadual de Campinas,"Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1TN, England.;Arestis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, San Sebastian, Spain.;Baltar, CT; Prates, DM (通讯作者)，Univ Estadual Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.;Prates, DM (通讯作者)，Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",cbaltar@gmail.com; prates@unicamp.br,"Baltar, Carolina Troncoso/A-8890-2013; Prates, Daniela/JPK-9750-2023","Baltar, Carolina Troncoso/0000-0002-3317-8169",Sao Paulo Research Foudation (FAPESP),Sao Paulo Research Foudation (FAPESP)(Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP)),Carolina Troncoso Baltar gratefully acknowledges research funding granted by Sao Paulo Research Foudation (FAPESP).,,25,5,6,1,17,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63.0,2,,,SI,,157,174,,10.2298/PAN1602157A,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,DM2YK,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376213800002,0

The EU member states have therefore declared to strongly increase the share of renewable energy sources (RES-E) in the next decades. Given a large deployment of wind and solar capacities, there are two major impacts on electricity systems: First, the electricity system must be flexible enough to cope with the volatile RES-E generation, i.e., ramp up supply or ramp down demand on short notice. Second, sufficient back-up capacities are needed during times with low feed-in from wind and solar capacities. This paper analyzes whether there is a need for additional incentive mechanisms for flexibility in electricity markets with a high share of renewables. For this purpose, we simulate the development of the European electricity markets up to the year 2050 using a linear investment and dispatch optimization model. Flexibility requirements are implemented in the model via ramping constraints and provision of balancing power. We found that an increase in fluctuating renewables has a tremendous impact on the volatility of the residual load and consequently on the flexibility requirements. However, any market design that incentivizes investments in least (total system) cost generation investment does not need additional incentives for flexibility. The main trigger for investing in flexible resources is the achievable full load hours and the need for backup capacity. In a competitive market, the cost-efficient technologies that are most likely to be installed, i.e., gas-fired power plants or flexible CCS plants, provide flexibility as a by-product. Under the condition of system adequacy, flexibility never poses a challenge in a cost-minimal capacity mix. Therefore, any market design incentivizing investments in efficient generation thus provides flexibility as an inevi complement (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we establish that the absolute volume of innovation increases within the firms most affected by Chinese imports in their output markets. We correct for endogeneity using the removal of product-specific quotas following China's entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001. Chinese import competition led to increased technical change within firms and reallocated employment between firms towards more technologically advanced firms. These within and between effects were about equal in magnitude, and account for 14% of European technology upgrading over 2000-7 (and even more when we allow for offshoring to China). Rising Chinese import competition also led to falls in employment and the share of unskilled workers. In contrast to low-wage nations like China, developed countries had no significant effect on innovation.","[Bloom, Nicholas] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Draca, Mirko] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Van Reenen, John] London Sch Econ, London, England; [Van Reenen, John] Ctr Econ Performance, London, England",Stanford University; University of Warwick; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,,,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019; Bloom, Nicholas/Y-2448-2019",,"Economic and Social Research Council; National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1, ES/M010341/1, ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1, ES/H02123X/1, ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This is a revised version of Bloom et al.

There are three main channels through which population ageing might influence long term economic growth: the size of the workforce, amount of savings and labour productivity. The pessimists argue that ageing leads to decline of both savings and firm's investment, slower capital accumulation and lower productivity. The optimistic view refers to changes of individual saving schemes and longer working life. The purpose of the paper is to evaluate the effects of ageing on economic performance. We analyse how the ongoing changes in age structure of population can affect selected determinants of the long term economic growth in OECD countries. On the basis of short literature review we try to describe theoretical relationship between the ageing and long term economic growth. The quantitative analysis could help to verify the importance of the ageing for prosperity. In general, the effects of demographic changes on economic output are ambiguous. Population ageing can harm accumulation of physical capital but the effect on productivity is doubtful. Thus, the adverse effects resulting from national accounting might be compensated by productivity increase.","[Breinek, Pavel] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Breinek, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",breinek@mendelu.cz,,,MSMT within the project COST CZ (LD) [LDI 15065],MSMT within the project COST CZ (LD),This article was written within the project LDI 15065 - Gender dimension of implementation of active ageing in Czech private and public sector and its comparison with western countries.

In societies in which the share of private investment in percentage of GDP is growing, in which tax cheaters usually choose to shelter the proceeds of their illegal activities from the official financial institutions, and in which the productivity of public spending is often low, tax evasion and tax corruption may contribute to the development of private capital if people find an opportunity to invest the proceeds of their illegal activities in equity markets.

Rapidly increasing incidence and prevalence of chronic diseases imposes additional burden on healthcare systems and national economies. This implies inefficient use of public health services, increased costs associated with clinical treatment of diseases and the cost of lost productivity due to inability of work and absenteeism.

Regulatory oversight was relaxed in the belief that emerging techniques in financial engineering would render irrelevant fears of sharp periodic downturns that have historically been the consequence of lightly regulated finance. The outcome of this new policy, embracing the idea of unregulated markets to deliver greater prosperity, is disappointing. We find that the average growth rate of UK GDP and output per person employed for three decades from the start of liberalization was no greater than that in the previous three post-war decades. Cyclical fluctuations were deeper. A remarkable feature of the second period is the sharp rise in income inequality in favour of the very top earners. An illusion of greater prosperity for a wider segment may have been created in the second period due to asset price bubbles and housing inflation.","[Chakravarty, S. P.; Nikolopoulos, K.

This is unlike most other parts of the world, including the OECD area, where income inequality has actually been rising. At the same time this improvement in the distribution of income has contributed to a reduction in the incidence of poverty in the region, although vulnerable groups face the risk of falling back into poverty if the economic environment deteriorates. Structural factors, such as a reduction in skill premia and labour income gains at the lower end of the income distribution, coupled with increased government spending on redistributive programmes, have been the main drivers. Short-term, cyclical factors, including GDP growth and sizeable terms-of-trade gains in the resource-based economies, have played a relatively smaller role.

Its material basis is formed by the global movement of finance capital. According to the authors, this is due to the fact that the current global financial system is a typical complex nonlinear system in a non-equilibrium unstable state in which the global nature of modern capital has come into irreconcilable conflict with the local one in nature and with the national one in the extent of the system of its international regulation. And this contradiction is at the heart of an international crisis of 2007-2009 and the subsequent financial and economic upheavals of 20102011, 2014 and 2015. According to the authors synergy should be used as the methodological basis of the study of these processes and the development of a new institutional system of global capital market regulation. It is a fairly new trend in science that has its main task - understanding the general laws of macroscopically ordered space and temporal structures in complex nonlinear systems which are far from equilibrium conditions, and near singular critical points - the bifurcation points in the vicinity of which the behavior of the system becomes unstable. International aspects of improving global financial market regulation must be based on the recommendations of synergy on a qualitatively new integration of global, regional and national institutions that contribute to the exit of global capital market from the bifurcation point.","[Ermolaev, Konstantin Nikolaevich; Salomatina, Svetlana Yuryevna] Samara State Univ Econ, Sovetskoi Armii Str 141, Samara 443090, Russia",,"Ermolaev, KN (通讯作者)，Samara State Univ Econ, Sovetskoi Armii Str 141, Samara 443090, Russia.",ermolaevkn@yandex.ru; salom771@rambler.ru,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,433,441,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800054,0

The study period (2002) captures the farm labour market conditions prior to enforcement of stricter 'Arizona' style of immigration controls. Farmers at that time usually would tend to exhaust the full potentials of family labour contributions before relying on off-farm labour sources. When off-farm workers were considered, the results establish the farms' dependence on foreign labourers for seasonal farm work, although farmers seemed to have already been more cautiously hiring these workers in areas with lower concentrations of undocumented workers. This study also confirmed that farmers generally used high wage offers (possibly directed to domestic workers with more employment options) to lure them into working in their farms. The results also emphasize the need for improvements in the H2A guest farmworker visa programme that did not offer significant remedy for seasonal farm labour hiring at that time.","[Escalante, Cesar L.; Wu, Ya; Li, Xiaofei] Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Escalante, CL (通讯作者)，Univ Georgia, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Athens, GA 30602 USA.",cescalan@uga.edu,"Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; Escalante, Cesar/GLV-6777-2022","Escalante, Cesar/0000-0002-0789-8330",,,,,14,1,2,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

In this setup, government spending accommodates tax revenues and target deficits. In particular, we concentrate on pre-announced tax cuts, as well as on the adoption of a lower debt target - following policies conducted in Israel during the 2000s. We construct a model where domestic production requires imported inputs, and simulate the effects of these policies. The analysis focuses on the dynamics generated by the announcements of these policy steps, followed by their implementation. The model has the implication that a credible announcement of a future tax cut has an expansionary effect on impact, similar in nature to the effects of productivity shocks. Also, the model implies that the announcement of a lower public debt/GDP target has a contractionary effect, while it's implementation leads to higher output in the long-run.","[Hercowitz, Zvi] IDC Herzliya, Tiomkin Sch Econ, IL-4610101 Herzliyya, Israel; [Hercowitz, Zvi] Tel Aviv Univ, Berglas Sch Econ, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel; [Friedman, Amit] Bank Israel, Market Operat Div, Jerusalem, Israel; [Sidi, Jonathan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Dept Stat, IL-91905 Jerusalem, Israel; [Sidi, Jonathan] Bank Israel, Res Dept, Jerusalem, Israel",Reichman University; Tel Aviv University; Bank of Israel; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Bank of Israel,"Hercowitz, Z (通讯作者)，IDC Herzliya, Tiomkin Sch Econ, POB 176, IL-4610101 Herzliyya, Israel.",zvi.hercowitz@idc.ac.il,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

According to forecasts of various market research agencies, application of gamification in activities of companies increases and gamification market growth will continue in the future. As gamification is usually focused on customers, it is naturally related to consumer behaviour. However, there is a lack of studies approaching gamification from consumer behaviour perspective. Because gamification is strongly driven by information technologies, the paper seeks to propose an integrated framework for gamification impact on online consumer behaviour. In order to achieve it, the paper explores origins of gamification concept, compares it to similar concepts, proposes gamification definition and provides an overview of the pyramid of key gamification elements: game components, game mechanics, game dynamics. The further paper analyses different models of online consumer behaviour with emphasis on the application of the stimulus-organism-reaction (SOR) model. SOR model is used for characterising online stimulus (company controlled elements) and their impact on online consumer behaviour. In order to develop the framework, interdependencies of approaches of the pyramid of key gamification elements and SOR model are analysed by identifying factors related to the virtual environment, process, and social dimensions.","[Gatautis, Rimantas; Vitkauskaite, Elena; Gadeikiene, Agne; Piligrimiene, Zaneta] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Gatautis, R; Vitkauskaite, E; Gadeikiene, A; Piligrimiene, Z (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",rimantas.gatautis@ktu.lt; elena.vitkauskaite@ktu.edu; agne.gadeikiene@ktu.lt; zaneta.piligrimiene@ktu.lt,"Gadeikienė, Agnė/AAV-1568-2020; Vitkauskaitė, Elena/A-7574-2010","Gadeikienė, Agnė/0000-0001-7719-4980; Vitkauskaitė, Elena/0000-0003-3421-4093; Gravelines, Zaneta/0000-0003-3930-2383",European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure [VP1-3.1-SMM-07-K-03-083],European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure,This research (No. VP1-3.1-SMM-07-K-03-083) is funded by the European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure.,,42,56,63,28,207,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The paper attempts to answer the key question: does fiscal consolidation (the numerator) or economic growth (the denominator) have a stronger impact in determining the debt-to-GDP ratio? Results of the panel data analysis showed that by achieving a more balanced government budget, public debt growth decreases, but the effect is rather small. Conversely, estimated GDP growth parameters are much greater. Results imply that the sovereign debt crisis should be resolved by stimulating economic growth, while bearing in mind the high price of potentially irresponsible public finance management.","[Globan, Tomislav; Matosec, Marina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Globan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",tgloban@efzg.hr; marina.matosec@hotmail.com,"Globan, Tomislav/H-7550-2018; Matosec, Marina/H-7738-2018","Globan, Tomislav/0000-0001-5716-2113; Matosec, Marina/0000-0003-1143-312X",Croatian Science Foundation [7031],Croatian Science Foundation,This work has been supported by the Croatian Science Foundation under the project no. 7031.,,22,9,9,0,10,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Data have been retrieved by means of the distributed microdata approach (DMD) from registers on business, trade and education as well as from surveys on production, ICT usage and innovation activities in firms held at the national statistical offices. This pioneering approach allows access to otherwise confidential linked firm-level information in dimensions not earlier available. Pooled OLS estimations based on approximately 400,000 observations in harmonised and representative datasets show that in a majority of countries there is a significant and positive relationship between the proportion of broadband internet-enabled employees and labour productivity in firms. However, the strength of the relationship varies across countries and industries.

We ask whether movements in the price of government bonds can be rationalized by lenders' unwillingness to fully roll over debt when the outstanding level of debt exceeds the government's repayment capacity. Investors do not support a Ponzi game in this case, but ration credit supply, thus forcing default at an endogenously determined fractional repayment rate. Interest rates on government bonds reflect expectations of this event. Numerical results show that default premia can emerge at moderately high debt-to-GDP ratios where even small changes in fundamentals lead to steeply rising interest rates. The behavior of risk premia broadly accords with recent observations for several European countries that experienced a worsening of fundamental fiscal conditions.","[Juessen, Falko] Berg Univ Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany; [Juessen, Falko] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Linnemann, Ludger] TU Dortmund Univ, Dortmund, Germany; [Schabert, Andreas] Univ Cologne, D-50923 Cologne, Germany",University of Wuppertal; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Dortmund University of Technology; University of Cologne,"Schabert, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Ctr Macroecon Res, Albertus Magnus Pl, D-50923 Cologne, Germany.",schabert@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Schabert, Andreas/AAD-8901-2022","Schabert, Andreas/0000-0002-4924-9937",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB 823],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"The authors would like to thank Christian Bayer, Huixin Bi, Eric Leeper, Juha Kilponen, Robert Kollmann, and Dirk Niepelt for helpful comments and suggestions; the usual disclaimer applies.

Adult learning and education is to a great extent an unexplored field. This in particular refers to the contested educational field, considering the fact that many negate the sole possibility of educational activity with adults. Along with other social changes of the contemporary world, most countries have an increasing population of convicts, who are a subgroup of the socially excluded population. A prison sentence and criminal activities that precede it, do not just affect the individual - the convict. The stated processes affect the society as a whole, especially the convicts' primary social environment. Educational work represents an important part of convicts' rehabilitation and resocialization, and educational programmes, managed by the staff of the treatment ward of penal institutions, are implemented with the aim to prevent the convict's return to crime and his/her more successful adaptation into society after leaving the penal institution. This research was conducted on a sample of 96 surveyed convicts of Osijek County jail. It attempted to examine the attitudes of the convict population towards the educational parts of the prison treatment and their own future. The obtained data was analysed using descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test and ANOVA. The data was analysed using OpenStat statistical programme. The results indicate that the convicts who participated in the research have positive attitudes towards the prison treatment and that they optimistically assess their own future. There is a positive correlation between the participant's age and his/her attitudes towards his/her own future and educational needs. This research indicates that the level of convicts' education and his/her attitudes towards educational needs at certain levels are connected. This indicates that it is impossible to generalize the attitudes and expectations of individual convicts and that there is a need for an individualized approach to each convict. This paper should contribute to theory of andragogy and penological-andragogic practice in defining the factors of quality penal treatment, which would also present a pathway towards improvement of the penal system as a whole.","[Jukic, Renata] Fac Humanities & Social Sci, L Jagera 9, Osijek, Croatia; [Radakovic, Vlatka] Umaska 35, Osijek, Croatia",,"Jukic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Humanities & Social Sci, L Jagera 9, Osijek, Croatia.",rjukic@ffos.hr; vlatka.radakovic@yahoo.com,"Jukic, Renata/S-8925-2019",,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,421,431,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600042,0

In 2003, Erik Wolf founded the International Culinary Tourism Association that supports and popularizes culinary entities and their activities all over the world. In the Czech Republic, there are 44 active industrial breweries and 300 microbreweries. Although the microbreweries produce only 1% of beer consumption in general, they have become a popular tourist target of original beer fans. Some of them offer beer only; others prepare local traditional culinary specialities as well when striving to provide better services than their competitors do. This case study analyses a promisingly developing Roznov brewery and beer spa called Roznovsky pivovar a Roznovske pivni lazne. The brewery offers beer specialities and in its restaurant, the regional culinary products are served. In historical cellars, there is a beer spa, and the brewery also cooperates with other entities of tourist industry. The research has confirmed that the brewery makes use of destination management tools. Moreover, it cooperates with other business entities of tourist industry in Roznov pod Radhostem, e.g. hotels, shipping companies, and with Wallachian Open Air Museum in the first place, which maintains folklore traditions. In case the brewery manages to group together the strongest and most important partners for a strategic cooperation, and forms a net, it can make a flexible international complex system out of the destination, which will be a driving force of the economic development.","[Kozak, Vratislav] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Kozák, V (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management & Mkt, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",kozak@fame.utb.cz,"Kozak, Vratislav/H-6470-2012","Kozak, Vratislav/0000-0002-2148-5380",,,,,23,0,0,0,11,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1031,1037,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800128,0

Current globalizing market environment is source of new risk cases with high degree of severity that threaten large enterprise values. If companies want to have long-term prosperity at global markets, they cannot have a passive attitude to risk management. Globalization process cannot be considered as completed. Globalization causes a revolutionary socio-economic transformation and forces companies to adopt new global strategic solutions and approaches. Adoption of right measures to prevent and protect against the crisis is very important and in case of crisis, companies have to react adequately in its effective solutions. For this reason, the sophisticated early warning systems are irreplaceable component of risk management. This article defines early warning systems and its objectives and describes the various stages of the process of early warning system. Early warning systems are applied in many areas of corporate practice, but the article is primarily focused on corporate finance and financial risk detection that determine the emergence of company bankruptcy. Article also discusses financial indicators through which it is possible to identify impending danger and deterioration of financial health of the company. Due to the turbulence of the global business environment, understanding the financial health of a company is very important information not only for management of the company, but also for other stakeholders.","[Kral, Pavol; Bartosova, Viera] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Kral, P (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",pavol.kral@fpedas.uniza.sk; viera.bartosova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Kral, Pavol/P-3291-2015; Bartosova, Viera/P-6636-2015","Bartosova, Viera/0000-0001-7960-4429",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-14-0841],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency - Grant NO.

Using the mobile phone became so common and automatic, that more often we can talk about the abuse or technology addiction. The article presents the results of a research conducted among students in 2015 in 3 European countries: Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. 1048 students have been tested, including 690 women and 322 men over the age of 18. The aim was to characterize the mobile phone use by young people and to define the level of the risk of phonoholism. The study was carried out using a diagnostic survey method. The online surveys technique was applied with the use of Ankietka.pl portal. In addition, the study used questionnaire named Addiction to Mobile Phone Questionnaire (AMPQ) by A. Potembska and B. Pawlowska. The article describes the scale of mobile phone addiction in the studied group of students. It was agreed that 7.6% of the surveyed respondents exhibit the characteristics of addiction from the phone, 34.6% belong to a group of people in risk of addiction, and 57.7% use the device correctly. The highest percentage (8.9%) of phone abusers belongs to Lithuanian students, and the lowest is in Latvia- 4.5%.

This paper applied the residual income valuation model (RIM) proposed by Ohlson (1995) to forecast stock prices for Taiwan three sectors. We compare relative forecasting accuracy of vector error correction model (VECM) with the vector autoregressive model (VAR) as well as OLS and RW models used in the prior studies. We conduct out-of-sample forecasting and employ two instruments to assess forecasting performance. Our empirical results suggest that the VECM statistically outperforms other three models in forecasting stock prices. When forecasting horizons extend longer, VECM produces smaller forecasting errors and performs substantially better than VAR, suggesting that the ability of VECM to improve VAR forecast accuracy is stronger with longer horizons. These findings imply that an error correction term (Ea) of the VECM contributes to improving forecast accuracy of stock prices. Our economic significance analyses and robustness tests for different data frequency are in favor of the superiority of VECM estimator. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After the introductory remarks describing the nature of neoliberalism and its definitions, relevant sources regarding the definitions of neoliberalism and its present existing forms were consulted and pointed out. The intent of this paper is to present what kind of critical stance was present in the texts published in Antipode in the period of four years (2010-2013). The discourse that was used to describe, characterize and critically judge the contemporary relationship of neoliberalism towards local communities was identified and analyzed. The basic content analysis of the selected texts from Antipode was made. Emphasizing the importance of scale in studying the processes of globalization and neoliberalisation (among others), the main topics that were studied in the research of neoliberalisation at the local level were: gentrification and privatization of former public space, privatization of local resources, the influence of neoliberalism on the immigrants in specific communities, and the resistance to neoliberalisation through the social protests in local communities. The focus of the analysis was on the words used to describe neoliberalisation of the aforementioned areas of social life and the context in which those words were used, through the analysis of full citations. The analysis has shown that neoliberalisation at the local scale has its specific occurrences, forms, subjects, and objects. The pressure from the private capital is transforming the local communities, and concurrently causing resistance that is taking various forms.","[Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia; [Kozina, Goran] Univ North, Ul 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia",University North - Croatia; University North - Croatia,"Kurecic, P (通讯作者)，Univ North, Trg Zarka Dolinara 1, Koprivnica, Croatia.",petar.kurecic@unin.hr; goran.kozina@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,39,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,39,51,,,,,,13,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389416500004,0

Design/methodology/approach - The doctrine of separability of arbitration and the competence-competence principle are studied based on the rules of international conventions and internationally recognized arbitral institutes. In addition, the laws of two common law jurisdictions, which are the USA and the UK are discussed with the Korean arbitration law, which follows the civil law system. This study also includes analysis of cases in order to show application of these two principles to practice and to give practical advices and implications to practitioners. Findings - Most national legislatures and jurisdictions approve the doctrine of separability of arbitration agreement and the competence-competence principle under international commercial arbitration. When there is a dispute regarding the existence or the validity of arbitration agreement, it is determined based on the prima facie test without being affected by the main contract in which the arbitration agreement is inserted. In practice, however, there are many occasions where the arbitration agreements are void or inoperable because of its contents. Many practical advices and suggestions are provided. Originality/value - This paper analyzes arbitration agreements which are used in practice so that it provides many practical advices to practitioners in terms of legal effects of languages and linguistic use.","[Lee, Byung-Mun] Soongsil Univ, Dept Global Commerce, Seoul, South Korea; [Park, Eunok] Penn State Univ, Inst Arbitrat Law & Practice, Penn State Sch Law, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Soongsil University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Park, E (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Inst Arbitrat Law & Practice, Penn State Sch Law, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",juliejulypark@gmail.com,,,,,,,10,1,1,1,15,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

I investigate the development of the shadow banking sector, and assess its impacts on financial stability and economic growth in China. I argue that, due to the loose regulations and institutional characteristics of the shadow banks, these banks tend to adopt business practices that elevate institutional risks. At the systemic level, shadow banks have contributed to credit expansion and credit-driven growth. However, such growth entails significant financial risks and renders the macro-economy financially fragile.

In this study, we use the smooth paths of partial least squares (PLS; more specifically its PLS-SVD algorithm) and principal component analysis (PCA) dependent on a time parameter to descriptively examine the multivariate connections of tourism and economic growth during the periods close to the crisis. A novel approach regarding the paths of leading singular values and corresponding singular vectors and describing the maximum covariance strength reveals many practical outputs as time lags and mutual connections between sets of data. From the base of Central European countries analysed here, only Switzerland shows a significant tourism lagged situation, where the results provide relative perceptive conditions to non-residents with stable conditions for domestic tourism. Our findings show great evidence of similar behaviour in the Austria, Slovenia and Poland group as well as the Czech Republic and Slovakia group. Also the Czech Republic and Slovakia are potentially very sensitive to non-resident visits. Germany reveals its strong interconnection to the European economy. On the other hand, in the case of Hungary, simultaneous changes in income and consumer prices form ideal conditions for tourism.","[Malec, Lukas; Abrham, Josef] Univ Econ, Dept Tourism, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Malec, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Tourism, Prague, Czech Republic.",Lukas.Malec@vso-praha.eu,"Abrhám, Josef/AAL-8271-2021; Malec, Lukáš/AAC-4978-2021","Abrhám, Josef/0000-0003-2484-8439; Malec, Lukáš/0000-0002-5586-4397",,,,,42,13,13,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Our empirical results show the presence of economic convergence in Ukrainian regions. Initially it was found that poor regions do grow relatively faster than the rich. Moreover, the difference between poor and rich regions has been decreased 1.8 times during 1999 and 2010. In addition, it was found that the presence of ecological convergence in the Ukraine and initially 'clean' regions do increase pollution faster than initially 'dirty' regions. That is, Ukrainian regions were converging to some environmental steady state through the process of increasing pollution. Ukrainian regions were also experiencing health convergence with negative policy implications, since all regions do converge to some health levels through an increase in morbidity. The economic growth of Ukrainian regions was achieved through sacrificing environmental situations and increased morbidity. Therefore, there were no clear economic reasons to start interregional confrontation that has taken place in the Ukraine, since all regions were on the same track of development.","[Melnyk, Leonid G.; Kubatko, Oleksandr V.; Kubatko, Oleksandra V.] Sumy State Univ Ukraine, Econ & Business Adm Dept, Sumy, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Sumy State University,"Melnyk, LG (通讯作者)，Sumy State Univ Ukraine, Econ & Business Adm Dept, Sumy, Ukraine.",melnyk@econ.fem.sumdu.edu.ua,"Kubatko, Oleksandra/ABG-6675-2020; Kubatko, Oleksandr/P-8515-2019; Melnyk, Leonid/AAP-7380-2021","Kubatko, Oleksandra/0000-0002-6869-7727; Kubatko, Oleksandr/0000-0001-6396-5772; Melnyk, Leonid/0000-0001-7824-0678",,,,,24,11,11,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Two players allocate a fixed discrete budget across battlefields. Each battlefield is won by the player who allocates the most to that battlefield. The player who wins the battlefields with highest total value receives a constant winner payoff, while the other player receives a constant loser payoff. We focus on apex games, in which there is one large and several small battlefields. A player wins if he wins the large and any one small battlefield, or all the small battle- fields. For each of the games we study, we compute an equilibrium and we show that certain properties of equilibrium play are the same in any equilibrium. In particular, the expected share of the budget allocated to the large battlefield exceeds its value relative to the total value of all battlefields, and with a high probability (exceeding 90% in our treatments) resources are spread over more battlefields than are needed to win the game. In a laboratory experiment, we find that strategies that spread resources widely are played frequently, consistent with equilibrium predictions. In the treatment where the asymmetry between battlefields is strongest, we also find that the large battlefield receives on average more than a proportional share of resources. In a control treatment, all battlefields have the same value and our findings are consistent with previous experimental findings on Colonel Blotto games.","[Montero, Maria; Possajennikov, Alex; Sefton, Martin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Montero, Maria] Univ Basque Cty FAE I, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain; [Montero, Maria] Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain; [Turocy, Theodore L.] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich Res Pk, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of Nottingham; Basque Foundation for Science; University of East Anglia,"Montero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.;Montero, M (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Cty FAE I, Av Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.;Montero, M (通讯作者)，Basque Fdn Sci, Ikerbasque, Bilbao 48013, Spain.",maria.montero@nottingham.ac.uk; alex.possajennikov@nottingham.ac.uk; martin.sefton@nottingham.ac.uk; T.Turocy@uea.ac.uk,"Montero, Maria/J-4771-2013; Possajennikov, Alex/ABG-8223-2021","Montero, Maria/0000-0002-6999-7342; Possajennikov, Alex/0000-0001-8887-8165; Turocy, Theodore/0000-0002-2265-844X; Sefton, Martin/0000-0002-1327-7311",,,,,25,11,13,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

The results support the existence of a correlation between the number of hours of daylight and market returns before and after the last financial crisis, even if the effect seems to change after the crisis.","[Murgea, Aurora] West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Str JH Pestalozzi 16, Timisoara 300115, Jud, Romania",West University of Timisoara,"Murgea, A (通讯作者)，West Univ Timisoara, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Dept Finance, Str JH Pestalozzi 16, Timisoara 300115, Jud, Romania.",aurora.murgea@e-uvt.ro,,,,,,,75,4,4,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We answer this question by empirically assessing the impacts of complete vertical separation, such as ownership unbundling, on the quality of service delivered by a liberalized network industry. Electricity distribution utilities in New Zealand are considered for this purpose and are analysed using panel-data econometrics. The results show robust evidence that ownership unbundling contributed to a fall in the duration and frequency of supply interruptions in electricity distribution. However, the results also show that unbundling has no effect on reducing distribution network losses. These results, overall, highlight the nonsimple impacts of ownership unbundling on the quality of electricity distribution. We suggest that the quality of service may largely improve when considered in the economic regulation of electricity networks than completely relying on specific reform measures such as ownership unbundling.","[Nepal, Rabindra] Charles Darwin Univ, CDU Business Sch, Darwin Waterfront, NT, Australia; [Carvalho, Antonio] Heriot Watt Univ, EGIS, Inst Petr Engn, Ctr Energy Econ Res & Policy, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Foster, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Energy Econ & Management Grp, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Charles Darwin University; Heriot Watt University; University of Queensland,"Nepal, R (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, CDU Business Sch, Darwin Waterfront, NT, Australia.",rabindra.nepal@cdu.edu.au,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206; Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539; Carvalho, Antonio/0000-0001-5279-1455",,,,,40,8,8,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Moreover, an unexpected amendment-a tax licence, which was first introduced in 2015 for the tax period of 2014. The adopted tax license, in terms of a minimal tax, is a rate that every legal entity has to pay compulsory for every tax term. A tax license is defined by taxpayer's annual turnover differing for taxpayer and non-taxpayers. However, this is a tax, for which companies did not earn money. This means, that if a business declares a loss in its tax return or declares an income tax that is lower than the tax license rate according to the categories, the entity has to pay the tax license anyway. However, if the entity declares income tax according to the license rate, it will not have to pay the tax license. The adoption of a tax license should lead to a more fair taxation system of the business entities, which are avoiding tax payment on a long-term basis. Globalization and wider entrepreneurial existence underlines the influence of tax licence on business and general tax duty.","[Olvecka, Viera] Comenius Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Ölvecká, V (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10, Bratislava 82005, Slovakia.",viera.olvecka@fm.uniba.sk,"Olvecká, Viera/ABC-7077-2020","Olvecká, Viera/0000-0001-9873-7884",,,,,14,3,3,0,0,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1604,1612,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800198,0

The contributions that they create in that process can be identified as reducing unemployment, improving social services, education and improving the quality of life. Sensitive to injustice and powerlessness of a certain group of people, social entrepreneurs want to create positive changes. But, this goal cannot be achieved easily because the biggest challenge before social entrepreneurs is to convince all the other actors of society to understand and support their ideas. Social entrepreneurship, as a hybrid model, focuses on crossing sectoral boundaries and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration, especially in addressing the complex social needs and environmental concerns. Strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration in local communities creates comprehensive integrated approaches to development and social policies, but also allows the revitalisation of social capital. This paper focuses on eastern Croatia, one of the country's least developed regions, where social entrepreneurship has shown potential for dealing with local issues. The paper is based on the assumption that the lack of networking and partnerships with social entrepreneurs prevents exploitation of existing resources and creation of entrepreneurial environment in which sectors cooperate and complement each other. Good cross-sectoral collaboration leads to innovative and creative solutions aimed at economic and social development. The main goal of the paper is to explore examples of good practice of networking between social entrepreneurs and their key stakeholders (local governments, financial institutions, academia, civil society organizations and the media). The methodological approach is based on qualitative and interpretative paradigm, using in-depth semi-structured interviews as the main method of data collection. Target groups are representatives of key actors from various sectors, and the fieldwork encompasses a convenience sample of 5-10 respondents from different sectors. The study answers whether and what kind of networking practice between social enterprise and other sectors exists, and what are the characteristics of cross-sectoral collaboration in this field. The findings of this pilot research may serve for developing indicators for more comprehensive national study and representative sample. Also, they may serve as a good basis for the development of specific local policies aimed at development of social enterprises. Finally, the study may offer a guidelines for further studies dealing with the influence of social development of regions on the specifics of local cross-sectoral collaborations.","[Peric, Julia] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia; [Vidovic, Davorka] Univ Zagreb, Fac Polit Sci, Lepusiceva 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek; University of Zagreb,"Peric, J (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek 31000, Croatia.",julia@efos.hr; dvidovic@fpzg.hr,"Perić, Julia/AAC-3447-2022","Perić, Julia/0000-0001-8031-7435",,,,,15,0,0,0,15,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,778,787,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600078,0

We find that adjustment costs represent around sixty percent of the difference between economic and book value of the assets for the representative firm, while rents from market power represent the other forty percent.

Our analysis focuses on behavior in the small noise double limit: we first take the noise level in agents' decisions to zero, and then take the population size to infinity. We show that in this double limit, escape from and transitions between equilibria can be described in terms of solutions to continuous optimal control problems. These are used in turn to characterize the asymptotics of the stationary distribution, and so to determine the stochastically stable states. We use these results to perform a complete analysis of evolution in three-strategy coordination games that satisfy the marginal bandwagon property and that have an interior equilibrium, with agents following the logit choice rule.","[Sandholm, William H.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Staudigl, Mathias] Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Maastricht University,"Sandholm, WH (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.;Staudigl, M (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",whs@ssc.wisc.edu; mathias.staudigl@gmail.com,,,"NSF [SES-0851580, SES-1155135, SES-1458992]; U.S. Air Force OSR [FA9550-09-0538]; Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF) [MA 09-017]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1458992] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); U.S. Air Force OSR; Vienna Science and Technology Fund (WWTF); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This article merges two working papers: Large deviations and stochastic stability in the small noise double limit, I: Theory and Large deviations and stochastic stability in the small noise double limit, II: The logit model.

However, it is shown here that the equality holds if the input matrices are random and the labour theory of value holds, in a sense to be specified, on average. Manuscripts recently published for the first time confirm that to the end Marx trusted his approach to the theory of value in that he continued to use the identity of the aggregates of capital and surplus in value and in price terms. His insistence was rooted in his philosophy. An attempt is made to clarify his use of a Hegelian methodology by comparing Hegel's and Marx's approaches to the foundation of the infinitesimal calculus. The article concludes with Marx's late reconsiderations of his theory of the falling rate of profit, which also continue to be based on the equality of profit and surplus value.","Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany; [Schefold, Bertram] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schefold, B (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt, Dept Econ, Gruneburgpl 1, D-60323 Frankfurt, Germany.",schefold@wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,32,23,25,3,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The literature also suggests that materialism is one of the main predictors of impulsive buying. It should also be noted that though the relationship of materialism and subjective well-being has been extensively explored, the ambiguity with respect to the directionality of the relationship still prevails in the literature. Subjective well-being recently became the subject of interest of scientists from different fields. However, the relationship of well-being with consumer buying behaviour received scarce attention. In particular the effect of life satisfaction (well-being) on consumers' tendency toward impulsive buying behaviour, except for a few attempts, has been nearly left unaddressed. This study attempts to explain the underlying mechanism of the relationship of subjective well-being and inclination toward impulsive buying behaviour. We hypothesise that subjective well-being affects the propensity toward impulsive buying indirectly through the presence of materialism. Lower levels of well-being increase materialism that in turn leads to a higher-level impulsive buying tendency. The results of the applied path analysis (regression based mediation) support the assumption of the indirect well-being-impulsive buying tendency link, mediated by the level of materialism.","[Seinauskiene, Beata; Rutelione, Ausra] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Social Sci Econ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Mascinskiene, Jurate; Petrike, Indre] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Seinauskiene, B (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Mkt, Social Sci Econ, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",Beata.seinauskiene@ktu.lt; jurate.mascinskiene@ktu.lt; indre.jucaityte@ktu.lt; ausra.rutelione@ktu.lt,"Šeinauskienė, Beata/ADO-5527-2022; Šeinauskienė, Beata/ABE-9315-2021","Šeinauskienė, Beata/0000-0003-1791-0214",,,,,88,9,11,11,54,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Therefore, the paper aims to highlight coherences of open innovation and internationalization by analyzing knowledge intensive SMEs in Lithuania. Referring to case studies approach it is disclosed how much firms are open in performing innovative activities by collaborating, how they share knowledge, what main profiles of national and foreign partners are and how open innovation is applied in internationalizing firm's activity. The research results indicated that while innovating firms were mostly focused on the R&D ecosystem oriented and innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem oriented networks at the national level. However, when internationalizing firm's activities, the preference to the international value chain oriented innovation network was disclosed. It contributes to the theory of open innovation from the knowledge intensive firms' internationalization point of view, especially in the understanding of open innovation's role in pursuing fast development in foreign markets while providing further knowledge on internationalization of firms originating from Baltic region area.","[Sekliuckiene, Jurgita] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Strateg Management, Social Sci Management & Business Adm, Gedimino St 50-415, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Sedziniauskiene, Rimante] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Strateg Management, Gedimino St 50-415, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Viburys, Vilius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Int Business, Gedimino St 50-415, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology; Kaunas University of Technology,"Sekliuckiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Strateg Management, Social Sci Management & Business Adm, Gedimino St 50-415, LT-44239 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurgita.sekliuckiene@ktu.lt; rimante.sedziniauskiene@ktu.lt; vilius.viburys@ktu.edu,"Sekliuckiene, Jurgita/P-4575-2015","Sekliuckiene, Jurgita/0000-0001-8899-3112",Research Council of Lithuania [GER -001/2015],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by the grant (No. GER -001/2015) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,62,7,8,8,57,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

More precisely this paper seeks to develop a more rigorous understanding of how adult education programs in several aspects of today's political, social and economic realms can empower individual actors, citizens, to involve in the societal evolution towards social cohesion, which consequently implies a transition to economic development. Transformative learning theory is such a tool to explain this empowerment to take action. What emerges from this paper is an alternative perspective on the benefits of adult education, differentiated from the dominant neoclassical approach framework of the Human Capital Theory, and relocated it in the methodological framework of International Political Economy. The latter serves as a tool of perceiving and understanding the existent complex context of political, economic and socio-cultural realities within European Union, coupled with the historical evolution of adult education. The upgrading of adult education standard is seen as central to the delivery of social cohesion and therefore to economic development.","[Sklias, Pantelis; Chatzimichailidou, Giota] Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Aristotelous 1 & Athinon Ave, Corinth 20100, Greece",University of Peloponnese,"Chatzimichailidou, G (通讯作者)，Univ Peloponnese, Dept Polit Sci & Int Relat, Aristotelous 1 & Athinon Ave, Corinth 20100, Greece.",psklias@hotmail.com; giotahatzi@gmail.com,,"CHATZIMICHAILIDOU, PANAGIOTA/0000-0002-7241-3678",,,,,61,0,0,1,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-40322-9; 978-3-319-40321-2,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,139,157,,10.1007/978-3-319-40322-9_9,0.0,,,19,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8CB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392198500009,0

For this purpose a literature study was carried out and an analysis of the operation of 8 political regions in Europe was performed. It has been proved that all these regions cooperate in terms of tourism, but only some of them become destinations. This article focuses on one of such regions, i. e. the Visegrad Group covering the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and the Slovak Republic. Based on an analysis of source documents answers were sought to three specific research problems: 1. Does tourism play a significant role among the declared priorities and actions implemented by the Visegrad Group's stakeholders? 2. Has the region's potential been reflected in unique, transnational tourism products? 3. Does the institutionalisation of tourism cooperation create favourable conditions for developing the brand and promotion of the transnational destination?

This knowledge has led us to the question: how probable is it that a sovereign might suffer serious solvency problems? The purpose of this study was to apply a multivariate discriminant analysis ( MDA) as an effective tool for a recognition and differentiation among defaulted and non-defaulted nations. The performed analysis was based on data up to 2012 for 26 emerging and 20 developed European countries. The results indicated a high predictive power for 'non-liquid' macroeconomic variables like import, export, investment, population and GDP ratios, underlining MDA as the most suitable model for insolvency prediction, compared to other popular methods like probit and logit model.

For service companies, forming and improving their internal environment is important for better marketability in the context of globalization (Albashiti et al, 2015). Nowadays the main engine driving the development of the market economy is competition that suggests rivalry with the aim to outscore the competitor. Leading positions can only be taken with a high competitive ability level. That stimulates market entities to seek new methods of increasing their marketability. A wholesome, transparent internal environment ultimately promotes financial growth and development of service companies. It is in the services sphere that all areas of social activity come together and form a unified functional system that serves the purpose of improving the quality of life and the overall standard of living. At the present stage of market development human resources are one of the least manageable internal factors a service company possesses and the only element capable of creating goods (Richnak, 2015; Daood, 2011; Putna, 2015). All other internal factors are inert resources that in their essence are incapable of creating anything until a person directs them at achieving the common goal, which is forming marketability (Avetisyan & Goloshchapova, 2012). Scientific approaches to the matter have evolved from seeing a person as part of the production mechanism to praising the human resource as the key one (Ambrozova et al., 2015; Kelperis, 2007; Svetozarovova & Cocul'ova 2015; Tomcikova, 2015). This study is dedicated to the correlation between better personnel training and the increased efficiency of service company management in the context of globalization.","[Volkova, Albina A.] Shpalernaya Ulitsa 40,Flat 7, St Petersburg 191123, Russia; [Plotnikov, Vladimir A.] Ulitsa Sikeyrosa 12,Flat 124, St Petersburg 194354, Russia",,"Plotnikov, VA (通讯作者)，Ulitsa Sikeyrosa 12,Flat 124, St Petersburg 194354, Russia.",albvolkova@yandex.ru; plotnikov_2000@mail.ru,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools [NSH-9726.2016.6],Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools(Leading Scientific Schools Program),Prepared by Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools NSH-9726.2016.6 The implementation of state economic policy through the development of tools of strategic and indicative planning.,,17,2,2,0,6,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2417,2424,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800300,0

But the household with less income and poor education background are more reliable to be financed by their social relationships such as friends and relatives. The house-ownerships play different roles in such selection. The household investors are less likely to turn to their social relationships. Comparatively, the house renters are harder to get money from banks as lack of collateral. Moreover, the household with the ownership of house for investment, would increase their risk preferences to increase amount of money financed by such channel and even afford a higher interests.","[Xue, Chen] Shenzhen Univ, Sch Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University,"Xue, C (通讯作者)，Shenzhen Univ, Sch Management, Shenzhen, Peoples R China.",chenxue@szu.edu.cn,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,978-3-319-22596-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,191,200,,10.1007/978-3-319-22596-8_13,0.0,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BJ0HR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000416839900013,0

Using input output tables we test empirically this hypothesis for 15 European countries in the years 1995-2007. The evidence confirms that the increase in productivity of the upstream sectors is positively influenced by the sector-level derived demand, according to the upstream rates of introduction of innovations and to the intensity of the user-producer interactions.

The results will highlight the effect of economic policy uncertainty on stock returns, given that such uncertainty rose to historically high levels after the recession of 2007-2009. In our case, uncertainty is related to tax, spending, and monetary policies. To identify the effect of different uncertainties (shocks) related to stochastic driving processes on stock returns, the empirical methodology allows factors relative to capital and labour tax rates, government spending, monetary policy and total factor productivity to play a leading role in the process of affecting stock returns, whereas the econometric methodology builds upon the stochastic volatility in mean (TVP-SVM) model by Koopman and Hol Uspensky (2002). The empirical findings document the importance of both policy and technological risks, especially after the recent financial crisis event. The findings also carry substantial implications for asset pricing modelling, indicating not only the time-varying character of shocks but also the asymmetric effect of such shocks on stock returns.

Institutional change can be studied using a variety of theoretical approaches. We study some of the main approaches to institutional change in original economic institutionalism and new institutional economics. First, after comparing the approaches of Emile Durkheim and Thorstein Veblen, we focus on the contributions of the instrumental value theory and other original institutional traditions in the study of institutional change. Second, new institutional economics improved on the weak points of rational choice institutionalism regarding institutional change and incorporated the institutions-as-rules approach (Douglass North) and the institutions-as-equilibria approach (Avner Greif, Masahiko Aoki). We analyze both approaches to institutional change. Furthermore, we present an updated nonintegral overview of approaches to institutional change, show several interconnections between original and new institutionalisms, and conclude that the dialogue between the different theories of institutional change is relevant and beneficial.","[Caballero, Gonzalo; Soto-Onate, David] Univ Vigo, Econ, Vigo, Spain",Universidade de Vigo,"Caballero, G (通讯作者)，Univ Vigo, Econ, Vigo, Spain.",,"Soto-Oñate, David/AAF-2529-2020; Soto-Oñate, David/JJC-7178-2023; Caballero, Gonzalo/GZG-3828-2022","Soto-Oñate, David/0000-0003-0366-2854;",Spanish Ministry of Economy [HAR2013-40760-R]; Xunta de Galicia [GRC2014/022],Spanish Ministry of Economy(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia),They acknowledge the financial support of the Spanish Ministry of Economy (HAR2013-40760-R) and Xunta de Galicia (GRC2014/022).

We assume that the innovation cycle consists of three phases, R&D, trial, and market introduction phases. We use a real option investment model to characterize firm value and risk dynamics over the innovation cycle and find that firm value is the sum of the value of assets in place and non-linear option values related to breakthrough, exit, and market introduction options. Firm risk over the innovation cycle is highly non-linear and quite distinct in different phases. During the R&D phase risk is high as the firm faces high operating leverage originating from R&D fixed costs together with technological uncertainty. During the trial phase risk is significantly lower and dominated by option risk to launch the product in the market while after the introduction of the product in the market risk is equivalent to the asset risk of the company. Our model is consistent with the view that positive excess returns of R&D intensive firms are a compensation for risk. Based on this insight we derive several testable predictions.

To prove abuse of market power, it must be demonstrated that the behaviour had that purpose rather than simply having that effect. In addition, it must be proven that the firm with market power took advantage' of that power. The Final Report recommends removal of these two restrictions.

This paper criticizes this opinion and shows that it rests on a mis-measure of the transition of the centrally planned economics of the ex-USSR, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and China developed by the official statistical agencies during the Cold War. This mis-measure has the effect of underestimating both the collapse of physical output in the ex-USSR and CEE during the transition and underestimating the growth of genuine national income after the creation of market economies where previously there had been none. This paper develops some alternative, much higher, estimates of the real growth of national income during the transition period.","MMU Business Sch, Mkt Operat & Digital Business, London SE13 7JT, England",,"Jefferies, W (通讯作者)，MMU Business Sch, Mkt Operat & Digital Business, 5 Ermine Rd, London SE13 7JT, England.",billjefferies@gmail.com,,,,,,,99,4,5,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

By constructing an endogenous growth model, where profit leakage to the South through LERs plays a key role, we obtain the following results. First, the relaxation of LERs in the South drives the relocation of firms from the North to the South, yielding a U-shaped growth rate. Second, our numerical simulations suggest that a sufficient relaxation of LERs is beneficial for the South, although the shared profit of joint ventures is maximized through the use of LERs.","[Morita, Tadashi] Kindai Univ, Higashiosaka, Osaka, Japan; [Takatsuka, Hajime] Kagawa Univ, Takamatsu, Kagawa 760, Japan; [Yamamoto, Kazuhiro] Osaka Univ, Osaka, Japan",Kindai University (Kinki University); Kagawa University; Osaka University,"Morita, T (通讯作者)，Kindai Univ, Higashiosaka, Osaka, Japan.",,"Takatsuka, Hajime/AAG-7683-2019","Takatsuka, Hajime/0000-0003-4958-2665","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [25870925, 24530303, 22330073, 20730183, 24730207]; Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [20730183, 25870925, 22330073, 15H03348, 24730207, 22243022, 24530303] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to Taiji Furusawa, Ken-ichi Hashimoto, two anonymous reviewers, Editor Masao Ogaki, and seminar and conference participants at Osaka University, Okayama University, University of Tokyo, Semiannual Meeting of Japanese Economic Association, the 2nd Asian Seminar in Regional Science and Asia Pacific Trade Seminars for helpful suggestions.

However, the performance of the developing countries in exporting garment and textiles is in fact, highly heterogeneous. While some of the developing countries such as, China, Vietnam and Bangladesh have been highly successful in exporting highly labor-intensive garment and textiles products, not all of the developing countries have been equally successful in doing so. Using cross-country panel data, an attempt has been made in this paper to ascertain the importance of infrastructure and business environment in explaining the heterogeneous performance in exporting garment and textiles by the developing countries. The paper empirically demonstrates that in addition to the availability of cheap labor, the availability of basic infrastructure, and a business friendly environment significantly affect the export of labor-intensive garment and textiles by the developing countries. The paper, thus, suggests to invest on infrastructure, and to develop a business friendly environment in developing countries to strongly link the growth potentials of labor-intensive products and economic growth.","[Mottaleb, Khondoker Abdul] Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Cereal Syst Initiat South Asia Mechanizat & Irrig, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Kalirajan, Kaliappa P.] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Econ & Govt, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",CGIAR; International Maize & Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT); Australian National University,"Mottaleb, KA (通讯作者)，Int Maize & Wheat Improvement Ctr CIMMYT, Cereal Syst Initiat South Asia Mechanizat & Irrig, Rd 53,House 10B,Gulshan 2, Dhaka, Bangladesh.",k.mottaleb@cgiar.org; Kaliappa.kalirajan@anu.edu.au,"Kalirajan, Kaliappa/X-5293-2019; Mottaleb, Khondoker A./I-1103-2019","Mottaleb, Khondoker A./0000-0002-2666-1152",,,,,39,3,3,1,87,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The key finding is that, contrary to the results for second-price auctions, the optimal ring at first-price auctions is generally not all-inclusive, especially when the number of bidders is large. Outsiders can free-ride the ring's suppressed competition and earn higher payoffs than by being a ring member; hence they choose not to participate in collusion. As a partial ring creates bidder asymmetry at first-price auctions, the overall allocation will be inefficient, which provides a basis for laws that outlaw collusion in auctions.

This neglect reflects the assumption that as a leader-leader model incorporating apparent excess rivalry it is presumably untenable, at least in theory. However, it is, in fact, observable in practice. Furthermore, the predicted excess competition is not only observable empirically but also accountable theoretically. We show how excess competition emerges when an upstream monopolist offers the downstream retailers a compensated game in which each acts as a leader. The outcome is not only stable but also benefits all involved actors, including consumers under vertically-related markets, such as those presided over by a monopolist producer. This result of emergent stability shows that the Bowley duopoly should be considered alongside other oligopoly models.","[Wako, Tohru] Tohoku Gakuin Univ, Sendai, Miyagi 9808511, Japan; [Ohta, Hiroshi] Aoyama Gakuin Univ, Tokyo 150, Japan",Tohoku Gakuin University; Aoyama Gakuin University,"Wako, T (通讯作者)，Tohoku Gakuin Univ, Dept Econ, Aoba Ku, 1-3-1 Tsuchitoi, Sendai, Miyagi 9808511, Japan.",twako@pop16.odn.ne.jp,,,,,,,26,0,0,0,4,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Developed countries that are better prepared to cope with climate change have stressed the importance of mitigation, which ideally requires a global agreement that is still lacking. This paper uses a theoretical framework to argue that in the absence of a binding international agreement on mitigation, Latin America should focus mainly on adaptation to cope with the consequences of climate change. This is not a recommendation that such economies indulge in free-riding. Instead, it is based on cost-benefit considerations, all else being equal. Only in the presence of a global binding agreement can the region hope to exploit its comparative advantage in the conservation and management of forests, which are a large carbon sink. The decision of which policies to implement should depend on the results of a thorough cost-benefit analysis of competing projects, yet very little is known or has been carried out in this area to date. Research should be directed toward cost-benefit analysis of alternative climate change policies. Policymakers should compare other investments that are also pressing in the region, such as interventions to reduce water and air pollution, and determine which will render the greatest benefits.","[Feld, Brian] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Urbana, IL USA; [Galiani, Sebastian] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Galiani, Sebastian] NBER, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",galiani@econ.umd.edu,,"Feld, Brian/0000-0001-6940-2372",,,,,79,7,7,0,22,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Simulation optimisation is a powerful tool for solving these problems. Moreover, fitness landscape analysis techniques provide an efficient approach to better selection of a suitable optimisation algorithm. The concept and techniques of fitness landscape analysis are described. A formalised scheme for simulation optimisation enhanced with fitness landscape analysis is given. Benchmark fitness landscape analysis is performed to find relations between efficiency of an optimisation algorithm and structural features of a fitness landscape. Case study in simulation optimisation of vehicle routing and scheduling is described. Various optimisation scenarios with application of the fitness landscape analysis are discussed and investigated.","[Merkuryeva, Galina; Bolshakov, Vitaly] Riga Tech Univ, Dept Modelling & Simulat, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia",Riga Technical University,"Merkuryeva, G (通讯作者)，Riga Tech Univ, Dept Modelling & Simulat, 1 Kalku Str, LV-1658 Riga, Latvia.",galina.merkurjeva@rtu.lv,,,Riga Technical University through the Scientific Research Project Competition for Young Researchers [ZP-2014/21],Riga Technical University through the Scientific Research Project Competition for Young Researchers,Support for this work was provided by the Riga Technical University through the Scientific Research Project Competition for Young Researchers No. ZP-2014/21.,,49,3,3,0,14,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

This practice has an adverse effect on commercial banks' monitoring incentives, encouraging the pursuit of private rents by entrepreneurs.

The analysis reveals the non-steady nature of economic change and shows that the adaptation pattern depends both on the innovation's factor-saving bias and on the extent of the bias, which determines the strength of the selection pressure on non-innovators.

The effect of subsidies as a policy tool depends on individual's response to the cost of vaccine. However, there have been few studies on the effects of vaccine costs on vaccination uptake. Using regional variations in vaccination subsidy amount within Japan's current immunization program, we examined the impact of subsidies for the cost of influenza vaccine on the vaccination rates and on two health outcome measures. Our results show that an increase in the subsidy amount by 1,000 yen (10 USD) leads to a one percentage point increase in the vaccination rate among the elderly, suggesting that vaccination rate is responsive to the costs of vaccination. On the other hand, we found no substantial effects on health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Theory predicts that forward contracting can not only increase the likelihood of collusion but can also serve as a credible commitment device that minimizes firms' incentives to deviate from collusion. Focusing on strategic choices, the experimental design investigates the impact of forward contracting on collusion and contrasts it to the effect of adding one additional competitor. While the findings do not provide evidence that a forward market results in more collusion, the findings suggest that forward contracting can reinforce collusion when firms tacitly collude.

This study examines the short-run and long-run relationship and causality between female labour force participation rate, infant mortality rate and fertility in a developing country in Asia - Malaysia. We employ the unit root test which allows for two structural breaks, and the break dates are then used as dummy variables in the bounds testing procedure within an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modelling approach and Granger-causality test. The results indicate that mortality changes have a significant and positive long-run impact on fertility rate and women's child bearing decisions are unaffected by their employment situation.

Four main facts emerge: (1) intermediate inputs constitute a major share of imports and dominate German imports since at least the 1970s; (2) the German workforce increasingly specializes in workplace activities and job requirements that are typically considered non-offshorable, mainly within and not between sectors and occupations; (3) the imputed activity and job requirement content of German imports grows relatively more intensive in work characteristics typically considered offshorable; and (4) labour-market institutions at German trade partners are largely unrelated to the changing task content of German imports but German sector-level outcomes exhibit some co-variation consistent with faster task offshoring in sectors exposed to lower labour-market tightness.

However, since deployment of fiber access networks is subject to high risk for operators, a core question faced by regulatory institutions is how to optimally design the regulatory framework to incentivize investment. This work employs recent EU27 panel data and examines the role of regulatory policies and competition controlling for relevant supply and demand side factors and the investment dynamics. The results indicate that relevant forms of previous broadband access regulation have a negative impact on investment in new fiber infrastructure. Furthermore, infrastructure-based competition from mobile operators and the replacement effect stemming from the incumbents' existing infrastructure exert a negative impact on investment incentives. Finally, there is clear evidence of adjustment costs underlying the fiber deployment process.","[Briglauer, Wolfgang] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany; [Briglauer, Wolfgang] Res Inst Regulatory Econ WU, Vienna, Austria",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Briglauer, W (通讯作者)，Ctr European Econ Res ZEW Mannheim, POB 103443, D-68034 Mannheim, Germany.",briglauer@zew.de,,,Deutsche Telekom AG,Deutsche Telekom AG,"The author is grateful to two anonymous referees for highly valuable and insightful comments as well as Deutsche Telekom AG for co-funding a previous and related research project and to Tim Radtke for research assistance.

The impliedmarket failures are due to the agents' attitudes toward risk, to risk shifting, and the uniform price for both types of energy. Under the plausible assumptions that consumers are prudent and at least as risk-averse as the producers of brown energy, the risk can be efficiently managed by placing a tariff on fuel imports (which is equivalent to taxing carbon emissions in the model at hand) and taxing green energy. The need to tax green energy contradicts the widespread view that subsidization of green energy is an appropriate means to enhance energy security in countries depending on risky fossil fuel imports.","[Eichner, Thomas] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, D-58097 Hagen, Germany; [Pethig, Ruediger] Univ Siegen, Dept Econ, D-57068 Siegen, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Universitat Siegen,"Eichner, T (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 41, D-58097 Hagen, Germany.",thomas.eichner@fernuni-hagen.de; pethig@vwl.wiwi.uni-siegen.de,,"Pethig, Ruediger/0000-0002-4037-4416",,,,,34,2,2,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Standard mechanisms in which an arbitrator can enforce her decisions are usually not feasible because disputants are sovereign entities. Nevertheless, we find that this limitation is inconsequential. Despite only being capable of making unenforceable recommendations, mediators can be equally effective as arbitrators. By using recommendation strategies that do not reveal that one player is weak to a strong opponent, a mediator can effectively circumvent the unenforceability constraint. This is because these strategies make the strong player agree to recommendations that yield the same payoff as arbitration in expectation. This result relies on the capability of mediators to collect confidential information from the disputants, before making their recommendations.

In these markets, acquiring information not only reduces the expected variability of the fundamentals for a given distribution (i.e. risk). It also mitigates the uncertainty about the true distribution of the fundamentals. Agents who lack knowledge of this distribution cannot correctly interpret the information other investors impound into the price. We show that, due to uncertainty aversion, the incentives to reduce uncertainty by acquiring information increase as more investors acquire information. When uncertainty is high enough, information acquisition decisions become strategic complements and lead to multiple equilibria. Swift changes in information demand can drive large price swings even after small changes in Knightian uncertainty.","[Mele, Antonio] USI Lugano, Swiss Finance Inst, Lugano, Switzerland; [Mele, Antonio] CEPR, London, England; [Sangiorgi, Francesco] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Swiss Finance Institute (SFI); Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Stockholm School of Economics,"Mele, A (通讯作者)，USI Lugano, Swiss Finance Inst, Lugano, Switzerland.",,,,,,,,42,39,46,2,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We use a linear public goods experiment design with heterogeneous endowments and peer sanctioning. In the Punishment treatment, aggregate contributions towards the public good are significantly higher amongst unequal groups, with low endowment players contributing the greatest endowment share. Sanctioning is significantly lower in unequal groups but demand for punishment is similar, irrespective of differences in relative costs. Free-riding drives punishment, but retaliation is another important motivator (specifically in unequal groups). In equal groups, antisocial punishment of cooperators is more common. The effect of real wealth and inequality on contributions and punishment is less salient, possibly due to real wealth not being discernible in the experimental context. Interestingly, social attitudes are important in explaining sanctioning behavior, indicating that distrust in formal institutions, and specifically in the top-down quota allocation process, may have a significant impact on behavioral outcomes and the effectiveness of community sanctioning mechanisms.

The first is that the need to alleviate the burden of distortionary taxation may justify the choice of a positive inflation rate. The second is based on compelling evidence that the degree of price and wage indexation falls with trend inflation. In fact, we find that a proper characterization of the joint evolution of fiscal variables and nominal rigidities has a strong impact on the Ramsey optimal policies, implying optimal inflation dynamics that are consistent with the observed evolution of U.S. trend inflation. By contrast, tax policies have been too lax, especially at the time of the controversial Bush tax cuts.","[Acocella, Nicola; Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni] Univ Roma La Sapienza, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Tirelli, Patrizio] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",Sapienza University Rome; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Di Bartolomeo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Econ & Law, Via Castro Laurenziano 9, I-00161 Rome, Italy.",giovanni.dibartolomeo@uniroma1.it,"Tirelli, Patrizio/AAM-3422-2020; Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/K-3030-2015","tirelli, patrizio/0000-0002-0171-8861; Di Bartolomeo, Giovanni/0000-0001-5016-8483",MIUR (PRIN); EC [320278-RASTANEWS],"MIUR (PRIN)(Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR)Research Projects of National Relevance (PRIN)); EC(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre)","The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees, Efrem Castelnuovo, Luisa Lambertini, George Kouretas, and seminar participants at the Annual International Conference on Macroeconomic Analysis and Finance (Crete, May 2013) and Advances in DSGE models (Milan Bicocca, June 2013) for useful comments on earlier drafts.

Notwithstanding, the issue of differentiating between the impacts of the attributes per se vs. the impact of the attribute levels shown in the experiment has been something of a challenge for researchers. Recent studies suggest that Best-Worst scaling (B-W) experiments would allow for the possibility of making this discrimination. In this study we combine B-W data with more traditional SC data to model the choice of residential location; we also allow for observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the combined models. To the best of our knowledge, this type of data fusion has not been used before in this context. Our dataset is fairly unique and corresponds to a sample of individuals interested in acquiring a flat in the centre of Santiago, Chile, from whom both types of responses were elicited. In addition, we have available a larger independent validation sample that responded to a second SC exercise in the same location and time period. We found that the best-fit model corresponded to pooling the 'best' and SC responses (i.e., ignoring the 'worst' data), while accounting for systematic taste variations (observable heterogeneity) and allowing for a correct treatment of the pseudo-panel nature of the data through error components (unobserved heterogeneity). Our results imply that analysts could get valuable additional information to increase their understanding on individuals' behaviour when considering the joint use of B-W Scaling and SC data incorporating heterogeneity.

A sequential disclosure rule is shown to implement an ascending price auction in which each losing bidder learns his true valuation, but the winning bidder's information is truncated from below. As the auction ends, the winning bidder only has limited information, namely that his valuation is sufficiently high to win the auction. The sequential mechanism implements the allocation of the handicap auction of Eso and Szentes (2007) but strengthens the participation constraints of the bidders from interim to posterior constraints. Due to the limited disclosure of information, the participation constraints (and incentive constraints) of all the bidders are satisfied with respect to all information revealed by the mechanism. In the special case in which the bidders have no private information initially, the seller can extract the entire surplus. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We use Slovenian data on the credit ratings of nonfinancial enterprises and analyze their reliability as predictors of corporate default to test whether banks in financial distress systematically underestimate credit risk. Our results show that the predictive accuracy of credit ratings deteriorated during the Great Recession both in absolute terms and relative to the benchmark econometric model that uses publicly available data only. Predictive accuracy was lowest for domestically owned banks and, within this group, for small banks. These results can be linked to incentives to underestimate credit risk due to exposure to nonperforming loans and the limitations on raising additional capital. Given that credit ratings are closely related to loan-loss provisions, our analysis indicates that underestimation of credit risk served to inflate banks' books. These findings can rationalize the results of the comprehensive review of the Slovenian banking system in 2013, which revealed significant capital shortfalls, on average, but also significant differences in capital shortfalls across groups of banks with different incentives to underestimate risk. Robustness checks confirm the validity of our conclusions. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for the results of a similar comprehensive review in the euro area prior to the launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism in 2014.","[Brezigar-Masten, Arjana] Univ Primorska, Fac Math Nat Sci & Informat Technol, Koper, Slovenia; [Brezigar-Masten, Arjana] Univ Primorska, Inst Macroecon Anal & Dev, Koper, Slovenia; [Masten, Igor] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia; [Masten, Igor] Bank Slovenia, Res, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia; [Volk, Matjaz] Bank Slovenia, Ljubljana 1505, Slovenia",University of Primorska; University of Primorska; University of Ljubljana,"Masten, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Pl 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",igor.masten@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,22,7,8,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Conversely, when firms compete a la Bertrand, we demonstrate that it is always optimal to pursue complete nationalization.","[Cai, Dapeng] Nagoya Univ, Inst Adv Res, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Karasawa-Ohtashiro, Yukio] Nanzan Univ, Fac Econ, Showa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4668673, Japan",Nagoya University,"Cai, DP (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Inst Adv Res, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",cai@iar.nagoya-u.ac.jp; yukioko@nanzan-u.ac.jp,,,"JSPS KAKENHI [26780143, 26380325, 26284014, 24530277]; Daiko Foundation; National Social Science Fund of China [14BJY017]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24530277, 26780143, 26284014] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Daiko Foundation(Daiko Foundation); National Social Science Fund of China; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The first author (the corresponding author) acknowledges financial supports from the JSPS KAKENHI (Grant Number 26780143, 26380325, and 26284014), the Daiko Foundation, and the National Social Science Fund of China (Grand Number 14BJY017).

The firm initially has capacity to sell an established product. Additionally, it also has the option to undertake an R&D project, which upon completion allows the firm to introduce a new vertically and horizontally differentiated product to the market, thereby extending its current product range. The breakthrough probability of detecting the new product depends on both the value of the firm's R&D stock and its current R&D investment. It is shown that the initial production capacity for the established product influences the intensity of R&D activities of the firm. In particular, there are constellations such that for large initial production capacity for the established product the firm never invests in R&D and the new product is never introduced. For small initial capacity the firm keeps investing in R&D implying that eventually the new product is always introduced. Finally, for an intermediate range of initial capacity levels the firm initially invests in product R&D, but then reduces these investments to zero. In this scenario the new product is introduced with a positive probability, which is however substantially smaller than 1. From a technical perspective this analysis gives the example of a new type of Skiba threshold phenomenon in the framework of a multi-mode optimization model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper reports an experiment where the defender may have the advantage of observing a prediction market on the aggressor's action. The results of the experiments indicate that: the use of prediction markets does not increase the defender's win rate; prediction markets contain reliable information regarding aggressors' decisions that is not being exploited by defenders; and the existence of a prediction market does not alter the behavior of the aggressor whose behavior is being forecast.

Government spending multipliers under this constraint are computed and compared with fiscal multipliers in normal times, that is, where the central bank sets the nominal interest rate via a Taylor rule. The trade elasticity and the parameter measuring home bias in consumption play an important role in determining the size of the multiplier. The multipliers are not necessarily large under the ZLB constraint. However, compared with the fiscal multipliers when the central bank sets the nominal interest rate according to a Taylor rule, the multipliers under the ZLB are bigger. Moreover, the persistence parameter of the binding ZLB plays a crucial role.","Univ Freiburg, Inst Allgemeine Wirtschaftsforsch, Abt Wirtschaftstheorie, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Flotho, S (通讯作者)，Univ Freiburg, Inst Allgemeine Wirtschaftsforsch, Abt Wirtschaftstheorie, D-79085 Freiburg, Germany.",stefanie.flotho@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,31,8,8,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Uncertain governance choices require that agents exercise judgment in the absence of other means of estimating the payoffs associated with complex combinations of transaction attributes, contractual contingencies, and governance structures. Judgments are made on an experimental basis to incrementally improve actors' heterogeneous cognitive representations of the contractual landscape. I argue that uncertain governance choices are subject to specific decision-biases that interact with the potentially corrective function of current organization and asymmetries in actors' access to decision-supporting systems. These asymmetries may affect the contracting parties' preferences over differential governance structures. Specifically, by overestimating individual unbiased rationality and disregarding how access to decision-supporting systems may affect governance choice, TCE runs the risk of underestimating the degree of vertical integration in actual firms.","Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Inst Econ Res, Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hallberg, NL (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Inst Econ Res, Lund, Sweden.",niklas.hallberg@fek.lu.se,,"Hallberg, Niklas Lars/0000-0003-3871-0000",,,,,107,16,19,1,34,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

For example, the application of a multinomial logit model in a party system with J parties results in maximally J - 1 parameters for chooser-specific attributes (e.g., sex and age). For the specification of alternative-specific attributes (usually: positions on issues and issue distances), maximally J parameters for each political issue can be estimated. Thus, a model of party choice with five parties based on three political issues and ten voter attributes already produces 59 possible coefficients. As soon as we allow for interaction effects to detect segment-specific reactions to issues, the situation is even aggravated. In order to systematically and efficiently identify relevant predictors in voting models, we derive and use Lasso-type regularized parameter selection techniques that take into account both individual- and alternative-specific variables. Most importantly, our new algorithm can handle for the first time the alternative-wise specification of the attributes of alternatives. Applying the specifically adjusted Lasso method to the 2009 German Parliamentary Election, we demonstrate that our approach massively reduces the models' complexity and simplifies their interpretation. Lasso-penalization clearly outperforms the simple ML estimator. The results are illustrated by innovative visualization methods, the so-called effect star plots. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This is particularly important for aid recipients, the focus of this paper. Theory shows that although there are many ways in which aid can have indirect effects on tax revenue, the direct effects arise because aid and tax are alternative sources of revenue and political economy factors influence the choices made by government. Aid may discourage tax effort if viewed as a politically less costly source of revenue. Under different conditions, the policies and reforms associated with aid may increase revenue, through promoting growth, encouraging more efficient tax structures, or supporting reforms to tax administration. While cross-country evidence reveals no systematic pattern, country studies show that aid can be associated with administrative and efficiency reforms to increase tax revenue. The conclusion discusses how aid and donors can promote increasing domestic tax revenue.","[Morrissey, Oliver] Univ Nottingham, CREDIT, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Morrissey, Oliver] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham; University of Nottingham,"Morrissey, O (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, CREDIT, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",oliver.morrissey@nottingham.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,15,16,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In this setting the type of each agent is assumed to be evolving according to a first order Markov process and is independent of the types of other agents. However, the valuation of an agent can depend on the types of other agents, which makes the problem fall into an interdependent valuation setting. Designing truthful mechanisms in this setting is non-trivial in view of an impossibility result which says that for interdependent valuations, any efficient and ex-post incentive compatible mechanism must be a constant mechanism, even in a static setting. Mezzetti (Econometrica 72(5):1617-1626, 2004) circumvents this problem by splitting the decisions of allocation and payment into two stages. However, Mezzetti's result is limited to a static setting and moreover in the second stage of that mechanism, agents are weakly indifferent about reporting their valuations truthfully. This paper provides a first attempt at designing a dynamic mechanism which is efficient, strict ex-post incentive compatible and ex-post individually rational in a setting with interdependent values and Markovian type evolution.","[Nath, Swaprava] Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi, India; [Zoeter, Onno; Dance, Christopher R.] Xerox Res Ctr Europe, Meylan, France; [Narahari, Y.] Indian Inst Sci, Bangalore 560012, Karnataka, India",Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi; Xerox; Indian Institute of Science (IISC) - Bangalore,"Nath, S (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, Econ & Planning Unit, Delhi, India.",swaprava@gmail.com,,"Nath, Swaprava/0000-0001-8309-5006",Tata Consultancy Services (TCS),Tata Consultancy Services (TCS),"We are grateful to Ruggiero Cavallo, David C.

To achieve this aim, panel data techniques (pooled OLS, fixed effects and GMM) were employed on a sample of SSA countries. The empirical results showed that efficiency and strategic asset seeking factors influenced FDI activities in SSA for the period investigated. Market size also influenced FDI however this was less robust to specifications. Surprisingly, FDI in SSA was not resource seeking. Furthermore, a statistical test confirmed structural and behavioural differences in FDI determinants between SSA sub-regional groups and when analysed separately, FDI in West and Central SSA was market and efficiency seeking while FDI in South and East Africa was best explained by efficiency seeking factors. Based on the empirical findings, a number of policy implications were derived. These policy implications include further implementation of policies targeted at increasing and sustaining trade liberalisation and trade diversification, control of corruption, credible upgrades and productive investments in infrastructure, and support for human capital accumulation as FDI is increasingly directed towards R&D, innovation and strategic asset activities.

Keynes's result (square rule), derived from the breakeven condition, was just a simplification to illustrate the importance of expected interest changes on the total return of an investor's portfolio, constrained to money and consols. Keynes's world is not one of yield, but one of total return, where price and yield form the returns. This paper aims to show that the same breakeven method can be used, but instead of a simple two-asset model (money and a specific financial asset such as consols) this framework can be generalized to take into account a broad spectrum of financial assets including perpetuals, zero-coupon, coupon bearing securities for different maturities and investment horizons, and risk preferences to analyze the impacts of expected changes in interest rates on total expected return. By using Keynes's breakeven condition and total return analysis, it is possible to generalize this argument for different types of securities (and not just consols) and it follows the approach of chapter 17 of the General Theory. In this paper, I update and extend Keynes's analysis to allow for different holding periods (or investment horizons) and different financial instruments. When we take into account duration and convexity effects, and given rising expected changes in interest rate, we get an upward sloping demand for securities with short duration relative to investment horizon rather than a downward sloping speculative money demand schedule. In this framework, duration and breakeven analysis play a crucial role in the demand for financial assets as bank's expectation on rate changes will generate a demand for short (or long) duration financial assets impacting asset prices.","[Rezende, Felipe] Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA",,"Rezende, F (通讯作者)，Hobart & William Smith Coll, Econ, Geneva, NY 14456 USA.",,,,,,,,45,1,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

A novel experimental environment is developed to capture the tension between increasing returns to group size and attaining a group policy closest to an ideal point. Subjects can move freely between locations, with group policy either fixed by location or determined by member vote. A primary goal is to assess which of two stability concepts common to the group formation literature predicts which groups agents sort into. The same set of Nash stable partitions exist in each condition, with the efficient, strong Nash stable state requiring subjects to form heterogeneous groups and compromise on policy. I find that subjects who are only able to move between locations with fixed policies always over-segregate, rather than build efficient heterogeneous groups. When mobility is combined with the ability to vote on local policy, most subjects reach the efficient partition. This shows outcomes cannot be determined by considering the existence of stable states alone and that consideration must also be given to subtle aspects of the system dynamics. Further, it suggests that experiments may play an important role in understanding these group formation dynamics.","[Robbett, Andrea] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Robbett, A (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",arobbett@middlebury.edu,,,Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science,Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science,"I thank Charles Plott, Leeat Yariv, Peter Matthews, Guillaume Frechette, Rod Kiewiet, John Ledyard, Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, and the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory.

We first analyse the structure and dynamics of ODI. We propose three testable hypotheses including technology sourcing, resource seeking, and political linkage. Various estimates show that technology sourcing is supported moderately, whereas resource seeking serves one of primary driving forces. Crucially, the motive of political linkage is significantly related to ODI and it is particularly relevant to developing destinations. This finding indicates that China tends to invest in developing countries with high political risk, which is in contrast with the prediction of the FDI theory. Furthermore, a developing country with high political risk seems to be the favoured destination for China's ODI to acquire technologies and resources.","[Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli, Taiwan; [Cheng, Mei-Chun] Taiwan Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lin, Chun-Hung] Tamkang Univ, Dept Ind Econ, New Taipei 25137, Taiwan",National Central University; Tamkang University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Jhongli, Taiwan.",chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; maggie-jacky@livemail.tw; chlin@mail.tku.edu.tw,,,,,,,43,8,8,0,46,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

I test for site selection bias in the context of the Opower energy conservation programs, using 111 randomized control trials involving 8.6 million households across the United States. Predictions based on rich microdata from the first 10 replications substantially overstate efficacy in the next 101 sites. Several mechanisms caused this positive selection. For example, utilities in more environmentalist areas are more likely to adopt the program, and their customers are more responsive to the treatment. Also, because utilities initially target treatment at higher-usage consumer subpopulations, efficacy drops as the program is later expanded. The results illustrate how program evaluations can still give systematically biased out-of-sample predictions, even after many replications.","[Allcott, Hunt] NYU, NBER, Jpal, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Allcott, H (通讯作者)，NYU, NBER, Jpal, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,Sloan Foundation,Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

Focusing on dowry, we develop a simple model of the marriage market with intrahousehold bargaining to understand the incentives for brides' parents to allocate the rights over the dowry between their daughter and her groom. In doing so, we clarify and formalize the dual role'' of dowry-as a premortem bequest and as a market clearing price-identified in the literature. We use the model to shed light on the intriguing observation that in contrast to other rights, women's rights over the dowry tend to deteriorate with development. We show how marriage payments are utilized even when they are inefficient, and how the marriage market mitigates changes in other dimensions of women's rights even to the point where women are worse off following a strengthening of such rights. We also generate predictions for when marital transfers will disappear and highlight the importance of female human capital for the welfare of women.","[Anderson, Siwan] Simon Fraser Univ, Vancouver Sch Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; Simon Fraser Univ, Canadian Inst Adv Res, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada",Simon Fraser University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Simon Fraser University,"Anderson, S (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Vancouver Sch Econ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,,,ASBRG; CIFAR,ASBRG; CIFAR(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)),"We thank three anonymous referees, the editors Elhanan Helpman and Robert Barro, as well as Patrick Francois, Andrew Newman, Debraj Ray, and Mauricio Drelichman for suggestions.

We examine the case of untouchability rules in India that forbid sharing water with low castes. We show that homicide rates of low castes individuals at the district level are positively and significantly correlated with public access to water, while no such relationship can be found as far as higher caste homicide rates are concerned. This relationship, which is robust to many econometric specifications, is seen as a testimony of the upholding of untouchability practices, despite having been outlawed for more than 60 years by the Constitution of India. This paper provides the first quantitative assessment of the link between access to public goods, untouchability norms and violence at the sub-continent scale. Finally, this study underlines the need for policy makers to partly shift their attention from the quantitative allocation of public goods to the effective access to these goods.

I explore political trust through an experiment in which representative agents can i in prove their Own welfare at the expense of voters. Collective voting and valuable seniority advantage make it difficult to foster accountability for trust betrayal. Subjects participate in a voting game with uncertain payoff redistribution, which allows agents to conceal self-interested behavior. The treatments vary the amount of information to voters compared to a baseline in which they are only aware of their payoff each period. I test to see whether revealing the intentions of the agent spurs a reaction to trust betrayal and whether accountability is comparison dependent. The collective-action problem and value of seniority affect observed accountability, but having a yardstick comparison across agents significantly increases accountability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

There is a price indicated for the flowers. However, as no monitoring takes place and the farmer has never enforced formal law, people can decide how much they want to pay. If people were to make a narrow rational choice, they would simply take the unsupervised flowers without paying and the market would collapse. However, payments were and are in general high enough to make considerable profits. The business is flourishing. In the experiment, we left several different messages next to the cashbox to influence payments. Legal threats and moral appeals were studied in similar field settings with mixed results. We hypothesize that legal threats and moral appeals are less important than the context in which people make their decision. Once we indicated that the flower field belonged to a family, turnover and payment rate per customer increased substantially. We also obseiyed a switch to fewer but more expensive flowers. However, no significant results were obtained for other treatments: consulting framing, moral appeal and legal threats. The results show that to understand the market success of a business, we have to investigate the expectations and opinions which people associate with the specific business context.

Compared with other dynamic Asian economies, the Singapore government's approach to intervene in the economy is both more extensive and more intrusive, but with a narrow focus on GDP growth and surplus accumulation as the primary objectives. The ruling government's near complete dominance in politics has enabled it to mobilize resources to create the preconditions for strong GDP growth and high savings. But the impact on the broader development of the economy and the long term sustainability of growth is less obvious. High GDP growth and strong savings have been achieved without developing the inherent production and indigenous innovation capacity, securing a larger hinterland and providing a less skewed income distribution and higher quality of life for residents. As the economy enters a new phase where more complex and multi-faceted development is needed, the Singapore government will require more than its vaunted competency in mobilizing resources to deliver the outcome.","[Song, Tan Kim] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore; [Bhaskaran, Manu] Centennial Asia Advisors Pte Ltd, Singapore 079906, Singapore",Singapore Management University,"Song, TK (通讯作者)，Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, 90 Stamford Rd, Singapore 178903, Singapore.",kstan@smu.edu.sg; manu@centennialasia.com,"TAN, Kim Song/D-1448-2009; song, tan/AAF-1657-2020",,,,,,25,0,0,3,20,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

We find that a firm's borrowing costs decrease with relationship strength, proxied by the share of bank debt provided by the lender. Borrowing costs, however, rise with relationship length. While the increase over time is weak on average, bank-dependent borrowers face a substantial premium after several relationship years. Switching the lender initially leads to only a small price discount on average. However, the discount is considerable for borrowers that switch and had a strong relationship with their previous lender. Our results suggest that close lending relationships lead to benefits for the firm, but may also imply hold-up costs in the long term.","Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Stein, I (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",ingrid.stein@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,25,5,5,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

This paper introduces a model of environmental policy for mining that accounts for bankruptcy risk, profit risk, and a mobilization cost that applies if, following bankruptcy, rehabilitation is funded by the regulator or investor. The results show that making deep-pocketed investors who are never judgement-proof liable for a share of rehabilitation cost is optimal. The share of extended liability depends on the policy setting, control rights over the firm and the firm's rent. If the firm has control rights over bankruptcy, optimal liability is at least the full cost of rehabilitation. If the investor has control rights then optimal liability is partial. Partial liability also applies when the policy is based on an insurance contract. Mobilization costs for a regulator to engage in rehabilitation mean it is socially optimal for an investor to prop-up a firm making moderate losses to complete mine rehabilitation.","Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia",University of Western Australia,"White, B (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Agr & Resource Econ, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.",benedict.white@uwa.edu.au,"White, Benedict/D-1434-2011","White, Benedict/0000-0001-7256-2449",ARC [DP0988368]; Australian Research Council [DP0988368] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,ARC(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"The author gratefully acknowledges helpful suggestions from two referees, Graeme Doole, Veronique Florec, Michael Burton and David Pannell.

Past 60-month returns have a significant positive effect, which provides a direct means of ruling out leverage hypothesis as an explanation of asymmetric volatility. The positive effect of distant-past returns is puzzling.

I explicitly model the housing tenure choices of households. Lenders offer individual-specific mortgage contracts to home buyers, and the terms of these contracts are endogenously determined. I find that, as lenders have better information about the households, the average mortgage premium, foreclosure rate, and homeownership rate all increase while average down payment decreases. Hence, improvements in information technology can rationalize the relaxation of mortgage credit terms, which has been suggested as one of the main reasons for the latest financial crisis.

In particular, prior studies have focused on two main hypotheses about firms engaged in international activities such as exporting and investing abroad; namely, self-selection of more productive firms into international activities and learning-by-doing international activities. This paper is the first study that explores these hypotheses in regard to firms' use of free trade agreements (FTAs). We first estimate the propensity score for firms' use of FTA schemes, and find that larger firms are more likely to participate. Then, by conducting matching analysis using the propensity scores, we find that, at least in the short run, the use of FTAs does not change bilateral exports, bilateral imports and employment but does raise the share of local inputs.","Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Bangkok, Thailand",,"Hayakawa, K (通讯作者)，Bangkok Res Ctr, Inst Developing Econ, Bangkok, Thailand.",kazunobu_hayakawa@ide-jetro.org,"Hayakawa, Kazunobu/HZM-4324-2023; Hayakawa, Kazunobu/T-9427-2019","Hayakawa, Kazunobu/0000-0003-0032-9060;",,,,,43,5,5,0,23,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The age pattern in male-female wage differences in the post-displacement job is similar, with the largest differences occurring at ages 20 to 29 and over 40.

As to the latter, our findings suggest that these central banks change their policy rates in discrete fashion, i.e. only when the deviation between its (unobservable) optimal rate and actual rate surpasses certain threshold values. Estimates of Taylor rule contain relevant economic variables, including real exchange rate. However, evidence is offered that in Romania, Serbia and Albania the exchange rate is a goal for itself, while in the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary it is an instrument to achieve inflation target, and this is related to different features of these two sets of economies.

The main results are that (1) the safety externalities associated with heavy vehicles are greater than the environmental ones; (2) under fuel economy standards, vehicle weights have recently decreased with little likely effect on accident deaths; and (3) similar environmental benefits could be combined with substantial reductions in deaths by implementing higher gasoline taxes.

When institutions work imperfectly, though, banks discount the value of effective collateral, thereby reducing lending volume. This process has been described in US states with difficult foreclosure procedures, but here we show that it also matters for poor countries after a violent conflict, when collateralizable assets have a heightened probability of being destroyed. We use firm-level data on loans in Sub-Saharan Africa to show that to get a loan, firms in countries with recent conflict need to pledge additional collateral. While some OLS offer supporting evidence, the effect is larger and more precisely estimated when we use quantile regressions to focus on the subgroup of firms that face tougher collateral requirements, which suggests that this effect is heterogeneous within countries. This mechanism is a novel channel that relates peace to economic growth and convergence through financial markets.","[Rubin, Janet; Wagner, Rodrigo] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wagner, Rodrigo] Univ Chile, Sch Business & Econ, Santiago, Chile; [Wagner, Rodrigo] CID Harvard, Cambridge, MA USA",Tufts University; Universidad de Chile,"Wagner, R (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",rodrigo_wagner@post.harvard.edu,,"Wagner, Rodrigo/0000-0002-7160-4413",British Department for International Development as part of a Growth Diagnostics [40012991],British Department for International Development as part of a Growth Diagnostics,A preliminary portion of this research was funded by the British Department for International Development as part of a Growth Diagnostics in 2009 [grant number 40012991].,,12,4,4,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The History and Future of Workplace Automation,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,US LABOR-MARKET; TECHNOLOGICAL-CHANGE; POLARIZATION; INEQUALITY; GROWTH,"In this essay, I begin by identifying the reasons that automation has not wiped out a majority of jobs over the decades and centuries. Automation does indeed substitute for labor-as it is typically intended to do. However, automation also complements labor, raises output in ways that leads to higher demand for labor, and interacts with adjustments in labor supply. Journalists and even expert commentators tend to overstate the extent of machine substitution for human labor and ignore the strong complementarities between automation and labor that increase productivity, raise earnings, and augment demand for labor. Changes in technology do alter the types of jobs available and what those jobs pay. In the last few decades, one noticeable change has been a polarization of the labor market, in which wage gains went disproportionately to those at the top and at the bottom of the income and skill distribution, not to those in the middle; however, I also argue, this polarization is unlikely to continue very far into future. The final section of this paper reflects on how recent and future advances in artificial intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth. I argue that the interplay between machine and human comparative advantage allows computers to substitute for workers in performing routine, codifiable tasks while amplifying the comparative advantage of workers in supplying problem-solving skills, adaptability, and creativity.","MIT, Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Autor, DH (通讯作者)，MIT, Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",,,,,,,,62,1069,1255,80,731,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We distinguish three regimes, depending on whether and how the price charged by the dominant firm depends on the quantity purchased from the rival firm. We find that the supply of rival good is distorted downward. Moreover, given the quantity supplied from the rival, the buyer may opportunistically purchase inefficiently many units from the dominant firm to pocket quantity rebates. We show that the possibility for the buyer to dispose of unconsumed units attenuates the opportunism problem and limits the exclusionary effects of nonlinear pricing.","[Chone, Philippe] CREST, Slough, Berks, England",,"Choné, P (通讯作者)，CREST, Slough, Berks, England.",chone@ensae.fr; laurent.linnemer@ensae.fr,,,,,,,16,12,12,0,17,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

This approach had an impact on a number of fields in economics in, particularly, the 1960s and 1970s. The modern body of property rights economics mainly originates in the work Oliver Hart and is quite different in style, scope, and implications from the original property rights economics of Coase, Demsetz, Alchian, Cheung, Umbeck, Barzel, etc. Based on our earlier work on the subject (Foss and Foss, 2001), we argue that the change from Mark I to Mark II property rights economics led to a substantial narrowing of the scope of property rights economics, somewhat akin to a Kuhnian loss of content. In particular, Mark II property rights economics make strong assumptions concerning the definition and enforcement of ownership rights made which lead to many real life institutions and governance arrangements being excluded from consideration, and a much more narrow focus than that of the rich institutional research program initiated by Coase and his followers.","[Foss, Kirsten; Foss, Nicolai] Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Strategy & Leadership, Bergen, Norway; [Foss, Nicolai] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Strateg Management & Globalizat, Copenhagen, Denmark",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH); Copenhagen Business School,"Foss, K (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Strategy & Leadership, Bergen, Norway.",Kirsten.Foss@nhh.no; njf.smg@cbs.dk,,,,,,,72,11,15,0,22,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

If network power is measured with the Shapley Value we obtain a clear ranking of the projects which corresponds to the observed investment patterns. Nord Stream's strategic value is huge, easily justifying the high investment cost for Germany and Russia. The additional leverage obtained through South Stream is much smaller and Nabucco is not viable.

Using disaggregate CPI data for Korea, this paper reviews extant measures of core inflation and documents several important empirical features of the measures. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the stylized facts on the extant measures are not compatible with a single stochastic trend, and our empirical findings strongly support this view. Motivated by price divergence, we model disaggregate prices in multiple-component structure and find there are four persistent components together with a group of diverging items. Having identified distinct common components, we employ a new core inflation measure based on a limited influence estimator for each convergence club. The new core inflation dominates the extant measures in its ability to account for central tendency of price distribution and for generating low variance of price changes. In addition, it forecasts the underlying trend of headline CPI inflation more accurately than the extant core inflation indicators do.","[Kim, Hyok Jung; Kim, Young Se] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, YS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 53 Myeongnyun Dong 3 Ga, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",hyokzzang@gmail.com; youngsekim@skku.edu,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2012S1A5A8023703],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2012S1A5A8023703).,,28,2,2,1,9,KOREAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION,SEOUL,"156 JEOKSEON-DONG, GWANGHWAMUN PLATINUM BUILDING 501HO, JONGNO-GU, SEOUL, 110 052, SOUTH KOREA",0254-3737,,,KOREAN ECON REV,Korean Econ.

The estimation results show that first, the capital structures of the listed companies matched the features of standardized corporate financing theories better than those of small-and medium-sized Vietnamese enterprises. Second, weak corporate governance due to insufficient monitoring by creditor led the listed companies to borrow excessively in the periods before and after the boom. Third, the state-controlled companies listed on the HOSE are likely to have an advantage over other companies in accessing loans and earning profits, even after the boom period. Fourth, while foreign-affiliated companies were not substantially more profitable during the boom period, they were more profitable in the period after the boom because of better production technology and management. These findings suggest that reforming the Vietnamese market requires the development of a system that ensures information transparency and independent corporate governance, enhances financial openness, and increases the privatization of state-owned companies, including those in the banking sector.

We illustrate how a novel identification strategy, proposed by Lewbel (2012), which utilizes a heteroscedastic covariance restriction to construct an internal IV, can be used to obtain IV estimates for returns to education when alternatively there are no conventional IVs available or the conventional IVs that are available are potentially weak. To do so, we estimate the returns to schooling in urban China using two datasets. One dataset, which is for Shanghai, does not have any conventional IVs for education. The other dataset, which is for urban residents from across China, contains information on conventional IVs (parents' education). We find that, in the case of returns to schooling, the Lewbel method provides plausible estimates in datasets in which conventional IVs are not available and can be used to provide a robustness check on the findings from conventional IVs in datasets in which conventional IVs are available, but are weak. Our findings suggest that the method could prove useful in other contexts in which endogeneity is a problem and either conventional IVs are not available or those which are available may not satisfy the exclusion restriction.

Specifically, a large technological distance between domestically owned and foreign-owned firms has positive effects on wages paid by domestically owned firms in the same industry and negative on domestic wages in upstream and/or in downstream industries. Finally, inward investment may indeed improve the domestic sectors, although such linkage depends on different characteristics of domestically owned firms and sectors where firms operate.","[Pittiglio, Rosanna] Univ Naples 2, Naples, Italy; [Reganati, Filippo] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Rome, Italy; [Sica, Edgardo] Univ Foggia, Foggia, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Sapienza University Rome; University of Foggia,"Pittiglio, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples 2, Naples, Italy.",,"SICA, EDGARDO/AGG-3654-2022; Sica, Edgardo/AAC-8732-2020; Reganati, Filippo/F-4225-2011","SICA, EDGARDO/0000-0001-9054-8309; Sica, Edgardo/0000-0001-9054-8309; PITTIGLIO, Rosanna/0000-0002-1717-2453; REGANATI, Filippo/0000-0002-5028-0421",,,,,87,9,10,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Social capital promotes imitation and there is a two-way interaction between imitation and human capital. Building social capital (which brings direct utility) requires time and access to infrastructure. Because life expectancy is endogenously related to human capital, time allocation between market work and social capital accumulation is also endogenously determined. The analysis highlights a fundamental trade-off between learning externalities and the life cycle-time allocation effect. The model is calibrated for a low-income country. Numerical experiments show that a policy that helps to promote social capital accumulation may be highly effective to foster economic growth, even if it involves offsetting cuts in government spending on education. Offsetting cuts in infrastructure investment, however, may entail significant dynamic trade-offs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the high volatility of tanker freight rates has been a major concern for market participants and led to the development of the tanker freight derivatives in the form of forward freight agreements (FFAs). The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of these instruments in managing tanker freight rate risk. Using a data set for six major tanker routes covering the period between 2005 and 2013, we examine the effectiveness of alternative hedging methods, including a bivariate Markov Regime Switching GARCH model, in hedging tanker freight rates. The regime switching GARCH specification links the concept of equilibrium freight rate determination underlying different market conditions and the dynamics of the conditional second moments across high and low volatility regimes. Overall, we find evidence supporting the argument that the tanker freight market is characterized by different regimes. However, while the use of a regime switching model allows for a significant improvement in the performance of the hedge in-sample, out-of-sample results are mixed. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The theory explains the core features of the caste system: its hereditary and hierarchical nature, and its insistence on endogamy (marriage only within castes). Endogamy is embraced by a group to minimize an externality that arises when group members marry outsiders. We demonstrate why the caste system embodies gender asymmetries in punishments for violations of endogamy and tolerates hypergamy (marrying up) more than hypogamy (marrying down). Our model also speaks to other aspects of caste, such as commensality restrictions and arranged/child marriages. We suggest that India's caste system is so unique because the Brahmins sought to preserve and orally transmit the Hindu scriptures for over a millennium with no script. We show that economic considerations were of utmost importance in the emergence of the caste system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence of a large positive correlation of the city share of migrants with natives' wages. Using different sets of control variables and instruments suggests that the effect is causal. The large total migrant impact (+10% when one moves from the first to the third quartile of the migrant variable distribution) arises from gains due to complementarity with natives in the production function (+6.4%), and from gains due to agglomeration economies (+3.3%). Finally, we find some evidence of a stronger effect for skilled natives than for unskilled, as expected from theory. Overall, our findings support large nominal wage gains that can be expected from further migration and urbanisation in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using a sample of 69 developing countries, we demonstrate that oil resources orient university students toward specializations that provide better future access to rents when institutions are weak. The results are robust to various specifications, datasets on governance quality and estimation methods. Oil affects the demand for each profession through a technological effect, indicating complementarity between oil and engineering, manufacturing and construction; however, it also increases the 'size of the cake'. Therefore, when institutions are weak, oil increases the incentive to opt for professions with better access to rents (law, business, and the social sciences), rather than careers in engineering, creating a deviation from the optimal allocation between the two types of specialization.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast in this paper we demonstrate that altruism may have more predictive power than previously understood. We present a model in which the object of altruism is a large number of potential recipients of a good for which there is a target level of provision (e.g. an acute malnutrition treatment, an insecticide-treated bed net). We show that in this case donors may measure the value of a contribution with reference to the impact that such contribution has on additional recipients, not with reference to the impact on the total level of an organization's charitable resources as traditionally assumed. In this situation, the equilibrium involves no free riding whatsoever. Equilibria that do involve free riding are characterized by provision of the target level of the charitable good to all potential recipients. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Income Distribution and Poverty in OECD Countries, Paris 2008; Divided we stand-Why inequality keeps rising, Paris 2011) but rather since the financial crisis. So far there is only scarce empirical evidence-besides a rather broad literature dealing with the US-about the consequences of the financial crisis on income inequality in Europe (e.g. Jenkins et al. in The Great Recession and the distribution of household income, Oxford University Press, Oxford 2013) and more important about wealth inequality (Lundberg and Waldenstrom in Paper presented at the 4. SEEK conference, Mannheim 2014). In this paper we focus on the short-term distributional effects in Germany, as this country was one of the OECD countries which had been hit hardest-as measured by a decline in GDP-by the Great Recession in 2008/2009. The underlying data source comes from the German Socio Economic Panel which is a representative longitudinal survey of private households in Germany. This survey provides consistent yearly information about incomes since 1984 and for wealth in at least three survey years. Thus, we are able to identify any potential effects of the financial crisis on incomes (e.g. earnings, market income, post-government income) and wealth components (e.g. property, business assets, financial assets, net worth) and their respective inequality in Germany. Our main finding is that we do not find any significant distributional changes during the Great Recession. However, the Great Recession temporary froze the income structure while afterwards income mobility tries to make up leeway. Findings of a factor decomposition showed as expected that the relative contribution of capital income to overall inequality lost in relevance during the Great recession. Several factors attenuated the impact of the Great Recession and will be discussed in detail.","[Grabka, Markus M.] DIW Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Grabka, Markus M.] TU Berlin, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Grabka, MM (通讯作者)，DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",mgrabka@diw.de,,,Hans-Bockler Foundation [S-2012-610-4],Hans-Bockler Foundation,"We would like to thank participants of the Annual Meeting of the Austrian Economic Association (NOeG) 30-31 May 2014 in Vienna, the conference Crises and the distribution'' 29-30.

However, as renewables feature very low variable production costs, over-curtailment can be costly. In this article, we use a stylised analytical model to assess this trade-off. We show that while curtailing renewables when their variability is high and the system flexibility is low can reduce generation costs, the different stakeholders will not necessarily benefit from such measures. As a consequence, leaving this decision to generators will lead to a sub-optimal level of curtailment. Either incentives to provide accurate RES availability forecasts or alternatively centralised forecasting should be put into place to solve the resulting problem of asymmetry of information.

We approach this question using counterfactual experiments within a quantified general equilibrium model of trade. We find that trade costs gain their relevance only by amplifying the effects of existing differences in endowments, population sizes and technologies. If, for example, market entry costs were the same in all countries, inequality would be about 13% lower. Variable trade costs are found to have a similar effect. In contrast, if countries differed only by their degree of trade openness, the resulting variance of per capita income would be negligible.","[Hepenstrick, Christian] Swiss Natl Bank, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tarasov, Alexander] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Swiss National Bank (SNB); University of Munich,"Hepenstrick, C (通讯作者)，Swiss Natl Bank, Borsenstr 15, CH-8022 Zurich, Switzerland.",christian.hepenstrick@snb.ch,"Tarasov, Alexander/M-6371-2015","Tarasov, Alexander/0000-0002-4393-9419",Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [SFB/TR 15]; Swiss National Science Foundation,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),The authors thank Josef Zweimuller for helpful comments and discussion as well as the two anonymous referees for suggestions that substantially improved the paper.

Using scale-dependent detrended fluctuation analysis, spectral analysis, and the probability distribution analysis we show that the studied markets exhibit strongly anti-persistent properties suggesting that their dynamics can be predicted based on historic price records across the range of time scales from 1 h to one month. For both Canadian markets, the price movements reveal three types of correlated behavior which can be used for forecasting. The discovered scenarios remain the same on different time scales up to one month as well as for on- and off-peak electricity data. These scenarios represent sharp increases of prices and are not present in the Mid-C market due to its lower volatility. We argue that extreme price movements in this market should follow the same tendency as the more volatile Canadian markets. The estimated values of the Pareto indices suggest that the prediction of these events can be statistically stable. The results obtained provide new relevant information for managing financial risks associated with the dynamics of electricity derivatives over time frame exceeding one day. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The deviation of the monetary policy-set federal funds rate from the natural interest rate estimated by Laubach and Williams (2003) is shown to have significant causal effects on the M&A activity. In the nondurable goods sector, the funds rate's deviation from the natural rate, rather than the funds rate itself, is the main macroeconomic factor influencing the M&A activity. In the durable goods sector, the variation in the funds rate, only when this rate is significantly below the natural one, is the main macroeconomic factor influencing the M&A activity. Setting the funds rate below the natural rate reflecting long-term fundamentals (a) leads to relatively lower financing costs which, in turn, lead companies to favour M&A relative to internal growth and (b) makes the M&A activity in the durable goods sector, which is sensitive to the variation in the cost of capital, highly dependent on the monetary policy-set rate.","Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews,"Adra, S (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews, Fife, Scotland.",sa49@st-andrews.ac.uk,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Many of these assessments are based on the integration of biophysical and agro-economic models, allowing to understand the physical and socio-economic responses of the agricultural sector to future climate change scenarios. The evolution of the bio-economic approach has gone through different stages. This review analyses its evolution: firstly, framing the bio-economic approach into the context of the assessments of climate change impacts, and secondly, by reviewing empirical studies at the global and European level. Based on this review, common findings emerge in both global and regional assessments. Among them, the authors show that overall results tend to hide significant disparities on smaller spatial scales. Furthermore, due to the effects of crop prices over yield changes, several authors highlight the need to consider endogenous price models to assess production impacts of climate change. Further, major developments are discussed: the progress made since the last two decades and the recent methods used to provide insights into modeling uncertainties. However, there are still challenges to be met. On this matter, the authors take these unresolved challenges as guidelines for future research.","[Fernandez, Francisco J.; Blanco, Maria] Tech Univ Madrid, ETSI Agronomos, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid,"Fernández, FJ (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Madrid, ETSI Agronomos, Avda Complutense 3, Madrid 28040, Spain.",,"Blanco, Maria/D-4833-2011; Fernández, Francisco José/L-7905-2017","Blanco, Maria/0000-0002-7491-3262; Fernández, Francisco José/0000-0001-8655-0748",EU [312182 KBBE.2012.1.4-05],EU(European Union (EU)),"This study has been funded under the ULYSSES project, EU 7th Framework Programme, Project 312182 KBBE.2012.1.4-05.",,87,5,6,3,49,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,APR 10,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201510.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-10,0.0,,,54,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CL4BO,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356897800001,0

We study this issue using a large longitudinal study of a recent cohort of teenagers in England. We use the General Health Questionnaire to derive measures of poor mental health. We find a large negative association between being at risk of poor mental health and educational outcomes where we consider examination results before leaving compulsory education and the probability of being 'not in education, employment or training' at a young age. Results are stronger for girls and also vary according to the different components of the mental health measure.

Contrary to the standard practice of using reference preferences and wages, these measures preserve preference heterogeneity in the normative step of the analysis. They also make the ethical priors, implicit in any interpersonal comparison, more explicit. Information on preference heterogeneity is obtained from a structural discrete choice labour supply model for married women estimated on microdata from the Socio Economic Panel in Germany. We construct welfare orderings of households according to the different metrics, each embodying different ethical choices concerning the treatment of preference heterogeneity in the consumption-leisure space and provide empirical evidence about the sensitivity of the welfare orderings to different normative principles. We also discuss how sensitive the assessment of a tax reform is to the choice of different metrics.","[Decoster, Andre M.

However, whether this beauty premium arises primarily because of differences in ability or confidence, bias, or sorting remains unknown. We use a rich dataset from a women's college to evaluate each of these three mechanisms at the college level. We find that students judged to be more attractive perform significantly worse on standardized tests but, conditional on test scores, are not evaluated more favorably at the point of admission, suggesting that more attractive people do not possess greater abilities at the beginning of college. Controlling for test scores, more attractive students receive only marginally better grades in some specifications, and the magnitudes of the differences are very small. Finally, there is substantial beauty-based sorting into areas of study and occupations.

Due to a lack of data, one question that remains unanswered is the effect prohibition had on the actual production of alcohol. This article attempts to answer this question by estimating prohibition's impact on the yields of grains that constitute the principal inputs in alcohol production. Using a variety of data sources and exploiting the variation in timing of state prohibition law adoption, we estimate the effect of prohibition on several measures of crop production. Our preferred identification strategy compares contiguous counties in states with differing prohibition laws. Our findings suggest that state prohibition laws decreased the production of barley and may have increased the production of corn. Using these estimates, we calculate that prohibition decreased alcohol production, and by extension consumption, by at least 18 gallons per adult per year.","[Edwards, Griffin] Collat Sch Business, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA; [Howe, Travis] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL USA",Northwestern University,"Edwards, G (通讯作者)，Collat Sch Business, BEC 209-B,1150 10th Ave S, Birmingham, AL 35294 USA.",gse@uab.edu,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

We model an agent-based continuous double-auction, allowing for a continuum of investment strategies within the chartist/fundamentalist framework.

We first show that a removal of travel restrictions on Israeli Arabs had raised female education and had almost no effect on male education. Next, we show that it lowered fertility rates among exposed women, which we interpret as an effect of female education on fertility. We rule out labor-force participation, age at marriage, marriage and divorce rates and spousal labor-force participation and earnings as confounding factors or as mechanisms but find that spousal education and children quality play a role in the fertility decline. We provide a variety of robustness tests that rule out other channels by which the removal of the travel restrictions could have affected fertility directly. These results are particularly interesting and important for the context of many Muslim countries with low rates of female labor force participation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Desires to help servers, reward service, buy future service, buy social status/esteem, avoid social sanctions, and fulfill internalized social obligations have all been proposed as possible explanations for this behavior, but surprisingly little research has documented the effects of these desires/motives. Results of an online survey indicate that self-reported individual differences in each of these motives for tipping predict the likelihood of tipping, uncertainty about the general likelihood of tipping, and/or tip sizes among those who tip. Results also indicate that the effects of future-service and duty motives on tipping likelihood vary across service occupations and that duty motives have opposite effects on the likelihood of tipping and on the size of tip left by those who do tip - increasing the former while decreasing the latter. Finally, results indicate that reward, altruistic, and esteem motives for tipping are positively related to attitude toward tipping while avoidance and duty motives for tipping are negatively related to attitude toward tipping. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with directions for future research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Migrants need to decide whether or not to remit funds to a recipient in El Salvador and if so how much. We maintain a (2 x 2) design in which the remittance budget has a value of $400 or $200, and the remitted funds arrive as cash or grocery vouchers that are nontransferable and applicable to basic necessities that do not include alcohol and cigarettes. Each migrant is randomly allocated to one of the resulting four treatments. We test across these treatments whether control over remittance spending in the form of grocery vouchers affects remittance behavior. We find the following. Our quantitative findings suggest that migrants prefer a remittance to arrive as cash than as groceries when stakes are high. This result is robust to inclusion of a wide set of covariates and is consistent with a conceptual framework in which migrants have preferences over how recipients spend remittances. Our qualitative findings suggest that Migrants integrate amounts sent in the experiment with the external environment for sending remittances. We explore the mechanisms underlying the main effect and find that migrants who more recently sent a remittance and, in certain specifications, male migrants exhibit a greater preference for cash. Some implications of our findings are discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The intelligence apparatus of each country evaluates the rival's capabilities and intentions, and enhances its military capability by increasing the effectiveness of its own weapon systems and reducing the effectiveness of the rival's weapon systems. Intelligence superiority also yields an advantage in deterrence and preemption. This study shows the following. (a) Investment in intelligence is much less beneficial for small government budgets, low intelligence efficiency, and a low degree of conservatism on the part of the policy-maker. (b) The expenditure on intelligence increases when intelligence efficiency is low and rising, and decreases when intelligence efficiency is high and rising. (c) Being very conservative may be costly to the country. (d) High-quality human capital substantially improves the country's security and welfare, particularly when the rivals are engaged in a knowledge race in addition to the usual arms race.

Moreover, different patterns of response times for travel time and travel cost indicate that these attributes are processed in different ways by respondents.

Using a dataset for 18 OECD economies spanning the last four decades, we identify periods of downward house price adjustment and estimate conditional logit models to measure the effect of energy inflation on the probability of these house price corrections after controlling for other relevant macroeconomic variables. Our results give strong evidence that increases in energy price inflation raise the probability of such corrective periods taking place. This phenomenon could be explained by various channels: through the adverse effects of energy prices on economic activity and income reducing the demand for housing; through the particular impact on construction and operation costs and their effects on the supply and demand of housing; through the reaction of monetary policy on inflation withdrawing liquidity and further reducing demand; through improving attractiveness of commodity versus housing investment on asset markets; or through a lagging impact of common factors on both variables, such as economic growth. Our results contribute to the understanding of the pass-through of oil price shocks to financial markets and imply that energy price inflation should serve as a leading indicator for the analysis of macro-financial risks.

The paper examines what we understand by Keynesian policies and the importance of policy coordination and then evaluates the extent to which Brazil used coordinated economic policies in the face of both crises. The main hypothesis of the paper is that the difference in the performance of the countercyclical policies in both crises is related mainly to Brazil's lack of coordination of macroeconomic policies in 2011-12, especially the implementation of fiscal policy.","[de Paula, Luiz Fernando] Univ State Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [de Paula, Luiz Fernando] CNPq, Brazilian Natl Council Sci & Technol Dev, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Modenesi, Andre de Melo] Fed Univ Rio de Janeiro UFRJ, Inst Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Modenesi, Andre de Melo] CNPq, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Pires, Manoel Carlos C.] IPEA, London, England",Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro; Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"de Paula, LF (通讯作者)，Univ State Rio de Janeiro UERJ, Econ, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,"de Paula, Luiz Fernando/AFV-3297-2022",,,,,,29,12,20,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

There is a two-way interaction between the macro-economy and the environment. We assume that the society under consideration finds itself in a high pollution equilibrium and show that a benevolent social planner is in principle able to engineer substantial welfare gains by choosing the appropriate mix of Pigouvian (capital) taxation and abatement activities. During the initial phase of the policy, abatement is used to reduce the inflow of dirt to zero whereas the tax is employed to bring down the stock of the polluting capital input in an optimal fashion.

The novelty of the paper is that it considers monthly time-series historical data that span over 150 years (1859:10-2013:12) and applies a predictive regression model that accommodates three salient features of the data, namely, a persistent and endogenous oil price, and model heteroscedasticity. Three key findings are unraveled: first, oil price predicts US stock returns. Second, in-sample evidence is corroborated by out-sample evidence of predictability. Third, both positive and negative oil price changes are important predictors of US stock returns, with negative changes relatively more important. Our results are robust to the use of different estimators and choice of in-sample periods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Two models are considered, one with physical capital only, and one with physical and human capital. In the model with physical capital only, capital income should be subsidized, while labor income taxed. In the model with two types of capital, instead, Ramsey optimality prescribes that the tax on physical capital is zero (negative), if effective labor is constant (decreasing) returns to scale in human capital and market goods, while the tax on human capital is negative and the tax on effective labor positive. Our findings depart from those obtained in immortal models with an endogenous labor supply and constant population growth, because physical and human capital affect the demand for fertility.

The French Statistical Institute (INSEE) has expanded the scope of its existing surveys. It has also launched an innovative experimental survey which, drawing upon a single statistical source, aims for the first time to explore the different dimensions of both objective and subjective quality of life, as highlighted in the Stiglitz Report. It allows us to study, at the individual level, correlations between these dimensions and the accumulation of deprivations. It has enabled us to better understand the links between determinants generally referred to as objective dimensions of quality of life (such as health or education) and subjective well-being. This information is of paramount importance for policy makers who cannot act directly on the level of people's satisfaction but can only act upon the levers of objective dimensions.

His answer is no: saving lives in poor countries is not expensive, and there are many episodes of massive health improvements in the absence of income growth. As an alternative, he argues that the cross-sectional correlation between health and income is induced by variation in institutional quality, while over time, parallel improvements in income and health have been a result of advancing knowledge.","[Weil, David N.] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Weil, David N.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Weil, DN (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,,31,10,14,1,25,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Our results show that the impacts of foreign acquisitions in China are different from but also comparable to those in developed countries found in the literature. Specifically, foreign acquisitions have significant positive effects on the levels of wage and employment of target firms, but mildly negative impact on employment growth and insignificant impact on wage growth. The impacts show heterogeneities. We also check the potential channels of the impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Prior literature on brand extensions supports the intuition that attaching established brand names (e.g., titles of box-office hits) to new products decreases advertising costs. We counter this intuition and examine factors that may increase advertising costs for movie sequels. Specifically, we investigate the consequences of asset specificity and bargaining power-concepts from transaction cost economics-in the context of the motion picture industry. We find a positive relationship between the bargaining power of the movie studio's suppliers and advertising expenditures for the movie sequel. We also find evidence of a moderating effect: higher bargaining power of the movie studio dampens the impact of supplier bargaining power on advertising. This is the first study to measure the effect of supplier bargaining power on movie studios' marketing decisions. In a broader context, our findings not only challenge the notion that brand extensions are cost saving, but are also novel in linking transaction cost constructs to the advertising behavior of firms.","[Ma, Judy; Huang, Dongling; Kumar, M.

The agent undertakes unobservable effort, which affects in each period the probability that the project is completed. We characterize the contracts that the principal sets, with and without commitment. With full commitment, the contract involves the agent's value and wage declining over time, in order to give the agent incentives to exert effort. The best sequentially rational equilibrium for the principal also involves the agent's wage declining over time, while the worst sequentially rational equilibrium for the principal has a constant wage (and is in fact the unique stationary equilibrium). The best (weakly) renegotiation-proof equilibrium for the principal is achieved by a constant wage that maximizes the principal's payoff, conditional on wages being constant.

The empirical results show that the gender differences in competitive preferences are statistically significant in almost all countries, with women having, on average, a lower preference for competitive situations than men. Although relatively substantial in most countries, the magnitude of gender differences varies considerably between countries. Results of a regression analysis suggest that the gender differences persist even when controlling for a number of potentially relevant variables. Furthermore, gender differences among adult men and women are hardly affected by the stage of life cycle.","Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany",University of Wuppertal,"Bönte, W (通讯作者)，Univ Wuppertal, Jackstadt Ctr Entrepreneurship & Innovat Res, Schumpeter Sch Business & Econ, D-42097 Wuppertal, Germany.",boente@wiwi.uni-wuppertal.de,,"Bonte, Werner/0000-0002-2923-5423",,,,,11,17,20,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The associated boom has required debt-driven bubbles to provide domestic demand since incomes of the masses have not risen in tandem, but such a strategy is inherently unsustainable.

A total of 10,000 potential political donors received solicitations referencing past contribution behavior of members of the competing party (competition treatment), the same party (cooperative treatment), or no past contribution information (control). We first theoretically analyze the effect of these treatments on the contribution behavior of agents with different social preferences in a modified intergroup public good (IPG) game. Then, we report the empirical results: Contribution rates in the competitive, cooperative, and control treatments were 1.45%, 1.08%, and 0.78%, respectively. With the exception of one large contribution, the distribution of contributions in the competitive treatment first order stochastically dominates that of the cooperative treatment. Qualitatively, it appears that the cooperative treatment induced more contributions around the common monetary reference point, while the competitive treatment led to more contributions at twice this amount. These results suggest that eliciting competitive rather than cooperative motivations can lead to higher contributions in IPG settings.

Bettis and Prahald (1995) discussed in their seminal article on the impact of dominant logic as a tool that management used to filter data or rather as a form of possible control of the communication process in today's organizations. It could be argued that the control of, or rather the limitation thereof, certain types of data not only has an impact on the organizational culture as a whole, but could possibly have a similar effect on the development of the Intellectual Capital. There may be a variety of reasons why the leadership may need to, or want to, limit data to various members of his or her organization, which can also lead to future cases studies. However, in this particular review of the literature, it is the intent of this paper to look at the impact of leadership style and impact of organizational culture may have on the application and functioning of dominant logic in organization, in particular, in past practices and focus on areas where there is a need for perhaps further investigation or training needed. Specifically, the impact of leadership style and how the leader approaches his or her leadership responsibilities can affect how the organization grows, continues with the status quo or perhaps starts to perish in various points of its organizational growth. In addition to the movement of data in general, dominant logic can be affected by the perceptions of the leader in charge of the organization at various stages of its growth. While many organizations may have proposed, or espoused, methods of control and review, some of these steps may be by-passed by various key players in the organization, as well as affected by the organizational culture in place at a given time and place. Another key factor to consider in the context of dominant logic's impact is economic growth, specifically when economic times may dictate that the leadership may have to change courses in his or her strategies in order to accommodate changing economic times. Thus, the leadership, organizational culture, and economic status of the organization can all play important parts in the strategic and organizational control of dominant logical in the workplace in terms of how the natural selection of movement of grow will be permitted or controlled to evolved. While businesses may be made-made and influenced, there may be a potential lens to view this development as evolutionary nature and perhaps a Darwinistic perspective of natural selection of the leader and organization may be applicable in the context of the role and function of dominant logic in the workplace and how it has helped or hindered organizational growth.","Amer Publ Univ, Sch Business, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA",American Public University System; American Public University,"Barrett, B (通讯作者)，Amer Publ Univ, Sch Business, Charles Town, WV 25414 USA.",docjob00@msn.com,,,,,,,20,12,12,1,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,1,6,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600001,0

These effects make tacit coordination easier to sustain and have a detrimental impact on welfare.

Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1 sigma increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4% and intergroup conflict by 11.3%.

Indeed, we feel the SFC approach has recently led to a blossoming literature, requiring a new summary after the work of Dos Santos and above all after the publication of the main reference work on the methodology, Godley and Lavoie's Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth. The paper is developed along the following lines. First, a brief historical analysis investigates the roots of this class of models that can be traced as far back as 1949 and the work of Copeland. Second, the competing points of view regarding some of its main controversial aspects are underlined and used to classify the different methodological approaches followed in using these models. Namely, we discuss (i) how the models are solved, (ii) the treatment of time and its implication and (ii) the need (or not) for microfoundations. These results are then used in the third section of the paper to develop a bifocal perspective, which allows us to divide the literature reviewed according to both its subject and the methodology. We explore various topics such as financialisation, exchange rate modelling, policy implication, the need for a common framework within the post-Keynesian literature and the empirical use of SFC models. Finally, the conclusions present some hypotheses (and wishes) for the possible lines of development of SFC models.","[Caverzasi, Eugenio] Marche Polytech Univ, Ancona, Italy; [Godin, Antoine] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland",Marche Polytechnic University; University of Limerick,"Godin, A (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Kemmy Business Sch, Limerick, Ireland.",godin.antoine@gmail.com,"Caverzasi, Eugenio/AFN-0951-2022","Godin, Antoine/0000-0001-9125-4986",,,,,119,77,84,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This article examines the output convergence among U.S. states for the last five decades by making several improvements over the extant literature. By applying a battery of convergence tests designed to capture nonlinear transitional dynamics to real output per worker data (i.e., nominal values deflated by state-level price), we find that output convergence has not been a feature of the continental United States since the 1970s. Instead, output convergence has proceeded among four subgroups within which constituent states have certain characteristics in common. Our regression analysis suggests that state-level characteristics related to technology and human capital play a crucial role in accounting for the formation and composition of convergence clubs, in agreement with the recent theoretical models of growth and development (e.g., Aghion et al. 2009; Gennaioli et al. 2013b). The level of technology, proxied by patents, turns out to be a consistently significant determinant even after controlling for endogeneity, suggesting that frictions in the diffusion of technology and human capital may have led to clustering of states with different levels of productivity. Our results therefore cast doubt on the common view that diffusion of knowledge and technology across state borders is frictionless.

Specifically, we examine how the competition in and standard policies of each country affect cellular diffusion through interactions with positive and negative network externalities. The empirical analysis shows that significant network externality effects exist in a cellular market. Although the positive effects dominate the negative effects initially, the negative network externality effects become larger and outweigh the positive externality effects after a certain level of diffusion rate has been achieved. In particular, a single standard policy and the speed of technological innovation combined with the previous penetration rate generate a positive network externality on the diffusion of mobile telecommunications. However, a competition policy that solely increases the rate of new subscriptions does not generate any interacting effects.","[Chung, J.

First, it differentiates how well informed different players within the same component are, and therefore how attractive they are to sponsor links to. Second, players may prefer to sponsor links to players they are already connected to. By focusing on small decay we analyze the first effect in isolation. We characterize the set of Nash equilibrium networks in the two-way flow model of network formation with small decay for any increasing benefit function of the players. The results show that small decay is consistent with two well-known stylized facts, namely that (i) many real world networks have high diameters, and (ii) that the diameter of such networks is typically small relative to the population size. We show that even stochastically stable networks may have any diameter when the benefit function is linear or strictly concave. Finally we study implied stability relations. We find that if any non-empty minimal network is stable, then so is the periphery-sponsored star. With strictly convex benefit functions, we find that other stars tend to be stable for a larger range of parameters than larger diameter networks which satisfy our characterization. However, with strictly concave benefit functions the other stars are stable for a smaller range of parameters than the larger diameter networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a rich data set from the Brazilian foreign exchange market, we estimate a reduced-form VAR to characterize the interaction of the central bank, financial and commercial customers in times of regulatory policy measures. We find that capital controls change market participants' behaviour, and that central bank interventions elicit a significant response in financial order flow. Referring to the source of order flow, we find no direct price impact by financial flows and thus no evidence that the appreciation of the Real is driven by financial customers' activity. Instead, commercial customers seem to be a primary driver of the Real within our model.","[de Roure, Calebe; Furnagiev, Steven; Reitz, Stefan] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany; [Furnagiev, Steven] Univ New Hampshire, Durham, NH 03824 USA; [de Roure, Calebe] Deutsch Bundesbank, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University System Of New Hampshire; University of New Hampshire; Deutsche Bank,"de Roure, C (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",calebe.de.roure@bundesbank.de,,,,,,,18,2,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Albania, Nepal, Tajikistan and Tanzania. this article calculates income-related inequality in health care utilization. We measure health disparity separately for generally and chronically ill individuals by constructing two models: one for the probability of a visit to a physician and another for the number of visits. Following model-based measurements, we decompose inequality into two major parts: one accounted for by identity-related factors and another by socioeconomic and other factors such as education, geography and distance to a clinic. We propose a new method to quantify the effect of changes in income and education on health disparity. One of our important findings suggests that health disparity is pro-rich in all our sample countries. The pro-rich disparity is prevalent among generally ill as well as chronically ill patients, in both visit probability and visit frequency models. Health inequality seems primarily driven by income differences followed by nonidentity factors. Further, the principle of equal treatment for equal need is not fulfilled in any of our countries. Among policy implications, increasing average income and education in a way that also reduces disparity in income and education, respectively, will substantially shrink inequality in health care utilization.","[Devkota, Satis] Univ Minnesota, Dept Econ & Management, Morris, IL 56267 USA; [Upadhyay, Mukti] Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Charleston, IL 61920 USA",University of Minnesota System; Eastern Illinois University,"Upadhyay, M (通讯作者)，Eastern Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Charleston, IL 61920 USA.",mpupadhyay@eiu.edu,,"Devkota, Satis/0000-0003-2020-6324",,,,,22,4,4,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A simple analytical framework of CPL is skaetched, the main attention being paid to revealing its deep connection with the economic development level. An extended empirical analysis, covering 20-year statistical series (1995-2014) for all the 28 members of the European Union is presented. The particular position of the Romanian economy is separately examined. The previous evolution of Romania's CPL as against the EU level is completed by an econometric attempt to forecast it for the years 2015-2016.

In contrast to the previous literature, we use an explicit macroeconomic model to analyze the Great Depression in Spain. We study this period from the perspective of the neoclassical growth theory, taking total factor productivity [TFP] as exogenous. We find that TFP accounts for most of the downturn of the Spanish economy throughout this period, but overestimates the evolution of the GDP per working-age person as well as worked hours at the end of the period (1933-1935). When terms of trade shocks are considered, the model accounts for the evolution of foreign trade in the 1930s, but the results are not significantly improved. Finally, introducing frictions in the labor market helps to explain the evolution of aggregate magnitudes and find a better performance of the model mainly for the period 1933-1935.

There are no systematic theories linking trade policy to technical efficiency; hence, the relation between trade liberalization and technical efficiency is fundamentally ambiguous. Stochastic frontier analysis is used to model the relationship between EU's production resources and agricultural output, as well as the importance of trade openness on technical efficiency of a country. The data for 16 of the 28 EU members were available for the period 1980-2007 including land, capital, fertilizer, labour, agricultural GDP, foreign direct investments (FDI), exports and import data. Results indicate that trade openness has an immediate, negative impact on efficiency in the EU agricultural sector. Over time, however, trade openness does increase efficiency. The FDI outflows increase efficiency. This suggests that an initial reduction in capital supply forces EU nations to utilize other factor inputs more efficiently. However, there is the unexamined potential that over time the depletion of capital results in a decrease in efficiency. Finally, formerly communist member-countries of the EU are found to have the lowest technical efficiency scores whereas Southern European nations have the highest efficiency.","[Hart, Jarrett] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Miljkovi, Dragan; Shaik, Saleem] N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58102 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; North Dakota State University Fargo,"Miljkovi, D (通讯作者)，N Dakota State Univ, Dept Agribusiness & Appl Econ, Fargo, ND 58102 USA.",Dragan.Miljkovic@ndsu.edu,"Shaik, Saleem/HSH-3760-2023","Shaik, Saleem/0000-0001-6177-2520",,,,,26,20,22,1,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show that the effects depend on the specification of the cash-in-advance constraint and the magnitude of the semi-interest elasticity of the income velocity. For the AK model, economic growth increases with higher inflation. For the other two models, growth declines for the case of the standard cash-in-advance constraint on consumption, whereas it either increases or decreases if money is introduced, as in the cash-credit good economy of Dotsey and Ireland, depending on the semi-interest elasticity of the income velocity.

One price taking firm which is subject to emission regulation has the choice to invest in gas or wind power plant. The firm faces uncertainty regarding stochastically evolving permit prices, while it receives a premium on the electricity price for wind energy. As a first step, we determine the value of the option to invest into a gas power plant over time. Then, we calculate the investment probability of a gas power investment in a range of policy scenarios. We find that allowing the usage of sCER permits in the present policy framework has a positive impact on gas power investment. Decoupling the price processes has a similar effect. If the quota of sCER permits is doubled, the decrease in the investment probability for wind power is large. We carry out sensitivity tests for different parameter values, and find that investment behavior changes significantly with differing interest rates, the wind energy premium and volatility.

Under a fixed exchange rate system, inflation in Bangladesh was moderately high and volatile during the 1950s and 1960s. Since the country's independence from Pakistan in 1971, inflation in Bangladesh has remained moderately high on average and highly volatile and persistent under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system or under a managed floating system since 2003. Using data from the early 1970s or earlier depending on data availability, the article undertakes both Granger-causality and the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) analysis with two models. The first model is comprised of such variables as inflation, the real interest rate, the real exchange rate and output growth, and the second model is comprised of the volatilities of money growth, real output growth and inflation. Then, based on the empirical findings, the article concludes that a rule-based monetary policy, namely monetary targeting or inflation targeting, remains appropriate for Bangladesh provided that it adopts a more flexible, if not freely floating, exchange rate system. The article suggests that the use of monetary policy to achieve multiple objectives under a fixed-pegged exchange rate system creates a time-inconsistency problem, reduces monetary policy credibility and makes it (monetary policy) ineffective in lowering inflation and its volatility. Low credibility of monetary policy in particular raises inflation persistence. Within the present monetary-policy framework in Bangladesh, the article illustrates how the fixed-pegged exchange rate system has generated money growth volatility in the presence of large-scale inflows of overseas workers' remittances and readymade garments export earnings. This does not seem to be a concern of the central bank of Bangladesh (Bangladesh Bank); rather, it (Bangladesh Bank) pursues monetary-base targeting to keep inflation low and stable after considering economic growth. The consequent diminishing credibility of monetary policy has kept inflation volatile and persistent, which has adversely affected economic growth.","Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia",University of Newcastle,"Hossain, AA (通讯作者)，Univ Newcastle, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle, NSW 2308, Australia.",akhtar.hossain@newcastle.edu.au,,"hossain, Akhtar/0000-0002-5224-7545",,,,,47,7,7,2,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Expanding on this line of inquiry and yet giving corrections of misinterpretations, this article claims that 'endogenous' demand is at play in Smith's theory of natural progress, providing a historical case study of early modern England for an illustration of the demand-based model of natural progress. Smith drew attention to the dynamics of growth with respect to the role of demand and the changing sectoral structure of economies in the model of natural progress as well as in that of historical progress. In this vein, Smith's approach to economic development differs from Hume's historical account of it. First, it is significant that Smith was concerned with a change in income distribution and expenditure pattern brought about by economic growth. With the general expansion of income, changes in patterns of income distribution and consumption (i.e., a larger share of wages and profits in national income at later stages of development) that favour manufactured items boost economic growth and lead an agrarian economy to move towards manufacturing and commercial economies. Second, it is now worth noticing that along with the progress of wealth an endogenous demand grounded on a part played by socio-psychological power as distinct from material motives furnishes a taste for manufactured goods more than for agricultural goods.","[Kim, Kwangsu] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul 110745, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, K (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 110745, South Korea.",glaskim@skku.edu,,"Kim, Kwangsu/0000-0002-9614-605X",,,,,56,2,2,2,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We find that compared to homogeneous groups, asymmetric valuations for the public good have negative effects on cooperation and its enforcement through informal sanctions. Asymmetric capabilities in providing the public good, in contrast, have a positive and stabilizing effect on voluntary contributions. The main reason for these results is the different externalities contributions have on the other group members' payoffs affecting individuals' willingness to cooperate. We thus provide evidence that it is not the asymmetric nature of groups per se that facilitates or impedes collective action, but that it is rather the nature of asymmetry that determines the degree of cooperation and the level of public good provision.

Overall, four statistically significant explanatory factors for this systematic over- or underpricing have been identified - the volatility in the difference between the interest rate levels, the spot price, the fx forward spread and the counterparty risk. In particular, the high significance of the counterparty risk demonstrates that pricing models for fx forwards should be reviewed.","[Leonhardt, A.] D Fine GmbH, D-60313 Frankfurt, Germany; [Rathgeber, A.

In this manner it is possible to observe large differences in almost all the analysed variables, which exist between evolution of the most technology-intensive manufactures and the rest of the branches.

The investment decisions of a company are divided into short-term investments in current assets and long-term productivity-enhancing investments in tangible and intangible assets.

Although the test for cointegration for the monetary aggregate M1 were inconclusive, the error correction estimates and stability test using the cumulative sum(CUSUM) of squares of recursive residuals show the long-run money demand function to be stable. The CUSUM results for M3 also show some instability in some periods, and the results show that the broad money demand is well cointegrated with its determinates.

Residents of places where deep underground oil and gas deposits are found want to know about the broader economic, social, and environmental impacts of these activities that generate windfall income for some residents. We first review the literature on windfall spending patterns. Then, using the Marcellus region, the earliest area to be tapped using the new techniques, we estimate county-level employment and income effects. For robustness, we employ two methods. Using a propensity score matching approach we find no effect of fracking on income or employment. A panel-fixed effect regression approach suggests statistically significant employment effects in six out of seven alternative specifications, but significant income effects in only one out of seven specifications. In short, the income spillover effects in the Marcellus region appear to be minimal, meaning there's little incentive at the county level to incur current or potential future costs that may be associated with this activity. We conclude with some ideas on how localities might employ policies that would allow natural gas extraction to move forward, benefitting landowners, while establishing some financial safeguards for the broader community.

Fiscal equalisation policy in Croatia is conducted through the personal income tax revenue sharing and the distribution of current grants from the central government budget to regional and local government units. However, the application of these instruments often relies on criteria that are not economic in nature. Therefore, this paper tests the hypothesis of the ineffectiveness of fiscal equalisation system in Croatia. The Gini coefficients are used to measure inequalities in fiscal capacities of local government units before and after the application of fiscal equalisation instruments. If the value of the Gini coefficient after the application of certain equalisation instrument is lower than before, that instrument is effective in alleviating fiscal inequalities and vice versa.

To reflect the investors' opinion about an enterprise, the parameters of skew t-distribution and stable distribution calculated from stock data (close and volume) have been used. The obtained preference area, the parameters (calculated from close and volume stock price data) of the distributions and the indicators representing the present have been employed as Random Forest inputs in predicting the direction of the change in future Accounting & Governance Risk (AGR) rating, which defines the change in the risk of provision of financial data, i.e., whether the risk will increase or decrease. As it has been revealed by the selection of features, stable distribution parameters better reflect the amplitude of the change in stock prices, while the investors' preference area, drawn on the basis of skew t-distribution parameters, has reflected the discrepancy between the investors' expectations and the enterprise's actual value. The same most important selected features have been found to be equally well applicable in describing enterprises characterised by the tendency for AGR rating to rise as well as those characterised by the tendency for AGR rating to drop, or describing both those groups of enterprises collectively.","[Sakalauskas, Leonidas; Vaiciulyte, Ingrida] Vilnius Univ, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Kalsyte, Zivile; Kupciunas, Irmantas] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-51367 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Kaunas University of Technology,"Sakalauskas, L (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Akad Str 4, LT-08663 Vilnius, Lithuania.",sakal@ktl.mii.lt; kalsyte@yahoo.com; ingrida_vaiciulyte@yahoo.com; irmkupc@ktu.lt,,"Vaiciulyte, Ingrida/0009-0008-0895-9343",,,,,26,2,2,1,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Since the bursting of the Japanese bubble economy, the country has fallen into a deep recession and has experimented with crisis therapies in the form of unconventional monetary expansion, Keynesian fiscal stimulus, and recapitalization of financial institutions. Japan reached a low interest rate environment in the mid 1990s and has accumulated an exceptionally high level of public debt during more than two decades of economic stagnation. This paper compares the boom-and-bust cycles in Japan and Europe with respect to the reasons for excessive booms, the characteristics of the crises, and the (potential) effects of the crisis therapies. It is argued that in both Japan and Europe the consequences of expansionary monetary and fiscal policies include the hysteresis of a low-interest rate and high government debt environment, the erosion of the allocation and signaling functions of the interest rate, the gradual quasi-nationalization of financial institutions, as well as gradual real income losses. The economic policy implication for Europe and Japan is the timely exit from crisis therapies in the form of excessively expansionary monetary and fiscal policies.","Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University,"Schnabl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Inst Econ Policy, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,38,6,6,1,16,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

It considers a large sample of Italian farm families and applies the Gini decomposition approach. The analysis accounts for direct payments of the Pillar I (decoupled, coupled and modulation payments) and of the Pillar 2 of the CAP (agro-environmental and compensatory payments). While the overall amount of direct payments reduces income concentration, the situation is very different among the tools under consideration. Furthermore, the situation differs among the three altimetry zones in which the full sample has been disaggregated. Direct payments as a whole have been effective in pursuing a more equitable distribution of income, particularly in mountain zones. Thus any reduction of the budget for such policy will likely result in an increase of income concentration. The shift of financial resources between Pillar I and Pillar 2 will not necessarily result in a more equitable income distribution. However, instruments such as modulation, decoupled payments and compensatory allowances have been found to be promising tools for reaching this goal. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

The paper finds that the presence of many commercial banks in the areas does not help the poor, instead the poor rely heavily on informal credit. Loans in the peri-urban areas are mainly used for non-productive purposes, which stresses the importance of consumption smoothing. Better community relationships and interpersonal trust in morerural wards help households to access to credit. In urban areas, the poor rely more upon subsidized funds. A closer look at specified microcredit sources reveals that household behaviour differs in each market segment. Furthermore, the poor are highly credit-constrained. Wealthier-asset households among the poor appear to be less credit-constrained. The likelihood of credit constraints increases with the distance to the nearest banks, which suggests that credit supply-side intervention could help overcome credit constraints. Overall, the poor in urban areas are more credit-constrained because of exclusion by commercial banks and weaker interpersonal trust.","[Tinh Doan] Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Tinh Doan] VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Polit Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam; [Tran Quang Tuyen] VNU Univ Econ & Business, Fac Polit Econ, Hanoi, Vietnam",University of Waikato; Vietnam National University Hanoi; Vietnam National University Hanoi,"Doan, T (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",,,"Tran, Tuyen/0000-0002-0221-1480; Doan, Tinh/0000-0002-2297-8187","Vietnam National University, Hanoi; VNU University of Economics and Business","Vietnam National University, Hanoi; VNU University of Economics and Business","We thank Andrea Menclova (Canterbury University) and Asadul Islam (Monash University) for their significant comments and suggestions to improve the paper, and participants, especially Valerie Kozel (the World Bank), of the Workshop on Development in the Mekong region at the University of Waikato for their helpful comments.

The project organized 30 community mobilization meetings to encourage financial contributions. Ten low meetings included only low contributors, ten high meetings included only high contributors, while ten mixed meetings were composed of both high and low contributors. We then followed contributions over one year. Low contributors increased their contribution after mixed versus low meetings. Effects were asymmetric: high contributors did not contribute less following mixed versus high meetings. Organizing mixed meetings was thus a win-win for the project. Detailed qualitative observations of meeting attendees suggest that much of the exposure in mixed meetings to peer encouragement, project criticisms, and neutral learning about the project came from high contributors.

This paper studies the effects of the ban in the Basque Country of a political party, Batasuna, which continued to contest the elections after its ban by calling for a null vote, that has expressive but no instrumental value. Exploiting the heterogeneity in the pre-ban presence of Batasuna and in the enforcement of the ban across municipalities and elections, I find that null voters are two-thirds of the potential Batasuna voters in a regular election, indicating that expressive motivations alone explain two-thirds of the votes for this party. Null votes lower the electoral threshold and raise the instrumental incentives for the remaining voters to vote for smaller parties, but the behavioral effect of the ban on the fragmentation of city councils is close to zero. In a region with salient identity politics, the results are consistent with prevalent expressive voting, in contrast with the common assumption of purely instrumental voters. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article estimates dose-response functions to evaluate the effects of enrolment in New Jersey's PDR programme on farm profitability. The generalized propensity score method in a continuous treatment setting is used to address selection bias arising from voluntary programme participation. Treatment effects are measured across treatment levels to determine whether farm profitability is affected differently across levels of programme participation. Our findings reveal that, relative to unpreserved farms, profit per acre tends to increase along lower treatment levels. The profit per acre of preserved farms in the 1-40% treatment range is, on average, $407 higher than that of unpreserved farms in the full sample. Positive profit differentials averaging between $317 and $472 per acre are also observed in the 1-20%, 1-40% and 1-60% treatment quintiles in the farming occupation sample. We do not observe statistically significant profitability differentials when treatment effects are averaged across all positive treatment values.","[Attavanich, Witsanu] Kasetsart Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Bangkok, Thailand; [Schilling, Brian J.] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Schilling, Brian J.] Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Cooperat Extens, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA; [Sullivan, Kevin P.] Rutgers State Univ, New Jersey Agr Expt Stn, New Brunswick, NJ USA",Kasetsart University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Schilling, BJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Dept Agr Food & Resource Econ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.;Schilling, BJ (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, Rutgers Cooperat Extens, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",schilling@njaes.rutgers.edu,"Attavanich, Witsanu/ABC-5376-2021","Attavanich, Witsanu/0000-0003-1502-5406; Schilling, Brian/0000-0003-4203-130X",USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010-85211-20515],USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture(United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)),This work was supported by the USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture [2010-85211-20515].

This paper investigates the importance of incentives inherent in the tax-benefit system for the individual decision to take up work. Using German microdata over the period 1993-2010, we find that recent reforms in Germany increased work incentives at the extensive margin measured by the participation tax rate (PTR), particularly for low-income individuals. Work incentives are even higher if the time horizon is extended to more than one year, pointing at an overestimation of the disincentives by standard measures. Regression analysis reveals that a decrease in the PTR increases the probability of taking up work significantly.","[Bartels, Charlotte] German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany; [Bartels, Charlotte] UCFS, Uppsala, Sweden; [Pestel, Nico] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pestel, Nico] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany; [Pestel, Nico] Ctr European Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Cologne; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Bartels, C (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res DIW, Berlin, Germany.;Bartels, C (通讯作者)，UCFS, Uppsala, Sweden.",cbartels@diw.de; pestel@iza.org,,"Pestel, Nico/0000-0003-0062-9514",,,,,22,6,7,0,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

It requires the identical average impact of the withdrawal of any agent from a game on the remaining population. It turns out that the axiom of balanced collective contributions and the classical axiom of efficiency characterize the equal allocation of nonseparable costs, an allocation rule that is extensively used in cost allocation problems and in accounting. In particular, the equal allocation of nonseparable costs coincides with the nucleolus on the class of data games within the European REACH legislation. While our result does not hold on data games, extra axioms enable provision of comparable characterizations of the equal allocation of nonseparable costs and the Shapley value on this class of games.","[Beal, Sylvain; Deschamps, Marc] Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE, EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France; [Solal, Philippe] Univ St Etienne, CNRS, UMR 5824, GATE, St Etienne, France",Universite de Franche-Comte; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Béal, S (通讯作者)，Univ Bourgogne Franche Comte, CRESE, EA3190, F-25000 Besancon, France.",sylvain.beal@univ-fcomte.fr; marc.deschamps@univ-fcomte.fr; philippe.solal@univ-st-etienne.fr,"Deschamps, Marc/AHB-4597-2022",,"National Agency for Research (ANR) [ANR-13-BSHS1-0010, ANR-12-JSH1-0001]; Mathematiques de la decision pour l'ingenierie physique et sociale (MODMAD) project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-JSH1-0001] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",National Agency for Research (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Mathematiques de la decision pour l'ingenierie physique et sociale (MODMAD) project; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to Jenny Helstroffer and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments.

Using an extensive panel data-set on the NUTS-4 level (i.e. the poviats level, or districts or counties level) we examine a wide range of determinants of local unemployment. Our research examines two groups of the determinants: one related to equilibrium theory and the other related to disequilibrium theory of local unemployment. We find that demographics, education and sectoral employment composition exert a stronger impact over rates of local unemployment than various demand factors. The impact of the determinants, while robust for outliers, is not homogeneous across Polish regions. In particular, in the most depressed local labour markets, skill improvement programmes do not appear to work and unemployment rates are relatively less responsive to investment. Our research suggests that there is no easy cure for local unemployment in Poland, but a few policies have the potential to slightly reduce existing disparities.","[Cizkowicz, Piotr; Rzonca, Andrzej] Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Int Comparat Studies, Warsaw, Poland; [Kowalczuk, Michal] EY Poland, Econ Anal Team, Warsaw, Poland",Warsaw School of Economics,"Cizkowicz, P (通讯作者)，Warsaw Sch Econ, Dept Int Comparat Studies, Warsaw, Poland.",pcizko@sgh.waw.pl,,,,,,,81,8,8,1,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC,2016,28.0,4,,,,,487,519,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1226784,0.0,,,33,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EC2FF,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387924400006,0

They originate from the voluntary nature of the EU project and the necessity to obtain unanimous approval of all member states to take new integration steps. To increase the resilience of the EU project against current and future shocks, its major institutional gaps and asymmetries should be addressed as quickly as possible. In this paper, we use the theory of fiscal federalism and subsidiarity principle to set the agenda of the EU reform. This includes the identification of areas such as completing the EMU and Schengen projects, foreign, security, and defence policies, environmental and climate change policies where further integration can offer substantial returns to scale and better provisions of global and pan-European public goods. On the other hand, there are also areas such as agriculture policy, products, services and labour standards, and fiscal surveillance rules, where deregulation in favour of market forces could ease business environment and make EU regulations less bureaucratic. Developing integration beyond the traditional economic sphere will also have an impact on the size of the EU budget, balance of power between the EU governing bodies (a bigger role of the European Parliament) and the democratic legitimacy of the EU project.","[Dabrowski, Marek] Bruegel, Brussels, Belgium; [Dabrowski, Marek] Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Dabrowski, Marek] Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，Bruegel, Brussels, Belgium.;Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.;Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@case-research.eu,"Dabrowski, Marek/AAA-3661-2021","Dabrowski, Marek/0000-0002-7960-8734",,,,,50,7,7,2,49,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We experiment a GIS approach to design a geographically stratified contingent valuation sample of the population resident in infrastructure corridors in a whole region. We estimate, by means of a binary choice logit model, the perceived marginal damage from impacts of power lines on human health, the landscape and the environment. Specific treatment is given to qualitatively different forms of impact, namely real estate depreciation versus diffused perception of damage, arising at different distances from the lines. The set of GIS-based variables (proximity to power lines, presence of other infrastructure, endowment of natural and built heritage and other local context variables) prove to be significant predictors in the utility function of resident households. Finally, we compute simulated values that combine information on individual's willingness to pay, population density and the dimension of the considered corridor around the infrastructure, so as to generalize the outcomes of case-specific studies for use in policy choices such as infrastructure localization, undergrounding and negotiation of compensations.","[Giaccaria, Sergio] European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, Petten, Netherlands; [Frontuto, Vito; Dalmazzone, Silvana] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat, Turin, Italy",European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Energy & Transport (IET); University of Turin,"Giaccaria, S (通讯作者)，European Commiss, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Energy & Transport, Petten, Netherlands.",Sergio.GIACCARIA@ec.europa.eu,,"Frontuto, Vito/0000-0002-0627-9511; Dalmazzone, Silvana/0000-0002-7203-8679",Directorate of Environment of the Piedmont Region; Office for the Evaluation of Public Investments of the Piedmont Region (NUVAL),Directorate of Environment of the Piedmont Region; Office for the Evaluation of Public Investments of the Piedmont Region (NUVAL),This article draws from results of a research project funded by the Directorate of Environment of the Piedmont Region and the Office for the Evaluation of Public Investments of the Piedmont Region (NUVAL).,,67,3,3,1,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Theoretically, labor and capital flows must be substitutes. However, empirical papers find migration and FDI to be either substitutes or complements, depending upon the skill content of migration. To reconcile the standard theory with these empirical results, we develop a two-country general equilibrium model. We consider three factors - capital, unskilled and skilled labor - and two internationally traded goods. Countries only differ in their factor endowments. The first country is a developing country amply endowed with unskilled labor; the second one is a developed country well endowed with skilled labor. Under imperfect factor mobility, we find that capital and unskilled labor flows are substitutes, while capital and skilled labor flows are complements. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a unique microtransaction data set, we find that the incidence of the subsidy strongly and significantly varies across price segments. Subsidized buyers of cheap cars paid a little more than comparable buyers who did not receive the subsidy, indicating incidence amounts slightly below 100 %. For more expensive vehicles, subsidized buyers were granted large extra discounts on top of the government premium, translating into incidence amounts considerably greater than 100 %.

Ostensibly, through the direct measurement of our thoughts, economics and social science will be revolutionized. Such claims have been subject to critique from mainstream and non-mainstream economists alike. Many of these criticisms relate to measurability, relevance, and coherence. In this article, we seek to contribute to this critical examination by investigating the potential of underdetermination, such as the statement that testing involves the conjunction of auxiliary assumptions, and that consequently it may not be possible to isolate the effect of any given hypothesis. We argue that neuroeconomics is especially sensitive to issues of underdetermination. Institutional economists should be cautious of neuroeconomists' zeal as they appear to over-interpret experimental findings and, therefore, neuroeconomics may provide a false prospectus seeking to reinforce the nostrums of homo economicus.","[McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Polit Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Novarese, Marco] Dipartimento Giurisprudenza Sci Polit Econ & Soci, Alessandria, Italy",University of Glasgow,"McMaster, R (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Polit Econ, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,,,,,,72,3,3,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Much has been written on the relationship between discretionary monetary policy and policy under commitment from a timeless perspective. Additionally, there is a relatively robust literature that suggests monetary policy in the U.S. responds asymmetrically to fluctuations in the output gap. Here, asymmetric optimal policy is analyzed under both commitment and discretion in a simple dynamic New-Keynesian model. The timeless perspective equilibrium leads to a policy rule with inertia (consistent with the literature), but in this case implies asymmetry over time. This result is not found under discretion. Both model variants and those imposing linearity are estimated for five developed economies. Policy deviations are simulated for the linear and nonlinear rules. Results imply that the asymmetric commitment policy produces the lowest average deviations from observed policy, and also the policy deviations with the smallest variance, for all five countries. A linear Taylor rule produces statistically larger average deviations than both asymmetric commitment and asymmetric discretionary policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","[Scott, C.

We show that an uninformed utility-maximizing investor, with a feasible level of risk aversion and reasonable portfolio exposure constraints, can use VIX futures to significantly improve his optimal reference portfolio comprised of a monetary asset, equities, corporate and government bonds. We find also that VIX futures provide significant improvement over hedge funds and commodities.

In the Czech Republic, voucher privatization created a large group of minority shareholders who coexisted with large shareholder-managers who controlled firms. Critics allege that the structure of shareholdings and regulatory failures allowed pervasive theft of corporate assets, much of it financed by irresponsible bank lending, and led to a financial crisis and an economic downturn. I argue that neither anecdotal evidence of managerial malfeasance nor the theories of tunneling and looting provide strong evidence for this view of corporate governance in the Czech Republic. A lack of small shareholder protection seems to have imposed small costs on the economy, and it may have facilitated rather than hampered the restructuring of firms.

The reinterpretation outlined here draws on institutional analysis as well as a range of archival sources, much of it previously unreleased. The inefficiencies within the original contractual agreement are highlighted. The lack of credibility associated with this agreement was in turn traceable to the institutional environment (with its associated risk-reward implications) under which industrial policy operated. This environment had a political element: it had been distorted by the Troubles and the resulting fears policymakers had of a cumulative causation relationship between violence and unemployment.

This effect is specified as a function of the density of temperatures observed at a high frequency with a functional coefficient, in contrast to conventional methods using a function of monthly heating and cooling degree days. Our approach also allows non-climate variables to influence the short-run demand response to temperature changes. Our methodology is demonstrated using Korean electricity demand data for residential and commercial sectors. In the residential sector, we do not find evidence that the non-climate variables affect the demand response to temperature. In contrast, we show conclusive evidence that the non-climate variables influence the demand response in the commercial sector. In particular, commercial consumers are less responsive to cold temperatures when controlling for the electricity price relative to city gas. They are more responsive to the price when temperatures are cold. The estimated effect of the time trend suggests that seasonality of commercial demand has increased in the winter but decreased in the summer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the lack of temporal flexibility in current designs of these market based instruments limits their cost-effectiveness on days forecasted to have the highest levels of pollution, including ozone precursors such as NOx, and as further emission reductions are sought, the marginal cost of these approaches increases dramatically. In this paper, we compare three regulatory schemes for reducing NOx emissions on high-ozone days: time-differentiated pricing, which prices NOx emissions only on days with high-ozone concentrations; undifferentiated pricing, which represents current NOx emission regulations; and technology-based standards. We develop a novel model that captures for the first time both the short- and long-term response of generators, through redispatching and control technology adoption, to a dynamic pricing scheme such as time-differentiated pricing. Unlike prior studies on time-differentiated pricing, the heart of our model, a unit commitment model, accounts for inter-temporal constraints on power generation that may be crucial to accurately capturing the response of generators to a transient price signal. We apply this model to the Texas power system and find that while control technology adoption (specifically selective catalytic reduction) does occur at very high time-differentiated prices, time-differentiated pricing mainly affects emissions and costs through redispatching of gas- for coal-fired generation. Furthermore, we show that time-differentiated pricing, due to its targeted pricing mechanism, provides a more cost-effective approach than undifferentiated pricing or technology-based standards for reducing NOx emissions on high-ozone days, but is not cost-effective at reducing summer-wide NOx emissions. Our results illustrate the trade-offs between these regulatory approaches and suggest that states should consider dynamic pricing schemes such as time-differentiated pricing for achieving further reductions in peak ozone concentrations.

The aim of this paper is to provide a simple microfoundation of these biases in a model where the size and type-composition of the meeting pools are shaped by agents' socialization decisions. In particular, agents either inbreed (direct search only to similar types) or outbreed (direct search to population at large). When outbreeding is costly, this is shown to induce stark equilibrium behavior of a threshold type: agents inbreed (i.e. mostly meet their own type) if, and only if, their group is above certain size. We show that this threshold equilibrium generates patterns of in-group and cross-group ties that are consistent with empirical evidence of homophily in two paradigmatic instances: high school friendships and interethnic marriages.

We confirm the theoretical prediction that information transmission occurs only in verifiable feedback mechanisms and private-verifiable feedback is the most informative mechanism. Yet, subjects also exhibit some behavior that cannot be explained by our baseline model, such as telling the truth even when this will definitely hurt them, interpreting no feedback more optimistically than they should, and being influenced by feedback given to the other agent. We show that a model with individual-specific lying costs and naive agents can account for some, but not all, of these findings. We conclude that although agents do take into account the principal's strategic behavior to form beliefs in a Bayesian fashion, they are overly optimistic and interpret positive feedback to the other agent more pessimistically than they should.

J,"Kim, SH",,,,"Kim, Sang-Hyun",,,On the optimal social contract: Agency costs of self-government,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Social contract; Democracy; Economic development; Principal-agent problem; Self-enforcing political regime,,"In a typical study of political economy, citizens are regarded as the principals, and government as the agent. In contrast, classical theorists of democracy such as Jean Jacques Rousseau and James Madison were deeply interested in the dual nature of people; they are the principals (citizens sharing the sovereign power) and, at the same time, the agents (subjects under the laws). Government, in their framework, is an intermediate body which helps people solve their self-control problem. Equipped with tools of modern economics, this paper explores the classical problem to see how economic development and political institutionalization relate to the structure of government and the quality of public sector. In particular, I consider repeated games with a large population and incomplete information, in which players decide whether to sacrifice private consumption to provide public goods. Because both people and the executive of the public projects are subject to moral hazard, the people spend resources to monitor the executive and the people themselves. The optimal self-enforcing contract, which can be interpreted as an efficiency upper bound of political systems, is characterized. An analysis of the contract shows that as a country gets more economically developed and politically institutionalized, the agency problem on the people's side becomes negligible and that poor economic performance of a country might prevent the citizens from establishing a more efficient public sector.

These bottlenecks likely affected not only China's domestic coal market, but also global coal markets. In this paper, we estimate the costs and consequences of these bottlenecks using a production and multimodal transportation model. We find that coal transportation inefficiencies increased the price of Chinese domestic coal at coastal locations and thereby influenced global seaborne coal prices. According to our model results, the resulting extra costs of coal supplied to the Chinese economy totaled 228 billion renminbi (RMB) in 2011 and 105 in 2013. The subsequent debottlenecking, on the other hand, has reduced the price of Chinese domestic coal delivered to coastal regions and contributed to the reduction in global seaborne coal prices since 2011. Our analysis also suggests that current tariffs for coal transport, with their embedded taxes to cover investments in rail capacity, result in economic efficiencies similar to charging marginal transportation costs and that planners have not introduced distortions that impose significant additional costs on the Chinese economy. Many projects that expanded transport capacity delivered strongly positive rates of return. However, some have poor or negative rates of return, which can reflect either overinvestment or preinvestment in future needs. (C) 2016 KAPSARC.

Human capital expenditure jeopardizes growth, if a country belongs to the group of under-performers, while the initial costs are progressively transformed into growth-friendly factors for the group of over-achievers. Welfare expenditure is unproductive in the medium term, but only above a given growth threshold. Higher direct taxes are more harmful for low-growth countries, since their effects are more persistent than for countries with high growth.

The Hong Kong government overestimated post-1997-Handover mainland Chinese immigration and local births, creating excess capacity in many school districts. In 2003, with student enrollment falling to new lows (increasing cost per student), the government announced that it would close schools that were unable to recruit enough students. Since schools compete for students within their own district, the accidental excess capacity created closure threats that varied by district. Difference-in-differences analyses show that after initiation of this policy, student scores in heavily overbuilt districts were lower than scores in other districts and lowest in districts with the fewest students per class. Although closure threats were counterproductive for improving performance, the school closures eventually improved overall school quality, as typically, the lowest performing schools in each district closed.","[Joh, Sung Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151916, South Korea; [Chiu, Ming Ming] Purdue Univ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [Khoo, Lawrence] Chinese Univ Hong Kong Shenzhen, Sch Management & Econ, Shenzhen, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Seoul National University (SNU); Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen","Joh, SW (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul 151916, South Korea.",chiu23@purdue.edu; swjoh@snu.ac.kr; lawrencekhoo@cuhk.edu.cn,,"Chiu, Ming/0000-0002-5721-1971","Institute of Finance and Banking at Seoul National University; Seoul National University; Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University","Institute of Finance and Banking at Seoul National University; Seoul National University; Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University","This work was funded by the Institute of Finance and Banking at Seoul National University, Seoul National University Research Grant (for Humanities and Social Sciences), and Institute of Management Research, Seoul National University.",,51,1,1,1,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Information structure and labor supply decisions follow the Mirrleesian tradition. However, while the household's total consumption is publicly observable, the consumption levels of the individual spouses are not observable. With a utilitarian social welfare function we show that the expression for a spouses' marginal income tax rate includes a Pigouvian (paternalistic) and an incentive term. The Pigouvian term favors a marginal subsidy (tax) for the high-weight (low-weight) spouse, whose labor supply otherwise tends to be too low (high). The sign and the magnitude of the incentive term depends on the weight structure across couples. In some cases both terms have the same sign and imply a positive marginal tax for the low-weight spouse (who may be female) and a negative one for the high-weight spouse (possibly the male). This is at odds with the traditional Bosldn and Sheshinski results. Our conclusions can easily be generalized to more egalitarian welfare functions. Finally, we present numerical simulations based on a calibrated specification of our model. The calculations confirm that the male spouse may well have the lower (and possibly even negative) marginal tax rate.","[Cremer, Helmuth; Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Lozachmeur, Jean-Marie] CNRS, F-75700 Paris, France; [Maldonado, Dario] Univ Los Andes, Sch Govt, Bogota, Colombia; [Roeder, Kerstin] Univ Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); University of Augsburg,"Roeder, K (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Augsburg, Germany.",helmuth.cremer@tse-fr.eu; jean-marie.lozachmeur@tse-fr.eu; dmaldonadoc@uniandes.edu.co; kerstin.roeder@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Maldonado, Dario/JAC-9219-2023","Maldonado, Dario/0000-0003-3544-208X",Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,Chaire Marche des risques et creation de valeur of the FdR/SCOR,"This paper has been presented at the CESifo Area Conference in Public Economics, the Journees d'Economie Publique LAGV, the Taxation Theory Conference Cologne, the Conference of the IIPF and of the German Economic Society and in seminars at the Universities of Munich, Cergy-Pontoise, Bologna, and NHH Bergen.

By far, the most relevant change has been the maturing of its financial systems and the growing relevance of the global financial cycle: financial inclusion has spread, financial markets have deepened and financial globalisation has linked domestic markets closer to international markets. One consequence of the maturing of the financial systems has been the weakening of the traditional case for the monetarist view of the roles of monetary aggregates in the conduct of monetary policy. In addition, the maturing of the financial systems has elevated concerns of financial stability, as both a source of shocks and a responsibility of central banks. These developments have been further complicated by monetary policy spillovers from the advanced economies. All this points to the need to consider alternatives to conventional inflation targeting frameworks. This paper lays out a policy framework based on a multi-pillar monetary policy approach as a potentially attractive alternative for EM Asia. The three pillars are based on economic, financial and exchange rate stability, respectively. This framework not only offers an alternative conceptual framework but also implies institutional reforms to ensure central banks take a longer term perspective when setting policy.

Despite its ubiquitous use, this is one of the first empirical studies that analyzes why the use of trade credit varies along the value chain. We argue that competition faced by firms at different stages in the value chain and enforcement mechanisms that stimulate repayment jointly determine the use of trade credit. We distinguish two dimensions of competition, that is, rivalry and customer bargaining power. Competition may stimulate firms to provide trade credit to keep customers from switching to other suppliers. Yet, high contract enforcement costs relative to the value of the transactions, reduce the willingness to offer trade credit. We find empirical evidence showing that competition does not (strongly) influence the use of trade credit in the retail market, whereas it does in the markets for wholesalers and millers. We interpret these results as suggestive evidence that the retail, wholesale and milling market segments differ in terms of the enforcement costs involved in the provision of trade credit. Rivalry at the retail market segment makes switching easy for customers, even in case of default. As enforcement of repayment in this market segment is difficult and costly, trade credit appears to be a risky and less attractive marketing instrument for retailers. In contrast, in the wholesale and milling market segment, trade credit is widespread as stakeholders know each other, making informal mechanisms effective in supporting the enforcement of trade credit repayment.","[Hermes, Niels; Lensink, Robert; Lutz, Clemens; Thu, Uyen Nguyen Lam] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Hermes, Niels] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Lensink, Robert] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Wageningen University & Research,"Hermes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.;Hermes, N (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.",c.l.m.hermes@rug.nl; b.w.lensink@rug.nl; c.h.m.lutz@rug.nl; nguyenlam_uyen@yahoo.com,"Lensink, Robert/ABA-3076-2020","Lensink, Robert/0000-0001-6448-5164",ESRC [ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,49,8,10,0,21,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

However, the kind of communication in these experiments is unrealistic for many economic and organizational contexts, as it consists of costless messages from every agent, which are sent every time a coordination game is played. We study how communication use and its effectiveness change when one considers that sending messages is often both costly and voluntary, and investigate the effectiveness of alternative communication policies employed by a firm. The policies differ in the degree to which message use is voluntary and in who bears the costs for communication. Imposing even small communication costs on employees dramatically reduces message use, but message use is more prevalent and efficient coordination occurs more frequently when the proportion of message costs borne by employees is small. We conclude that under certain conditions, large but incomplete subsidies for using communication can be an optimal solution for obtaining efficient coordination in firms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Evasion affects the capital dynamics in two ways: the growth rate of capital increases because some taxes are not paid, but when caught evading the consumer has to pay a fine (proportional to evasion). Consumption can be allocated between ordinary goods and so-called visible goods. The latter are used by the Government for targeting the audit, since they are considered like an indicator of consumer's income. In fact, the probability of being caught is a function of the distance between the actual and the presumed consumption in visible goods.

We illustrate with firm-level data for Belgium and Peru that the decline was very sudden and almost entirely due to lower export sales by existing exporters. After the recession, exports rebounded almost equally quickly and we evaluate whether export promotion programs were an effective tool aiding this recovery. We show that firms taking advantage of this type of support did better during the crisis, controlling flexibly for systematic differences between supported and control firms. The primary mechanism we identify is that supported firms are generally more likely to survive on the export market and, in particular, are more likely to continue exporting to countries hit by the financial crisis. In terms of absolute magnitudes, the mid-point of the range of estimates suggest a 6% to 11%, respectively for Belgium and Peru, higher probability of survival on the export market for supported firms and approximately 20% to 10% higher exports for surviving exporters.","[Van Biesebroeck, Johannes] Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; CEPR, Washington, DC USA; Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC USA",KU Leuven; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); Inter-American Development Bank,"Van Biesebroeck, J (通讯作者)，Katholieke Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",,"Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/GLV-0353-2022","Van Biesebroeck, Johannes/0000-0003-4144-5578",,,,,83,37,41,0,21,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Recently, like other regulatory authorities, the Irish central bank introduced regulatory limits on mortgage lending aimed at protecting greater financial stability. In this paper, we seek to examine some of the wider implications of these measures for tenure choice in the Irish housing market. We find that a reduction in the loan-to-value ratio, such as may occur as a result of regulatory limits, will lead to a greater demand for rental accommodation, prompting higher rents for a given house price level. While this result is somewhat incidental to financial stability, it does have significant implications for housing policy, particularly, at a time when the Irish housing market is confronted by an acknowledged supply shortage.

We find bi-directional causality between polarization and inequality, consistent with theoretical conjecture and less formal evidence in previous studies.","[Duca, John V.; Saving, Jason L.] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, POB 655906, Dallas, TX 75265 USA; [Duca, John V.] Southern Methodist Univ, Dallas, TX USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas; Southern Methodist University,"Duca, JV (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, POB 655906, Dallas, TX 75265 USA.",john.v.duca@dal.frb.org,,,,,,,49,18,19,1,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

An advantage of this formalization is that it demonstrates the importance of the structure of production costs, as well as market power, in explaining the long-run survival of discriminatory firms. In addition, we show that, despite decades of empirical research on this connection, there is no consistent theoretical relationship between the degree of market concentration within an industry and the degree of discrimination. However, we do find an indirect link in which market liberalization has a more pronounced effect in reducing discrimination in more concentrated markets.

In order to evaluate the properties of these markets, we compare their behaviour to behaviour in markets without money, where money cannot intervene. As the trading mechanism might be a compounding factor, we investigate two kinds of market mechanism: the double auction, where bids, asks and trades take place in continuous time throughout a trading period; and the clearing house, where bids and asks are placed once in a trading period, and which are then cleared by an aggregating device. We thus have four treatments, the pairwise combinations of non-monetised/monetised trading with double auction/clearing house. We find that: convergence is faster under non-monetised trading, implying that the necessity of using money to facilitate trade hinders convergence; that monetised trading is noisier than non-monetised trading; and that the volume of trade and realised surpluses are higher with the double auction than the clearing house. As far as efficiency is concerned, monetised trading lowers both informational and allocational efficiency, and while the double auction outperforms the clearing house in terms of allocational efficiency, the clearing house is marginally better than the double auction in terms of informational efficiency when trade is through money. Crucially we confirm the conjecture that inspired these experiments: that the necessity to use money in trading hinders convergence to competitive equilibrium, lowers realised trades and surpluses, and hence may cause unemployment.","[Hey, John D.] Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Di Cagno, Daniela] LUISS, Rome, Italy",University of York - UK; Luiss Guido Carli University,"Hey, JD (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Econ & Related Studies, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",john.hey@york.ac.uk,,,CESARE,CESARE,"The authors would like to express their gratitude to Andrea Lombardo for writing the software in Visual Studio for these experiments.

We contrast the impact limited credibility has when the consolidating country has the means to tailor monetary policy to its own needs, with the impact when the country is a small member of a currency union with a negligible effect on interest rates and on nominal exchange rates of the currency union. We find two key results. First, in the case of an independent monetary policy, the adverse impact of limited credibility is relatively small, and consolidation can be expected to reduce government debt at a relatively low output cost given that monetary policy provides more accommodation than it would under perfect credibility. Second, the lack of monetary accommodation under currency union membership implies that the output cost may be significantly larger, and that progress in reducing government debt in the short and medium term may be limited under imperfect credibility.

In particular, we develop a two-level frontier-efficiency model to examine how ICT's direct and indirect impact on different components of productivity is related to the economic growth in the US. Our empirical analysis has confirmed that ICT investment does contribute to productivity but not in the usual manner - we find a positive (but lagged) ICT effect on technological progress. We argue that for a positive ICT role on growth to actually take place, a period of negative relationship between productivity and ICT investment together with ICT-using sectors' capacity to learn from the embodied new technology was crucial. In addition, it took a learning period with appropriate complementary co-inventions for the new ICT-capital to become effective and its gains to be realized.

For this purpose, we develop a biennial non-radial directional distance function measure (BNDDM) by combining biennial environmental technology and the non-radial directional distance function. This new approach can overcome the well-known infeasibility problem and incorporate the total slacks of variables. We further extend BNDDM in a dynamic perspective to propose a BNDDM-based Luenberger productivity indicator that is capable of measuring green TFP growth. Then, we explore the drivers of China's green TFP based on the proposed methodology from 1999 to 2012. The empirical results are as follows: first, China's green TFP improves by 2.02% annually, although this improvement has recently slowed. Second, technological progress is the main driver of green TFP from the technology-contribution view; reductions in COD and SO2, as well as labor saving, are the main drivers from the factor-contribution view. Third, China suffers from two kinds of double deterioration: the deterioration of efficiency and the scale effect as well as that of harmony in both traditional and green TFP among the three regions.

In every period, the players choose how much to search of the previously unsearched portion of the island in a winner-takes-all contest. If the players cannot coordinate so as to avoid searching the same locations, the unique equilibrium involves complete dissipation of rents. On the other hand, if the players have some (even limited) ability to coordinate so as to avoid duplicative search and the search area is sufficiently small, there is a unique equilibrium in which the full area is searched and each player earns a positive expected return.

First, we develop a simple theoretical model linking tax evasion to the business environment. Second, we test the model predictions using the World Bank Enterprise Survey data for Uganda. Findings indicate that the extent of tax evasion is associated with bureaucratic bribery, the quality and efficiency of the legal systems, and the inadequate provision of public capital. Our results are robust to alternative estimation strategy, choice of instruments, treatment of outliers, and missing data.","[Mawejje, Joseph] Ctr Econ Policy Res, 51 Pool Rd,Makerere Univ Campus,POB 7841, Kampala, Uganda; [Okumu, Ibrahim Mike] Makerere Univ, Coll Business & Management Sci, Kampala, Uganda",Makerere University,"Mawejje, J (通讯作者)，Ctr Econ Policy Res, 51 Pool Rd,Makerere Univ Campus,POB 7841, Kampala, Uganda.",jmawejje@eprcug.org,,"Mawejje, Joseph/0000-0002-3301-7226; Okumu, Ibrahim/0000-0001-9652-675X",,,,,46,12,12,2,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.
