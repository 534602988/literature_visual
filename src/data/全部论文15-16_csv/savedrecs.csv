There is less evidence on whether, fora fixed level of spending, doctors allocate resources to patients with the highest expected returns. We assess both sources of inefficiency, exploiting variation in rates of negative imaging tests for pulmonaty embolism. We document enormous across-doctor heterogeneity in testing conditional on patient population, which explains the negative relationship between physicians' testing rates and test yields. Furthermore, doctors do not target testing to the highest risk patients, reducing test yields by one-third. Our calibration suggests misallocation is more costly than overuse.","[Abaluck, Jason; Venkatesh, Arjun] Yale Univ, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Abaluck, Jason; Agha, Leila] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Agha, Leila] Dartmouth Coll, Dept Econ, 6016 Rockefeller Hall, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Kabrhel, Chris] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Dept Emergency Med, Zero Emerson Pl,Suite 3B, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Kabrhel, Chris; Raja, Ali] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Raja, Ali] Massachusetts Gen Hosp, Zero Emerson Pl,Suite 3B, Boston, MA 02114 USA; [Venkatesh, Arjun] Yale New Haven Med Ctr, 20 York St, New Haven, CT 06504 USA",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Dartmouth College; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Harvard University; Harvard University; Massachusetts General Hospital; Yale University,"Abaluck, J (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, 165 Whitney Ave, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.;Abaluck, J (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jason.abaluck@yale.edu; Leila.Agha@dartmouth.edu; ckabrhel@partners.org; asraja@partners.org; arjun.venkatesh@yale.edu,"Raja, Ali S./AAE-5103-2019",,NIA [T32-AG0000186],NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"An earlier draft of this paper circulated under the title Negative Tests and the Efficiency of Medical Care: What Determines Heterogeneity in Imaging Behavior?

We use a unique Latvian scanner-level dataset, covering the 2008-2009 crisis, to document several empirical findings. First, expenditure switching accounted for one-third of the fall in imports, and took place within narrowly defined product groups. Second, there was no corresponding within group change in relative prices. Third, consumers substituted from expensive imports to cheaper domestic alternatives. These findings motivate us to estimate a model of nonhomothetic consumer demand, which explains two-thirds of the observed expenditure switching. Estimated switching is driven by income, not changes in relative prices.","[Bems, Rudolfs] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan; [di Giovanni, Julian] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Ramon Trias Fargas 25-27, Barcelona 08005, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian] ICREA, Barcelona, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian] Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian] CREI, Barcelona, Spain; [di Giovanni, Julian] CEPR, Washington, DC USA",University of Tokyo; Pompeu Fabra University; ICREA; Barcelona School of Economics; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR),"Bems, R (通讯作者)，Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Publ Policy, Bunkyo Ku, 7-3-1 Hongo, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.",rudolfs.bems@gmail.com; julian.digiovanni@upf.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017; Di Giovanni, Julian/D-1154-2014","Di Giovanni, Julian/0000-0002-6864-6401",ICREA Funding Source: Custom,ICREA(ICREA),,,47,12,15,1,31,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Given that immigrant workers are younger than the domestic population, a continuous flow of immigrants reduces the old-age dependency ratio and improves financing. Existing general equilibrium estimates of the public finance contribution of migration, performed with different models, are not comparable across countries and sometimes differ even in sign. We use the same overlapping-generations model with a detailed representation of institutions and labor market activity to provide comparable estimates of the impact of immigration on public finance in four European countries. We find that future projected immigration flows are equivalent to 14.3 % points labor income taxes in Austria, 7.3 points in Germany, 6.2 points in the UK and 1.7 points in Poland in 2060. These differences are due to the projected volume of immigration and institutional setups, among other factors. For comparable volumes of immigration, future flows have largest impact in Germany and smallest in the UK.","[Berger, Johannes; Strohner, Ludwig] EcoAustria Inst Econ Res, Heumarkt 10, A-1030 Vienna, Austria; [Davoine, Thomas] Inst Adv Studies, Josefstaedter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria; [Schuster, Philip] Oesterreich Natl Bank, Off Austrian Fiscal Advisory Council, Otto Wagner Pl 3, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",,"Davoine, T (通讯作者)，Inst Adv Studies, Josefstaedter Str 39, A-1080 Vienna, Austria.",johannes.berger@ecoaustria.at; davoine@ihs.ac.at; philip.schuster@oenb.at; ludwig.strohner@ecoaustria.at,,,Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna; Oesterreichische Nationalbank [13800],Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna; Oesterreichische Nationalbank,"Open access funding provided by Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna.

There are two main strategies available for reacting to these changes. This paper considers the decision to invest in either adaptation (domestic) capital or prevention (foreign) capital before a pandemic in an interval of time when pandemic risk is increasing. This paper demonstrates how relatively small investments in the two strategies can provide large savings through smaller expected future damages. The technical relationships between adaptation, prevention and risk also determine the optimal mixture of investment over time. As risk increases, the technical relationships between these three stocks causes the optimal mixture of strategies to change over time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We consider a setting in which there is a vertically integrated incumbent that controls a network required for the supply of the final services and an entrant that undertakes a build-or-buy decision. In this multi-product framework, where the quality of the services is endogenously determined, we show that the entrant always prefers service-based to facilities-based entry, provided that this option is available. Hence, the regulator sets the welfare-maximizing access charges whenever this socially optimal access pricing policy leads to higher welfare than facilities-based entry. Otherwise, a sufficient access policy that ensures facilities-based competition is to ban access to the incumbent's upstream facilities. We present the conditions under which each of these instruments should be implemented and conclude that the optimal access rules depend on the characterization of consumers according to their tendency to be firm-oriented or technology-oriented since this discrimination determines whether intra-firm or, respectively, inter-firm competition prevails in the market.

The laboratory study featured a discrete choice task and questions on comprehension, while the ten countries online experiment included measures of willingness to pay and comprehension. Labels focusing on fuel economy or running costs are better understood, and influence choice about money-related eco-friendly behaviour. We suggest that this effect comes through mental accounting of fuel economy. In the absence of a cost saving frame, we do not find a similar effect of information on CO2 emissions and eco-friendliness. Labels do not perform as well as promotional materials. By virtue of being embedded into a setting designed to capture the attention, the latter are more effective.

There, a cost advantage strengthens small firms, and pricing below the incumbents' marginal cost provides the unique entry strategy.","[Cracau, Daniel; Sadrieh, Abdolkarim] Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany",Otto von Guericke University,"Cracau, D (通讯作者)，Univ Magdeburg, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Pl 2, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.",cracau@ovgu.de; sadrieh@ovgu.de,"Montero, Sonia/HTP-2275-2023; Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/C-7858-2013","Sadrieh, Abdolkarim/0000-0002-9322-4729",,,,,45,1,1,0,9,J C B MOHR,TUBINGEN,"POSTFACH 2040, W-7400 TUBINGEN, GERMANY",0932-4569,1614-0559,,J INST THEOR ECON,J.

We will argue that there is an important role for the IMF in helping to solve information, commitment, and coordination problems with significant implications for the stability of national economies and the international monetary and financial system. In executing these functions, the effectiveness of the IMF, like that of a football referee, depends on whether the players see it as competent and impartial. We will argue that the Fund's perceived competence and impartiality, and hence its effectiveness, are limited by its failure to meet four challenges-concerning the quality of its surveillance (of individual countries, groups of countries, and the global system); the relevance of conditionality in loan contracts; the utility of the Fund's approach to debt problems; and the Fund's failure to adopt a system of governance that gives appropriate voice to different stakeholders. These problems of legitimacy will have to be addressed in order for the IMF to play a more effective role in the 21st century.","[Eichengreen, Barry] Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ & Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Woods, Ngaire] Univ Oxford, Blavatnik Sch Govt, Oxford, England; [Woods, Ngaire] Univ Oxford, Global Econ Governance, Oxford, England",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Eichengreen, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Econ & Polit Sci, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",eichengr@econ.berkeley.edu; ngaire.woods@bsg.ox.ac.uk,,"Eichengreen, Barry/0000-0002-1683-4486",,,,,60,10,14,1,16,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

While such price drops have far-reaching implications for the functioning of the power market, their underlying determinants remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we propose a Markov regime-switching model to investigate low-price events at the European Power Exchange. Our analysis focuses on the role of energy policies that promote renewable energies and have led to significant reductions of nuclear capacities after the Fukushima accident. We find that high electricity infeed from renewable sources increases negative price spike probabilities, while the decommissioning of nuclear plants under the Nuclear Moratorium had an opposing effect. Simulations of market outcomes under different energy policies indicate that reaching ambitious renewable energy targets increases the frequency of low-price events and compromises the financial viability of conventional generation units, while a nuclear phase-out or an increase in storage capacities mitigates these effects.","[Gerster, Andreas] RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Gerster, Andreas] Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany",RWI - Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Gerster, A (通讯作者)，RWI Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.;Gerster, A (通讯作者)，Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, Hohenzollernstr 1-3, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",andreas.gerster@rwi-essen.de,,,,,,,30,5,5,1,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

This evidence is the basis to put forward an assessment on the intensity of interregional redistribution operated by public sector. The main result of the paper is that even if the amount of resources transferred to Southern Italy from the rest of the country has been significant and increasing over time (at least up to the end of the 1990s), redistribution cannot be judged disproportionately large, in the light of income differences among regions, the public commitment in regional policies and the constitutional principles of equal access of citizens to the basic public services. Secondly, historical analysis of data and inspection of facts indicate that the relationship between the intensity of interregional redistribution and the financial effort of regional policies is weak. This supports the view that increasing NFFs have little served the purpose of regional convergence; rather, the rise of imbalances seems to be mainly connected to the overall escalation of public expenditure, following the institutional break occurred in mid-1970s with the establishment of Regional Governments.

In doing so, we use a DSGE model developed to describe the business cycle in Chile, a copper exporting country. We compare the effects of commodity-price shocks under different fiscal rules. The results show that if the fiscal policy is conducted in a way such that the government saves most of the extra revenues from the higher commodity price, then the macroeconomic effects of a commodity price increase of 10% are an expansion of output below 0.2% and a real exchange appreciation of 0.5%. In contrast, when fiscal policy is highly expansive, the same commodity price increase implies an output expansion above 0.5% and a real exchange rate appreciation of 0.8%. With our model, we also analyze the effects of persistent reduction in the commodity price, the relevance of exchange rate flexibility and the role of imperfect credibility of the fiscal rule.

I incorporate a financial accelerator mechanism into a version of the Smets and Wouters (2007) DSGE framework and explore the properties of the model assuming, on the one hand, complete rationality of expectations and, alternatively, several learning algorithms that differ in terms of the information set used by agents to produce the forecasts. I show that the implications of the financial accelerator for the business cycle may vary depending on the approach to modeling the expectations. The results suggest that the learning scheme based on small forecasting functions is able to amplify the effects of financial frictions relative to the model with Rational Expectations. Specifically, I show that the dynamics of real variables under learning is driven to a significant extent by the time variation of agents' beliefs about financial sector variables. During periods when agents perceive asset prices as being relatively more persistent, financial shocks lead to more pronounced macroeconomic outcomes. The amplification effect rises as financial frictions become more severe. At the same time, a learning specification in which agents use more information to generate predictions produces very different asset price and investment dynamics. In such a framework, learning cannot significantly alter the real effects of financial frictions implied by the Rational Expectations model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We prove structural properties of the optimal expected profits with respect to time, inventory level, price impact, advertising impact and different model parameters, such as discount rate, marginal unit costs, and holding costs. We find that the value of an additional item (opportunity costs) is decreasing in the unit costs, the discount rate, the holding cost rate and the number of items left to sell. We also derive structural properties of optimal joint pricing and advertising strategies. This way, we obtain general qualitative insights in the complex interplay and the mutual dependence of optimal pricing and advertising decisions. Among other properties, we show that a higher advertising impact leads to higher optimal prices and lower advertising rates, which in turn implies a lower speed of sale. The results obtained help practitioners to respond to changes in market conditions by adjusting price and advertising accordingly. Our results allow speeding up numerical computations of decisions as the set of possible actions can be reduced significantly. Our analysis implies general results for pure pricing as well as pure advertising models with time-dependent demand elasticities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research for the U.S., Canada and some European countries shows that children who enter school relatively young have higher ADHD rates than their older peers, suggesting that ADHD may be misdiagnosed in the younger children due to their relative immaturity. Using rich administrative health insurance claims data from Germany we study the effects of relative school entry age on ADHD risk in Europe's largest country and relate the effects for Germany to the international evidence. We further analyze different mechanisms that may drive these effects, focusing on physician supply side and demand side factors stemming from the production of education. We find robust evidence for school-entry age related misdiagnosis of ADHD in Germany. Within Germany and internationally, a higher share of misdiagnoses are related to a higher overall ADHD level, suggesting that misdiagnoses may be a driving factor of high ADHD levels. Furthermore, the effects in Germany seem to be driven by teachers and parents in an attempt to facilitate and improve the production of education.

Increasing income and wealth inequalities and a growing anti-elite sentiment in British society, coupled with the negative image of Brussels bureaucrats and a British approach to the rule of law that is fundamentally different from the continental one, also contributed to the final result of the referendum.

Results from a controlled laboratory experiment provide evidence for selfish-rational non-vaccination: individuals react to the interactive incentive structure and make strategic vaccination decisions. We also find support for additional psychological factors determining behavior: individuals with stronger positive other-regarding preferences are more likely to vaccinate. Moreover, costs from action (vaccine-adverse events) have a stronger impact on behavior than costs from inaction (disease), which is evidence for the omission bias. Overall, we suggest that variants of the I-Vax Game can contribute to a better understanding of vaccination behavior and vaccine hesitancy. It can further be a useful experimental tool for testing interventions aiming at increasing vaccine uptake. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Smokeless tobacco (SLT) taxes lead to reductions in SLT use but also lead to substitution among SLT products. We find evidence that cigarette taxes induce purchases of cigarettes with higher tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide contents, but this compensatory behavior is overwhelmed by the reduction in cigarettes purchased.","[Cotti, Chad] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 800 Algomera Blvd, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA; [Nesson, Erik] Ball State Univ, Dept Econ, 2000 W Univ Ave, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Tefft, Nathan] Bates Coll, Dept Econ, 2 Andrews Rd, Lewiston, ME 04240 USA",University of Wisconsin System; Ball State University,"Cotti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 800 Algomera Blvd, Oshkosh, WI 54901 USA.",cottic@uwosh.edu; etnesson@bsu.edu; ntefft@bates.edu,,"Nesson, Erik/0000-0002-4714-0495",,,,,26,27,31,3,21,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

Yet there is little understanding of why some individuals become obese while others do not. We conduct a lab-in-field experiment in a low-income African American community to investigate whether risk and time preferences play a role in the tendency to become obese. We examine the relationship between incentivized measures of risk and time preferences and weight status (BMI), and find that individuals who are more tolerant of risk are more likely to have a higher BMI. This result is driven by the most risk tolerant individuals. Patience is not independently statistically related to BMI in this sample, but those who are more risk averse and patient are less likely to be obese. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model predicts a nonmonotonic relationship between the level of centralization in wage-bargaining institutions and the levels of firm ownership concentration and investor protection legislation. Low and high degrees of centralization yield less concentrated ownership and more investor protection than intermediate degrees. Like recent research, this paper highlights labor as a key constituent in shaping corporate governance. However, our theory can resolve an important puzzle this research confronts, namely, why Scandinavian countries with higher than average labor strength also have higher than average investor protection legislation.

An Empirical Investigation,REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ECONOMIC-DETERMINANTS; PANEL-DATA; LIBERALIZATION; INTEGRATION; EQUATIONS; RETURNS; STATES; INCOME,"This paper assesses how regional trade agreements (RTAs) impact on growth volatility for a sample of 170 countries over the period 1978-2012. Notwithstanding concerns that trade openness through RTAs might heighten exposure to shocks, RTAs through enhanced policy credibility, improved policy coordination and reduced risk of conflicts can also ease growth volatility. Empirical estimations suggest the benefits outweigh the costs as RTAs are consistently associated with lower growth volatility. In addition, smaller economies benefit more from the reduced growth volatility associated with RTAs than larger ones. The nature of the RTA also matters as shallow agreements such as partial-scope preferential trade agreements do not appear to have a significant effect on growth volatility, whereas free trade areas and customs unions do. Finally, in investigating the drivers of RTAs, the regression results confirm that countries that are more prone to shocks are more likely to join an RTA, in particular with countries with relatively less volatile growth.","[Kpodar, Kangni; Imam, Patrick] Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Kpodar, Kangni] FERDI, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kpodar, K (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Kpodar, K (通讯作者)，FERDI, 1900 Penn Ave NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",kkpodar@imf.org,,,,,,,56,4,4,1,23,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

Gender bias is particularly likely to take the form of statistical discrimination. In this study we sought to verify the hypothesis that researcher's gender affects evaluation of his or her work, especially in a field where women only represent a minority. Towards this end we asked a sample of subjects, mostly economics majors, to evaluate a paper written by mixed-gender couples, indicating that it was (co-)authored by a female economist, male economist, young female economist or young male economist or giving no information about the author at all. While age factor played no role, female authors appeared to be seen as less competent than males, in that subjects (being incentivized to give their best judgment) less often believed that their papers have been published. This effect did not interact strongly with the gender of the subject. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As the world's largest economy in PPP terms and the second largest in terms of nominal exchange rates, such a slowdown has profound implications. The whole world is asking if the Chinese economy will continue to slow or be trapped in low growth. This paper presents a rather optimistic outlook for the Chinese economy, concluding that a reacceleration to 8% in the medium run is possible under favorable conditions. We argue that the main factors that led to the slowdown since 2010 are external and cyclical. Nevertheless, structural and institutional obstacles to the re-acceleration of growth are also discussed, together with policy suggestions. Journal of Comparative Economics 44(4) (2016) 842-853.

Although this topic has been widely discussed in the literature, this paper provides the most recent overall estimation of the emission mitigation factors from both the production side and the consumption side taking into account China's recent energy and economic transformation. This study adopts China's most recent revised energy and economic data from 2005 to 2013 and analyzes it with a logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model. We find that the primary emission mitigation contributor is the improvement of energy productivity in the industry sectors, which contributes 72% of the total reduction; household contributes 8.3%. The economic transitions in 2013 are still in art early stage, and the expected economic structure effect is moderately on emission reduction. In the future, China needs to improve the energy productivity in production sectors further by both enforcing energy conservation and promoting industry upgrading. Economic restructure will play a more important role in future emission reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using unique longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and exploiting exogenous variation in interview timing throughout 2001, I find that the 9/11 events caused an immediate shift of around 40 percent of one within-standard deviation to more negative attitudes toward immigration and resulted in a considerable decrease in concerns over xenophobic hostility among the German population. The quasi-experiment 9/11 provides evidence on the relevance of non-economic factors in attitude formation and the role of education in moderating the negative terrorism shock. Additional descriptive analysis suggests that the effects have also been persistent in the years after the attacks.","[Schueller, Simone] FBK IRVAPP, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany; [Schueller, Simone] Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, IZA, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany",Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Munich,"Schüller, S (通讯作者)，FBK IRVAPP, Ifo Inst, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.;Schüller, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Leibniz Inst Econ Res, Ifo Inst, IZA, Poschingerstr 5, D-81679 Munich, Germany.",schueller.s@ifo.de,"Schueller, Simone/ABD-7909-2020","Schueller, Simone/0000-0002-9842-6258",German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"Financial support from the German Research Foundation (DFG) for the project Ethnic Diversity and Labor Market Success in the Priority Program Flexibility in Heterogeneous Labor Markets is gratefully acknowledged.
