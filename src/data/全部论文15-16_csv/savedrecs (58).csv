The resulting representation is as if the decision maker adds to the formulation of the problem one new state, representing the occurrence of some unforeseen event. Each Savage act is extended to the new, endogenous state by assigning this state with the worst consequence the act obtains on all other, primitive states. On the extended decision problem a Subjective Expected Utility rule is applied. The representation thus expresses the common practice of a 'worst-case scenario' assumption as means to cope with unforeseen contingencies.

Given a non-atomic game, its perturbed game is one in which every player believes that he alone has a small, but positive, impact on the societal choice; and a distribution is a strategic equilibrium if it is a limit point of a sequence of Nash equilibrium distributions of games in which each player's belief about his impact on the societal choice goes to zero. After proving the existence of strategic equilibria, we show that all of them must be Nash. We also show that all regular equilibria of smooth non-atomic games are strategic. Moreover, it is displayed that in many economic applications, the set of strategic equilibria coincides with that of Nash equilibria of large finite games. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective We aimed to investigate how overcrowding may affect urgent patients' waiting times (i.e., the robustness of the triage patient priority system) and to evaluate the extra costs due to inappropriate use of EDs. Methods Data referring to 54,254 patients who accessed the ED of a major Italian hospital in 2011 were analyzed to study patient flows and overcrowding. To define an average per-patient cost, according to the severity of his or her health condition, the 2010 profit and loss account of the aforementioned hospital was studied and the time devoted by physicians to each type of patient was estimated by means of a self-reported survey. Results Empirical findings confirm a positive correlation between overcrowding and the time a patient has to wait before receiving treatment. This effect is relevant only for non-urgent patients who are responsible for the overcrowding itself. However, urgent patients' waiting times do not increase in the presence of overcrowding, confirming that the triage priority system is robust against the overcrowding situation. The analysis estimates, using 2010 data, that the actual per patient cost incurred by the hospital when treating white-coded patients is, on average, 36.54 euros; a green code costs 93.17, yellow 170.62, and red 227.62. It emerges that 4 % of all the personnel costs are attributable to white color-code assistance, 67 % to green codes, 23 % to yellow codes, and the remaining 6 % to red codes. Conclusion The implementation of effective policies intended to improve both efficiency and quality in providing emergency health services has to deal with the systemic problem of inappropriate use of EDs. Policy-makers should be aware of the fact that there is a considerable portion of ED demand for assistance that is inappropriate and that oversizing EDs with respect to the true, appropriate, urgent patients' demands, could bring about a further and undesirable rise in inappropriate assistance demands and, therefore, an increase in ED costs that are not consistent with their objectives.","[Cremonesi, Paolo] EO Osped Galliera, Genoa, Italy; [di Bella, Enrico; Montefiori, Marcello; Persico, Luca] Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, I-16126 Genoa, Italy",Ente Ospedaliero Ospedali Galliera; University of Genoa,"Montefiori, M (通讯作者)，Univ Genoa, Dept Econ, Via Vivaldi 5, I-16126 Genoa, Italy.",paolo.cremonesi@galliera.it; edibella@economia.unige.it; montefiori@unige.it; persico@economia.unige.it,"CREMONESI, PAOLO/AAB-5616-2019; Persico, Luca/AAD-5900-2021; Di Bella, Enrico/AAX-7937-2020","Persico, Luca/0000-0002-5436-2627; Di Bella, Enrico/0000-0002-2792-3476; MONTEFIORI, MARCELLO/0000-0002-7288-9641",,,,,18,30,31,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We first transform the raw data via the probability integral transformation according to a symmetrized empirical distribution, and show that under the null hypothesis of symmetry, the transformed data has a limiting uniform distribution, reducing testing for symmetry to testing for uniformity. Employing Neyman's smooth test of uniformity, we show that only odd-ordered orthogonal moments of the transformed data are required in constructing the test statistic. We present a standardized smooth test that is distribution-free asymptotically and derive the asymptotic behavior of the test and establish its consistency. Extension to dependent data case is discussed. We investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed tests on both homogeneous and mixed distributions (with unobserved heterogeneity). An empirical application on testing symmetry of wage adjustment process, based on heterogeneous wage contracts with different durations, is provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To complete a cost analysis based on a medical effectiveness randomized trial comparing an ERCP-first approach with an MRCP-first approach in patients with suspected bile duct obstruction. Methods: The management strategies were based on a medical effectiveness trial of 257 patients over a 12-month follow-up period. Direct and indirect costs were included, adopting a societal perspective. the cost values are expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars. Results: Total per-patient direct costs were Can$3547 for ERCP-first patients and Can$4013 for MRCP first patients. Corresponding indirect costs were Can$732 and Can$694, respectively. Causes for differences in direct costs included a more frequent second procedure and a greater mean number of hospital days over the year in patients of the MRCP-first group. In contrast, it is the ERCP-first patients whose indirect costs were greater, principally due to more time away from activities of daily living. Choosing an ERCP-first strategy rather than an MRCP first strategy saved on average Can$428 per patient over the 12-month follow-up duration; however, there existed a large amount of overlap when varying total cost estimates across a sensitivity analysis range based on observed resources utilization. Conclusions: This cost analysis suggests only a small difference in total costs, favoring the ERCP-first group, and is principally attributable to procedures and hospitalizations with little impact from indirect cost measurements.","[Adam, Viviane; Bhat, Mamatha; Martel, Myriam; Valois, Eric; Barkun, Alan N.] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Gastroenterol, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada; [da Silveira, Eduardo] San Jose Gastroenterol, San Jose, CA USA; [Reinhold, Caroline] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Diagnost Radiol, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Barkun, Jeffrey S.] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Surg, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Barkun, Alan N.] McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Epidemiol Biostat & Occupat Hlth, Montreal, PQ, Canada",McGill University; McGill University; McGill University; McGill University,"Barkun, AN (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Ctr Hlth, Div Gastroenterol, Montreal Gen Hosp Site,1650 Cedar Ave,Room D7-346, Montreal, PQ H3G 1A4, Canada.",alan.barkun@muhc.mcgill.ca,"Martel, Myriam/ABB-3862-2020; , Myriam Martel/HKN-3858-2023; Barkun, Alan N/JDV-6782-2023; Bhat, Mamatha/AAC-4333-2020","Barkun, Alan N/0000-0002-1798-5526; Bhat, Mamatha/0000-0003-1960-8449",Medical Research Council of Canada [57563CT199903MCT]; American College of Gastroenterology; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec - Association des Radiologues du Quebec Award; American Digestive Health Foundation/American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Endoscopic Research Award,Medical Research Council of Canada(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); American College of Gastroenterology; Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec - Association des Radiologues du Quebec Award(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)); American Digestive Health Foundation/American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Endoscopic Research Award,"Funding sources for this publication included the Medical Research Council of Canada (grant no. 57563CT199903MCT), the American College of Gastroenterology Clinical Research Award, the Fonds de la Recherche en Sante du Quebec - Association des Radiologues du Quebec Award, and the American Digestive Health Foundation/American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Endoscopic Research Award.",,30,8,8,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,767,773,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.04.009,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409603.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800005,0

The linear model is a simplifying hypothesis that derives from the power transform model in three different ways, each producing its own identification problem. We call this modeling difficulty the trifold identification problem and show that it may be overcome using a test based on the quasi-likelihood ratio (QLR) statistic. More specifically, the QLR statistic may be approximated under each identification problem and the separate null approximations may be combined to produce a composite approximation that embodies the linear model hypothesis. The limit theory for the QLR test statistic depends on a Gaussian stochastic process. In the important special case of a linear time trend regressor and martingale difference errors asymptotic critical values of the test are provided. Test power is analyzed and an empirical application to crop-yield distributions is provided.

In France, most elderly people with dementia live in the community and receive informal care, which has not been well characterized. Methods: Using a sample of 4680 people aged 75 years and older collected in 2008 through a national comprehensive survey on health and disability, we compared the economic value of the care received by 513 elderly people with dementia to that received by a propensity score- matched set of older people without dementia. Results: More than 85% of elderly people with dementia receive informal care; the estimation of its economic value ranges from (sic)4.9 billion (proxy good method) to (sic)6.7 billion (opportunity cost method) per year Conclusions: The informal care provided to people with dementia has substantial annual costs; further work should be done to examine the social and economic roles foregone as a result of this care.","[Paraponaris, Alain; Davin, Berengere] INSERM, UMR912, SESSTIM, F-13006 Marseille, France; [Paraponaris, Alain] Aix Marseille Univ, UMR S912, IRD, Marseille, France; [Paraponaris, Alain; Davin, Berengere] ORS PACA, South Eastern Health Observ, Marseille, France; [Paraponaris, Alain] AMSE, Marseille, France",Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); Aix-Marseille Universite; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Aix-Marseille Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite,"Paraponaris, A (通讯作者)，INSERM, U912, 23 Rue StanislasTorrents, F-13006 Marseille, France.",alain.paraponaris@inserm.fr,,"Paraponaris, Alain/0000-0001-8281-8305",,,,,74,13,13,1,18,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,368,375,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.002,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091590.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600003,0

Correlated shocks across health care goods and over time interact with complementarity and substitutability to affect optimal cost sharing. Health care goods that are substitutes or have positively correlated demand shocks should have lower optimal patient cost sharing. Positive serial correlations of demand shocks and uncompensated losses that are positively correlated with covered health services also reduce optimal cost sharing. Our results rationalize covering pharmaceuticals and outpatient spending more fully than is implied by static, one good, or one period models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Working with concentrated estimating equation simplifies greatly the high-order expansions for bias and variance; a simple bootstrap procedure overcomes a major difficulty in analytically evaluating expectations of various quantities in the expansions. The method is then studied in detail using a more general SAR model, with its effectiveness in correcting bias and improving inference fully demonstrated by extensive Monte Carlo experiments. Compared with the analytical approach, the proposed approach is much simpler and has a much wider applicability. The validity of the bootstrap procedure is formally established. The proposed method is then extended to the case of more than one nonlinear estimator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper evaluates the impact of smoking bans on active smoking using data from the British Household Panel Survey and exploiting the policy experiment provided by the differential timing of the introduction of the bans in Scotland and England. We assess the short-term impact of the smoking bans by employing a series of flexible difference-in-differences fixed effects panel data models. We find that the introduction of the public smoking bans in England and Scotland had limited short-run effects on both smoking prevalence and the total level of smoking. Although we identify significant differences in trends in smoking consumption across the survey period by population sub-groups, we find insufficient evidence to conclude that these were affected by the introduction of the smoking bans. These results challenge those found in the public health literature but are in line with the most recent strand of economic literature indicating that there is no firm evidence on the effects of smoking bans on smoking.

This study aggregately investigates the lenders' herd behavior when making platform selection decisions in China P2P lending markets. We first examine whether lenders herd when selecting P2P lending platform at a general level by adopting an empirical panel analysis and find that lenders tend to invest in P2P lending platforms that have already enjoyed large amount of lenders, but with a diminishing effect. By adopting quantile regression model, we highlight the importance of allowing parameter estimates to vary across the distribution of different herding level to capture the extent to which lenders herd. The results demonstrate that the influence of objective lending characteristic such as interest rate, average borrow amount and the average duration varies with the quantile of herding level both in the significance and the magnitude. Low and moderate level of herding could be rational, while there is not sufficient evidence of rational herding for the herding level increase. Moreover, to further explore the rationality of herding, we introduce search index into our model to rule out the possibility that the herding is caused by lenders' online information searching and find a smaller but significant herding effect.","[Jiang Yang; Yan Xiang-bin] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Tan Yong] Univ Washington, Michael G Foster Sch Business, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",Harbin Institute of Technology; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Jiang, Y (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,"Jiang, Yang/O-6259-2019; Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019",,,,,,38,1,1,0,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,52,61,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600008,0

We find little evidence of differential willingness to pay for quality by race among first-time nursing home entrants, but do find significant distance and race-based preference effects. Simulation exercises suggest that both effects contribute importantly to racial disparities in nursing home quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A policy change standardized cost-sharing parameters of plans across insurers and altered information presentation. Post-change, consumers chose more generous plans and different brands, but were not more price-sensitive. We use a discrete choice model that allows the policy to affect how attributes are valued to decompose the policy's effects into a valuation effect and a product availability effect. The brand shifts are largely explained by the availability effect and the generosity shift by the valuation effect. A hypothetical choice experiment replicates our results and explores alternative counterfactuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Ericson, Keith M.

We show that a rate of return is underdetermined by the project's cash-flow stream; in particular, a unique return function (not a unique rate of return) exists for every project which maps depreciation classes into rates of return. The various shapes a rate of return can take on (internal rate of return, average accounting rate of return, modified internal rate of return, etc.) derive from the (implicit or explicit) selection of different depreciation patterns. To single out the appropriate rate of return for a project, auxiliary assumptions are needed regarding the project's capital depreciation. This involves value judgment. On one side, this finding opens terrain for a capital valuation theory yet to be developed; on the other side, it triggers the creation of a toolkit of domain-specific and purpose-specific metrics that can be used, jointly or in isolation, for analyzing the economic profitability of a given project. We also show that the AIRR perspective has a high explanatory power that enables connecting seemingly unrelated notions and linking various disciplines such as economics, finance, and accounting. Some guidelines for practitioners are also provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For each economy, the serial assignment, the assignment selected by the (probabilistic) serial rule, is sd-efficient and sd-envy-free (sd stands for stochastic dominance) but in general, it is not the only such assignment. Our question is when the uniqueness also holds. First, we provide a necessary condition for uniqueness, termed top objects divisibility. Exploiting the structure revealed by top-objects divisibility, we then provide two sufficient conditions: preference richness and recursive decomposability. Existing sufficient conditions are restrictive in that they are satisfied only if there are sufficiently many agents relative to the number of objects; and that they only focus on preferences, ignoring other aspects of the problem that are also relevant to uniqueness. Our conditions overcome these limitations and can explain uniqueness for a wide range of economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

As the term suggests, transaction or quote data are averaged over short time periods ranging from 30 s to five min, and the resulting averages approximate the efficient price process much better than the raw data. Apart from reducing the size of the microstructure, the methodology also helps synchronise data from different securities. The procedure is robust to short term dependence in the noise. Since averages can be subject to outliers, and since they can pulverise jumps; we have developed a broader theory which also applies to cases where M-estimation is used to pin down the efficient price in local neighbourhoods. M-estimation serves the same function as averaging, but we shall see that it is safer. Good choices of M-estimating function greatly enhance the identification of jumps. The methodology applies off-the-shelf to any high frequency econometric problem. In this paper, we develop a general theory for pre-averaging and M-estimation based inference. We show that, up to a contiguity adjustment, the estimated process behaves as if one sampled from a semimartingale (with unchanged volatility) plus an independent error. Estimating the efficient price is a form of pre-processing of the data, and hence the methods in this paper also serve the purpose of data cleaning. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Scant data are available, however, about its costs. Objective To estimate total costs of plasma from production through administration, from the perspective of a US hospital blood donor center (BDC). Study Design and Methods Six sequential decision analytic models were constructed and informed by primary and secondary data on time, tasks, personnel, and supplies for donation, processing, and administration. Expected values of the models were summed to yield the BDC's total cost of producing, preparing, and transfusing plasma. Costs ($US 2015) are reported for a typical patient using three units of plasma. Models assume plasma was obtained from whole blood donation and transfused in an inpatient setting. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to test the impact of changing inputs for personnel costs and adverse event (AE) rates and costs. Results BDC production cost of plasma was $91.24/patient ($30.41/unit), a $30.16/patient savings versus purchased plasma. Administration and monitoring costs totaled $194.64/patient. Sensitivity analyses indicated that modifying BDC personnel costs during donation and processing has little impact on total plasma costs. However, the probability and cost of transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) have a significant impact on costs. Conclusion Plasma produced by our BDC may be less costly than purchased plasma. Though plasma processes have multiple tasks involving staff time, these are not the largest cost driver. Major plasma-related AEs are uncommon, but are the biggest driver of total plasma costs.","[Prioli, Katherine M.; Pizzi, Laura T.] Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Suite 901, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA; [Karp, Julie Katz; Galanis, Taki; Herman, Jay H.] Thomas Jefferson Univ Hosp, 111 South 11th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA",Jefferson University; Jefferson University,"Prioli, KM (通讯作者)，Thomas Jefferson Univ, 901 Walnut St,Suite 901, Philadelphia, PA 19107 USA.",katherine.prioli@jefferson.edu,,"Karp, Julie/0000-0002-5970-4585; Prioli, Katherine/0000-0003-3987-1738",,,,,18,1,1,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This paper studies a more flexible model, i.e. a class of copula structured M4 (multivariate maxima and moving maxima) processes, and hence CSM4 for short. CSM4 processes are constructed by incorporating sparse random coefficients and structured extreme value copulas in asymptotically (in)dependent M4 (AIM4) processes. It is shown that the new model overcomes all of the aforementioned three constraints. The paper illustrates new features and advantages of the CSM4 model using simulated examples and real data of intra-daily maxima of high-frequency financial time series. The paper also studies probabilistic properties of the proposed model, and its statistical inference. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use a French panel data set of 43,111 individuals observed from 2010 to 2012. At the beginning of the period, none of them were covered for balance billing; by the end, 3819 had switched to supplementary insurance contracts that cover balance billing. Using instrumental variables to deal with possible non-exogeneity of the decision to switch, we find evidence that better coverage increases demand for specialists who charge high fees, thereby contributing to the rise in medical prices. People whose coverage improves increased their average amount of balance billing per consultation by 32%. However, the impact of the coverage shock depends on the supply of physicians. For people residing in areas where few specialists charge the regulated fee, better coverage increases not only prices but also the number of consultations, a finding that suggests that balance billing might limit access to care. Conversely, in areas where patients have a genuine choice between specialists who balance bill and those who do not, we find no evidence of a response to better coverage.

Applied to daily stock market and bond market data, we identify a number of different covariance breakdowns which leads to a significant improvement in the marginal likelihood and gains in portfolio choice.

Whether this is attributable to changing financial leverage is still subject to dispute but the terminology is in wide use. There are many tests of the leverage hypothesis using discrete time data. These typically involve fitting of a general parametric or semiparametric model to conditional volatility and then testing the implied restrictions on parameters or curves. We propose an alternative way of testing this hypothesis using realized volatility as an alternative direct nonparametric measure. Our null hypothesis is of conditional distributional dominance and so is much stronger than the usual hypotheses considered previously. We implement our test on individual stocks and a stock index using intraday data over a long span. We find only very weak evidence against our hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: One thousand adults with one or more qualifying changes in statin therapy and one or more previous diagnoses of hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, or mixed dyslipidemia were identified from the Henry Ford Health System administrative database. Data regarding statin utilization, comorbidities, and adverse effects were extracted from the administrative database and corresponding EMR. Patients were stratified by cardiovascular (CV) risk. SI was classified as absolute intolerance or titration intolerance on the basis of changes in statin utilization and/or the occurrence of adverse effects and laboratory testing for creatine kinase. Measures of concordance (Cohen's kappa [kappa]) and accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value) were calculated for the administrative database algorithms. Results: Half of the sample population was white, 52.9% were women, mean age was 60.6 years, and 35.7% were at high CV risk. SI was identified in 11.5% and 14.0%, absolute intolerance in 2.2% and 3.1%, and titration intolerance in 9.7% and 11.8% of the patients in the EMR and the administrative database, respectively. The algorithm identifying any SI had substantial concordance (kappa = 0.66) and good sensitivity (78.1%), but modest PPV (64.0%). The titration intolerance algorithm performed better (kappa = 0.74; sensitivity 85.4%; PPV 70.1%) than the absolute intolerance algorithm (kappa = 0.40; sensitivity 50%; PPV 35.5%) and performed best in the high CV-risk group (n = 353), with robust concordance (kappa = 0.73) and good sensitivity (80.9%) and PPV (75.3%). Conclusions: Conservative but comprehensive algorithms are available to identify SI in administrative databases for application in real-world research. These are the first validated algorithms for use in administrative databases available to decision makers.","[Schulman, Kathy L.] Outcomes Res Solut Inc, 303 Wyman St,Suite 300, Waltham, MA 02451 USA; [Lamerato, Lois E.] Henry Ford Hlth Syst, Detroit, MI USA; [Dalal, Mehul R.; Sung, Jennifer; Jhaveri, Mehul; Koren, Andrew; Mallya, Usha G.] Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ USA; [Foody, JoAnne M.] Harvard Med Sch, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Boston, MA USA",Henry Ford Health System; Henry Ford Hospital; Sanofi-Aventis; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Schulman, KL (通讯作者)，Outcomes Res Solut Inc, 303 Wyman St,Suite 300, Waltham, MA 02451 USA.",kathy.schulman@orsolutionsinc.com,,,"Sanofi US; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY; Bridgewater, NJ","Sanofi US; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY; Bridgewater, NJ","This study was funded by Sanofi US, Bridgewater, NJ, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY.",,34,13,13,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,852,860,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1858,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712714.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500023,0

We show that a planning economy welfare-dominates a competitive economy and time-consistent government policy is welfare-improving if the agents are sufficiently patient. The government policy consists of a tax on physical capital income and a subsidy on human capital accumulation. Our results differ from those of existing one-sector models with quasi-geometric discounting in which a competitive economy always outperforms a planning economy and the government's time consistent tax policies reduce equilibrium welfare.

Multiple conditioning methods can be used for CER to adjust for group differences, including difference-in-differences (DiD) estimation. Objective This study presents DiD and demonstrates how to apply this conditioning method to estimate treatment outcomes in the CER setting by utilizing the MarketScan (R) Databases for multiple sclerosis (MS) patients receiving different therapies. Methods The sample included 6762 patients, with 363 in the Test Cohort [glatiramer acetate (GA) switched to fingolimod (FTY)] and 6399 in the Control Cohort (GA only, no switch) from a US administrative claims database. A trend analysis was conducted to rule out concerns regarding regression to the mean and to compare relapse rates among treatment cohorts. DiD analysis was used to enable comparisons among the Test and Control Cohorts. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of relapse after switching from GA to FTY, and to compare group differences in the pre- and post-index periods. Results Crude DiD analysis showed that in the pre-index period more patients in the Test Cohort experienced an MS relapse and had a higher mean number of relapses than in the Control Cohort. During the pre-index period, numeric and relative data for MS relapses in patients in the Test Cohort were significantly higher than in the Control Cohort, while no significant between-group differences emerged during the post-index period. Generalized linear modeling with DiD regression estimation showed that the mean number of MS relapses decreased significantly in the post-index period among patients in the Test Cohort compared with patients in the Control Cohort. Conclusion In this study, an MS population was utilized to demonstrate how DiD can be applied to estimate treatment effects in a heterogeneous population, where the Test and Control Cohorts varied greatly. The results show that DiD offers a robust method for comparing diverse cohorts when other risk-adjustment methods may not be adequate.","[Zhou, Huanxue] KMK Consulting Inc, 7 North Tower,23 Headquarters Plaza, Morristown, NJ 07960 USA; [Taber, Christopher] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, 1180 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Arcona, Steve; Li, Yunfeng] Novartis Pharmaceut, Outcomes Res Methods & Analyt, US Hlth Econ & Outcome Res, One Hlth Plaza 135-584, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; Novartis,"Li, YF (通讯作者)，Novartis Pharmaceut, Outcomes Res Methods & Analyt, US Hlth Econ & Outcome Res, One Hlth Plaza 135-584, E Hanover, NJ 07936 USA.",frank.li@novartis.com,,,,,,,30,72,78,0,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Interventions assist beneficiaries and their health care providers to appropriately manage chronic health condition(s) according to established clinical guidelines. Cost containment has been a key justification for the creation of these programs despite mixed evidence they actually save money. This study evaluates the effects of a disease management program in Georgia by exploiting a natural experiment that delayed the introduction of high-intensity services for several thousand beneficiaries. Expenditures for medical claims decreased an average of $89 per person per month for the high-and moderate-risk groups, but those savings were not large enough to offset the total costs of the program. Impacts varied by the intensity of interventions, over time, and across disease groups. Heterogeneous treatment effect analysis indicates that decreases in medical expenditures were largest at the most expensive tail of the distribution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, if a greater social activity of an individual enhances oblique (i.e. to non-relatives) transmission of her cultural traits at the expense of vertical (i.e. to children) transmission as well as family size, which behavior is optimal from cultural evolution standpoint? I formalize a general model that characterizes evolutionarily stable social activity. The proposed model replicates the theory of Newson et al. (2007) that fertility decline is caused by increasing role of oblique cultural transmission. Second, if social activity is a rational choice rather than a culturally inherited trait, and if cultural transmission acts on preferences rather than behaviors, which preferences survive the process of cultural evolution? I arrive at a very simple yet powerful result: under mild assumptions on model structure, only preferences which emphasize exclusively the concern for social prestige, i.e. extent to which one's cultural trait has been picked up by others, survive.

Despite differentiation efforts consumers did not obtain satisfaction. Customer interaction provides another way to generate innovation from its involvement in the production process (co-creation of value). The research was held in an awarded winery located in Bento Gonc, alves (Brazil) with the objective of understanding how the process of value co-creation between Brazilian award-winning wineries and consumers influences innovation generation. It is an exploratory and qualitative study collected through in-depth interviews with a semi-structured script. The winery identifies beneficial effects in the production process resulting from interactions because it narrows the bond with the consumer creating a better understanding of the consumers as well as develop a more tailored offer regarding value.

The staggered timing of Medicaid's adoption across the states created meaningful variation in cumulative exposure to Medicaid for birth cohorts that are now in adulthood. Analyses of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics suggest exposure to Medicaid in early childhood (age 0-5) is associated with statistically significant and meaningful improvements in adult health (age 25-54), and this effect is only seen in subgroups targeted by the program. Results for economic outcomes are imprecise and we are unable to come to definitive conclusions. Using separate data we find evidence of two mechanisms that could plausibly link Medicaid's introduction to long-term outcomes: contemporaneous increases in health services utilization for children and reductions in family medical debt.

Recently there was great expansion of genomics resources about grapevine genome, thus providing increasing efforts for molecular breeding. Current cultivars display a great level of inter-specific differentiation that needs to be investigated to reach a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic differences, and to find responsible genes selected by cross breeding programs. While there have been significant advances in resolving the pattern and nature of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on plant genomes, few data are available on copy number variation (CNV). Furthermore association between structural variations and phenotypes has been described in only a few cases. We combined high throughput biotechnologies and bioinformatics tools, to reveal the first inter-varietal atlas of structural variation (SV) for the grapevine genome. We sequenced and compared four table grape cultivars with the Pinot noir inbred line PN40024 genome as the reference. We detected roughly 8% of the grapevine genome affected by genomic variations.

The wine consumer appreciates attributes such as tradition, quality and distinctiveness, characteristics that are associated with the terroir. In this segment, trademarks and geographical indications (GI) are relevant distinctive signs for the consumers' choice. Issues involving the protection of these signs have become increasingly stronger in the same proportion of the trade growth. Wine GIs hold a long tradition in the international scenario, particularly the European. In Brazil, the trademarks have a broader protection history, and the GIs were only acknowledged with the 1996 Industrial Property Law. Nevertheless, Brazil stands out as an emergent market for wines. The databank of the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI-Brazil) shows that 30% of all applications for GI protection are for wines and spirits. Such figures indicate the growing importance of the GI for the segment. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the applications for trademarks and GIs for wines and spirits, based on the INPI databank. For such, some foreign GIs have been chosen, for their historic and commercial importance, as well as one national GI, the first acknowledged in the segment. Among the results, several applications for trademarks from different applicants containing the searched terms have been found. From these results, it is believed that the coexistence and overlap of trademarks and GIs indicate the need for a review of the national legislation.","[da Silva Barhosa, Patricia Maria] Inst Nacl Propriedade Ind, Diretoria Marcas, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Dupim, Luiz Claudio] Inst Nacl Propriedade Ind, Diretoria Contratos GI & Registros, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Bruch, Kelly Lisandra] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Ctr Estudos & Pesquisas Agronegacios, Fac Direito, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Peralta, Patricia Pereira] Inst Nacl Propriedade Ind, Acad Propriedade Intelectual Inovacao & Desenvolv, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI); Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI); Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial (INPI),"Barhosa, PMD (通讯作者)，Inst Nacl Propriedade Ind, Diretoria Marcas, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,9,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3002.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703002,0.0,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700080,0

Even though the technological requirements from these systems are different, in both cases, the Zoning or Variability Map for the Terroir (MVT) is required. MVT is a detailed mapping of the plot and enables to know the delineation and characterization of several sectors which make up its variability. The VP manages independently and optimized each of these sectors, allowing, among other things, optimizing the plantation's layout, rootstocks' selection, tillage, cover crop management, fertilization and maintenance programs, adjustment of water needs, diagnosis and pests and diseases management, monitoring of ripening, the harvest timing, etc. and all so in a localized manner according to the characteristics of each sector. Direct Method (MD) is the natural way to get the MVT. The map made from Direct Method defines and characterizes the different sectors indeed, and also provides some information about the terroir characteristics, which allow diagnosing the causes of heterogeneity and thus, handle them properly. Maps obtained by remote sensing from Spectral High Resolution Imaging (IEAR) provide relevant information, they are very affordable, and with an easy accuracy limits and they are obtained quicker than those made from MD. However, this kind of maps split the areas whose differentiation is due to the plant response in a specific situation that may be caused by a nearly endless options, and therefore, they vary with them. These maps are unable to discriminate sectors by the properties according to environmental factors (climate, lithology, geomorphology, soil) that affect the terroir variability, forbidding any direct action on them. Doing a MVT performed through a MD is expensive on large scales (very detailed studies) due to the gap about adequate perform delineations (net fixed error is related to sides length). However, IEAR technology provides a map which is obtained allowing to buffer this problem and also, reducing the costs. Both in maps obtained from MD or IEAR, the sampling quality is a key point. Both density of observations and the number of properties involved in the study determine its utility and the relative directives, when is possible under an international procedure (such as, OIV), must be a quality guarantee. In fact, both methodologies (MD and IEAR) are complementary for doing the MVT and, once the map (done through MD) is available, the right interpretations of the IEAR maps are possible, whether annual, seasonal, depending on the phenological status or any other circumstance that may affect the variability (pests, stress,...). MVT obtained like that, allows to the viticulturist address the most ambitious goal: the product optimization and homogenization. Specifically, in a short or medium term and by the management carried out with the VP's performance on the terroir's properties in different sectors of the parcel/plot, resulting in the highest uniformity as possible, and also, in the product. In this work, we worked on terroir's variability and the vineyard management systems (MC and VP), highlighting the relevance of mapping, the need for MVT and its complementary performance related to the MD, and the use of remote sensing systems (IEAR) as another discriminative method.","[Gomez-Miguel, Vicente D.; Sotes, Vicente; Martinez, Alvaro] UPM, Dept Prod Agr, Madrid, Spain; [Gonzalez-SanJose, Maria L.] Univ Burgos UBU, Dept Biotechnol & Food, Sci, Madrid 28040, Spain; C Puerta Elierro 2, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Politecnica de Madrid; Universidad de Burgos,"Gómez-Miguel, VD (通讯作者)，UPM, Dept Prod Agr, Madrid, Spain.",Vicente.gomez@upm.es,"González-SanJosé, Mª Luisa M.L./B-3841-2013","González-SanJosé, Mª Luisa M.L./0000-0003-2973-7287",,,,,31,1,1,0,11,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1025.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701025,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700025,0

Methods: Patients participating in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial were administered a health -related quality-of life questionnaire, the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), on four occasions over a 5-year period. We used two-way fixed-effects longitudinal regression models to investigate the impact of incident diabetes complications (stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, renal failure, blindness, and amputation) on EQ-5D-3L utility score (where 1 = perfect health), while controlling for characteristics of individuals that do not vary over time. Results: The effect of having any one of the seven complications was to reduce the EQ-5D-3L utility score by 0.054 (95% confidence interval 0.044-0.064), and this was not significantly affected by baseline age, sex, economic region, or the value set used to derive utilities. The complication with the largest disutility was amputation (0.122), followed by stroke (0.099), blindness (0.083), renal failure (0.049), heart failure (0.045), and myocardial infarction (0.026). Ischemic heart disease did not significantly reduce the utility score. Quality of life also declined with elapsed time by an average of 0.006 per year, in addition to the effect of complications. Conclusions: Common complications significantly reduce health -related quality of life. Utility scores derived from the EQ-5D-3L provide a potential measure that can be used to summarize patient-reported outcomes and inform health economic models. Prevention of complications is critical to reduce the progressive burden of declining quality of life for people with diabetes.

With the increased demand appear the necessity to check the sparkling wine authenticity, because the practice of adding CO2 in sparkling wine is not allow. A way to control the carbonation process is through the determination of CO2 delta C-13, because the sugar added during the second fermentation define the CO2 isotopic value, according to elaboration process. For this reason, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between values of d13C from still wines and sparkling wines, in order to set up limit values to exogenous carbonation control. Thirty-eight still wines elaborated by microvinification and 59 samples of commercial sparkling wines were analyzed, using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). The most negative value of natural d13C from still wine found was -24.7%(0), it can be to estimate that lowest values are an indicative of industrial CO2 addition. Among the commercial sparkling wine from South America evaluated in this study, 10% from the samples showed signs of carbonation. Through this research was possible to establish limits of isotopic values to determine the presence of exogenous CO2.","[Leonardelli, Susiane; Dutra, Sandra V.; Carnieli, Gilberto J.; Spinelli, Fernanda; Ferreira, Daniel de Siqueira; Vanderlinde, Regina] Inst Brasileiro Vinho IBRAVIN, Alameda Fenavinho 481,Ed 29, BR-95700000 Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil; [Spinelli, Fernanda] Lab Referencia Enol Evanir da Silva LAREN, Ave Vindima 1855, BR-95084470 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil; [Vanderlinde, Regina] UCS, Inst Biotecnol, Rua Francisco Getulio Vargas 1130, BR-95070560 Caxias Do Sul, RS, Brazil",Universidade de Caxias do Sul,"Leonardelli, S (通讯作者)，Inst Brasileiro Vinho IBRAVIN, Alameda Fenavinho 481,Ed 29, BR-95700000 Bento Goncalves, RS, Brazil.",,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2001.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702001,0.0,,,4,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700045,0

Such programs have the potential to affect drinking through a combination of channels - such as raising students' disposable income and increasing the incentive to maintain a high GPA - that could theoretically raise or lower alcohol use. We find that the presence of a merit-aid program in one's state generally leads to an overall increase in (heavy) drinking. This effect is concentrated among men, students with lower parental education, older students, and students with high college GPA's. Our findings are robust to several alternative empirical specifications including event-study analyses by year of program adoption.

Our models nest Gaussian, Student's t, grouped Student's t, and generalized hyperbolic copulas with time-varying correlations matrices, as special cases. We introduce time-variation into the densities by writing them as factor models with stochastic loadings. The proposed copula models have flexible dynamics and heavy tails yet remain tractable in high dimensions due to their factor structure. Our Bayesian estimation approach leverages a recent advance in sequential Monte Carlo methods known as particle Gibbs sampling which can draw large blocks of latent variables efficiently and in parallel. We use this framework to model an unbalanced, 200-dimensional panel consisting of credit default swaps and equities for 100 US corporations. Our analysis shows that the grouped Student's t stochastic copula is preferred over seven competing models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of Medicaid adult dental coverage on the use of dental services and oral health,JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,CARE; INSURANCE; OUTCOMES; ACCESS; CHILDREN; IMPACT,"This article examines the effect of Medicaid adult dental coverage on use of dental care and dental health outcomes using state-level variation in dental coverage during 2000-2012. Our findings imply that dental coverage is associated with an increase in the likelihood of a recent dental visit, with the size of the effect increasing with Medicaid payment rates to dentists, and a reduction in the likelihood of untreated dental caries. We are among the first to detect an effect of Medicaid coverage on a clinical health outcome other than mortality. These findings may have implications for states expanding Medicaid coverage to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty threshold under the Affordable Care Act as most of these states offer an adult dental benefit.

Through a series of Monte Carlo simulations, this paper illustrates that reliance solely on the summary score may lead to biased estimates of incremental effects, and I propose a novel two-stage approach that allows for unbiased estimation of incremental effects. The proposed methodology essentially reverses the order of the analysis, from one of aggregate, then estimate' to one of estimate, then aggregate'. Compared to relying solely on the summary score, the approach also offers a more patient-centered interpretation of results by estimating regression coefficients and incremental effects in each of the HRQoL domains, while still providing estimated effects in terms of the overall summary score. I provide an application to the estimation of incremental effects of demographic and clinical variables on HRQoL following surgical treatment for adult scoliosis and spinal deformity.

Objective: To describe the use of a deliberative forum to explore community perspectives on a complex health problem disinvestment. Methods: A deliberative forum of citizens was convened in Adelaide, South Australia, to develop criteria to support disinvestment from public funding of ineffective pathology tests. The case study of potential disinvestment from vitamin B-12/folate pathology testing was used to shape the debate. The forum was informed by a systematic review of B-12/folate pathology test effectiveness and expert testimony. Results: The citizens identified seven criteria: cost of the test, potential impact on individual health/capacity to benefit, potential cost to society, public good, alternatives to testing, severity of the condition, and accuracy of the test. The participants not only saw these criteria as an interdependent network but also questioned the authority of policymakers to make these decisions. Conclusions: Coherence between the criteria devised by the forum and those described by an expert group was considerable, the major differences being that the citizens did not consider equity issues and the experts neglected the cost of social and emotional impact of disinvestment on users and the society.","[Street, Jackie M.; Callaghan, Peta; Braunack-Mayer, Annette J.; Hiller, Janet E.] Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, DX650 550,Level 7,178 North Tce, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia; [Hiller, Janet E.] Swinburne Univ Technol, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia",University of Adelaide; Swinburne University of Technology,"Street, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Adelaide, Sch Publ Hlth, DX650 550,Level 7,178 North Tce, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.",jackie.street@adelaide.edu.au,"Hiller, Janet E./A-5633-2008; Braunack-Mayer, Annette/AAE-7796-2019; Street, Jackie/A-2016-2011","Braunack-Mayer, Annette/0000-0003-4427-0224; Street, Jackie/0000-0002-1033-4341; Hiller, Janet/0000-0002-8532-4033",Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) [565327]; NHMRC [565501]; Australian National Preventive Health Agency [20STR2013F],Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Australian National Preventive Health Agency,"This study was conducted as part of the Assessing Services and Technology Use To Enhance Health study, a multidisciplinary research project funded by Australia's National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC, grant no. 565327).

Systematically assembled evidence demonstrating its clinical and cost effectiveness would be helpful for its adoption by decision makers. Objective To summarise the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted laparoscopic (RAL) surgery compared with relevant alternatives. Methods and results of identified studies were assessed to identify the deficiencies in evidence and areas for further research. Methods Studies reporting both costs and outcomes for comparisons of RAL with laparoscopy and/or open surgery were systematically identified. Searches were conducted in February 2015 on MEDLINE, EMBASE and NHS EED. Quality of the included studies was assessed against a standard checklist for economic analyses. Length of hospital stay and operating time (determinants of cost), cost of intervention, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were extracted. To aid comparison, costs were converted into a common currency and price year (2014 US dollars). Results Forty-seven eligible studies were identified (full economic evaluation n = 6 and cost analysis n = 41). Economic models were used in 11 (23 %) studies. Only three studies used a model considered representative of the disease and clinical pathway with a time-horizon allowing capture of relevant differences in outcomes across strategies. The cost of RAL varied substantially between uses, ranging from US$7011 for hysterectomy to over US$30,000 for radical cystectomy. The majority of estimates were between US$15,000 and US$25,000 per person. In part this difference is explained by the difference between studies in which costs were included. It was also identified to have higher costs than the alternatives it was compared against. Incremental cost per QALY for RAL radical prostatectomy was US$28,801-$31,763 over a 10-year period assuming 200 cases per annum. Conclusion The clinical evidence available for RAL overall and used within included studies is limited. RAL surgery costs were consistently higher than open and laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, in adopting the robotic technology decision makers need to take into account the cost effectiveness within their own systems. Economic models generated and published for radical prostatectomy and hysterectomy may be adapted to other health systems if the care pathway is similar to provide locally relevant data.","[Tandogdu, Zafer] Newcastle Univ, Northern Inst Canc Res, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tandogdu, Zafer; Vale, Luke] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Hlth Econ Grp, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England; [Fraser, Cynthia; Ramsay, Craig] Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Serv Res Unit, 3rd Floor,Hlth Sci Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland",Newcastle University - UK; Newcastle University - UK; University of Aberdeen,"Ramsay, C (通讯作者)，Univ Aberdeen, Hlth Serv Res Unit, 3rd Floor,Hlth Sci Bldg,Foresterhill, Aberdeen AB25 2ZD, Scotland.",c.r.ramsay@abdn.ac.uk,"Ramsay, Craig/AAD-8249-2021","Ramsay, Craig/0000-0003-4043-7349; Vale, Luke/0000-0001-8574-8429; tandogdu, zafer/0000-0002-5309-3656","European Association of Urology scholarship (EUSP clinical fellowship) at Newcastle University; Medical School, Northern Institute for Cancer Research (NICR), Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; Chief Scientist Office [HSRU1] Funding Source: researchfish","European Association of Urology scholarship (EUSP clinical fellowship) at Newcastle University; Medical School, Northern Institute for Cancer Research (NICR), Newcastle upon Tyne, UK; Chief Scientist Office(Chief Scientist Office - Scotland)","Zafer Tandogdu is with a European Association of Urology scholarship (EUSP clinical fellowship) at Newcastle University, Medical School, Northern Institute for Cancer Research (NICR), Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.",,64,31,31,1,14,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We describe the patterns of non-response and examine if attrition affects the econometric analysis of medical labour market outcomes using the estimation of physician earnings equations as a case study. We compare the econometric gestimates obtained from a number of different modelling strategies, which are as follows: balanced versus unbalanced samples; an attrition model for panel data based on the classic sample selection model; and a recently developed copula-based selection model. Descriptive evidence shows that doctors who work longer hours, have lower years of experience, are overseas trained and have changed their work location are more likely to drop out. Our analysis suggests that the impact of attrition on inference about the earnings of general practitioners is small. For specialists, there appears to be some evidence for an economically significant bias. Finally, we discuss how the top-up samples in the Medicine in Australia: Balancing Employment and Life survey can be used to address the problem of panel attrition.

A central goal of the insurance is to support informal care provided by family members. Care recipients can choose between benefits in kind (formal home care services) and benefits in cash. From a budgetary perspective, family care is often considered a cost-saving alternative to formal home care and to stationary nursing care. However, the opportunity costs resulting from reduced labor supply of the carer are often overlooked. We focus on the labor supply decision of family carers and the incentives set by the long-term care insurance. We estimate a structural model of labor supply and the choice of benefits of family carers. We find that benefits in kind have small positive effects on labor supply. Labor supply elasticities of cash benefits are larger and negative. If both types of benefits increase, negative labor supply effects are offset to a large extent. However, the average effect is significantly negative.

To allow for the dependence between the error terms and regressors in the QR models, we propose a jackknife model averaging (JMA) estimator which selects the weights by minimizing a leave-one-out cross-validation criterion function and demonstrate its asymptotic optimality in terms of minimizing the out-of-sample final prediction error. We conduct simulations to demonstrate the finite-sample performance of our estimator and compare it with other model selection and averaging methods. We apply our JMA method to forecast quantiles of excess stock returns and wages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Often, generic measures such as the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire are used, but this may not appropriately reflect the health-related quality of life of patients with cancer including myelofibrosis. Objective: To derive a condition-specific preference based measure for myelofibrosis using appropriate existing measures, the Myelofibrosis-Symptom Assessment Form and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 30 Questionnaire. Methods: Data from the Controlled Myelofibrosis Study with Oral JAK Inhibitor Treatment trial (n = 309) were used to derive the health state classification system. Psychometric and factor analyses were used to determine the dimensions of the classification system. Psychometric and Rasch analyses were then used to select an item to represent each dimension item selection was validated with experts. A selection of health states was valued by members of the general population using time trade-off. Finally, health state values were modeled using regression analysis to produce utility values for every state. Results: The Myelofibrosis 8 dimensions has eight dimensions: physical functioning, emotional functioning, fatigue, itchiness, pain under ribs on the left side, abdominal discomfort, bone or muscle pain, and night sweats. Regression models were estimated using time trade-off data from 246 members of the general population valuing a total of 33 states. The best performing model was a random effects maximum likelihood model producing utility values ranging from 0.089 to 1. Conclusions: The Myelofibrosis 8 dimensions is a condition-specific preference based measure for myelofibrosis. This measure can be used to generate utility values for myelofibrosis for any data set containing the Myelonbrosis-Symptom Assessment Form and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 30 Questionnaire data","[Mukuria, Clara; Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John E.; Young, Tracey A.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Nafees, Beenish] ICON Plc, Dublin, Ireland",University of Sheffield; ICON plc,"Mukuria, C (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",c.mukuria@sheffield.ac.uk,"Young, Tracey A/A-4543-2010; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Young, Tracey/0000-0001-8467-0471; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109",Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited,Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited,This study was funded by Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Limited.,,29,18,19,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,846,855,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.07.004,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409613.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800015,0

Methods: The study used data from patients with ADHD receiving LOX (N = 104) or OROS-MPH (N = 107) in a phase Ill randomized clinical trial. A prediction model was developed to estimate risk scores for failing OROS-MPH, where treatment failure was defined as less than 25% improvement in the ADHD Rating Scale IV total score from baseline. Patients were ranked by their predicted risks of OROS-MPH failure to define high-risk subpopulations. Outcomes of LDX and OROS-MPH were compared within subpopulations. Results: The prediction model for OROS-MPH failure selected seven predictors (age, disease duration, and five ADHD Rating Scale 1V item scores) and had an in-sample C statistic of 0.860. Among all patients, LOX had a 17% (95% confidence interval 7.1%-27.8%) lower treatment failure rate than that of OROS-MPH; differences in failure rates ranged from 17% to 43% across subpopulations, increasingly enriched for high-risk patients. Similar heterogeneity across subgroups was observed for other efficacy measures. Conclusions: In the overall trial population, LDX was associated with a lower rate of treatment failure compared with OROS-MPH in patients with ADHD. A more pronounced benefit of LOX over OROS-MPH was observed among subpopulations with a higher predicted risk of failing OROS-MPH. The present study showed the feasibility of individualizing treatment selection. Future research is needed to prospectively verify these results.","[Setyawan, Juliana; Erder, M.

We study the connection between the two concepts. We partially characterize the correlations embedded among type spaces with the same set of hierarchies of beliefs over conditional beliefs with partially correlating devices, which send correlated signals to players in a way that preserves each player's belief about others' types. Since the belief-invariant Bayesian solution is also implemented by such correlating devices, we then establish that it is invariant on equivalent type space. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Fagnart, JF; Germain, M",,,,"Fagnart, Jean-Francois; Germain, Marc",,,"Energy, complexity and sustainable long-term growth",MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,VARIETY,"We introduce the concept of product complexity in an endogenous growth model with renewable energy and expanding product variety a la Grossman and Helpman (1991). We describe the complexity of a product as an increasing function of the variety of inputs it consists of. Considering that energy is necessary to all human activities (including research), we highlight what type of long run growth path is possible according to (a) the potential of energy efficiency gains in the various human activities and (b) the effect of the product complexity on the energy intensiveness of its production process. In a finite world, a neoclassical growth path where economic growth can be both quantitative and non-quantitative (i.e. takes the form of an increase in the quantity of produced goods and in the product variety) is only possible if the potential of energy efficiency gains is unbounded in all human activities. If the energy intensiveness of the final production is bounded from below by a strictly positive constant, quantitative growth is not possible in the long run but non-quantitative growth may persist if (i) the impact of product complexity on the energy intensiveness of production is null or weak enough and (ii) the energy intensiveness of research activities tends to zero. If these conditions are not met, no form of long run growth is possible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that pharmaceutical innovation played a key role in reducing premature mortality from all diseases in Slovenia, and to examine the effects of pharmaceutical innovation on the age-standardized number of cancer deaths and on hospitalization from all diseases. Estimates and other data were used to calculate the incremental cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical innovation in Slovenia. Method Longitudinal disease-level data was analyzed to determine whether diseases for which there was greater pharmaceutical innovation-a larger increase in the number of new chemical entities (NCEs) previously launched-had larger declines in premature mortality, the age-standardized number of cancer deaths, and the number of hospital discharges. My methodology controls for the effects of macroeconomic trends and overall changes in the healthcare system. Results Premature mortality from a disease is inversely related to the number of NCEs launched more than 5 years earlier. On average, the introduction of an additional NCE for a disease reduced premature mortality from the disease by 2.4 % 7 years later. The age-standardized number of cancer deaths is inversely related to the number of NCEs launched 1-6 years earlier, conditional on the age-standardized number of new cancer cases diagnosed 0-2 years earlier. On average, the launch of an NCE reduced the number of hospital discharges 1 year later by approximately 1.5 %. Conclusions The estimates imply that approximately two-thirds of the 2000-2010 decline in premature mortality was due to pharmaceutical innovation. If no NCEs had been launched in Slovenia during 1992-2003, the age-standardized number of cancer deaths in 2008 would have been 12.2 % higher. The NCEs launched in Slovenia during 2003-2009 are estimated to have reduced the number of hospital discharges in 2010 by 7 %. If we assume that pharmaceutical expenditure was the only type of expenditure affected by pharmaceutical innovation, the cost per life-year saved was (sic)3,953, which is well below even the lowest estimates of the value of a life-year saved. Moreover, 85 % of the increase in drug expenditure may have been offset by a reduction in hospital expenditure; therefore. the cost per life-year saved may have been only (sic)611.","Columbia Univ, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Lichtenberg, FR (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, 504 Uris Hall,3022 Broadway, New York, NY 10027 USA.",frl1@columbia.edu,,,"Mednarodni forum znanstvenoraziskovalnih farmacevtskih druzb, GIZ /Forum of International R & D Pharmaceutical Companies, EIG","Mednarodni forum znanstvenoraziskovalnih farmacevtskih druzb, GIZ /Forum of International R & D Pharmaceutical Companies, EIG","This research was supported by Mednarodni forum znanstvenoraziskovalnih farmacevtskih druzb, GIZ /Forum of International R & D Pharmaceutical Companies, EIG.

The choice of insulin delivery device may also have direct effects on effectiveness. Objective: '1'his study aimed to estimate the effects of insulin adherence and delivery device on realworld health outcomes. Methods: This study included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus initiating insulin, with continuous health plan insurance for 6 or more months before initiation (baseline) and 1 or more year after. Measured outcomes included glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb AO reduction, hospitalization rate, total health care costs, and pharmacy costs over 1 year of follow-up. Adherence (defined as having insulin fills sufficient for the entire quarter), pen or vial/syringe use, and disease-related patient characteristics were assessed in each quarter. To account for the time varying relationship between adherence, patient characteristics, and outcomes, marginal structural generalized linear models were used to estimate the effect of adherence and device use Mean outcomes were predicted for different combinations of adherence and device choice. Results: Among the 13,428 patients (mean age 54 years; 46% women; baseline Hb 9.3%), adherent pen users had greater reductions in Hb AI, (0.35%; P = 0.045), lower hospitalization rates (0.36; P < 0.01), and higher pharmacy costs ($2923; P < 0.01) than did nonadherent vial users, and similar total health care costs ($3906 lower; P = 0.1). Pen use and adherent vial use decreased hospitalization rate and increased pharmacy but not total costs. Conclusions: Adherence and pen use have beneficial effects on patients' real-world outcomes, with the most favorable effects attributable to adherent pen use","[Ayyagari, Rajeev; Cheng, David; Signorovitch, James; Wu, Eric Q.] Anal Grp Inc, Boston, MA USA; [Wei, Wenhui] Sanofi Auentis US, Bridgewater, MA USA; [Pan, Chunshen] Prounlimited, Boca Raton, FL USA",Analysis Group Inc.,"Ayyagari, R (通讯作者)，111 Huntington Ave,Tenth Floor, Boston, MA 02199 USA.",RAyyagari@analysisgroup.com,"LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023",,Sanofi-Aventis,Sanofi-Aventis(Sanofi-Aventis),Source of financial support: Sanofi-Aventis sponsored this study.,,29,24,25,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,198,205,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.12.016,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773555.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300010,0

The identification of structural shocks in FAVAR can involve infinitely many restrictions as the number of cross sections goes to infinity. Our focus is to test the joint null hypothesis that all the restrictions are satisfied. Conventional tests cannot be used due to the large dimension. We transform the infinite-dimensional problem into a finite-dimensional one by combining the individual statistics across the cross section dimension. We find the limit distribution of our joint test statistic under the null hypothesis and prove that it is consistent against the alternative that a fraction of or all identifying restrictions are violated. The Monte Carlo results show that the joint test statistic has good finite-sample size and power. We implement our tests to an updated version of Stock and Watson's (2005) data set. Our test result is further confirmed by the impulse responses of major macroeconomic variables to the monetary policy shock: the impulse responses based on the specification selected by our test are generally more plausible than those based on the specifications rejected by our test.

We separately derive locally best invariant tests for the I(0) and I(1) cases; under their respective assumptions, the resulting confidence sets provide correct asymptotic coverage regardless of the magnitude of the break. We suggest use of a pre-test procedure to select between the I(0)- and I(1)-based confidence sets, and Monte Carlo evidence demonstrates that our recommended procedure achieves good finite sample properties in terms of coverage and length across both I(0) and I(1) environments.

Considerable attention has been placed on geographic variation in utilization; however, empiric data has shown that geographic variation in utilization is not associated with overuse. While there has been renewed interest in overuse in recent years, much of the focus has been on the overuse of individual procedures. In this paper we argue that overuse should be thought of as a widespread and pervasive phenomenon that we coin as systematic overuse. While not directly observable (i.e., a latent phenomenon), we suggest that systematic overuse could be identified by tracking a portfolio of overused procedures. Such a portfolio would reflect systematic overuse if it is associated with higher healthcare costs and no health benefit (including worse health outcomes) across a healthcare system. In this report we define and conceptualize systematic overuse and illustrate how it can be identified and validated via a simple empirical example using several Choosing Wisely indicators. The concept of systematic overuse requires further development and empirical verification, and this paper provides an important first step, a conceptual framework, to that end.","[Nassery, Najlla; Segal, Jodi B.] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Med, Div Gen Internal Med, Baltimore, MD 21224 USA; [Segal, Jodi B.; Chang, Eva; Bridges, John F.

The change of tourism market in the world and the competitive nature of the tourism industry, require tourist destinations to give better service and generate a positive image on tourists' mind. Unfortunately, the fragility of the tourism sector, internal sources are always not enough to keep or attract the visitors. There are security problems both human made (war, terrorist attacks, robberies & accidents) and natural disasters (earthquake, volcano, tsunami & storm disease) which are affecting the pre and after arrivals and safety perception of tourists that establishes destination's security image and popularity. Destination security image plays an important role in destination choice of tourists. In addition, these events not only damaged the countries physically, also it changed the trends of the tourism. Nowadays, countries are suffering from the Bird Flu, especially tourism based destinations. Over and above deceases like Ebola has also affected travel industry. Furthermore, political issues also affect the image of a particular destination. The case of the Mediterranean island of Cyprus illustrates such situation. Cyprus is divided between North and South since 1974. Where northern part is administered by Turkish armed forces and southern part is governed by Greeks. North Cyprus, which is called Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, is still an unrecognized country and suffers from political instability, while the southern part of the island became a full member state of European Union in 2004. Both sides are major tourist destination in the Mediterranean, ideal place for sand, sun and sea type holidays, however, the northern part remains largely unknown due to its political isolation. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to examine how foreign tourists perceive North Cyprus in terms of security before and after visiting the country.","[Hussain, Kashif; Bouchon, Frederic; Kumar, Jeetesh] Taylors Univ, Sch Hospitality Tourism & Culinary Arts, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Ekiz, Erdogan H.] King Abdulaziz Univ, Tourism Inst, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Taylor's University; King Abdulaziz University,"Hussain, K (通讯作者)，Taylors Univ, Sch Hospitality Tourism & Culinary Arts, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",kashif.hussain@taylors.edu.my; hekiz@kau.edu.sa; frederic.b@taylors.edu.my; jeetesh.kumar@taylors.edu.my,"Ekiz, Erdogan/AAA-3785-2020; Bouchon, Frederic/L-3151-2019; Hussain, Kashif/JDN-2995-2023; Kumar, Jeetesh/AAC-2636-2019; Hussain, Kashif/A-6326-2014","Bouchon, Frederic/0000-0002-2932-5787; Kumar, Jeetesh/0000-0001-9878-1228; Hussain, Kashif/0000-0002-2923-3575",,,,,33,0,0,0,3,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,663,673,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900047,0

A generic approach of bibliographic analysis is implemented to present visualised and organised results, which enable a systematic review on previous studies. We found that (1) research on internationalisation of R&D originated from three different fields, i.e., strategic management, innovation management and international business, and (2) research frontiers are emerged in most recent studies that can be categorised into four key areas. Bibliometric analysis provides a possibility to identify and understand the intellectual structure of research on R&D internationalisation in latest 35 years.

Accordingly, the qualitative fertilization involved NP solution, YARA Vita Thiotrac and combinations of both applied by foliar spraying. The application of sulfur combined with nitrogen or qualitative fertilization had no influence on grain yield. The qualitative fertilization increased the protein content by up to 0.8% for Rosso and only by 0.2% for Skorpion, while the value of Zeleny sedimentation volume grew by 2.7 to 6.3 ml for Rosso and by 1 to 1.7 ml for the Skorpion variants fertilized with N1S1. The representation of individual protein fractions was significantly influenced only by the variety - no fertilization effect was demonstrated. For Rosso, the content of selected cyanidins increased by 1.0%-81.0% after the application of qualitative fertilization, while the influence for Skorpion was less significant, ranging from -9.3% to 37.3%.

When dealing with family businesses, the question of succession is extremely important. To what extent the practices of planning ahead, or being committed to other people and taking care of family members and employees will be maintained are crucial points to be clarified with potential future successors. It is also important to understand whether and how the national cultural factors influence succession. In order to have a better understanding of the above enumerated points, a survey has been conducted among 143 young Hungarian people (members of Generation Y aged 18-33) in spring 2014 with family business backgrounds.

In a first instance, we look at how nostalgia correlates with demographic variables like age, education and income. And, at a second level we observe how nostalgia's interaction with these same demographic variables impacts upon ownership and usage of the internet and smartphones. Results demonstrate that nostalgia tends to negatively influence both smartphone usage and ownership, but has an adverse effect only on internet usage, not ownership. We also note that, in general, age positively influences nostalgia; income has a negative effect on it; while education seems to not be a significant influencer of nostalgia. In contrast, with regards to technology ownership and usage, age shows negative correlations, while income and education shows positive correlations. Following these observations, we discuss potential ways in which marketers can leverage nostalgia to promote, rather than deter technology ownership/usage. We also emphasize the need for relevant authorities and society to support such initiatives.","[Shibchurn, Joshana; Yan Xiang-bin] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Yao Xiao-xu] Northeast Forestry Univ, Coll Informat & Comp Engn, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Northeast Forestry University - China,"Shibchurn, J (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,"Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71531013, 71171067]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(71531013, 71171067)",,26,0,0,0,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1179,1187,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600158,0

Results from the multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the surface action of emotional labor had significant negative effect on organizational citizenship behavior and the deep action of emotional labor had significant positive effect on organizational citizenship behavior of university teachers; the influence of emotional labor on organizational citizenship behavior was partly mediated by job satisfaction among university teachers.

However, this strategy has two aspects of effects. On one hand, it expands the scale of customers and obtains the cost savings. On the other hand, in an Internet-based channel, the customers buy direct from the manufacturer sacrificing the benefits of physical inspection of the product, this leads to a significant likelihood that customer will have some dissatisfaction with the product and would like to return it even if the product has no functional or cosmetic defect (i.e., false failure returns). Furthermore, the mix of traditional retailing and online e-tailing has added a new dimension of competition to the manufacturer's distribution channels. Comparing with the traditional retail channel, the online channel with a clearly explained and generous return policy and an attractive sales price will be welcome by the customers, and it will threaten the existing traditional channel, which is referred to channel conflict. Then, from the manufacturer's point of view, the key problem is that how to mitigate the channel conflict and maximize the profits via pricing and return policy? To answer this question, we develop a profit maximization model under the scenarios of partial refund, full refund and no refund policy. We obtain the optimal price and return policy, and investigate the impacts of return policy on the optimal price and profits of the manufacturer and the retailer.","[Wang Jing; Tian Hou-ping] Nanjing Univ Sci & technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Liu Chang-xian] Nanjing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Management, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Wang, J (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Sci & technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71402074, 71472089, 70901042]; Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [13YJC630088]; Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province Education Department [2013SJB6300071]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [30920130111011]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province Education Department; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities)","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(71402074, 71472089, 70901042), Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(13YJC630088), Social Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province Education Department (2013SJB6300071), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (30920130111011)",,37,1,1,1,9,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,666,672,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600088,0

One solution is to include bolt-on dimensions describing additional specific health problems. Objectives: This study aimed to develop bolt-on dimensions to the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-51)) and assess their impact on health state values. Methods: Bolt-on dimensions were developed for vision problems, hearing problems, and tiredness. Each bolt-on dimension had three severity levels to match the EQ-5D. Three core' EQ-5D states across a range of severity were selected, and each level of a bolt-on item was added, resulting in nine states in each condition. Health states with and without the bolt-on dimensions were valued by 300 members of the UK general public using time trade-off in face-to-face interviews, and mean health state values were compared using t tests. Regression analysis examined the impact of the bolt-on variants and the level of the bolt-on items after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Bolt-on dimensions had an impact on health state values of the EQ-5D; however, the size, direction, and significance of the impact depend on the severity of the core EQ-5D state and of the bolt on dimension. Regression analysis demonstrated that after controlling for possible differences in sociodemographic characteristics between the groups, there were no significant differences in health state values between the three bolt-on dimensions but confirmed that the impact depended on the severity of the EQ-51) health state and the levels of bolt on dimensions. Conclusions: The impact of a bolt-on dimension on the EQ-5D depends on the core health state and the level of the bolt-on dimension. Further research in this area is encouraged.

The experimental result shows that the identification model on the Principle Component Analysis and Random Forest has higher identification accuracy and efficiency, which get a 89.0% accuracy in less than 5 minutes.","[Zhang Li-yi; Zhang Jiao] Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China",Wuhan University,"Zhang, LY (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Informat Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",,"XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023; jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; zhang, lin/IZQ-4870-2023; Wu, Jiaqiang/JUV-0151-2023","Wu, Jiaqiang/0009-0004-0536-5364",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71373192]; MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in Chinese Universities [14JJD870002],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in Chinese Universities,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71373192), the MOE Project of Key Research Institute of Humanities and Social Science in Chinese Universities (14JJD870002)",,29,10,11,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,9,15,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600002,0

The analysis uses dynamic panel data estimates and a recent nationwide administrative database for major diagnostic categories in 1068 Japanese hospitals in 2006-2012 to show that average length of stay significantly increases for hospitals in percentiles 0-25 of the pre-reform length of stay and significantly decreases for hospitals in percentiles 51-100. The decline of the average length of stay is larger for hospitals in higher percentiles of the length of stay. Hospitals in percentiles 51-100 significantly increase their rate of nonemergency/unanticipated readmissions within 42days after discharge. The decline in the length of total episode of treatment is smaller for hospitals in percentiles 0-25. The findings are robust in terms of the choice of a cohort of hospitals joining the reform. The paper discusses applicability of best practice' rate-setting to help improve the performance of hospitals in the lowest quartile of average length of stay.

However, there were no clear empirical evidences in Korea that show if population aging has a significant impact on HCE. To examine the 'red herring' argument, this study used Heckman, two-part, and augmented model with Korean National Health Insurance claim data for the deceased and survivors of aged 20 years and over verified by Korean National Health Insurance Service between January 1 and December 31, 2010. Our results suggest that when time to death is controlled for as explanatory variable, HCE decreases as a function of age, and HCE during the terminal year increases as a function of time to death, and HCE in the last quarter of life decreases with age. Therefore, this study affirms that there is no age effect in Korea experiencing the most rapid population aging among Asian countries. An increase in the number of elderly, due to the aging of baby boomers, may not increase a share of HCE out of gross domestic product (GDP) in Korea.

Objectives: In this paper, we develop the precise conditions needed for a financing mechanism, HealthCoin, to work between a private payer and Medicare, to incentivize the former to invest in breakthrough therapies or cures in the US. Methods: We illustrate the valuation of such a currency for a cure of Type 2 diabetes. Results: We show that without a HealthCoin, a private payer does not invest in the cure, a small fraction of the patients live up to age 65, Medicare pays for the full price of the cure at age 65 and incurs net loss in returns over the elderly ages, and the manufacturer only sells cures for those who reach age 65. In contrast, a HealthCoin is feasible in this market, incentivizing the private payer to invest in the cure during the non elderly ages and leading to Pareto improvements for all three stakeholders. Conclusions: Discussions around the applicability of Health Coin for breakthrough therapies on the horizon, such as gene therapies for blindness and hemophilia B, and the feasibility of instituting such payments through new legislations or demonstration projects could be of great value.","[Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Hlth Serv, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Basu, Anirban] Univ Washington, Dept Econ, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Subedi, Prasun; Kamal-Bahl, Sachin] Pfizer Inc, Global Hlth & Value Innovat Ctr, New York, NY USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Pfizer,"Basu, A (通讯作者)，1959 NE Pacific St,Box 357631, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",basua@uw.edu,,,"Global Health & Value Innovation Center, Pfizer, Inc.; consortium of 12 biomedical life sciences companies","Global Health & Value Innovation Center, Pfizer, Inc.; consortium of 12 biomedical life sciences companies","This study was conducted using funds provided by Global Health & Value Innovation Center, Pfizer, Inc., and a consortium of 12 biomedical life sciences companies to the University of Washington.",,23,10,12,1,8,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,861,868,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1859,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712715.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500024,0

I focus on four different types of health outcomes: subjective health measures, objective health measures, health behavior, and healthcare utilization. Fixed effect models are estimated with British Household Panel Survey data. I find that whereas objective health and health behavior are barely affected by commuting time, subjective health measures are clearly lower for people who commute longer. A longer commuting time is, moreover, related to more visits to the general practitioner. Effects turn out to be more pronounced for women and for commuters driving a car. For women, commuting time is also negatively related to regular exercise and positively to calling in sick.

This study provides the first evidence on the national income elasticity of vaccination spending. Both fixed and random effects models are applied to data from 84 countries from 2010 to 2011. The income elasticities for healthcare expenditure and vaccine expenditure are 0.844 and 0.336, respectively. Despite vaccines' high cost-effectiveness, the national propensity to spend income on vaccines as income increases lags behind general health care. The low income elasticity of vaccine spending means that relying on economic growth alone will provide an unacceptably slow trajectory to achieving high vaccine coverage levels.

Despite our high levels of health spending, and our field's long and consistent approach to the basic tools of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), US private and public payers are not routinely or explicitly using CEAs in their reimbursement decisions. This is a puzzle that raises the following question: Why does the United States have so many skilled pharmacoeconomic practitioners and produce so many CEAs given this apparent lack of interest and trust? There are multiple reasons, but the lack of incentives to use the information certainly matters. This article identifies and discusses a number of key issues and challenges for incorporating CEA into US clinical guidelines development: potential bias in manufacturer-sponsored CEAs, the role of societal perspective, payer-subscriber and physician-patient agency relationships, the need for disease area CEA studies and modeling, patient heterogeneity, investigators' conflicts of interest, assessing the quality of economic studies, and aggregation of information using multicriteria decision analysis. These developments suggest that the application of CEA in health care decision making in the United States is evolving and may be approaching a tipping point. With increasing pressures on drug prices, perhaps reflecting challenges to industry sustainability, payers, providers, and patients are looking for value for money. CEA should be an important part of this process.","[Garrison, Louis P., Jr.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,H375,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Garrison, LP (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific St,Hlth Sci Bldg,H375,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",lgarrisn@uw.edu,,,,,,,16,20,25,0,5,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,512,515,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.018,0.0,,,4,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565265.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600002,0

We apply it to test the hypothesis that one time series has no directional predictability to another time series. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the cross-quantilogram and the corresponding test statistic. The limiting distributions depend on nuisance parameters. To construct consistent confidence intervals we employ a stationary bootstrap procedure; we establish consistency of this bootstrap. Also, we consider a self-normalized approach, which yields an asymptotically pivotal statistic under the null hypothesis of no predictability. We provide simulation studies and two empirical applications. First, we use the cross-quantilogram to detect predictability from stock variance to excess stock return. Compared to existing tools used in the literature of stock return predictability, our method provides a more complete relationship between a predictor and stock return. Second, we investigate the systemic risk of individual financial institutions, such as JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and AIG. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our contribution is two-fold: we first propose a new test constructed via the comparison between in-sample and out-of-sample pseudo-likelihoods. Under the null hypothesis that the copula model is correctly specified, we show that the proposed test statistic converges in probability to a constant equal to the dimension of the parameter space. We establish the asymptotic normality and investigate the local power of the test. We also extend the proposed test to the specification test of a class of multivariate time series models, and propose a new bootstrap procedure to establish the finite-sample null distribution, which is shown to have better control of type I error than the commonly used bootstrap. Secondly, we introduce a Bonferroni-based hybrid mechanism to combine several test statistics, which yields a useful test. This hybrid method is particularly appealing when there exists no single dominant optimal test. We conduct comprehensive simulation experiments to compare the proposed new test and hybrid approach with two of the best blanket tests in the literature. For illustration, we apply the proposed tests to analyze two real datasets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The adaLASSO is a one-step implementation of the family of folded concave penalized least-squares. We assume that both the number of covariates in the model and the number of candidate variables can increase with the sample size (polynomially or geometrically). In other words, we let the number of candidate variables to be larger than the number of observations. We show the adaLASSO consistently chooses the relevant variables as the number of observations increases (model selection consistency) and has the oracle property, even when the errors are non-Gaussian and conditionally heteroskedastic. This allows the adaLASSO to be applied to a myriad of applications in empirical finance and macroeconomics. A simulation study shows that the method performs well in very general settings with t-distributed and heteroskedastic errors as well with highly correlated regressors. Finally, we consider an application to forecast monthly US inflation with many predictors. The model estimated by the adaLASSO delivers superior forecasts than traditional benchmark competitors such as autoregressive and factor models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The payoff gradient of a game is defined as a vector whose component is a partial derivative of each player's payoff function with respect to the player's own action. If the Jacobian matrix of the payoff gradient is negative definite for each state, then a Bayesian Nash equilibrium is unique. This result unifies and generalizes the uniqueness of an equilibrium in a complete information game by Rosen (1965) and that in a team by Radner (1962). In a Bayesian game played on a network, the Jacobian matrix of the payoff gradient coincides with the weighted adjacency matrix of the underlying graph. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, employees' insurance rates are not gender-rated in the employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) market. Thus, women may experience lower wages in equilibrium from employers who offer health insurance to their employees. We show that female employees suffer a larger wage gap relative to men when they hold ESI: our results suggest this accounts for roughly 10% of the overall gender wage gap. For a full-time worker, this pay gap due to ESI is on the order of the expected difference in healthcare expenses between women and men. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, a set of necessary conditions for optimal control is given in the case of the dynamic (multi-stage) weight selection problem of consensus protocols. Under some mild conditions, it turns out that only one-stage is sufficient for reaching consensus, and the article derives a closed-form solution for the optimal control. Second, a (zerosum) game theoretical model with a convex-convex quadratic objective function is considered for the problem of a network with an adversary corrupting the control signal with noise. Mixed-strategy saddle-point (MSSP) strategies are obtained for the players (the adversary and the network designer) in the resulting game. Further, a totally distributed gradient method that computes the optimal control is provided. Simulation results show that an adversary using an MSSP strategy can drive the system away from consensus, while an adversary using a uniform random strategy does not cause as much damage.","[El Chamie, Mahmoud] INRIA Sophia Antipolis Mediterranee, 2004 Route Lucioles BP 93, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France; [Basar, Tamer] Univ Illinois, Coordinated Sci Lab, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, 1308 West Main, Urbana, IL 61801 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,"El Chamie, M (通讯作者)，INRIA Sophia Antipolis Mediterranee, 2004 Route Lucioles BP 93, F-06902 Sophia Antipolis, France.",shamieh.m@gmail.com; basar1@illinois.edu,"Basar, Tamer/V-6613-2019",,,,,,25,2,2,0,0,BIRKHAUSER BOSTON,CAMBRIDGE,"675 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139-2333 USA",,,978-3-319-28014-1; 978-3-319-28012-7,ANN INT SOC DYN GAME,,,2016,14.0,,,,,,117,137,,10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_6,0.0,,,21,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6CK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389946800006,0

This is especially the case when the ratio of public debt over GDP is restricted to be constant. Using a Ramsey model, we show that such a constraint can however be a fundamental source of indeterminacy, and therefore, of expectations-driven fluctuations. Indeed, through the intertemporal budget constraint of the government, income taxation negatively depends on future debt, i.e. on the expected level of production. This mechanism ensures that expectations on the future tax rate may be self-fulfilling. We show that this is promoted by a larger ratio of debt over GDP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We fill this gap by investigating the impact of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and work-related physical activity (WRPA) on obesity and chronic conditions in Canadians aged 18-75 using instrumental variable and recursive bivariate probit approaches. Average local temperatures surrounding the respondents' interview month are used as a novel instrument to help identify the causal relationship between LTPA and health outcomes. We find that an active level of LTPA (i.e. walking 1h/day) reduces the probability of obesity by five percentage points, which increases to 11 percentage points if also combined with some WRPA. WRPA exhibits a negative effect on the probability of obesity and chronic conditions. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[Sarma, Sisira; Campbell, M.

Using a rich data set linking records of mortality and health events to survey data on lifestyles for the Netherlands (1998-2007), we test the sensitivity of estimated inequity to different normative choices and conclude that the location of the responsibility cut is of vital importance. Traditional measures of inequity (such as socioeconomic and regional inequalities) only capture part of more comprehensive notions of unfairness. We show that distinguishing between different routes via which variables might be associated to mortality is essential to the application of different normative positions. Using the fairness gap (direct unfairness), measured inequity according to our implementation of the control' and preference' approaches ranges between 0.0229 and 0.0239 (0.0102-0.0218), while regional and socioeconomic inequalities are smaller than 0.0020 (0.0001). The usual practice of standardizing for age and gender has large effects on measured inequity. Finally, we use our model to measure inequity in simulated counterfactual situations. While it is a big challenge to identify all causal relationships involved in this empirical context, this does not affect our main conclusions regarding the importance of normative choices in the measurement of inequity.

Studies examining the impact of tax incentives generally report zero/negative coefficients, but these studies incorrectly define their tax variables and rely on difference-in-differences despite likely failures of the parallel trends assumption. We identify the causal effect of tax legislation to serve as an organ donor on living kidney donation rates in the U.S. states using more precise tax data and allowing for heterogeneous time-variant causal effects. Employing a synthetic control method, we find that the passage of tax incentive legislation increased living unrelated kidney donation rates by 52 percent in New York relative to a comparable synthetic New York in the absence of legislation. It is possible that New York is unique, but our methodology does not allow us to measure accurately effects in other states. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using detailed individual health expenditure data from a Swiss health insurer, we estimate the response in healthcare demand to the discrete price increase generated by resetting the deductible at the start of each calendar year. We find that for individuals with high deductibles, healthcare demand drops by 27%. The decrease is most pronounced for inpatient care and prescription drugs. By contrast, for individuals with low deductibles, there is no significant change in healthcare demand (except for prescription drugs). Overall our results suggest that healthy individuals respond much stronger to the price change.

Methods: The study population comprised 1,076,311 patients registered in the Health Search CSD Longitudinal Patient Database between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2010. We randomly selected 538,254 and 538,057 patients to form the development and validation cohorts, respectively. To ensure model convergence, 5% of the aforementioned cohorts were selected randomly to create development and validation samples. The outcome was the total direct health care costs covered by the national health system. Interaction between age and sex, chronic diseases, and acute diseases were entered in a multilevel generalized linear latent mixed model with random intercepts (province of residence and general practitioner) to identify determinants associated with increased or decreased costs. The estimated coefficients were linearly combined to create the HSM Index for individual patients. The score was applied to the validation sample, and measures of predictive accuracy, explained variance, and the observed/predicted ratio were computed to evaluate the model's accuracy. Results: The mean yearly cost was 414.57 per patient, and the HSM Index had a median value of 5.08 (25th-75th range 4.44-5.98). 'I'he HSM Index explained 50.17% of the variation in costs. Concerning calibration, in 80% of the populadon, the margin of error in the estimation of costs was around 10%. Conclusions: The HSM Index is a reliable case-mix system that could be implemented in general practice for costs adjustment This tool should ensure fairer scrutiny of resource use and allocation of budgets among general practitioners.","[Lapi, Francesco; Bianchini, Elisa; Cricelli, Iacopo; Mazzaglia, Giampiero] Italian Coll Gen Practitioners & Primary Care, Hlth Search, I-50149 Florence, Italy; [Trifiro, Gianluca] Univ Messina, Dept Clin & Expt Med, Sect Pharmacol, Messina, Italy; [Cricelli, Claudio] Italian Coll Gen Practitioners & Primary Care, Florence, Italy",University of Messina,"Lapi, F (通讯作者)，Italian Coll Gen Practitioners & Primary Care, Hlth Search, Via Sestese 61, I-50149 Florence, Italy.",lapi.francesco@simg.it,"Trifiro, Gianluca/K-9744-2016; CRICELLI, Claudio/E-7607-2010","Trifiro, Gianluca/0000-0003-1147-7296; Mazzaglia, Giampiero/0000-0003-4933-2148; CRICELLI, Claudio/0000-0002-9607-5802",,,,,46,8,9,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,884,895,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.004,0.0,,,12,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409617.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800019,0

Methods: Electronic databases and supplementary sources were searched for economic evaluation guidelines. Guidelines were critically appraised. Descriptive characteristics, standard formats, supports for nontechnical audiences, presentation approaches, and common reporting recommendations were extracted. Frequencies were tabulated and trends identified. Results: Thirty-one guidelines were included. Twenty-two guidelines include a standard reporting format with some sample tables and graphs. Common presentation approaches include well-cited tables of data sources, transparent model diagrams and descriptions, disaggregated results, and tabular and graphical displays of sensitivity analyses. Despite most guidelines being funded by policymakers, only five guidelines provided advice on presenting economic evaluations to noneconomists. However, 11 guidelines included a glossary of economic terminology for nontechnical readers. Common concepts that may require further explanation include differences in economic perspectives, appropriateness of time horizons, how economic outcomes such as qualityadjusted life years relate to their component clinical outcomes, and choice of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Health economists have consistent presentation formats and common reporting elements that should be considered when developing user-friendly explanations for general audiences. These overlap with policymakers' informational needs but may not be sufficient for understanding by nontechnical audiences. Developing presentation formats and tools that incorporate viewpoints of both economists and noneconomists will allow for better application of the results of economic evaluations and enhance the transparency and legitimacy of decision-making processes that are informed by economic evaluations.","[Sullivan, Shannon M.; Wells, George] Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada; [Wells, George; Coyle, Doug] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; University of Ottawa,"Sullivan, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Ottawa, Inst Heart, 40 Ruskin St H1281, Ottawa, ON K1Y 4W7, Canada.",ssull011@uottawa.ca,,"Coyle, Doug/0000-0003-3492-2268",Canadian Institute of Health Research Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network [116573],Canadian Institute of Health Research Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network,This research was supported through a grant from the Canadian Institute of Health Research Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (funding reference no. 116573).,,63,11,13,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,915,924,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.06.007,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409620.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800022,0

However, regulations and the generic drugs available vary between countries. It is the prescriber or dispenser of the drug who is the final decision maker. Nevertheless, physicians' and pharmacists' perceptions of generic drug use are not well documented to date. This study presents a systematic review of physicians' and pharmacists' perspectives on generic drug use worldwide. Methods A systematic literature search was performed to retrieve all articles published between 2002 and 2012 regarding physicians' and/or pharmacists' experiences with generic drugs and generic substitution. Results Of 1322 publications initially identified, 24 were eligible for inclusion. Overall, the studies revealed that physicians and pharmacists were aware of the cost-saving function of generic drugs and their role in improving global access to drugs. Nevertheless, marked differences were observed between countries when studying physicians' and pharmacists' perceptions of the available generic drugs. In less mature healthcare systems, large variations regarding, for example, control routines, bioequivalence requirements, and manufacturer standards were reported. A lack of reliable information and mistrust in the efficacy and quality were also mentioned by these participants. In the most developed healthcare systems, the participants trusted the quality of the generic drugs and did not hesitate to offer them to all patients regardless of socioeconomic status. In general, pharmacists seemed to have better knowledge of the concept of bioequivalence and generic drug aspects than physicians. Conclusions The present study indicates that physicians and pharmacists are aware of the role of generic drugs in the improvement of global access to drugs. However, there are marked differences regarding how these health professionals view the quality of generic drugs depending on the maturity of their country's healthcare system. This can be attributed to the fact that developed healthcare systems have more reliable public control routines for drugs in general as well as better bioequivalence requirements concerning generics in particular.","[Toverud, Else-Lydia; Hakonsen, Helle] Univ Oslo, Sch Pharm, Dept Social Pharm, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; [Hartmann, Katrin] Univ Bielefeld, Bielefeld Sch Publ Hlth, Hlth Care Management, D-33615 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Oslo; University of Bielefeld,"Toverud, EL (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Sch Pharm, Dept Social Pharm, POB 1068, N-0316 Oslo, Norway.",e.l.toverud@farmasi.uio.no,,,Abbott Pharmaceuticals,Abbott Pharmaceuticals(Abbott Laboratories),Abbott Pharmaceuticals is acknowledged for economic support for the study.,,35,54,58,2,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We compared no screening, telephone screening, Internet screening, screening with a handheld screening device, and audiometric screening for various starting ages and a varying number of repeated screenings. Methods: The costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for no screening and for 76 screening strategies were analyzed using a Markov model with cohort simulation for the year 2011. Screening was deemed to be cost-effective if the costs were less than (sic)20,000/QALY. Results: Screening with a handheld screening device and audiometric screening were generally more costly but less effective than telephone and Internet screening. Internet screening strategies were slightly better than telephone screening strategies. Internet screening at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, was the most cost-effective strategy, costing (sic)3699/QALY. At a threshold of (sic)20,000/QALY, this strategy was with 100% certainty cost-effective compared with current practice and with 69% certainty the most cost-effective strategy among all strategies. Conclusions: This study suggests that Internet screening at age 50 years, repeated at ages 55, 60, 65, and 70 years, is the optimal strategy to screen for hearing loss and might be considered for nationwide implementation.

There is uncertainty about NAC's effectiveness and no study of its cost-effectiveness compared with that of standard primary debulking surgery (PDS). Objectives: To seek answers to three important questions: 1) What is the lifetime cost of treating elderly patients with advanced ovarian cancer, based on the primary treatment received? 2) Are the extra costs expended by the NAC group worth any extra survival advantage? 3) Would NAC potentially benefit a particular subgroup and serve as a cost-effective first-line treatment approach? Methods: A cohort of elderly women (>= 65 years) with stage III/IV ovarian cancer was identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare linked database from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2009. Cost analysis was conducted from a payer perspective, and direct medical costs incurred by Medicare were integrated for each patient. Cumulative treatment costs were estimated with a phase-of-care approach, and effectiveness was measured as years of survival. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and propensity-score-adjusted net monetary benefit regression was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of NAC per life-year gained. Analyses were further stratified by risk group categorization on the basis of tumor stage, patient age, and comorbidity score. Results: Average lifetime cost for treatment with NAC was $17,417 more than with PDS. With only 0.1 incremental life year gained, the ICER estimate was $174,173. Stratification, however, helped to delineate the treatment effect Patients in the high-risk subgroup incurred $34,390 and 0.8 life years more than did patients in the PDS subgroup, with a corresponding ICER of $42,987. In the non-high-risk subgroup, NAC use was dominated by PDS (more costly, less effective). Conclusions: Administering NAC before surgery to patients in the high risk subgroup was cost-effective at normal levels of willingness to pay, but not for the overall sample or for patients in the non-high-risk subgroup.","[Poonawalla, Insiya B.; Piller, Linda B.; Du, Xianglin L.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol Human Genet & Environm Sci, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Lairson, David R.] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Management Policy & Community Hlth, Houston, TX 77030 USA; [Chan, Wenyaw] Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Houston, TX 77030 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health; University of Texas System; University of Texas Health Science Center Houston; University of Texas School Public Health,"Lairson, DR (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Hlth Sci Ctr Houston, Sch Publ Hlth, Div Management Policy & Community Hlth, 1200 Pressler St,RAS-E307, Houston, TX 77030 USA.",David.R.Lairson@uth.tmc.edu,,,AHRQ HHS [R01-HS018956] Funding Source: Medline,AHRQ HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesAgency for Healthcare Research & Quality),,,68,19,19,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,387,395,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.005,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091592.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600005,0

Methods: We searched relevant studies published until September 3, 2013, on MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Current Contents Connect, and Web of Science. Selected studies were qualitatively synthesized, and those of at least medium quality were included in the meta analysis. A random effects model was used to pool effectiveness (Hedges's g) and to examine heterogeneity (Higgins I-2). We also explored the influence on the pooled effectiveness of unique intervention BCTs (those delivered to the intervention groups but not control groups in a trial) by estimating their modifying effects. Results: Fourteen studies were selected for the qualitative synthesis and 10 were included in the meta analysis. The pooled effectiveness of the interventions was 0.21 (95% confidence interval -0.05 to 0.47; I-2 = 82%). Eight unique BCTs were analyzed. Cope with side effects (P = 0.003) and general intention formation (P = 0.006) had a modifying effect on the pooled effectiveness. The pooled effectiveness of the interventions in which cope with side effects was applied was moderate (0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.96; I-2 = 56%). Conclusions: The overall effectiveness of OAD adherence-enhancing interventions that have been tested is small. Helping patients cope with side effects or formulate desired treatment outcomes could have an impact on the effectiveness of OAD adherence enhancing interventions. Only those interventions that include helping patients to cope with side effects appear to be particularly effective in improving OAD adherence.","[Zomahoun, Herve Tchala Vignon; Moisan, Jocelyne; Gregoire, Jean-Pierre; Guenette, Line] Univ Laval, Fac Pharm, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Zomahoun, Herve Tchala Vignon; Guillaumie, Laurence; Moisan, Jocelyne; Gregoire, Jean-Pierre; Perez, Norma; Vezina-Im, Lydi-Anne; Guenette, Line] CHU Quebec Res Ctr, Populat Hlth & Optimal Practices Res Unit, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Zomahoun, Herve Tchala Vignon; Guillaumie, Laurence; Moisan, Jocelyne; Gregoire, Jean-Pierre; Perez, Norma; Vezina-Im, Lydi-Anne; Guenette, Line] Chair Adherence Treatments, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [de Bruin, Marijn] Univ Aberdeen, Inst Appl Hlth Sci, Foresterhill, Scotland; [Vezina-Im, Lydi-Anne] Univ Laval, Fac Nursing, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",Laval University; University of Aberdeen; Laval University,"Guénette, L (通讯作者)，Hop St Sacrement, CHU Quebec Res Ctr, 1050 Chemin Ste Foy, Quebec City, PQ G1S 4L8, Canada.",,"de Bruin, Marijn/X-8418-2018; Guenette, Line/J-3813-2019; Guillaumie, Laurence/C-2461-2015","Guenette, Line/0000-0001-9769-7550; Guillaumie, Laurence/0000-0003-1138-8285",,,,,60,21,24,1,28,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,530,540,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.017,0.0,,,11,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091607.0,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600020,0

Based on this interest, many approaches such as rational choice theory or expected utility hypothesis have been proposed. Although these approaches provide a suitable ground for modeling the decision making process of humans, they are unable to explain the corresponding irrationalities and existing paradoxes and fallacies. Recently, a new formulation of decision theory that can correctly describe these paradoxes and possibly provide a unified and general theory of decision making has been proposed. This new formulation is founded based on the application of the mathematical structure of quantum theory to the fields of human decision making and cognition. It is shown that by applying these quantum-like models, one can better describe the uncertainty, ambiguity, emotions and risks involved in the human decision making process. Even in computational environments, an agent that follows the correct patterns of human decision making will have a better functionality in performing its role as a proxy for a real user. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the researches and the corresponding recent developments. Finally, the benefits of leveraging the quantum-like modeling approaches in computational domains and the existing challenges and limitations currently facing the field are discussed.

As estimates of the effects of existing soda taxes with low rates suggest little health improvements, recent proposals suggest that large taxes may be effective in reducing weight because of non-linear consumption responses or threshold effects. This paper tests this hypothesis in two ways. First, we estimate non-linear effects of taxes using the range of current rates. Second, we leverage the sudden, relatively large soda tax increase in two states during the early 1990s combined with new synthetic control methods useful for comparative case studies. Our findings suggest virtually no evidence of non-linear or threshold effects.

It is class-size invariant if it is unaffected by the multiplication of all entries in a class (i.e., a row or a column). We prove that every class-size invariant measure of association assigns to each cross-classification table a number which depends only on the cross-product ratios of its 2 x 2 subtables. We submit that the degree of association should increase when mass is shifted from cells containing a proportion of observations lower than what is expected under statistical independence to cells containing a proportion higher than expected provided that total mass in each class remains unchanged. We prove that no continuous row-size invariant measure of association satisfies this monotonicity axiom if there are at least four rows. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unfortunately, a complete census of fetal deaths, an important measure of overall fetal health, is infeasible, and available data are selectively observed. We consider this issue in the context of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 (CAAA), one of the largest and most influential environmental regulations in the history of the United States. We discuss a model of potential bias in measuring observed fetal deaths, and present the sex ratio of live births as an alternative fetal health endpoint, taking advantage of the finding that males are more vulnerable to side effects of maternal stress in utero. We find the CAAA caused substantial improvements in fetal health, in addition to previously identified reductions in post-natal mortality. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We develop theoretical arguments about two causes for closure that are triggered by errors or external shocks: poor economic sustainability and regulatory action. Homes aiming to operate with lower quality in the market are argued for a number of reasons to be more susceptible to errors/shocks in setting quality, especially negative errors, leading to an empirical hypothesis that observed quality should negatively affect closure chance. In addition, given quality, homes facing relatively high levels of local competition should also have an increased chance of closure. We use a panel of care homes from 2008 and 2010 to examine factors affecting their closure status in subsequent years. We allow for the potential endogeneity of home quality and use multiple imputation to replace missing data. Results suggest that homes with comparatively higher quality and/or lower levels of competition have less chance of closure than other homes. We discuss that the results provide some support for the policy of regulators providing quality information to potential purchasers in the market. (c) 2015 The Authors.

In such systems, long-term care provision is often characterised by significant local variability. Using a panel dataset of local authorities over the period 2002-2012, the paper investigates the underlying causes of variation in gross social care expenditure for older people in England. The analysis distinguishes between factors outside the direct control of policy makers, local preferences and local policy spillovers. The results indicate that local demand and supply factors, and to a much lesser extent local political preferences and spatial policy spillovers, explain a large majority of the observed variation in expenditure.

Our study examines the relationship between family structure and LTCI purchase and addresses several major limitations of the prior literature by using a long panel of data and considering modern family relationships, such as the presence of stepchildren. We find that family structure characteristics from one's own generation, particularly about one's spouse, are associated with purchase, but that few family structure attributes from the younger generation have an influence. Family factors that may indicate future caregiver supply are negatively associated with purchase: having a coresidential child, signaling close proximity, and having a currently working spouse, signaling a healthy and able spouse, that long-term care planning has not occurred yet or that there is less need for asset protection afforded by LTCI. Dynamic factors, such as increasing wealth or turning 65, are associated with higher likelihood of LTCI purchase.

We impose no distributional assumptions on the factors which therefore may be non-Gaussian. The novelty of our approach is to use many observables (yields or bond prices) in the cross-section dimension. This implies that the latent factors can be determined quite accurately by a sequence of cross-section regressions. We also show how output from these regressions can be used to obtain model parameters by a two- or three-step moment-based estimation procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on series estimators, test statistics are established that allow for tests of the general model against a parametric or nonparametric specification as well as a test of exogeneity of the vector of regressors. The tests' asymptotic distributions under correct specification are derived and their consistency against any alternative model is shown. Under a sequence of local alternative hypotheses, the asymptotic distributions of the tests are derived. Moreover, uniform consistency is established over a class of alternatives whose distance to the null hypothesis shrinks appropriately as the sample size increases.

Recently, there has been significant development of growing energy crops as raw materials for biogas production in biogas plants (BGP). In the conditions of the Czech Republic, it is mainly maize. Maize cultivation itself and especially technical processes associated with it participate significantly in the anthropogenic emission production. One of the ways of reducing these emissions is the substitution of maize with another plant suitable for such purposes. This may be Miscanthus x giganteus. This article presents the results of monitoring of emission load resulting from the cultivation of maize (Zea mays L.) and Miscanthus x giganteus for energy purposes. The tool to determine the level of emission load (expressed in CO(2)e where CO(2)e = 1x CO2 + 23x CH4 + 298x N2O) is the simplified Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method, respectively its Climate Impact category. For the calculations, the SIMAPro software and the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method is used. The results show that within the cultivation of Miscanthus x giganteus for energy purposes, the CO(2)e production decreases during the second year of cultivation by nearly 40% per 1 kg of dry matter. While in comparison with maize, it is almost half production of CO(2)e per the production unit depending on the yields and energy inputs.","[Bernas, Jaroslav; Jelinkova, Zuzana; Moudry, Jan, Jr.; Kopecky, Marek; Moudry, Jan] Univ South Bohemia, Dept Agroecosyst, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Bernas, J (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Dept Agroecosyst, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic.",bernasj@seznam.cz,"Bernas, Jaroslav/D-9464-2016; Kopecky, Marek/D-9452-2016; Moudry, Jan/D-9496-2016; Moudry, Jan/D-9484-2016","Bernas, Jaroslav/0000-0001-7728-7642; Kopecky, Marek/0000-0002-8312-0627; Moudry, Jan/0000-0001-6323-2464; Moudry, Jan/0000-0002-6165-5225",,,,,27,3,3,0,5,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,183,188,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100035,0

It was discovered that the strategy conversion from OEM to OBM for Chinese private processing trade enterprises is not only the change of strategy itself, but also the integral shift of enterprise strategy systems. It was proposed that enterprises should adopt the appropriate tactics according to their own strengths and the external conditions, carefully deal with various relations and reduce the conversion cost to ensure the success of strategy conversion and that the government should create good external environments for enterprises transformation and upgrading.","[Chang Li-hua] Huaihua Univ, Dept Econ, Huaihua 418008, Peoples R China; [Deng Hou-ping] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Huaihua University; Wuhan University of Technology,"Chang, LH (通讯作者)，Huaihua Univ, Dept Econ, Huaihua 418008, Peoples R China.",,,,Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China [11YJAZH005]; Humanities and Social Science Research Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province [13g042],Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China; Humanities and Social Science Research Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province,Supported by the projects of Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Foundation of the Ministry of Education of China (11YJAZH005) and the Humanities and Social Science Research Project of the Department of Education of Hubei Province in 2013 (13g042).,,39,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,996,1006,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600132,0

The purpose of this research is to provide recommendations to enhance the employee retention of Dien Quang Company by investigating various factor effects on employees' intention to stay and intention to leave. Therefore, demographic factors, recognition, career development, supervision, and interpersonal relationship were employed to clarify their influences on both intention to stay and intention to leave. Multivariate regression model was used to analyze the correlation between dependent variables and their determinants. 350 blue collar workers of the company participated in the survey but only 302 were qualified for the research sample. The results showed that recognition increases employees' intention to stay but has no significant effect on intention to leave. Career development and supervision have positive impacts on employee intention to stay but negative influences on intention to leave. Besides, interpersonal relationship has a positive effect on intention to leave but insignificant correlation is found with intention to stay. Therefore, it is suggested that the company should focus on enhancing employees' commitment through recognition, career development, and supervision as key elements of their employee retention strategies.

Work in other disciplines, following the seminal contribution of Trivers and Willard (1973), suggests that prenatal shocks may increase fetal loss and reduce the number of boys relative to girls at birth. This has been largely ignored in the economics literature and could affect the interpretation of estimates of the effect of prenatal shocks and that of gender in other applied economics contexts. This paper analyzes the effect of in utero exposure to a shock - civil conflict in Nepal - on (i) fetal loss, and (ii) gender and (iii) health at birth. Maternal fixed effects estimates show that exposed pregnancies are more likely to result in a miscarriage and in a female birth, but exposed newborns are neither smaller nor more subject to neonatal mortality.

Finally, the analysis of factors implicating surveyed tourists' behaviors and expectations (like level of education and financial status) was made. The research with use of the polling technique was made in summer of 2013 and included 45 participants (tourists) in age of 55 or higher, resting in rural accommodation objects near Kampinos National Park. Identification of preferences and behaviors of people resting in valuable natural areas is crucial to the improvement and adaptation of tourist accommodation offer to the level expected by particular market segments. Such research is also important for authorities of the local communities, as well as people planning touristic and recreational development in valuable natural areas.

After verifying that the modified BA model is more accurately to interpret the formation mechanism of a collaborative innovation network, this paper suggests that collaborative innovation network on engineering project have their own distinctive characteristics: relativity between two nodes and attractiveness of one node. The modified BA model are imitated by using programming simulation method, experimental results show the fact that the degree distribution of nodes presents power-law distribution under the affection of relativity and attractive factor. The conclusion assist project participant chooses their cooperation partner in innovation, even design their innovation networks by application of complex networks theory.","[Zhang Rui-xue; Xue Xiao-long] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Zhang, RX (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271065, 71390522]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET-11-0811]; National 12th Five-Year Science & Technology Program, China [2011BAJ10B06, 2012BAJ19B04, 2014BAL05B06]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET)); National 12th Five-Year Science & Technology Program, China","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71271065, 71390522), the Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET-11-0811), the National 12th Five-Year Science & Technology Program, China (2011BAJ10B06, 2012BAJ19B04, 2014BAL05B06)",,33,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1635,1640,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600218,0

Besides, the productivity growth resulted mainly from technical progress, with negative influence of pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency. The publication of Measures for the Administration of Net Capital of Trust Companies by China Banking Regulatory Commission in September, 2010 had promoted the total factor productivity growth of trust industry. Compared with large trust companies, the productivity of small and medium-sized enterprises had made a greater progress. Overall, the expansion rates of most trust companies had exceeded the growth rate of demands, which had caused certain input redundancy.","[Zhang Shao-jie; Ding Ling] Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Zhang, SJ (通讯作者)，Jilin Univ, Sch Management, Changchun 130022, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1277,1283,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600171,0

Methods We conducted a literature review of cost-effectiveness studies in the Hong Kong population related to cancer screening published up to 2015, through a hand search and database search of PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and OVID Medline. Binary data on the government's decisions were obtained from the Cancer Expert Working Group, Department of Health. Mixed-effect logistic regression analysis was used to examine the impact of ICERs on decision making. Using Youden's index, an optimal ICER threshold value for positive decisions was examined by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Eight studies reporting 30 cost-effectiveness pair-wise comparisons of population-based cancer screening were identified. Most studies reported an ICER for a cancer screening strategy versus a comparator with outcomes in terms of cost per life-years (55.6 %), or cost per quality-adjusted life-years (55.6 %). Among comparisons with a mean ICER of US$102,931 (range 800-715,137), the increase in ICER value by 1000 was associated with decreased odds (odds ratio 0.990, 0.981-0.999; p = 0.033) of a positive recommendation. An optimal ICER value of US$61,600 per effectiveness unit yielded a high sensitivity of 90 % and specificity of 85 % for a positive recommendation. A lower ICER threshold value of below US$8044 per effectiveness unit was detected for a positive funding decision. Conclusions Linking published evidence to Government recommendations and practice on cancer screening, ICERs influence decisions on the adoption of health technologies in Hong Kong. The potential ICER threshold for recommendation in Hong Kong may be higher than those of developed countries.","[Wong, Carlos K. H.; Guo, Vivian Y. W.; Lam, Cindy L.

Exploiting the sudden and unexpected collapse of the Icelandic economy, I find that first-trimester exposure to the crisis led to a sizable and significant reduction in birth weight, increased the probability of a low birth weight (<2500 g), and decreased the probability of a high birth weight (>4000 g). I also find evidence that the collapse reduced the sex ratio, indicating selection in utero due to maternal prenatal stress exposure. My results imply large welfare losses from financial distress that have hitherto been ignored - because children with worse health at birth can expect substantially lower lifetime earnings - and suggest that economic hardships may in general exacerbate income inequalities in the long run as low-income households are typically more exposed to financial distress.

The changes in copayments and in the regulation of the provision of free patient transportation, introduced in early 2012 in Portugal, provide a natural experiment to evaluate that impact. However, those changes in user costs were accompanied with changes in the criteria that determine which patients are exempt from copayments, implying that simple comparisons of user rates would be biased. In this paper, we develop a new methodology to evaluate the impact of increases in direct and indirect user costs on the demand for emergency services (ES) in the presence of compositional changes in co-payment exempt and non-exempt populations. Our results show that the increase in copayments did not have an effect in moderating ES demand by paying users, but we find significant effects of the change in transport regulation. Thus, our results support the conclusion that indirect costs may be more important than direct costs in determining healthcare demand in NHS-countries where copayments are small and wide exemption schemes are in place, especially for older patients.
