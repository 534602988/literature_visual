Worldwide proven oil, gas and coal reserves are 1688 billion barrels (Bb), 6558 trillion cubic feet (TCF) and 891 billion tons (Bt) being consumed at rates of 0.092 Bb, 0.329 TCF and 7.89 BT per day, respectively. The oil, gas and coal reserves are increasing at the rate of 600 million barrels (Mb), 400 billion cubic feet (BCF) and 19.2 Giga tons of oil equivalents (GTOE) per year. While the rate of annual increase in consumption of oil, gas and coal is 1.4 Mb, 4.5 BCF and 3.1 million tons (Mt). Global annual energy demand of over 12 billion tons of oil equivalent (BTOE) results in the emission of 39.5 Giga tons of carbon dioxide (Gt-CO2), and the annual CO2 emission would increase up to 75 Gt-CO2 when future energy demand will rise to 24-25 BTOE. Oil, gas and coal may continue to exist for next several decades, yet the energy transition to low carbon intensity fuels is necessary to cope with rampant climate change. Renewable and alternative energy sources hold key to the solution of twin problems, energy and climate change, with a high initial investment. Transition from fossil fuels to sustainable and renewable energy resources of 150 Petawatt hours (PWh) requires major investment and innovatory technologies. Perhaps CO2 and H2O based fuel systems would facilitate climate change and grand energy transition. An energy mix consisting of fossil fuels, hydrogen, bio-fuels, and renewable energy sources seems to be a good initiative. This paper reviews evidence of hydrocarbons decline scenarios and timelines of future energy technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The identification of a differentiated attribute is key for the success of RT initiatives. This often involves a collective action and a self-discovery process. As RT is a package of services, complementation among different providers is needed. Hence, public policies may facilitate coordination and cooperation among RT providers. The fact that RT groups are formed by small and micro producers located in rural and often poorly connected areas is the main obstacle for innovation.

Firms compete in prices and may signal their environmental performance to uninformed consumers through prices. I also analyze the effect of an expected liability on firms in this setting. Compared to full information, incomplete information generates higher strategic incentive to invest in cleaner technology particularly when consciousness and/or expected liability are not too high. Requiring mandatory disclosure of technology or environmental performance may discourage such investment. Even though consumers and the regulator are uninformed, competition has a positive effect (relative to monopoly) on the incentive to invest. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Furthermore, increasing interest of stakeholders in various forestry goods and services requires dealing comprehensively with the potentials of multifunctional forestry. In fact, forest enterprises may be engaged not only in providing a range of forestry-based outputs but also with ventures unrelated to forests. Nevertheless, there is still little empirical evidence concerning the economic significance of diversification. Established economic monitoring schemes traditionally concentrate on timber production. Political interest and forest certification are typically restricted to forest-based activities. In this paper, the empirical evidence regarding auxiliary activities as documented by the Austrian accountancy network of larger forest enterprises is appraised for the first time. A set of economic key figures can be derived for a considerable range of activities. On average, timber production is still dominating by far, other activities contributing in total only to an equivalent of some 2.5% of the timber profits. A range of methodical limitations associated with the data collected so far underpin the necessity to interpret results prudently. Several amendments are identified which could substantially improve the significance of the empirical investigations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article examines whether theoretical expectations of cost efficiency gains can be empirically confirmed. In contrast to previous studies, the analysis of hospitals in Switzerland provides a comparison of a retrospective per diem payment system with a prospective global budget and a payment per patient case system. Using a sample of approximately 90 public financed Swiss hospitals during the years 2004-2009 and Bayesian inference of a standard and a random parameter frontier model, cost efficiency gains are found, particularly with payment per patient case. Prospective payment, designed to put hospitals at operating risk, is more effective in terms of cost reduction than the retrospective alternative. However, hospitals are heterogeneous with respect to their production technologies, making a random parameter frontier model the superior specification for Switzerland.","[Widmer, Philippe K.] Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland; [Widmer, Philippe K.] Polynomics Inc, Olten, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Widmer, PK (通讯作者)，Univ Zurich, Dept Econ, Hottingerstr 10, CH-8032 Zurich, Switzerland.",philippe.widmer@econ.uzh.ch,,,,,,,39,13,15,1,28,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

But the SCM Article 3 claim by Japan and the European Union remains unadjudicated, because neither tribunal made a finding that the price guaranteed for electricity from renewable sources constitutes a 'benefit' pursuant to the SCM Agreement. Although the Appellate Body provides useful guidance to future Panels on how the existence of a benefit could be calculated, the most noteworthy aspect of the new jurisprudence is the Appellate Body's reasoning that delineating the proper market for 'benefit' analysis entails respect for the policy choices made by a government.

However, the discourse on 'management innovation' attributes a curious dual function to the concept of management. On the one hand, management is portrayed as the 'toxin' that can impede innovation. But on the other hand, management is portrayed the 'cure' that will heal the defects that prevents innovation. Informed by Derrida's reflection upon the dual meaning of pharmakon, a word that means both 'remedy' and 'poison', the paper engages with Hamel's popular management handbook The Future of Management. Although Hamel attempts to establish a clear-cut distinction between those principles of management that obstruct and those that facilitate innovation, one is ultimately left uncertain whether management is a cure or A poison for innovation. This ambivalence points to an underlying paradox of contemporary post-managerial thinking that is characterized by incorporating transgression into its productive logic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Data came from the 2004 to 2010 Household Budget Survey. Catastrophic health spending was defined by health payments as percentage of household consumption expenditures and capacity to pay at a set of thresholds. The poverty impact was evaluated by poverty head counts and poverty gaps before and after OOP health payments. The percentage of households that catastrophically spent their consumption expenditure and capacity to pay increased from 2004 to 2010, regardless of the threshold used. Households with a share of more than 40 % health spending in both consumption expenditure and capacity to pay accounted for less than 1 % across years. However, when a series of potential confounders were taken into account, the study found statistically significantly increased risk for the lowest threshold and decreased risk for the highest threshold in 2010 relative to the base year. Household income, size, education, senior and under 5-year-old members, health insurance, disabled members, payment for inpatient care and settlement were also statistically significant predictors of catastrophic health spending. Overall, poverty head counts were below 1 %. Poverty gaps reached a maximum of 0.098 %, with an overall increase in 2010 compared to 2004. Catastrophe and poverty increased from 2004 to 2010. However, given that the realization of some recent policies will affect the financial burden of OOP payments on households, the findings of this study need to be replicated.","[Narci, Hacer Ozgen] Acibadem Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Management, Istanbul, Turkey; [Sahin, Ismet; Yuldirm, Hasan Huseyin] Hacettepe Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Healthcare Management, Ankara, Turkey",Acibadem University; Hacettepe University,"Narci, HÖ (通讯作者)，Acibadem Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Dept Hlth Management, Istanbul, Turkey.",Hacer.Narci@acibadem.edu.tr,"Özgen Narcı, Hacer/ADH-2166-2022; Şahin, İsmet/AAM-9017-2021","Özgen Narcı, Hacer/0000-0002-5666-2172; Şahin, İsmet/0000-0003-0878-5669",Hacettepe University,Hacettepe University(Hacettepe University),Hacettepe University funded this study as a project for the years 2004-2008.

In this article, we intend to analyze the effect of the reform process in Korean companies. We show that the decrease in controlling shareholder ownership, the increase in the ownership rates of institutional investors and foreign investors, and the increased ratio of outside directors are related to the increase in stock repurchase amount and dividend payout. The increase in stock repurchase and dividend payout represents the shareholder-friendly behaviors of Korean firms after the crisis. It is shown that governance reform efforts in Korea have at least increased the shareholder-friendly behaviors of the companies. However, after the crisis, Korean firms increased cash holdings by reducing research and development (R&D) investments and utilized increased cash holdings to pay stock repurchase and dividends. This raises the question of whether shareholder-friendly management resulting from governance reform was only an institutional isomorphism from responding passively to outside pressure.","[Kim, Jootae] Dankook Univ, Cheonan, South Korea; [Oh, Kum-Sik] Univ Huddersfield, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, W Yorkshire, England",Dankook University; University of Huddersfield,"Kim, J (通讯作者)，119 Dandae Ro, Cheonan 330714, Chungnam, South Korea.",jkim@dankook.ac.kr,,,,,,,62,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

This article addresses this question with reference to attitudes towards redistributive tax policy. In doing so, it identifies an important distinction between preferences over the level of taxation and preferences over its structure. Using individual-level survey data from 17 advanced industrial countries, I find 'decoupling' of pro-redistributive attitudes over the size versus the shape of government. The modal respondent prefers higher progressivity (more redistribution) but lower tax levels (less redistribution). Further, this decoupling varies across countries: preferences over tax levels have a greater effect on progressivity preferences in less progressive tax systems. I examine how theories of redistribution preferences help understand this disconnect, and show that income and risk affect progressivity preferences as they do attitudes towards redistribution. In contrast, trust affects preferences over tax levels in the same way as it affects redistribution preferences.","[Barnes, Lucy] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Barnes, Lucy] Univ Kent, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Oxford; University of Kent,"Barnes, L (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",lucy.c.barnes@gmail.com,,"Barnes, Lucy/0000-0002-6403-6657","Nuffield College, Oxford","Nuffield College, Oxford","Nuffield College, Oxford provided financial and intellectual support as this work was completed during a Prize Postdoctoral Fellowship there.",,62,48,51,2,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The empirical part of the work is based on the testing corpus, which consists of 20 written interviews with entrepreneurs, collected from magazines, newspapers and downloaded from the Internet. At each interview, a total of 27 variables related to linguistic behavior were questioned. The study evaluates the types of arguments used by entrepreneurs of Croatian and German national identity. Also, a great attention is paid to the structure of the argumentation processes. The results showed that only certain parts of the linguistic behavior mentioned in the theoretical part can actually be attributed to women or men, thus the style of leadership which they belong, and whether the results are identical according to the national identity of respondents.","[Borcic, Nikolina] Univ Appl Sci VERN, Zagreb, Croatia; [Prusina, Jurica] Atlas LtD, Zagreb, Croatia; [Despot, Jelena] Gimnazija Karlovac, Karlovac, Croatia",,"Borcic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci VERN, Zagreb, Croatia.",nikolina.borcic@vern.hr; jurica.prusina@atlas.hr; jelenadespot@rocketmail.com,,,,,,,20,0,0,1,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,558,567,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000051,0

However, their use is associated with vascular calcification and an increased mortality risk. The aim of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of second-line Lanthanum Carbonate (LC) treatment in patients not responding to CB (calcium carbonate and calcium acetate). Material and methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed considering three health states (predialysis, dialysis and death). Transitions between states and efficacy data were obtained from randomized clinical trials and the European Dialysis and Transplant Association Annual report. Mortality rate was adjusted with the relative risk related to serum phosphorus levels. According to the Spanish healthcare system perspective, only medical direct costs were considered. Dialysis costs (2013 prices in Euros) were obtained from diagnosis-related groups. Drug costs were derived from ex-factory prices, adjusted with 7.5% mandatory rebate. Quality of life estimates were based on a published systematic review. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. Results: At the end of simulation, costs per patient with LC therapy were (sic)1,169 and (sic)5,044 with CB alone. 4.653 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were gained per patient treated with LC, and 4.579 QALYs with CB. CB therapy is dominated by the LC strategy (i.e. lower costs, higher QALYs). Assuming a (sic)30,000/QALY threshold, LC was dominant in 100% of PSA simulations. Conclusions: LC is a cost-effective second line treatment of hyperphosphatemia in CKD patients irrespective of dialysis status in Spain.","[Gros, Blanca; Echave, Maria; Oyagueez, Itziar] Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res Iberia PORIB, Madrid, Spain; [Galan, Antonio] Consorcio Hosp Gen Univ, Nephrol Dept, Valencia, Spain; [Gonzalez-Parra, Emilio] Hosp Fdn Jimenez Diaz, Nephrol Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Herrero, Jose A.] Hosp Clin San Carlos, Nephrol Dept, Madrid, Spain; [Vegter, Stefan] Univ Groningen, Dept Pharm, Unit Pharmacoepidemiol & Pharmacoecon PE, Groningen, Netherlands; [Tolley, Keith] Tolley Hlth Econ Ltd, Buxton, England",Fundacion Jimenez Diaz; Hospital Clinico San Carlos; University of Groningen,"Oyagüez, I (通讯作者)，Pharmacoecon & Outcomes Res Iberia PORIB, Madrid, Spain.",ioyaguez@porib.com,"Oyagüez, Itziar/L-2185-2019","Oyagüez, Itziar/0000-0002-3047-6152",Shire Pharmaceuticals Spain,Shire Pharmaceuticals Spain,"This project was supported with an unrestricted grant from Shire Pharmaceuticals Spain.

Approach/methodology - The analysis of the evolution of the main macroeconomic indicators was based on time series from 2002-2013, 2005-2012. The data was analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and correlations. Results - According to the analysis made, we can observe the following aspects: a growth of GDP, based on an important growth of indirect taxes, a slight growth of the active and occupied population and, also a growth of the number of unemployed persons registered in 2012, compared to 2011. However, the number of active enterprises on the market registered a slow ascendant trend, while the percentage of newly set up enterprises is going down. Also, a decrease is registered by the indicator, the value of investments made by the enterprises. Using the correlations, we could establish a connection between the number of enterprises from Romania and the number of active persons, on one hand and, on the other hand, between the monthly net nominal salary and turnover registered by the enterprises, these last two indicators having an ascendant trend during the reference period. Originality - Based on the obtained results, the authors propose a XIIIth element to the competitiveness pillars of the model proposed by Schwab (2014) and this is: number of active enterprises within an economy, together with other proposals for the competitive growth.","[Marcu, Nicu] Romanian Acad, Bucharest, Romania; [Meghisan, Georgeta-Madalina] Univ Craiova, Craiova, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; University of Craiova,"Marcu, N (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Bucharest, Romania.",marcu.nicu@yahoo.com; madalina_meghisan@yahoo.com,"Meghisan-Toma, Georgeta-Madalina/ABE-7789-2021; Meghisan-Toma, Madalina/B-6944-2012",,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,17,24,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200003,0

One of the possible approaches that include an uncertainty into cooperative games is the fuzzy-sets approach. This approach expect that players knows a degree of membership of specific expected payoffs.

The study is based on a survey, which was carried out as a telephone interview. The main question is whether a buyer is satisfied with the implementation of the sale and purchased product. The survey results confirm, that a majority of respondents is satisifed with the sales method and is up to buy any other product of the company. Among the objectives of the measurement of customer satisfaction, the most important for the company, is maintaining the contact with customers and expanding sales. There is a correlation between established innovation and customer satisfaction. There is also a correlation between customer satisfaction and his loyalty. More, as the company considers how to innovate the selling process, what will bring better perception of customer's needs and satisfying the identified needs, the more it can increase the market share and thereby the profits of the company. Basic finding of this article is that introduced innovation into the sales process had positive impact on the customer satisfaction, with existing, as well as with new customers. Customers, because of theirs current satisfaction with a way of selling and satisfaction with product, indicate they are willing to buy also other kinds of products of the company.","[Ostrez, Peter] Fak Komercialne & Poslovne Vede, Celje, Slovenia",,"Ostrez, P (通讯作者)，Fak Komercialne & Poslovne Vede, Celje, Slovenia.",peter.ostrez@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,421,426,,,,,,6,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000038,0

Seven Central American continental countries (in alphabetical order: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama) with 41.5 mil inhabitants are located between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in a territory of 522,300 km(2) with more than 13 mil head of cattle kept on 485,237 establishments. More than 70% of the population lives in rural areas where consumption of unpasteurised milk and milk products from unpasteurised or non-heat-treated milk is common. From this viewpoint, milk contaminated by the causal agent of bovine tuberculosis represents high risk for human infections (especially for children). Based on the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) data the epidemiological situation was analysed during the last decade (2003-2012). Bovine tuberculosis was diagnosed in six countries (except of Belize which is officially free of bovine tuberculosis in cattle) in a total of 642 herds (0.132%). Higher prevalence of infected cattle herds with bovine tuberculosis was found in Costa Rica (0.237%), El Salvador (0.267%), and Guatemala (0.221%). The last outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis were diagnosed in Belize in 1991 and in Panama in 2008. These results represent risks for trade with cattle and dairy and beef products and negative economic impact. The consumption of not properly heat-treated food (meat, milk, meat, and milk products) should be considered as highly risky. Infected humans are disabled to work and their treatment is expensive as well.","[Pavlik, Ivo; Niebauerova, Daniela] Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Tr Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Pavlik, I (通讯作者)，Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Tr Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",ivo.pavlik@mendelu.cz; xniebaue@mendelu.cz,"Pavlik, Ivo/P-5887-2014","Pavlik, Ivo/0000-0002-5771-3381",,,,,31,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,825,831,,,,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800078,0

These events have undoubtedly influenced the overall financial and economic situation of Slovak agriculture producers, as well as their ability to lead prosperous businesses. Generally, the Slovak agriculture tends to be low profitable, unstable and risky sector. It can be subjected to several reasons and factors affecting the production, income, and welfare. In the previous studies several authors focused on identification of financial ratios that decide about successful performance of businesses, and determined their critical values. Moreover, there were constructed classification and prediction models of financial distress. The financial factors impact on the financial distress in the case of Slovak agriculture companies has been analysed in the scientific papers of Chrastinova (1998), Gurcik (2002), Bielikova et al. (2014), and others. However, only a few authors paid attention to the non-financial factors. Therefore, the sufficient evidence of their impact on agriculture companies ' prosperity is missing. There are factors in the agriculture that may not be influenced by the producers themselves, such as climate conditions and weather. However, we assume that number of decisions made by farmers can lead to more effective production, profitability and risk elimination. In the previous studies was investigated mainly the impact of legal form, organisational and size structure on the performance of farms (Lancaric et al., 2013; Ciaian et al., 2009; Kopta, 2013). Generally, the non-financial factors impact on different businesses was emphasised in the works of Cumby and Condor (2001), Khizer et al. (2011) and others. We decided to extend the previous studies and investigate, what are the key factors of prosperity, except of the financial results and ratios. The analysis will be applied on the 842 farms operating during each year of the period 2009-2012 in all regions of Slovakia. We will create sample of prosperous and unprosperous companies and analyses them according to their legal form, production orientation, size of utilized agriculture area UAA (LPIS) and number of owners and employees. With the use the linear discriminant analysis and decision trees we will try to find the non-financial factors, which determine the successful performance of farms in agriculture primary sector.

It is a discipline with a huge potential in the future because nowadays, when managers are given more responsibility, more requests on effectiveness and expertise, it is inevitable to understand the act of time management. The basic principles of time management of activities are to learn to plan the writing form, the most important tasks should be done as first, to learn how to delegate, omit disturbance and do not have all the day filled with planning. If a manager applies in his job the principles of time management, he should remember the following principles as well: understand the orders of seniors, ask for clear goals and measureable evaluation of work effectiveness, do not accept goals he knows he cannot reach, prepare a time plan to reach the goals, include the subordinates into planning, organize regular meetings to keep the continuity of planning and resources of the organization. The objective of the paper was to analyze effectiveness of managerial work on the middle level management and to elaborate suggestions for improvement of their activities. To fulfill the objective we had to follow several steps. Firstly, it was important to study the literature necessary for understanding the principals and relationships within time management. Based on this knowledge we elaborated series of questionnaires which were then handed over to the managers on the middle level management in selected set of 25 small and medium sized food processing companies of Kosice region. 4 questionnaires were elaborated, each intended on a different area of time management. The first one identified the basic activities of managers and time dedicated to these activities. The second one supplemented this information with the analysis of importance and relevance of certain activities. Based on the results we were able to identify key activities of a manager and recommend which activities are more important, which activities should be delegated which activities should be postponed or simply ignored. The next two questionnaires were intended to analyze the activities which waste the manager's time and do not bring the manager any benefit as for the results of their work. In this case our effort was to identify these activities and subsequently generalize them to be able to elaborate the overall picture of the time waste factors. We also found out that the managers have a positive attitude to their companies what positively influences the corporate culture.","[Sajbidorova, Maria; Lusnakova, Zuzana; Hrda, Veronika] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Sajbidorová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",maria.sajbidorova@uniag.sk; z.lusnakova@gmail.com; veronika.hrda@uniag.sk,"Lušňáková, Zuzana/AAL-8249-2020","Lušňáková, Zuzana/0000-0001-6331-9930",,,,,7,0,0,0,13,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,937,947,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800090,0

And with which audiences, and through which judicial means does the WTO DSS try to communicate in order to sustain its legitimacy? Empirical evidence generated through semi-structured interviews with WTO practitioners demonstrate that since its inception, the interstate WTO DSS has been engaged in a continuing quest for legitimacy amidst multiple audiences, well beyond WTO Member States, This quest prominent in the dispute-category known as 'trade-and' disputes has manifested itself in both the thetorical, procedural, and substantive judicial choices taken by WTO adjudicators. Also, this quest has not been static, but rather dynamic in nature, whereas in response to some audiences' demands, jurisprudential, procedural and rhetorical readjustments have been made along the way. The article demonstrates these assertions through discursive analysis of the recent US-Clove Cigarettes dispute, while revisiting several earlier jurisprudential milestones on the DSS' road to legitimacy. Coupling this analysis with insiders' views, the article sheds a novel empirical light on how the DSS' legitimacy challenges in 'trade-and' disputes are experienced 'from within', and the manner in which they are subsequently weaved into the choices taken by WTO adjudicators in their strategic judicial space. [M]ost adjudicators have a sense at an intuitive level as to what the main elements of 'legitimacy' are. One would be transparency, due process... consistency with existing case law, like arguments being treated the same way.... And one of those things... would be understanding the audience... knowing who the audience is for a particular type of decision and drafting the decision, at least stylistically in some respects, in a way that the audience will perceive it as being legitimate, and the audience for a dumping case will be different from the audience for US-Clove Cigarettes.","[Shlomo-Agon, Sivan] NYU, Sch Law, Jean Monnet Ctr Int & Reg Econ Law & Justice, New York, NY 10003 USA; [Shlomo-Agon, Sivan] Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Law, ERC GlobalTrust Project, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",New York University; Tel Aviv University,"Shlomo-Agon, S (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Law, Jean Monnet Ctr Int & Reg Econ Law & Justice, New York, NY 10003 USA.;Shlomo-Agon, S (通讯作者)，Tel Aviv Univ, Sch Law, ERC GlobalTrust Project, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",sivanshlomo@gmail.com,,,,,,,157,7,7,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In Quantum physics, Heisenberg Principle of Uncertainty states that we cannot know the exact position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. In time frequency domain, Heisenberg Principle states that we cannot exactly know information about time and frequency simultaneously. Time delta multiplied by frequency delta is greater than some arbitrary constant. This restriction has different consequences in Fourier transformation and Wavelet transformation, which is more suitable for non-stationary times series analysis. Wavelets fits into this principle because a basic Wavelet is characterized by short time and high frequency. However, when the Wavelet is stretched then it has longer time and lower frequency. This principle is inherent in the nature of things and has nothing to do with numerical precision of the Wavelet analysis.

For doing so, we develop a new intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operator called the intuitionistic fuzzy induced ordered weighted averaging standardized distance (IFIOWASD) operator,. which provides a wide range of intuitionistic fuzzy standardized distance measures between the maximum and the minimum. The main advantage of the IFIOWASD is that it is able to reflect the complex attitudinal character of the decision maker by using order inducing variables and provide much more complete information for decision making. Moreover, it is able to deal with uncertain environments where the information is very imprecise that can be assessed with intuitionistic fuzzy information. We study some of the IFIOWASD's different particular case.

Traditionally, forest harvesting policies have intended to limit maximum clear-cut areas, leading to harvesting fragmentation, and have thus reduced interior forest habitat and negatively affected operational efficiency. Aiming to address this issue, the main goals of this study were i) to propose approaches to include harvesting connectivity into a forest planning model, and ii) to evaluate the impacts of enforcing connectivity on the economic outcomes of the forest. We applied two approaches for clustering forest harvesting: (i) a model based on the Minimum Span-ning Tree problem for enforcing harvesting connectivity and (ii) a Simulated Annealing approach for simultaneous consideration of harvesting stands connectivity and wood flow. The optimization process could reduce the average harvesting radius from 4575.8 up to 2300.5 m and increase the average area of harvesting blocks from 22.4 up to 157.4 ha. However, this solution would marginally reduce the net present values (from 3.9% to 15.4%) compared to the base scenario, without the inclusion of connectivity requirements and depending on the level of enforced connectivity.

To what extent, however, is the labour market absorbing and fully utilising these capabilities? Drawing on data from a recent cohort of PhD graduates, we examine the correlates and consequences of qualification and skills mismatch. We show that job characteristics such as economic sector and main work activity play a fundamental and direct role in explaining the phenomenon of mismatch, experienced as overeducation and overskilling. Academic attributes operate mostly indirectly in explaining this mismatch, since their effect loses importance once we control for job-related characteristics. We detected a significant earnings penalty for those who are both overeducated and overskilled. Being mismatched reduces satisfaction with the job as a whole and with non-monetary aspects of the job, especially for those whose skills are underutilised. Overall, the problem of mismatch among PhD graduates is closely related to the demand-side constraints of the labour market. Increasing the number of adequate jobs and broadening the job skills that PhD students acquire during training should be explored as possible responses.","[Di Paolo, Antonio] Univ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; [Mane, Ferran] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain",University of Barcelona; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Mañé, F (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, Avinguda Univ 1, Reus 43202, Spain.",ferran.mane@urv.cat,"Di Paolo, Antonio/F-1800-2015","Di Paolo, Antonio/0000-0003-0000-7301","Spanish Ministry of Education [ECO2013-41022-R, ECO2013-42884-P]",Spanish Ministry of Education(Spanish Government),This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education (ECO2013-41022-R; ECO2013-42884-P).,,31,39,41,0,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of linaclotide compared to antidepressants for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe IBS-C who have previously received antispasmodics and/or laxatives. A Markov model was created to estimate costs and QALYs over a 5-year time horizon from the perspective of NHS Scotland. Health states were based on treatment satisfaction (satisfied, moderately satisfied, not satisfied) and mortality. Transition probabilities were based on satisfaction data from the linaclotide pivotal studies and Scottish general all-cause mortality statistics. Treatment costs were calculated from the British National Formulary. NHS resource use and disease-related costs for each health state were estimated from Scottish clinician interviews in combination with NHS Reference costs. Quality of life was based on EQ-5D data collected from the pivotal studies. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5 % per annum. Uncertainty was explored through extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Over a 5-year time horizon, the additional costs and QALYs generated with linaclotide were 659 pound and 0.089, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 7370 pound per QALY versus antidepressants. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the likelihood that linaclotide was cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 20,000 pound per QALY was 73 %. Linaclotide can be a cost-effective treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe IBS-C who have previously received antispasmodics and/or laxatives in Scotland.","[Fisher, Mark] WG Consulting Healthcare Ltd, High Wycombe, Bucks, England; [Walker, Andrew] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland; [Falques, Meritxell; Moya, Miguel; Lindner, Leandro] Almirall SA, Gen Mitre 151, Barcelona 08022, Spain; [Rance, Mark] Almirall Ltd, London, England; [Taylor, Douglas] Ironwood Pharmaceut, Cambridge, MA USA","University of Glasgow; Almirall; Almirall; Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Lindner, L (通讯作者)，Almirall SA, Gen Mitre 151, Barcelona 08022, Spain.",leandro.lindner@almirall.com,,,"Almirall, S.A.","Almirall, S.A.(Almirall)","Miguel Moya, Meritxell Falques, Mark Rance, and Leandro Lindner are/were employees of Almirall, S.A.

Due to the variety of existing methods, it is challenging to define an appropriate method for each decision problem. This study demonstrates the impact of the non-standardized Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method on priorities, and compares it with Best-Worst-Scaling (BWS) and ranking card methods. Methods: We investigated AHP results for different Consistency Ratio (CR) thresholds, aggregation methods, and sensitivity analyses. We also compared criteria rankings of AHP with BWS and ranking cards results by Kendall's tau b. Results: The sample for our decision analysis consisted of 39 patients with rare diseases and mean age of 53. 82 years. The mean weights of the two groups of CR <= 0.1 and CR <= 0.2 did not differ significantly. For the aggregation by individual priority (AIP) method, the CR was higher than for aggregation by individual judgment (AIJ). In contrast, the weights of AIJ were similar compared to AIP, but some criteria's rankings differed. Weights aggregated by geometric mean, median, and mean showed deviating results and rank reversals. Sensitivity analyses showed instable rankings. Moderate to high correlations between the rankings resulting from AHP and BWS. Limitations: Limitations were the small sample size and the heterogeneity of the patients with different rare diseases. Conclusion: In the AHP method, the number of included patients is associated with the threshold of the CR and choice of the aggregation method, whereas both directions of influence could be demonstrated. Therefore, it is important to implement standards for the AHP method. The choice of method should depend on the trade-off between the burden for participants and possibilities for analyses.","[Schmidt, Katharina; Babac, Ana; Pauer, Frederic; Damm, Kathrin; von der Schulenburg, J-Matthias] Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany; [von der Schulenburg, J-Matthias] German Ctr Lung Res DZL, Biomed Res Endstage & Obstruct Lung Dis Hannover, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Schmidt, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, CHERH, Otto Brenner Str 1, D-30159 Hannover, Germany.",ks@cherh.de,,,Open Access fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,Open Access fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover,The publication of this article was funded by the Open Access fund of Leibniz Universitat Hannover.,,41,16,18,1,7,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

However, there have been policy inconsistencies, conflicts, and even maladaptions such as harvest restrictions, taking of devolved forestland without fair compensation, lack of flexibility in local execution, and a rush to forming co-ops. Building on recent research advances, this paper attempts to further elucidate practical solutions to these challenges. The authors argue that the stake is high to address these challenges in a timely manner, and that effective and coherent resolutions to them are urgently needed. To that end, it is essential to better understand the institutional economics in regard to property rights, collective action, transaction costs, and governance, and to better understand the primary features of forest ecosystems and forestry as well as the rural society of China. It is hoped that this effort will contribute to the continued discussion and more effective implementation of the forest devolution and institutional transition in China and elsewhere.

An internal Critical Infrastructure model can be used as a core part of a number of larger models, each of which is tailored to a specific disaster in a specific location. We have shown that this collaborative modeling methodology is able to allow a group of professionals in Emergency Management to develop a single model exhibiting their collective viewpoints on interactions of Critical Infrastructure conditions. We demonstrate how to deal with conflicting views when we have people with different backgrounds and geographic origins. This research might be used as a reference in different contexts and by different groups for supporting emergency plans and risk analysis.

To identify the channels, we study the effects on GDP aggregates. Our findings suggest that credit expansion held back consumption growth by claiming resources for investment in gross capital formation and net exports. This effect is stronger with more rapid credit growth.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted among forest related professionals, followed by an in-depth qualitative analysis. The results show the importance of managing forests for several forest functions simultaneously within one area, indicating the suitability of the integrative approach. Moreover, it was affirmed that forest biomass for energy should not be the main goal of forest management, but rather a by-product of other goals. Its use is driven by a set of policy instruments interrelated with external factors, the most important of which are economic instruments and the market, respectively. From this perspective, interviewees recognised the role of government as essential in the development of the bioenergy sector in Slovenia. Value chains in combination with educational activities offer a suitable answer for coordinating various wood uses.

The application of this obligation is subject to the fulfilment of cumulative conditions that are subject to interpretation. This has raised numerous issues regarding both the scope of application and requirements of Article XVII GATS.

It examines whether the adoption of 'good regulatory practices' in accordance with the TPP will help to ensure that measures states enact to protect non-economic interests (such as the environment or public health) are consistent with other key obligations of international trade and investment law.

We find a positive and statistically significant relationship between temperature and international outmigration only in the most agricultUre-dependent countries, consistent with the widely documented adverse impact of temperature on agricultural productivity. Further, the temperature migration relationship is nonlinear and resembles the nonlinear temperature-yield relationship. In addition, migration flows to current major destinations are especially temperature-sensitive. Policies to address issues related to climate-induced international migration would be more efficient if focused on the agriculture-dependent countries and especially people in those countries whose livelihoods depend on agriculture.

Spain was the third country in the world (after the Netherlands and Belgium) to introduce a law recognizing homosexual marriage and the adoption of children by homosexual couples. In this paper, we examine for the first time whether schools are more hesitant about giving feedback to homosexual parents during children's pre-registration period in Catalonia (Spain). To do so, we designed a correspondence experiment to be conducted in schools. We created three types of fictitious couples one heterosexual, one gay, and one lesbian and sent emails to schools in which the couples' sexual orientation was explicit. Our results show that gay couples had a significantly lower (22 percentage points) call-back probability than heterosexual couples. No statistically significant differences in call-back probability were found between the lesbian and heterosexual couples. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper we present a forest sector transportation model of the three Canadian Prairie Provinces, and use the model to estimate residual fibre production, utilization and surpluses, as well as some potential forest sector impacts from bioenergy capacity additions. Under our base-case assumptions and using 2010 product prices, we estimate that 6.9 million cubic meters (round-wood equivalent) of processing residuals would be traded over the course of a year, with sawmills being the most significant source and pulp and paper mills being the most significant user. Approximately 33% of residuals would be used to produce bioenergy-related products (wood pellets, electricity sold to the grid, or internal electricity and power at pulp mills). Results show that some surpluses of processing residuals may be present in the existing supply chain, though the availability of these residuals is sensitive to lumber prices. At the same time, new bioenergy capacity itself may trigger higher sawmill output, making additional fibre available for both new and existing users. Roadside harvesting residuals are not an economically viable source of fibre under our base-case assumptions; however, their viability is sensitive to roadside processing costs and electricity prices.

Methods: Prospective, non-interventional, multicenter, parallel-group study comparing effectivenessand costs of incobotulinumtoxinA (INCO) treatment (n = 118) to conventional (CON) antispastic therapy (n = 110) for upper limb spasticity after stroke in 47 clinical practices across Germany over a 1-year treatment period. IncobotulinumtoxinA was applied according to the individual treatment algorithms of each participating site and additional antispastic treatments were allowed. Primary efficacy objective was the reduction of the muscle tone measured by Ashworth scale. Responder analyses and logistic regressions were performed. Quality of life, measured by SF-12 questionnaire and functional disability were assessed. Besides calculating treatment costs, a cost-utility analysis was performed. Results: Responder rates of all muscle groups of the upper extremities were significantly higher in the treatment group (62.9-86.2 % vs. 15.5-26.9 %, p < 0.01). Total health service costs were twice as high in the INCO group, however cost-utility ratios were consistently superior compared to the control group. Lowest incremental costs were documented to improve the physical health dimension in quality of life. Conclusion: Higher responder rates, higher increases in quality of life and superior cost-utility ratios in the BoNT/A-treatment group underline guideline recommendations for botulinum toxin A treatment in focal or segmental spasticity. Results may partially be influenced by different patient demographics or disease severity at study entry.","[Rychlik, Reinhard; Kreimendahl, Fabian] Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany; [Dressler, Dirk] Hannover Med Sch, Dept Neurol, Movement Disorders Sect, Hannover, Germany; [Schnur, Nicole; Lambert-Baumann, Judith] Merz Pharmaceut, Frankfurt, Germany",Hannover Medical School; Merz Pharmaceuticals GmbH,"Kreimendahl, F (通讯作者)，Inst Empir Hlth Econ, Ziegelfeld 28, D-51399 Burscheid, Germany.",Fabian.Kreimendahl@ifeg.de,,,"Merz Pharmaceuticals Gmbh.

Our findings document a high market responsiveness to political events and reveal how market participants view the evolution of cap stringency in the light of a particular announcement. We provide evidence that a sequence of strong event-induced price drops evolve in the backloading decision process, which is consistent with the interpretation that market participant's confidence in the political support for reform, and probably the EU ETS in general, has been unsettled.

This paper assesses different types of income indicators, such as mean equivalised net income per household, Gini coefficient, unemployment rate, at risk of poverty threshold (60 % of national median), S80/S20 and their effect on mortality. Methods: Using data from the Slovak mortality database 1996-2013, the method of direct standardisation was applied to eliminate variances resulted from differences in age structures of the population across regions and over time. To examine the relationships between income indicators and standardised mortality rates, we used the tools of descriptive statistics and methods of correlation and regression analysis. Results: At first, we show that Slovakia has the worst values of standardised mortality rates for ischemic heart diseases in EU countries. Secondly, mortality rates are significantly higher for males compared with females. Thirdly, mortality rates are improving from Eastern Slovakia to Western Slovakia; additionally, high differences in the results of variability are seen among Slovak regions. Finally, the unemployment rate, the poverty rate and equivalent disposable income were statistically significant income indicators. Conclusions: Main contribution of paper is to demonstrate regional differences between mortality and income inequality, and to point out the long-term unsatisfactory health outcomes.","[Gavurova, Beata; Vagasova, Tatiana] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Gavurová, B (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",beata.gavurova@tuke.sk,"Gavurová, Beáta/N-9159-2018","Gavurová, Beáta/0000-0002-0606-879X",VEGA Project [1/0929/14],VEGA Project(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This work was supported by the VEGA Project No. 1/0929/14 Multidimensional economic and financial evaluation of the implementation process and the use of 1 day health care and quantification of the financial impact on the health care system in the Slovak Republic.,,34,31,31,1,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Using the 2008-10 MEPS Insurance Component augmented with information from other sources, we generate new estimates of employers' price-sensitivity of offering insurance. Our results suggest that small and medium-size employers are sensitive to changes in the tax price of insurance, with small employers exhibiting the largest price-sensitivity. Workforce composition and local labor market conditions also influence employer offers. With these model estimates, we predict how provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA)-including the employer shared-responsibility requirement, premiumtax credits for exchange-based coverage, and the individual mandate-affect the probability of offering ESI. Findings from this study can inform policy discussions about the implications of ACA provisions as well as subsequent reforms focused on the tax-exempt status of ESI premiums.","[Abraham, Jean M.; Feldman, Roger] Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA; [Graven, Peter] Oregon Hlth & Sci Univ, Ctr Hlth Syst Effectiveness, Portland, OR 97201 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities; Oregon Health & Science University,"Abraham, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Div Hlth Policy & Management, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",abrah042@umn.edu,,,National Institute for Health Care Reform,National Institute for Health Care Reform,We thank the National Institute for Health Care Reform for financial support.

Much of this literature, however, has focused on the relative effect of income on happiness while other factors such as education, marriage, or leisure have received less attention. In this study, I extend this line of inquiry by investigating how individuals' level of education, as well as the average level of education of their reference group, influences their happiness. Using longitudinal data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, I find that, even after controlling for an individual's own education, higher reference group education is associated with lower levels of happiness. More educated people, however, are found to be less affected by social comparison. The panel nature of the HILDA dataset, and additional tests, indicate that the negative association between happiness and reference group education is not driven by people's (changing) interpretations of the happiness scale, self-selection, or the income of their reference group. Additional robustness tests show that the results are not sensitive to variations in the definition of a reference group. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Such expectations and in particular subjective expectations regarding future health-related quality of life remain understudied. The purpose of this study was to investigate individuals' subjective quality adjusted life years (QALYs) expectation from age 65 onwards in a representative sample of the Dutch generic public. A web-based questionnaire was administered to a sample of the adult population from the Netherlands. Information on subjective expectations regarding length and future health-related quality of life were combined into one single measure of subjective expected QALYs from age 65 onwards. This subjective QALY expectation was related to background, health and lifestyle variables. The implications of using different methods to construct our main outcome measure were addressed. Mean subjective expected QALYs from age 65 onwards was 11 QALYs (range -9 to 40 QALYs). Individuals with unhealthier lifestyles, chronic diseases, severe disorders or lower age of death of next of kin reported lower QALY expectations. Indicators were varyingly associated with either subjective life expectancy or future health-related quality of life, or both. Extending the concept of subjective life expectancy by correcting for expected quality of life appears to generate important additional information contributing to our understanding of people's perceptions regarding ageing and lifestyle choices.","[Rappange, David R.; Brouwer, Werner B.

After the crisis of late 1990s, the government declared science and technology (S&T) as one of national priorities and started increasingly investing in this sector but it has not led to the tangible output like a bigger volume of high-tech exports or a higher share of international publications. A number of policy instruments have been introduced to increase the efficiency of STI policies. One of them is S&T Foresight. The activities aimed at identification of national S&T priorities and series of Foresight studies have helped to understand which areas are most promising for sustaining existing competitive advantages and building new ones via gradual shift from the resource-based economy towards the technology-oriented one. The paper presents the design and organisation of a large-scale Russian S&T Foresight exercise as a fully-fledged instrument of the national STI policy and discusses the achieved results and their use for policies at different levels.

Accounting for negative defensive medicine, and insurers' reaction to it, leads to different predictions of the effects of changing malpractice pressure compared to past models. Rising malpractice pressure causes both health care spending and quality to increase up to a threshold, and decrease thereafter. This non-monotonicity implies that malpractice reform is not a silver bullet capable of achieving both cost reductions and quality improvements for all consumers. The results can further explain inconsistent findings in the empirical literature and suggest alternative specifications for estimating the effects of malpractice reform.","[Montanera, Daniel] Georgia State Univ, Inst Hlth Adm, 35 Broad St NW,Suite 805,POB 3988, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Montanera, D (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Inst Hlth Adm, 35 Broad St NW,Suite 805,POB 3988, Atlanta, GA 30302 USA.",dmontanera1@gsu.edu,,"Montanera, Daniel/0000-0002-1324-5061",,,,,62,12,14,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Although there are many possible explanations for this, East Asian teaching methods and curriculum design are two factors to have particularly caught policymakers' attention. Yet there is currently little evidence as to whether any particular East Asian teaching method actually represents an improvement over the status quo in England, and whether such methods can be successfully introduced into Western education systems. This paper provides new evidence on this issue by presenting results from two clustered Randomised Controlled Trials (RCT's), where a Singaporean inspired 'mastery' approach to teaching mathematics was introduced into a selection of England's primary and secondary schools. We find evidence of a modest, positive treatment effect that comes at a relatively low per-pupil cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

On the whole, studying economics appeared to increase beliefs in favor of personal freedom and decrease support for government intervention in markets.

One reason for this might be supply growth of wild species at the total German whitefish market, if market integration exists between farmed and wild-caught whitefish. This article examines market integration between farmed (pangasius and tilapia) and wild-caught (Alaska pollock, cod, and saithe) frozen whitefish in Germany and finds close integration. Hence, prices of frozen pangasius and tilapia fillets in Germany are determined not only by supply of these species, but more importantly by the much larger supplies of wild-caught cod and Alaska pollock. The implication of the presence of market integration is that the small-scale Asian farmers are secured against severe price reductions in Germany arising from farm productivity growth. However, market integration also makes them dependent on quotas and supply of competing wild-caught whitefish.","[Bronnmann, Julia] Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany; [Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac; Nielsen, Max] Univ Copenhagen, Inst Food & Resource Econ, Rolighedsvej 25, DK-1958 Frederiksberg C, Denmark",University of Kiel; University of Copenhagen,"Bronnmann, J (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Agr Econ, Olshausenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",Julia.bronnmann@ae.uni-kiel.de; iay@ifro.ku.dk; max@ifro.ku.dk,"Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/O-3944-2019; Bronnmann, Julia/GPW-6997-2022; Nielsen, max/F-4544-2015","Ankamah-Yeboah, Isaac/0000-0003-4587-8311; Bronnmann, Julia/0000-0003-4149-7589",Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft and Ernahrung; Danish Development Agency [R387-A26778-B17192],Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft and Ernahrung; Danish Development Agency,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the Research Project Systematische Verfahrensoptimierung der Edelfischaufzucht in rezirkulierenden Systemen Aqua-Edel by Bundesanstalt fur Landwirtschaft and Ernahrung.

The CJT consists of two parts, (a) stating that a jury of experts is always more competent than a single expert given a certain level of competence, and (b) asserting that for large juries, the collective competence approaches infallibility. This note argues that these insights suggest the application of a Condorcet jury voting procedure in case of nudging boundedly rational consumers. The note proposes a simple calculus for finding an optimal jury size and advocates consumers' meta-preferences as the jury's evaluative dimension for designing soft paternalistic policies.","[Dold, Malte Frederic] Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Dold, MF (通讯作者)，Albert Ludwig Univ Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.",malte.dold@vwl.uni-freiburg.de,,,,,,,60,0,0,0,1,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,39,58,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_4,0.0,,,20,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500005,0

Recently, the WTO Appellate Body has shed some fresh light on how the NT obligation should be interpreted in EC-Seal Products. The Appellate Body's report on EC-Seal Products and other recent developments in WTO case law have fundamentally reshaped our collective understanding of the NT obligation. The purpose of this article is to take stock of what we have known about the NT obligation in GATT Article III: 4 after EC-Seal Products, as well as identifying some lingering uncertainties. This paper argues that the boundary of the NT obligation in GATT Article III: 4 will be largely determined by how the Appellate Body deals with three big issues identified in this article in future disputes.","[Du, Ming] Univ Lancaster, Sch Law, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England",Lancaster University,"Du, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Sch Law, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",Michael.mingdu@gmail.com,"Du, ming/JAD-2238-2023",,,,,,55,5,6,1,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2016,15,1.0,,,,,139,163,,10.1017/S1474745615000245,0.0,,,25,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372460500007,0

We argue that, rather than being concerned about policymakers' incapacity to raise the population's welfare, we should be concerned about their unwillingness to do so. We offer a solution to this problem. We resort to the constitutional level of decision-making in which voters are able to determine the procedures or processes by which governments may resort to nudging. Nudging should not be considered as an innocuous exception to constitutionally based decision-making. It must be admitted, though, that at first sight most nudges do seem to be beneficial to people.

The base of this paper is the questionnaire data of the private Finnish health care companies. We shed light on one corner of diverse and complex combination of the profitability process in the small companies. Thus, we address that the customer, beside other factors, has an influence on a firm's performance.

Russia can only achieve economic sustainability if it is able to significantly improve the self-sufficiency of its industrial sectors and increase volumes of products manufactured domestically. The authors believe that in the current situation the potential of monocities can and should be leveraged from and the cities should enhance its production using existing infrastructures. The paper substantiates the need for consolidated efforts to put into practice monocity support and development programs, as well as main fields of action to address issues based on regional and industrial specifics of the monocities. The authors have analyzed the efficiency of existing programs on the creation of industrial clusters and priority development territories (PDT). The study has showed that the good use of monocities' potential will help deal with an entire range of goals, such as boosting the economy of the territory and mitigating the depopulation in the regions; increasing the level and quality of life through a better socio-economic infrastructure of monocities and creating new jobs; improving Russia's technology and food sovereignty through the development of corresponding sectors.","[Kirsanova, Natalia Yurievna; Lenkovets, Olga Mikhailovna] St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint Petersburg Mining University,"Kirsanova, NY (通讯作者)，St Petersburg Min Univ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Lenkovets, Olga/AAG-5877-2019","Lenkovets, Olga/0000-0003-4144-1331",,,,,4,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,499,506,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100065,0

On the other hand the volume of this segment shows it should not be neglected. Marketing strategies based on understanding the segment specifics bring both - success to producers and retailers and - satisfaction to consumers. Therefore researching low income segment purchase strategies brings more light into understanding what, how and why. The submitted paper presents results of hybrid research of low income consumer behaviour done in Central European country. The results show what purchase strategies are used by this segment to minimalize the impact of limited income on the overall household consumption. Six different strategies are identified and described in qualitative phase and later some of them are deeper described by quantitative data obtained through quantitative research phase. The paper not only defines the purchasing strategies but also shows the insight how they should be understood to help in planning successful marketing policies of retailers or produces towards this segment.","[Kopanicova, Janka; Klepochova, Dagmar] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Kopanicová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Mkt, Bratislava, Slovakia.",jkopanicova@gmail.com; dklepochova@gmail.com,"Kopanicova, Janka/ABD-7049-2021; Kopanicova, Janka/AAC-9447-2021",,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,238,245,,,,,,8,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100022,0

Economic development is based on three factors: human capital, artificial production facilities, natural resources. In recent decades, natural factor becomes more limited. In 1970s, fundamentally new development concept became necessary due to environmental problem aggravation. Modern social and economic development is technogenic, i.e. nature-intensive, based on artificial production facilities manufactured without due regard to the environmental limits. Technogenic development is characterized by quick depletion of non-renewable resources (mineral resources) and excessive exploitation of renewable resources (soil, wood, etc.), which are unable to be restored in time. National resource degradation and environmental pollution result in substantial economic loss [1, 2]. Technogenic economic development is characterized by significant externalities. In environmental management, these externalities are defined as negative environmental and economic consequences of economic activity, which aren't acknowledged by agents of this activity, because these consequences are predominantly global [3].","[Kovarda, V.

From the research results can be seen that low price discounters and traditional supermarket corporations dominate the retail market and the size of retail chain is not directly proportional to the size of the market share. Some retailers already exist for several decades but there are newly coming retailers to the local markets which are effectively competing against these reputable brands. Total revenues, number of stores and number of employees are compared in five year period to show the evolution since 2010. Chains generally are not focused purely on retail activity; therefore the basis of retail chain strategy should be to determine the conceptual, territorial and assortment framework of the activities. The main factors of innovation performance of retail chains are the financial and informational resources, the openness towards customer needs and their own approach to the innovation.","[Matejovska, Petra] Tech Univ Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Matejovská, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Liberec, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,6,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,609,616,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100080,0

The organization networks have many advantages but also face challenges and problems mainly linked to the complexity of the collaborative environment. One of the main challenges of the organization networks is raised by the inter-organization processes. The complexity of these collaborative processes makes them difficult to model and represent them in a form that can be understood by electronic computing systems. Collaborative processes performance representation, automation and management require a good understanding of collaboration impact on business processes.

Due to the computational complexity of the problem, a hybrid solution procedure based on dynamic programming and simulated annealing is developed to effectively solve it. In the proposed methodology, partial solutions are created by the simulated annealing, and the dynamic programming is applied to complete these partial solutions and evaluate their optimum objective function values.

What determines the level of corruption? This question may be a good starting point in studying this phenomenon since corruption levels vary greatly across countries. For answering to this question and to better understand the relationship between economic factors such as economic growth, inflation, economic freedom and income distribution and the perceived level of corruption, an empirical study is pursued by using a cross - section data on 30 European countries between 2010-2014. Consistent with our predictions, we find that economic development, inflation, economic freedom and income distribution are significantly related to the level of perceived corruption in a country. These findings suggest that in periods of high inflation and skew income distribution, corruption increases. Last but not the least, this study offers an overview of the most relevant drivers of corruption which can be used to build appropriate anti-corruption strategies.","[Tuchilus, Gabriela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Tuchilus, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",tuchilus.gabriela@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,4,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,361,365,,,,,,5,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300057,0

Specifically, tariff reduction, in general, not only encourages the entry into new export markets, but also induces an increase in the volume of renewable energy products already traded. In addition, the positive effects of trade liberalization are more pronounced for foreign-owned exporters than for state-owned or privately-owned exporters. Also, the ways in which trade liberalization promotes exports of renewable energy products differ by the type, destination or origin of the renewable goods being exported.","[Zhao, Yong] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Dept Int Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Lili] Univ Int Business & Econ, Inst Int Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yu, Yihua] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Dept Energy Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; University of International Business & Economics; Renmin University of China,"Yu, YH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Dept Energy Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yihua.yu@ruc.edu.cn,"wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022",,Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Research Funds of Renmin University of China [14XNJ010],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Funds of Renmin University of China,This research was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China (Project No. 14XNJ010).,,41,3,4,2,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Those dropping out of the labour market are typically young, educated women qualified for professional occupations, suggesting a discouragement effect exacerbated by widening gender pay differentials in top occupations.

However, evidence demonstrates an increasing rate of deforestation occurred during the implementation of fiscal policy reforms. Thus, problems persist in the implementation of fiscal policies in the forestry sector. This study evaluates the gap between the rule and the implementation of forest fiscal policy, focusing on regulatory, economic, administrative, and informational instruments. There are four main findings of this study. First, there are several inappropriate and even conflicting regulations concerning local government authorities and forest conservation; second, the lack of coordination among agencies is one of the most important factors causing sub-optimal collection of non-tax state revenues from the forestry sector; third, forest fiscal policies in Indonesia mostly focus on collecting financial benefits from timber rather than preserving ecosystem functions, and; fourth, there is a weak management information system concerning forest fiscal policy. To address the gaps identified in this study, the implementation of green fiscal policy in the forestry sector must provide a comprehensive regulatory framework and improve the capacity of human resources.

Methods In a cross-sectional study, ESRD patients attending a tertiary hospital were interviewed using a battery of questionnaires including the EQ-5D-5L, the kidney disease quality of life instrument (KDQOL-36), and questions assessing dialysis history and socio-demographic characteristics. We reviewed patients' medical records for their clinical information. We assessed the construct validity of the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D index scores and compared their ability to distinguish between patients differing in health status and the magnitude of between-group difference they quantified. Results One hundred and fifty ESRD patients on dialysis (mean age, 60.1 years; female, 48.7 %) participated in the study. Both EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D demonstrated satisfactory known-groups validity; the EQ-5D-5L was more sensitive to differences in clinical outcomes and the SF-6D was more sensitive to differences in health outcomes measured by KDQOL scales. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the measures was 0.36. The differences in the EQ-5D-5L index score for patients in better and worse health status were greater than those measured by the SF-6D index score. Conclusions Both EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D are valid instruments for assessing ESRD patients. However, the two preference-based measures cannot be used interchangeably and it appears that EQ-5D-5L would lead to more favorable cost-effectiveness results than SF-6D if they are used in economic evaluations of interventions for ESRD.","[Yang, Fan; Chia, Kee Seng; Luo, Nan] Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, 12 Sci Dr 2,MD 1, Science Drive 117549, MD, Singapore; [Lau, Titus; Lee, Evan; Vathsala, A.] Natl Univ Hlth Syst, Univ Med Cluster, Div Nephrol, Singapore 119228, Singapore",National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore,"Luo, N (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Saw Swee Hock Sch Publ Hlth, 12 Sci Dr 2,MD 1, Science Drive 117549, MD, Singapore.",nan_luo@nuhs.edu.sg,"CHIA, Kee Seng/C-5790-2011","leong, wai yie/0000-0002-5389-1121; Yang, Fan/0000-0003-4689-265X",National University Health System (NUHS) Cross Department Collaborative Grant,National University Health System (NUHS) Cross Department Collaborative Grant,This study was supported by the National University Health System (NUHS) Cross Department Collaborative Grant.,,45,38,40,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

One of the few US trade agreements that deviate permanently from the restrictive 'yarn forward' RoOs in textile and garments is the qualifying industrial zone (QIZ) agreement with Egypt and Jordan and the subsequent Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Jordan. The more flexible RoOs of these agreements have contributed to a dramatic increase in exports especially from Jordan. Examining this through the lenses of global value chains (GVCs), this paper argues that these RoOs facilitated the integration of the two locations, particularly Jordan, in the highly contingent transient GVCs of Asian producers raising questions about the developmental impacts of such integration.","[Azmeh, Shamel] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Int Dev, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Azmeh, S (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci LSE, Dept Int Dev, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",c.azmeh@lse.ac.uk,"Azevedo, Micheline/JHT-0825-2023",,Capturing the Gains project at the University of Manchester,Capturing the Gains project at the University of Manchester,The research for this paper was conducted as part of a doctorate research at the University of Manchester.

The exclusion hypothesis proposes that a large informal sector lowers the preferences from formal workers and the middle-and high-income groups for social services to be provided by the state, and raises these groups' preferences for public welfare goods to become club goods. In contrast, the prospect hypothesis argues that formal workers, particularly the middle-income group, ally themselves to the informal sector to insure against the risk of future employment in informality. The study examines individual preferences for the provision of pensions and health care by either the state or private enterprises. The two competing hypotheses are tested with a hierarchical model using survey data from Latin America for 1995, 1998 and 2008. The findings offer support for the exclusion hypothesis.","[Berens, Sarah] Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany",University of Cologne,"Berens, S (通讯作者)，Univ Cologne, Cologne, Germany.",sarah.berens@uni-koeln.de,,,,,,,57,19,24,0,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

J,"Ahlqvist, T; Rhisiart, M",,,,"Ahlqvist, Toni; Rhisiart, Martin",,,Emerging pathways for critical futures research: Changing contexts and impacts of social theory,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Critical theory; Social theory; Critical futures research,TECHNOLOGY; FORESIGHT; SCIENCE; CONSTRUCTION; EXPECTATIONS,"There has always been a critical, emancipatory tradition within futures studies. Although those voices can still be heard, there has been a growing tendency for futures studies to be driven by more utilitarian needs in business and government. Whilst it is positive that futures thinking and research is increasingly valued within corporate and policy-making settings, much of that work appears to lack genuine plurality of worldviews and interests. The paper traces the changing contexts for futures research over the past 25 years. It argues that futures research needs to be viewed as part of the re-politicisation - in the Habermasian sense - of technocratic decision-making. It suggests that there are three particular reasons for revisiting the need for criticality in futures research: the increasing acknowledgement of systemic interrelatedness (ecological, social, economic), a growth in the forward-looking socio-economic paradigm that permeates both business and policy, and the challenge of theory development. Drawing on social theory and futures research, we suggest three pathways for revived critical futures research: socio-technical practices, future-oriented dialectics, and socio-economic imaginaries. As a result, the paper calls for development in futures studies that would dialectically integrate and overcome the dichotomy between instrumentalisation and (critical) theorising that can be currently understood as somewhat antagonistic. In order to find a balance between these antagonistic dimensions, futures research should be more engaged in enabling critique and revealing assumptions and interests. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Households have had more access to new forms of assets and debts and new ways to fund their lifestyles. This occurred at the same time that income inequality and job insecurity increased dramatically in the USA. We show that a more risk-taking culture that engages in more active financial management emerges amongst the middle and upper middle classes. We suggest that these households are feeling the effects of growing inequality at the top more acutely and they respond by changing how they think about their financial lives. For those lower on the socio-economic status distribution, financial strategies are more of a defensive strategy to get by. Those at the top embrace finance as an opportunity to preserve and extend their lifestyles.","[Fligstein, Neil; Goldstein, Adam] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA",University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Fligstein, N (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fligst@berkeley.edu,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking,Institute for New Economic Thinking,The research reported in this paper was funded by a grant from the Institute for New Economic Thinking.,,63,118,128,0,42,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Financial self-sufficiency is an important element in improving conservation effort in these areas. This study seeks to review best practices in recreational fee systems in different countries and to find a relevant entry fee for a wildlife sanctuary in Malaysia. The revenue of the National Elephant Conservation Center (NECC) in Kuala Gandah, Malaysia, comes from several sources, including the national government, but all these budgetary sources are strained by tighter public budgets and greater demands. The present study investigates the introduction of visitor entrance fees to supplement an otherwise inadequate budget for supporting the operational costs of the sanctuary. Factor analysis and a double-bounded contingent valuation method were combined to estimate tourists' willingness to pay (WTP) the proposed entrance fee. Factor analysis showed that respondents' motivation to support the NECC with user fees is conditioned by their direct experiences with elephants, their satisfaction with NECC's educational programs and services, and other experiences it gives to users. The WTP model considered respondents' four motivation factors with their sociodemographic characteristics. Since NECC visitors arrive from both within and outside the country, this study suggests to center managers a two-tier fee structure (residents vs. nonresidents of Malaysia), based upon mean WTP estimates. This study further suggests that revenue from such an entrance fee for NECC could support the Center's management and development costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Society generally requires that individuals with an illness take leave from their work, seek medical assistance and return when they are well. This is not possible for individuals with chronic illness. By its nature, chronic illness has no cure. Individuals who are diagnosed with diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease and who also undertake paid employment may need to disclose their illness and seek some form of accommodation in their workplace. Understanding attitudes of managers plays a significant role in the success of managing work and chronic illness.

The research suggests that creative arts activate important neurological pathways that aid the transfer of information from short-to long-term memory, where it can be retrieved for future problem-solving. To encourage meaningful learning and economic literacy, students must be able to mentally organize and retain information from their classroom experiences. The fresh metaphors and imagery present in creative arts such as poetry can deepen and clarify conceptual meaning, and allow students to learn and express their understanding of economics in a more personal and memorable way.

Using general utility structures and exploring both linear and non-linear taxes, it is demonstrated that the optimal second-best tax on an externality-generating good should not be corrected for the marginal cost of public funds, since it equals one in the optimal tax system. In the optimum, distortions of income taxes are equal to marginal redistributional gains. If the government does not have access to a non-distortionary marginal source of finance, the marginal cost of public funds can be either larger or smaller than one depending on subjective preferences for income redistribution. The optimal second-best corrective tax is then either higher or lower than the Pigouvian level. The findings in this paper generalize and amend prior results based on representative-agent models, shedding new light on the weak double-dividend hypothesis, and on the welfare gains of recycling revenue from environmental taxes.

For this reason, alternative preference-based instruments have been developed for economic evaluations in the elderly, such as the ICECAP-O. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness using a short run time frame for an integrated care model for frail elderly, and (2) to investigate whether using a broader measure of (capability) wellbeing in an economic evaluation leads to a different outcome in terms of cost-effectiveness. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses on costs and outcomes separately. We also performed incremental net monetary benefit regressions using quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based on the ICECAP-O and EQ-5D. In terms of QALYs as measured with the EQ-5D and the ICECAP-O, there were small and insignificant differences between the instruments, due to negligible effect size. Therefore, widespread implementation of the Walcheren integrated care model would be premature based on these results. All results suggest that, using the ICECAP-O, the intervention has a higher probability of cost-effectiveness than with the EQ-5D at the same level of WTP. In case an intervention's health and wellbeing effects are not significant, as in this study, using the ICECAP-O will not lead to a false claim of cost-effectiveness of the intervention. On the other hand, if differences in capability QALYs are meaningful and significant, the ICECAP-O may have the potential to measure broader outcomes and be more sensitive to differences between intervention and comparators.","[Makai, Peter; Adang, Eddy; Melis, Rene] Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Dept Geriatr, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Looman, Willemijn; Stolk, Elly; Fabbricotti, Isabelle] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Makai, P (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen Med Ctr, Dept Geriatr, Renier Postlaan 4, NL-6500 HB Nijmegen, Netherlands.",Peter.Makai@radboudumc.nl,"Melis, René/J-5943-2012; Adang, E.M.M./L-4169-2015; Makai, Peter/I-5278-2012","Melis, René/0000-0002-7863-4738; Makai, Peter/0000-0002-5332-1751",Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMW) as part of the National Care for the Elderly Program in the Netherlands (NPO) [313030201]; CZ,Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMW) as part of the National Care for the Elderly Program in the Netherlands (NPO); CZ,We would like to thank Erwin Birnie and Marc Koopmanschap for their useful suggestions on a previous version of this paper.

Regardless of the industry, the probability of innovation increases when there is investment in research and development (R&D) labs and firms are large.

Household fixed-effects models indicate that the children of monogamous mothers have significantly greater height-for-age z-scores than children of polygynous mothers. Also, a low ranking in the hierarchy of mothers and the ratio of married women to men are negatively correlated with child height.

It returns to the creation of the stock market in 1602 to examine the stock market's origin without the presumption of its respectability. Often considered the genesis of modern corporations and contemporary financial markets, its venerable status is questioned. The instability of the system, established incidental to the Dutch East India Company's solution for financing East Indies voyages and never intended as a model for global capitalism, is found to be insurmountable. Rather than extrapolating the current trajectory of capitalism, an alternative future based on the expansion of productive primary economic activity, is considered. A movement that is evolving spontaneously around innovative lending to expand business enterprises in the primary economy offers the possibility of this alternative future with goals other than amassing capital, more akin to the economic model that originally funded the Renaissance.

How do forest owners, managers and members of local communities who often depend on the forest, value it and what are the problems affecting the forests in terms of being able to meet these new challenges? In Portugal, this task has taken on an even greater priority as more than 90% of the forest is private and forest management relies on the individual decisions of thousands of forest owners. To understand stakeholder views on forest and forest management, a transversal social perception survey was implemented in the form of a case study of central Portugal which included decision-makers, local technicians, forest owners and the general public. The results show that there is a consensus on the main issues affecting forests and forest management. A shift from classic forest owners to the emergence of indifferent forest owners was observed, although this shift has not been recognized by the forest owners in the survey, who maintain the individual management of their properties.

We examine the ecological and social results of the collaborative Fort Valley Ecosystem Restoration Project on U.S. Forest Service lands near Flagstaff, Arizona. Since this experiment had areas treated with and without a diameter cap, we sought to determine: 1) the ecological consequences of implementing a 16-inch diameter cap, 2) whether the fears and concerns of the environmental groups who proposed the diameter cap were, in fact, warranted, and 3) how the local collaborative responded to implementing the diameter cap. The ecological data revealed that a site's management history played a major role in how a diameter cap would affect the restoration of stand structure in terms of tree density and tree size. The data suggest that, if implemented, diameter caps are best applied in a manner that takes into account both site conditions and stand management history. In general, we found the concerns about the loss of old-growth trees due to thinning treatments were not realized at Fort Valley. Finally, stakeholder surveys indicate that while the discussion of diameter caps caused tension within the collaborative group, the overall goal of forest restoration was not compromised.

The analysis is based on student-level administrative records from college transcripts, Unemployment Insurance wage data, and the National Student Clearinghouse data across 830,000 students between 2001 and 2010. Findings from this study confirm those from earlier work: The returns to certificates and diplomas were weak, but associate and bachelor's degrees yielded very strong returns; even small accumulations of credits had labor market value; and the health sector credentials had extremely high returns. Returns were higher for female than for male students. Despite the Great Recession, the returns to college remain strong over the late 2000s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper examines a different option: to develop the full capacity of the human mind to remain open to all possibilities, guided by utopian thinking. An inquiry into the creative potential of the human mind finds that collective thinking from a collective mind goes beyond transdisciplinarity as currently constructed. In collective thinking, knowledge boundaries are reframed as dynamic inter-relationships, and due weight is given to each of personal, physical, social, ethical, aesthetic, sympathetic and reflective ways of knowing. In applying the collective mind in these times of transformational change, there is hope is for innovative solutions to seemingly intractable, aptly labelled wicked problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

While it is mandatory for the regional counties to introduce choice plans for primary care it is voluntary for ambulatory specialist services. The voluntary nature of the regulations for the latter types of care generates a potential gap between the central government's reform attempts and the regional implementation of the plans. We review the regional implementation of this reform with respect to specialist services from a political economy perspective. Data on the scope of implementation show that counties of the same political ideology as the central government have introduced the most choice plans for specialist care. In particular, counties ruled by right-wing majorities have introduced the Choice Act to a considerably larger extent than left-wing counties. This creates a highly uneven situation across the various parts of the country, possibly at odds with the basic premises of the country's health law of equal access to care. The introduction of choice plans forms part of a decidedly contentious set of issues that are high on the political agenda of Sweden. The nature and impacts of these reforms are also a concern to the general public and the broader industry. Considerably more rigorous analyses will be needed to assess the impact on key policy parameters such as overall system efficiency and equitable access to services as a result of these changes to the health care markets.","[Ekman, Bjorn; Wilkens, Jens] Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Div SMGH, Jan Waldenstroms Gata 35, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden",Lund University,"Ekman, B (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Clin Sci, Div SMGH, Jan Waldenstroms Gata 35, S-20502 Malmo, Sweden.",bjorn.ekman@med.lu.se,"Ekman, Björn/HNP-0960-2023; Ekman, Björn/AAB-9240-2022","Ekman, Björn/0000-0001-7630-7904; Ekman, Björn/0000-0001-7630-7904",,,,,17,4,4,0,5,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

We consider an economy in which initial consumption levels and growth expectations are heterogeneous. In the benchmark case in which relative inequalities are permanent and relative risk aversion is constant, inequalities do not affect the discount rate. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which permanent inequalities reduce the discount rate. We also show that the anticipation of economic convergence raises the efficient discount rate when relative prudence is larger than unity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using the nonparametric stochastic frontier data envelopment approach, we analyze how financial development is related to efficiency improvement and technological progress, the two components of TFP. The study shows that Chinese financial development plays a significant role in promoting TFP growth via technological progress rather than efficiency change. The faster the financial development takes place, the better it could correct the mismatch of resource allocation, thus promoting TFP growth. The results imply that China needs to both further optimize the allocation of financial resources and perfect the regional financial system.","[Han, Jian; Shen, Yanzhi] Nanjing Univ, Sch Econ, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University,"Shen, YZ (通讯作者)，22 Hankou Rd, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",yanzhi@nju.edu.cn,,,,,,,27,40,41,6,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Adaptation to the needs of elderly population means that orientation on production and services designed for the growing number of older consumers will ensure stable market share in the environment of changing consumer preferences ( in aggregate macroeconomic perspective the significant changes in the number of seniors will shape new consumption patterns that will be reflected in demand side). Moreover, it is not just a matter of a business or economic theory, adaptation to the needs of silver population clearly has a strong social aspect - implementation of innovative IS solutions can improve active and independent lives of older people and enhance their living conditions. For both, economic growth content as well as social aspect we strongly recommend promoting development of silver sectors, supporting providers of silver services and searching for new solutions in an ageing society.

Government regulation, environmental strategy, organization and environmental performance are the key factors in the analytical framework. This paper uses ordinary least square (OLS) method for estimation. The results of the analysis indicate that the environmental management system and green procurement by parent firms are significantly related to the international transfer of these practices. Top leadership and the goal of environmental management in the subsidiary are also significantly related to the transfer. The emphasis of environmental strategy leads to improved environmental performance. Specifically, water and air performance are related to top initiative. In contrast, CO2 and waste performance are related to the priority of environmental management.

Complementarity of the two principles was already recommended in several other problems, but the broad context or frameworks on how to read together stories and statistics are being suggested such as the one in this very paper, which also includes: (1) a query about the decision-making process of entrepreneurs and the balance among all factors, which are representing the entrepreneurship inside and outside the company. This query starts with a few examples accompanied by basic theories, such as examples of the use of Petri networks (PN) in entrepreneurs' decision making. (2) Examples, such as the one of the dexterous entrepreneur, open the issue of broad context of factors influencing entrepreneurship. Those factors are leading towards the analysis of the national statistics. (3) a broad context, which is reflected in national statistics that had been provided to the reader in respect to changes that the entrepreneur`s behaviour must include to the inside processes of decision-making, which is being done continuously and in the hope of resilience.

The scrutiny in this paper was presented in a few examples divergent ones. Tradition mentioned by the study reported by Dana, Light (2011) is scrutinized differently than investment example (PN). Whichever decision-making process one follows this influences statistical results, which are then often being interpreted somewhat troublesome, as mentioned in various reports, e.g. Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report. The aim of this conceptual overview is to stimulate discussion about what entrepreneurship is, and how it has been analysed so far in connection with the resilience of country, region. Entrepreneurship is widely seen as an important driver of economic development and employment and productivity growth. Also, it is one of the main factors or indicators as factors important for resilience. Despite of wide range in the number of variables considered in the various indicators of resilience, the variables fall into six main categories: socio-economic characteristics and financial resources of individuals, infrastructure, community capacity, innovation and technology and natural environment, institutional capacity of the spatial economic system, the number of enterprises in region and in export industries. For a more complete understanding of how entrepreneurship contributes to economic and societal development, it is important to recognize the contextually embedded quality of entrepreneurial actions and behaviors in national, regional, and city-level contexts.","[Kolvekova, Gabriela; Korobanicova, Iveta; Liptakova, Erika] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Kolveková, G (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",gabriela.kolvekova@tuke.sk; iveta.korobanicova@tuke.sk; erika.liptakova@tuke.sk,"Liptakova, Erika/AAA-5938-2020; Kolvekova, Gabriela/C-3881-2018; Korobanicova, Iveta/L-6041-2017","Liptakova, Erika/0000-0002-6016-0757;","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic, project VEGA [1/0454/15]","Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic, project VEGA","This paper was supported by the Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic as part of the research project VEGA [1/0454/15] Redefining regional development - shift towards resilience regions",,15,0,0,0,14,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,304,315,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500035,0

By comparing the sensitivities of portfolio loss value-at-risk with respect to the model parameters, we show that the portfolio loss distributions depend not only on the model parameters but also on the multivariate nature of the factor model. With the empirical tests based on the Korean banks' nonperforming loan rates, our proposed models outperform the Vasicek model and provide more appropriate asset correlation and a systematic risk measure reflecting the characteristics of bank-level nonperforming loan rates. In addition, we measure the regional concentration of all the Korean banks using the Herfindahl-Hirschman index. We find that the regional concentration of a bank is strongly related to bank-level systematic risk, and the multivariate nature of asset return has a huge effect on bank-level systematic risk for the given regional concentration of a bank.","[Lee, Yongwoong] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Finance, Coll Business & Econ, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Poon, Ser-Huang] Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Hankuk University Foreign Studies; University of Manchester,"Lee, Y (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Div Int Finance, Coll Business & Econ, 81 Oedae Ro, Yongin 449791, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",ywlee@hufs.ac.kr,"Poon, Ser-Huang/IVV-6153-2023","Poon, Ser-Huang/0000-0002-7297-9401",Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund.,,25,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It is not an easy task; on the other, it is a very important feature on people's welfare, nations' development and social stability at a national level. The methodology applied will be the Porter's Diamond. The ensemble of resources, either physical infrastructures or capable companies or adequate regulations, to support the implementation of efficient and functional food security networks in many countries, frequently is provided without analysis of the population demand profile and resources available, normally importing other country model. Given the importance of food security to provide the correct amount of food to the different populations in a country, a framework for analyzing the competitive balance of the factors involved and the different models under consideration has been selected. Michael Porter described the Diamond in 1990 in his seminal work The competitive advantage of Nations. It considers different national factors that interact to produce the competitive advantage, such as home demand conditions, related support industries, factor conditions, companies` strategy and rivalry and Government regulation. With the Diamond the profile of the different factors are analyzed according to priority and importance. The resulting model allows detecting weaknesses and strengths considering the principal actors that build a food security network. Also it is possible to represent graphically the points of analysis, which allows to explore together different models of food security networks. The food supply it is a vital factor in every country for the population survival. The fresh food production, mainly fruits and vegetables, meat and fish, needs a net work of markets, at wholesale and retail level in order to distribute that fresh food from the farms where is produced to the final consumer, mainly located in the big cities (farm-to-fork). The whole activities related to bring food and supply to the final consumers is denominated food security. There is another concept associated to the food security which is called food safety. In some extend both are related, but different. The food safety concept means that the food must be safe for human consumption (innocuous). This simple difference (security-safety) has created some confusion in some countries. Food security guarantees the quantity of food supplied to people. Food safety guarantees the quality of food from human health perspective. Food security it is much more important in the poor than in the affluent countries or its regions. In countries with less than 1000 US$ per capita, the amount of money expended on food it is around 40% of the average income. In that case, a change in agricultural costs or on food prices has tremendous influence in the whole society. Many countries have developed a National Plan for food security in order to create markets network. This network operates as a group of engines pumping food from origin to destination. Thanks to this organization has been possible to correct many deficiencies in the population's food supply. The wholesale markets either in food origin area or in destination are not easy to establish. They need many important aspects to be evaluated before start the wholesale market design. The influence area determination; the right dimension of the premises; the type of buildings and pavilions; the protection of the market; the wholesalers transference; the users' relationships; the working rules; tariffs; timetables; gathering and distribution of the daily commercial information; connections with other markets; and a very long etcetera.

The results have shown that there is a significant difference between expectations and satisfaction of examinees with received medical services according to all observed variables in SERVQUAL model, which leads to the conclusion that quality of services in primary healthcare public institutions in Sibenik is not satisfactory. When it comes to satisfaction with specific elements of medical services, it has been concluded that the examinees are least pleased with the duration of time necessary to have physical check-ups and with insufficiently modern medical equipment. Moreover, it has been established that the frequency in usage of services significantly influences the overall contentment of the examinees whereas those who use mentioned services quite often are actually those who are the least satisfied.","[Mecev, Dijana; Goles, Ivana Kardum] Polytech Sibenik, Trg Andrije Hebranga 11, Shibenik, Croatia; [Kuran, Linda Martic] Polytech Marko Marulic Knin, Petra Kresimira 4 30, Knin, Croatia",,"Mecev, D (通讯作者)，Polytech Sibenik, Trg Andrije Hebranga 11, Shibenik, Croatia.",dijana@vus.hr; ikardum000@gmail.com; lmartic@veleknin.hr,"Martić Kuran, Linda/GLS-0320-2022","Martić Kuran, Linda/0000-0003-0234-941X",,,,,33,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,19,26,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000003,0

Today's and tomorrow's demands for a highly skilled workforce for the European economy are new and demanding challenges for the teacher and training community. New skills and competencies are needed for success and those skills should be a component part of education. This study deals with VET teacher preparation in Slovakia and describes partial results of ENTANGLE (Entrepreneurship Trainers for VET: A Novel Generation Learning approach) project. This project has been funded with support from the European Commission and is funded by the Lifelong Learning Programme Leonardo da Vinci - Transfer of Innovation. The project has an innovative practical approach to stimulating entrepreneurship among students in VET institutions by providing their teachers with the tools and materials to educate inspire and motivate their students to be able to start a career as an entrepreneur. This project is carried out in six European Countries: Spain, Netherlands, Cyprus, Belgium, Lithuania and Slovakia. Entangle consortium is composed of seven partners from six European Union countries among them is Faculty of economics and management of Slovak University of Agriculture in Nitra Slovakia. In the study are described theoretical background of the project and the qualitative analysis of the pilot test of the methodology developed in the project in the form of country report. FEM SUA in Nitra organised a piloting workshop at the end of May. Project presentation and its activities was aimed at university teachers. The group of teachers consisted of young teachers and scientists from different faculties of the university. Teachers were interested in the project; they highlighted the need of the entrepreneurship education and appreciated this initiative. To conclude the results we can say that there are many similarities in VET teacher preparation between partner countries of the project despite there are also some differences. But the common aim is to improve quality of vocational education for the future social and economic prosperity of the countries. Majority of the participants expressed their interest to adapt the material in their teaching life as a guide encouraging their students being entrepreneurs in the near future. They also stated positive shift in their entrepreneurship teaching skills development. The project aims at reaching the biggest number of VET teachers possible and start a lively discussion with them on entrepreneurship teaching and policies in the EU. We hope this aim is to be achieved in a short time period. VET students who finish their studies are usually expected to continue their education elsewhere or start a job. Some former students however start up their own firm. Most teachers are unaware of this next step a student takes after graduation. Relations between teachers and world of work should be improved.","[Seben Zatkova, Timea] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Pedag & Psychol, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Seben Zatkova, T (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Pedag & Psychol, Nitra, Slovakia.",timea.zatkova@uniag.sk,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,1,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,977,988,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800094,0

The OPEC countries have been experiencing the same situation due to their oil industry and favourable oil price evolution for them mainly in the past. According to some authors foreign reserves accumulation should have positive impact on country credibility, inflow of investment, output, trade, etc. However, inflow of investment can lead to redundant exchange rate appreciation as well and consequently reduce competiveness of a country. Finally, outcome and other indicators will not be positively affected. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to evaluate impact of foreign reserves accumulation in the OPEC countries on their macroeconomic situation. The evaluation is realised through Granger causality testing. Results confirm positive impact of reserve hoarding on investment of three OPEC countries (Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Venezuela). However positive impact on economic output has not been detected.

The indicator is rather an indicator of the performance of the entire enterprise, as evidenced by the very low correlation with the purchasing operating efficiency metrics as purchased quantity per dollar, purchased quantity per purchasing employee, or turnover ratio. Another way to evaluate the purchasing performance is based on Management by Objectives (MBO). The metrics of purchasing operational efficiency, as well as evaluation on the basis of MBO, can be obtained only from detailed analyses or audits, which are often not implemented in the enterprises; ROA is a very rough indicator of the purchasing performance. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to put forward purchasing performance indicators based on available information from financial statements and determine whether these indicators are applicable for purchasing performance evaluation. A survey method was the basic tool for collecting the data. Financial data were obtained from the Albertina database. Suggested indicators are compared with the MBO indicators acquired by exploratory analysis of data concerning purchasing objectives' importance and fulfilment. It is confirmed that the selected indicators based on available financial statements (purchasing costs per employee, inventory turnover, purchasing costs per unit sold) are suitable as a partial evaluation of the purchasing performance.","[Svandova, Eva; Suchanek, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Svandová, E (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, CS-60177 Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Suchanek, Petr/R-9626-2019; Švandová, Eva/AAE-2416-2020; Svandova, Eva/C-7492-2015","Suchanek, Petr/0000-0002-2606-4040;",,,,,15,0,0,1,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,419,426,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200054,0

In Canada - Renewable Energy, a domestic support measure for renewable energy generation has been subject if dispute settlement proceedings before the World Trade Organization (WTO) for the first time. In this ruling, the concept of 'relevant market' which forms part of the subsidy analysis proved to be highly controversial. By looking at the delineation of the relevant market and the conditions justifying subsidies, this article takes up this debate and examines the degree of policy space that is conferred to WTO Members in supporting their renewable energy sector. It discusses possible solutions to overcome the legal insecurity emanating from the blurry concept of 'relevant market' by arguing that a comparison between the WTO law and antitrust law can yield valuable insights to establish a more consistent approach for assessing the relevant market.","[Weber, Rolf H.] Univ Zurich, Fac Law, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weber, Rolf H.] Univ Zurich, European Law Inst, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Weber, Rolf H.] Univ Zurich, Ctr Informat & Commun Law, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland; [Koch, Rika] Univ Zurich, CH-8006 Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Weber, RH (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",rolf.weber@rwi.uzh.ch; rika.koch@rwi.uzh.ch,,,,,,,18,6,7,1,13,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

It suggests rich possibilities for further research and theoretical thinking into the globally relevant, yet locally specific features of this Special Administrative Region of China. Following studies that identify residents' perceptions of how their once-quiet enclave has changed under the impact of recent phenomenal growth in the casino industry, it includes discussion, not just of crimes, but of a range of undesirable roles, acts and outcomes currently supported and encouraged by Macau's casino culture and its position as a border state of China. A structural tension is identified between gambling as the main source of government revenue and the need to control and enforce regulation of unsavory acts and their consequences, both legal and illegal. It presents a typology of socially defined roles and processes within this environment that permit such activities to continue even across, and sometimes because of, the borders of different governmental jurisdictions. It suggests that a theoretical approach that gives broad attention to social harm rather than specific, legally defined casino-related crimes may be the most appropriate way to study negative social impacts in this and other communities dominated by casino-related economies.","[Zabielskis, Peter] Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China",University of Macau,"Zabielskis, P (通讯作者)，Univ Macau, Fac Social Sci, Ave Univ, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",peterz@umac.mo,,,,,,,53,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,170,191,,,,,,22,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000018,0

A number of other few questions act as support for searching the answers to the three above-formulated questions. Finally, the purpose of the research is to formulate at least a consistent and viable hypothesis about the relationship between CSR and EC actions in terms of existence, meaning and intensity. The research support is the status of the CSR actions of three Romanian enterprises located in the North-Eastern area of the country. The original, exploratory component of the research was set by the choice of a heuristic approach through which we can identify the CSR principles, the enterprise management position towards them and a few basic elements to assess the competitiveness of the three enterprises. The survey was approached by appealing to direct meetings based on a semi-structured interview, whose coordinates were set by an appropriate interview guide containing five groups of questions. Processing, analysis and interpretation of results were achieved by recourse to comparative analysis, using as a basis of comparison the standard situation of the GRI report available in 2015 for European companies as a result of previous research in the field. The findings of this research have a double benefit: first, to serve as support for further testing and validation of two hypotheses derived through the abductive approach; then to identify available directions in terms of action for the Romanian enterprise in order to enhance the incentive potential of CSR actions in relation to competitiveness. The adaptations and methodological developments made in this research stage will also be followed in order to be validated and to identify possible extensions for further research.

As T2DM treatment requires strict adherence, patient needs and preferences should be taken into consideration. Methods Based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis, a discrete choice experiment (DCE) was applied to identify patient preferences. Apart from six identical attributes (adjustment of glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], prevention of hypoglycemia, risk of genital infection, risk of gastrointestinal problems, risk of urinary tract infection, and weight change), one continuous variable of either dditional healthy life years (AHY) or additional costs attribute (AC) was included. The DCE was conducted using a fractional factorial design, and the statistical data analysis used random effect logit models. Results In total, N = 626 (N = 318 AHY ? N = 308 AC) T2DM patients participated in the survey. The estimation revealed a clear dominance for prevention of hypoglycemia (coefficient 0.937) and adjustment of HbA1c (coefficient 0.541). The attributes, additional healthy life years (coefficient 0.458) or additional costs (coefficient 0.420), were in the middle rank and both of significant impact. The side effects, risk of genital infection (coefficient 0.301), risk of gastrointestinal problems (coefficient 0.296), and risk of urinary tract infection (coefficient 0.241) followed in this respective order. Possible weight change (coefficient 0.047) was of less importance (last rank) to the patients in this evaluation. Conclusions These survey results demonstrate how much a (hypothetical) T2DM oral treatment characteristic affects the treatment decision. The preference data can be used for risk-benefit assessment, cost-benefit assessment, and the establishment of patient-oriented evidence. Understanding how patients perceive and value different aspects of diabetes oral treatment is vital to the optimal design and evaluation of treatment options. The present results can be an additional source of information for design, assessment, and decision in T2DM treatment regimes. As such, more effective and efficient care of patients can be achieved, thereby increasing adherence.","[Muehlbacher, Axel; Bethge, Susanne] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Muehlbacher, Axel] Gesell Empir Beratung mbH, Denzlingen, Germany",,"Mühlbacher, A (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Neubrandenburg, Germany.;Mühlbacher, A (通讯作者)，Gesell Empir Beratung mbH, Denzlingen, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211",AstraZeneca Germany,AstraZeneca Germany(AstraZeneca),The study was sponsored by AstraZeneca Germany.,,53,28,31,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

The results suggest that: (i) the optimal rotation age for the low income group is longer than that for the high income group; (ii) low income farmers are more sensitive in terms of the land expectation value to changes in discount rate; (iii) low income farmers gain less if the carbon price increases; and (iv) the carbon payment scheme at the start of a rotation is more financially attractive to forest farmers, but the carbon payment scheme at the end of a rotation is more advantageous in terms of forest biodiversity. These findings lead to potential policy implications for forest management for the provision of multiple ecosystem services in the context of a developing country, demonstrating a tradeoff between forest income and biodiversity conservation. While an increase in carbon prices would benefit forest farmers, we also suggest that these farmers could be compensated for their income losses or rewarded to maintain or increase forest biodiversity. However, relatively greater attention could be paid to compensating low income farmers as they potentially lose more with an increase in discount rate and gain less with an increase in carbon price.

The results suggest that, when the recycling rate is low, increasing it to its optimal level will result in more land area being devoted to forestry and, thus, more trees. However, increasing it beyond its optimal level will reduce the number of trees in the long run. In addition, the recycling rate that maximizes the forest area is optimal in the sense that it also maximizes the social net benefit. An application shows that increasing the recycling rate up to its optimal level considerably increases the forest area. The increase in the social net benefit is very small.

Previous research has shown that 11 % of the Dutch insured opted for a voluntary deductible (VD) in health insurance in 2014, while the highest VD level was financially profitable for almost 50 % of the population in retrospect. To explain this discrepancy, this paper identifies and discusses six potential determinants of the decision to opt for a VD from the behavioral economic literature: loss aversion, risk attitude, ambiguity aversion, debt aversion, omission bias, and liquidity constraints. Based on these determinants, five potential strategies are proposed to increase the number of insured opting for a VD. Presenting the VD as the default option and providing transparent information regarding the VD are the two most promising strategies. If, as a result of these strategies, more insured would opt for a VD, moral hazard would be reduced.","[van Winssen, K. P. M.; van Kleef, R. C.; van de Ven, W. P. M.

As illustrations of scenarios, metaphors already have a long history in the futures studies, too. Metaphors were discussed in the CLA Reader 1.0(1) (Inayatullah ed., 2004) but the CIA Reader 2.0 edited by Inayatullah and Milojevic (2015) gives metaphors the central role in futures research(2) that they deserve. The article compares the approaches of semiotics and the CLA and suggests practical steps for the analysis of metaphoric futures oriented texts and their use in the construction of scenarios. Assuming that the litany is a text, metaphors may be present on all levels of the CLA: litany, systemic causes, worldview and myth/emotion. Metaphors are suitable even for the illustration of the CLA second level quantitative causal relations between variables. As an illustrating case study, we analyze a text that suggests the great future of the Northern Sea Route. The deconstruction of the litany results in two narratives or scenarios. They are constructed utilizing proverbs and other metaphoric sayings that get many citations on the Internet. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This study deals with climate change adaptation and its costs-benefits with an empirical analysis optimizing food security related adaptation strategy over a 50-year time frame. An Empirical Dynamic Commutable General Equilibrium Model for Climate and the Economy (EDCGECE) is applied to describe the potential effects of climate change on food security and examine the implications of future strategies for Malaysia. Specifically, this study considers the potential effects of climate change on food security and explores the prioritizing of mitigation options. Different scenarios show a baseline scenario without adaptation action followed by introduction of adaptation actions. The analysis reveals important contrasts from baseline to future options over time. The results indicate that food sustainability gap in Malaysia is about 30-35% below the national targets in 2015 (baseline) and the gap is rising over time due to climatic effects in agriculture. However, applying different levels of adaptation actions, (e.g. 5-20%) food security gaps are reduced over time considerably. The projected adaptation strategies applied in this study would be effective and helpful to support sustainable food security related strategies in Malaysia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous evidence for the US from the 1960s and 1970s suggests they do, primarily working through their effect on educational attainment to generate a causal impact on crime. In this paper, we consider whether more recent experience replicates this. There are two key findings. First, there is a strong and consistent negative effect on crime from stricter compulsory schooling laws. Second, there is a weaker and sometimes non-existent link between such laws and educational attainment. As a result, credible causal estimates of the education-crime relationship cannot in general be identified for the more recent period, though they can for some groups with lower education levels (in particular, for blacks).

This paper argues that despite its overall static trend, FLFP of some Iranian women responded to economic pressures induced by macroeconomic instabilities. Looking at the Iranian economic crisis of 1994-5, the study shows that, controlling for individual fixed effects, married women in rural areas and never-married women in urban areas increased their participation rate by as much as 38 percent.

We investigate the heterogeneity of physicians' preferences as a potential explanation of these mixed results in France, where the national voluntary QIP - the CAPI - has been cancelled due to its unpopularity. We rely on a discrete choice experiment to elicit heterogeneity in physicians' preferences for the financial and non-financial components of QIP. Using mixed and latent class logit models, results show that the two models should be used in concert to shed light on different aspects of the heterogeneity in preferences. In particular, the mixed logit demonstrates that heterogeneity in preferences is concentrated on the pay-for-performance component of the QIP, while the latent class model shows that physicians can be grouped in four homogeneous groups with specific preference patterns. Using policy simulation, we compare the French CAPI with other possible QIPs, and show that the majority of the physician subgroups modelled dislike the CAPI, while favouring a QIP using only non-financial interventions. We underline the importance of modelling preference heterogeneity in designing and implementing QIPs.","[Ammi, Mehdi] Carleton Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, River Bldg,1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada; [Peyron, Christine] Univ Bourgogne, Lab Econ Dijon, CNRS UMR 6307, Inserm U, Dijon, France",Carleton University; Universite de Bourgogne; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm),"Ammi, M (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Sch Publ Policy & Adm, River Bldg,1125 Colonel Dr, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada.",mehdi.ammi@carleton.ca,,,Regional Council of Bourgogne (CPER); Regional Council of Bourgogne (PARI),Regional Council of Bourgogne (CPER); Regional Council of Bourgogne (PARI),We thank the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments that helped improve this manuscript.

Cost-effectiveness analysis using a discrete event simulation (DES) model to simulate two therapeutic strategies in patients with advanced NSCLC. Strategy one included patients tested for EGFR-mutation and therapy given accordingly. Strategy two included chemotherapy for all patients without testing. All results are presented in 2014 US dollars. The analysis was made with data from the Mexican frequency of EGFR-mutation. A univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted on EGFR prevalence. Progression-free survival (PFS) transition probabilities were estimated on data from the IPASS and simulated with a Weibull distribution, run with parallel trials to calculate a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. PFS of patients in the testing strategy was 6.76 months (95 % CI 6.10-7.44) vs 5.85 months (95 % CI 5.43-6.29) in the non-testing group. The one-way sensitivity analysis showed that PFS has a direct relationship with EGFR-mutation prevalence, while the ICER and testing cost have an inverse relationship with EGFR-mutation prevalence. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that all iterations had incremental costs and incremental PFS for strategy 1 in comparison with strategy 2. There is a direct relationship between the ICER and the cost of EGFR testing, with an inverse relationship with the prevalence of EGFR-mutation. When prevalence is > 10 % ICER remains constant. This study could impact Mexican and Latin American health policies regarding mutation detection testing and treatment for advanced NSCLC.","[Arrieta, Oscar; Morales-Oyarvide, Vicente; Alejandra Ramirez-Tirado, Laura] INCan, Unit Thorac Oncol, San Fernando 22,Col Secc 16, Mexico City 14080, DF, Mexico; [Anaya, Pablo] IMS Hlth, Mexico City, DF, Mexico; [Polanco, Ana C.] AstraZeneca, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (INCAN); AstraZeneca,"Arrieta, O (通讯作者)，INCan, Unit Thorac Oncol, San Fernando 22,Col Secc 16, Mexico City 14080, DF, Mexico.",ogarrieta@gmail.com,"Arrieta, Oscar/ABH-6022-2020","LA, Ramirez-Tirado/0000-0003-0179-8774; Arrieta, Oscar/0000-0002-1164-3779",,,,,46,17,18,1,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

To the extent that smoke-free laws change perceptions, norms, and attitudes about tobacco use, these laws may also reduce the prevalence and intensity of cigarette consumption. Using nationally representative data on over four million individuals spanning 15 years, we study the average effect of comprehensive, state-level indoor smoking bans on smoking prevalence in the United States. Our research design exploits within-state variation in smoking prevalence, as well as the rapid diffusion of comprehensive bans across states between 2002 and 2010. Our results suggest that a comprehensive indoor smoking ban is associated with a 2.35 percent to 3.29 percent average reduction in smoking prevalence, a range that is robust to various specifications. These effects are roughly equivalent to a $0.95 to $1.33 increase in the average state's cigarette tax in 2010. Finally, we demonstrate that state-level indoor bans in bars may significantly decrease smoking prevalence in specific subpopulations, particularly young, female, low-income, and binge-drinking individuals.","[Carton, Thomas W.] Louisiana Publ Hlth Inst, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA; [Darden, Michael] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Levendis, John] Loyola Univ, Dept Econ, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Lee, Sang H.] Southeastern Louisiana Univ, Sch Management & Business Adm, Hammond, LA 70402 USA; [Ricket, Iben] Louisiana State Univ, Hlth Sci Ctr, Chron Dis Prevent & Control Unit, Baton Rouge, LA 70803 USA",Tulane University; Loyola University New Orleans; University of Louisiana System; Southeastern Louisiana University; Louisiana State University System; Louisiana State University; Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center at Shreveport,"Carton, TW (通讯作者)，Louisiana Publ Hlth Inst, New Orleans, LA 70112 USA.",tcarton@lphi.org,"Lee, Sang/I-6370-2019","Lee, Sang/0000-0003-3612-8666",Louisiana Cancer Research Center; Louisiana Campaign for Tobacco-Free Living,Louisiana Cancer Research Center; Louisiana Campaign for Tobacco-Free Living,"Funding is acknowledged from the Louisiana Cancer Research Center and the Louisiana Campaign for Tobacco-Free Living.

Moreover we investigated the impact of care times on the QoL. Methods: Through a specifically designed questionnaire, 150 caring relatives were interviewed retrospectively on all accrued financial costs, caring times incurred and the current QoL, assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale for happiness (VAS). Results: The caring time incurred was on average 6.4 +/- 8.5 (mean +/- SD) hours per week. The QoL was on average rated at 6.7 +/- 1.9 on a ten point scale. Financial strain was incurred by the direct non-medical costs of on average (sic) 405 +/- 1104 and the direct medical costs of on average (sic) 134 +/- 340 per year. Indirect costs were stated by two caregivers as amounting to (sic) 2400 and (sic) 6000 net income loss per year respectively. Caregivers of privately insured patients with wet AMD carried a financial cost burden which was up to six times higher than caregivers of patients who were on state insurance while showing the same visual acuity. Conclusion: The evaluation shows that caregivers of privately insured patients with wet AMD have higher costs than caregivers of patients with state insurance coverage. This burden seems to be a factor to be considered independently since it does not appear to have any relation to patients AMD acuity.","[Weyer-Wendl, Hannah; Walter, Peter] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Ophthalmol, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University,"Weyer-Wendl, H (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Dept Ophthalmol, Pauwelsstr 30, D-52074 Aachen, Germany.",weyer.wendl@gmail.com,"Walter, Peter/L-5982-2018","Walter, Peter/0000-0001-8745-6593",,,,,18,5,6,1,8,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

I account for ability/selection bias and the probability that entering freshmen will not eventually graduate. I find the financial proposition of attending college is a sound investment for most individuals and cost scenarios, although some scenarios do not pay off until late in life, or ever. I estimate the present discounted value of attending college for the median student to vary between $85,000 and $300,000 depending on the student's major. Most importantly, the results of this paper emphasize the role that risk (e.g. the nontrivial chance that a student will not eventually graduate) plays in the cost-benefit analysis of obtaining a college degree.

The existing literature assumes inconsistent Nash conjectures, despite the fact that policymakers recognize that abatement levels are strategic substitutes and increases in abatement generate carbon leakage. With consistent conjectures much of the conventional wisdom is reversed. The non-cooperative abatement level is below the Nash equilibrium. The difference between Nash and consistent conjectures is greatest when benefits are large and costs are small. We find that large coalitions cannot form. However, small coalitions can result in substantial increases in abatement relative to the non-cooperative outcome. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We build on own, existing, and longitudinal findings on forest policy changes in Bangladesh over three decades. We contrast this data with data on forest Development Project Aid from 1980 to 2014. First, we identify multiple links between the two parallel data sets. We subsequently corroborate selected links through qualitative in-depth analyses. The results indicate a link between donor funding and domestic policy changes towards community-based forest policy. This link is further specified by different temporal relations, as policy changes are being observed prior to, in response to, or simultaneously with donor funding. We conclude that donor funding for forestry projects has a strong influence on the recipient country's forest policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Rahman, Md Saifur; Sadath, Md.

However, said research seldom analyses actor involvement directly, and in addition leaves open the theoretical definition of the term actor. The lack of this definition makes impossible the comparison of different findings. If further research intends to compare community forestry worldwide, there is a need for a theory-based actor model. In order to contribute to the general discourse on community forestry, this study has defined the term actor, and also introduces an actor classification model that is theory-based. The model, together with an actor identification method, was applied to selected community forestry case studies in five different countries around the world (Indonesia, Germany, Cameroon, Namibia and Nepal). The results provide an answer on the question: who are the main actors involved with community forestry? At the same time, the empirical findings also demonstrate that the model is applicable in practice. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Schusser, Carsten; Krott, Max; Movuh, Mbolo C.

To clarify the assigned pattern, we utilised further qualitative indicators, and we estimated that both membership of a scholarly group of universities and universities' research intensity can positively affect their graduates' invitations to interviews and entry-level annual salaries.

The purpose of this study is to provide guidance for priority setting of HSR projects based on economic theory. Methods The conceptual analysis starts from the premise that competition in health care is valuable-a position that seems to predominate among Western policymakers. The principle of competition rests on economic theory and, in particular, its branch of welfare economics. Results Based on economic theory, the role of HSR is to detect and alleviate information asymmetry, negative externalities, and harm caused by competition and inappropriate incentives for competition. A hierarchy of HSR projects is provided; following the ethical principle of harm ('do not harm'), the detection and prevention of harm would receive highest priority among HSR projects. Conclusions Agreeing that competition is valuable in achieving efficiency and quality of care (and therefore agreeing to the assumptions of economic theory) implies accepting the role of HSR in detecting market failure and the HSR hierarchy as suggested. Disagreement would require an alternative coherent concept of improving efficiency and quality of care.","[Gandjour, Afschin] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany",Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Gandjour, A (通讯作者)，Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Sonnemannstr 9-11, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany.",a.gandjour@fs.de,"Gandjour, Afschin/I-8963-2019",,,,,,8,1,1,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Regional dispersion increases in the outcome of consolidation episodes, particularly, when packages are more severe and implemented through spending cuts rather than tax rises. From a policy perspective, these findings suggest that fiscal consolidations driven by reductions in government spending can exacerbate regional disparities and may ultimately counteract the European policy efforts to promote territorial cohesion. Our results are robust to alternative inequality measures, the occurrence of crisis episodes and the exclusion of fiscal outliers.","[Agnello, Luca; Fazio, Giorgio] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Fazio, Giorgio] Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Alumni Assoc, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England",University of Palermo; Newcastle University - UK; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Agnello, L; Fazio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat, Viale Sci, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.;Fazio, G (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Business, 5 Barrack Rd, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 4SE, Tyne & Wear, England.;Sousa, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Sousa, RM (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.;Sousa, RM (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Alumni Assoc, Houghton St, London WC2 2AE, England.",luca.agnello01@unipa.it; giorgio.fazio@newcastle.ac.uk; rjsousa@eeg.uminho.pt,"Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753",Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268 (PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013)],Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; National Funds through FCT-Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),The authors would like to thank the editors and two anonymous referees for helpful suggestions.

In order to avoid such situations, pilot projects and other forms of policy experiments can and are often used to test new approaches before their full-scale roll-out. Policy experimentation can provide meaning to policymaking by helping in framing or projecting the future, deriving alternate response strategies and monitoring any changes in the policy environment. At least in theory, the small scale and experimental nature of pilots can encourage policy innovations and reduce policy risks. The discussion in this paper examines three key challenges to policy experimentation all of which centre on questions of meaning in terms of understanding the future, and power in terms of the ability of governments to design and implement such actions. These are (1) the influence of politics and key stakeholders therein on the design and evaluation of experiments, (2) problems in the technical evaluation of policy experiments and (3) problems encountered in the diffusion of experiments and retaining the lessons drawn from them.

The objective of this programme is reducing the carbon footprint and improving the energy efficiency of greenhouse horticulture, and developing a climate neutral greenhouse in 2020. In 2009 the programme introduced the New Cultivation concept. Previous research showed that this concept could reduce heat demand 15-30%. The target was to have 400 ha of greenhouses applying the concept in 2015 and 2000 ha in 2020. In 2012 the sector had achieved 90 ha, realised by 18 firms. This achievement was considered insufficient to meet the targets for 2015 and 2020. For that reason two sociological studies were started. One study in 2012 to specify the knowledge needs of the early adopters. A second study in 2014 to analyse the group dynamics of the early majority in making the shift to the New Cultivation concept. In both studies, face-to-face interviews were conducted with greenhouse growers. Each individual interview was summarised in a mind map. In addition, meta-analyses were made in which the mind maps were ranked on basis of similarities and dissimilarities. The meta-analysis of the 2012 study revealed striking differences in the focus points of researchers, equipment suppliers, crop advisers and early adopters. These differences in focus points emphasized that demand and supply of knowledge in the knowledge chain were not yet geared to one another. In fact the early adopters had to integrate various fragments of knowledge into a practical version of New Cultivation, meeting their needs of a better crop growth, smaller crop losses and lower heating costs. The necessity to compose a practical version out of fragments of knowledge explains the 'chasm' between the early adopters and the early majority. The early majority lacks the agency to compose a practical version on their own. The bridge for 'Crossing the Chasm' was organising learning groups of colleagues. The meta-analysis of the 2014 study revealed three subgroups: market-oriented, crop-oriented and costs-oriented growers. For further introduction we advised to focus on the subgroup of crop-oriented growers. The reasons for this advice were: the size of the subgroup (50% of population), their passion for climate management, their desire to exchange experiences and their fear for the plant health risks of the New Cultivation concept.","[Buurma, J.

Those policies and their unwinding may significantly affect cross-border capital flows and thus destabilize the financial systems of emerging markets. For example, emerging markets experienced substantial financial instability during the taper tantrum triggered by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's May 2013 announcement of the potential unwinding of QE. In this article, we examine the spillovers from the taper tantrum on emerging markets more rigorously by using econometric analysis to empirically assess the effect on equity markets in emerging markets.

Our objective in this pilot study was to benchmark three broad categories of crop losses, including internal production losses, unsold product, and credits on shipped product. Surveyed growers provided more detailed loss codes within these categories. Crop losses were tracked by 11 large U.S. growers who each produced at least $1 million (M) in wholesale value of seedling plugs or rooted cuttings in 2009 and 2010. The total value of product planted averaged $15.7 M in 2010 across the companies. Total shrinkage per firm averaged 9.23% of units (containers) produced or 9.48% of crop value. Shrinkage represented an average loss of annual sales of $1.26M per firm. Among plant types, losses were highest for seedling plugs (14.98% of units, 14.89% of value), followed by rooted cuttings (11.63, 11.49%, respectively) and finished plants (6.82, 5.82%). The higher shrinkage rate for young plants compared with finished plants included production losses related to germination of plugs, and poor quality unrooted cuttings (starter material). Product losses of unsold young plants also occurred because of a high level of plants grown for risk management, trays that were only partially-filled and were therefore not saleable, or product grown on speculation. Levels of shrinkage varied widely between firms and years (ranging from 6.1 to 20.1%), and in the distribution between shrinkage categories, depending on the type of crops grown and business marketing structure. Monitoring shrinkage is strongly recommended for horticulture firms in order to identify areas for improved efficiency, allow accurate cost estimates, and benchmark efficiency over time and against competitors.","[Fisher, P.

Afterwards, two prediction models are compared -ARIMA and the model with oil price incorporated into the autoregressive structure. The findings of these extended model show as an increase in the prediction accuracy in the short-term forecasting of fuel prices based on data of oil price development.

Modern development of any business requires development of responsibility, and stimulates the necessity of integration of social policy and corporate strategy, examining financial expenses on the social programs as form of investing in forming of strategic advantage. Consideration of stakeholder interests and needs is the basis of the modern CSR concept, and it is a required component of the system of CSR strategic management. This paper proposes an approach to the classification of CSR strategies based on targeting priority groups of stakeholders. Three types of CSR strategies, including focusing on internal stakeholders, external stakeholders - immediate environment and external stakeholders local community, is the result of the application of the proposed approach. The implementation of each proposed type of CSR strategy provides programs and longterm cooperation projects with selected priority stakeholder groups to achieve the strategic objectives in CSR field. Companies' business processes are the means to obtain positive economic impact of the implementation of socially responsible policies. Consideration of influence of stakeholder's requirements for business process management in the company on a systematic basis contributes to the improvement of business processes. Basing on an overview of recent theoretical evidence, we conclude that efforts to improving business processes as a result of application of CSR strategies lead to an increase in their efficiency. The increase can be shown in improving certain local operations as well as in the broader consequences like increasing the company's competitiveness and its sustainability.","[Kamyshnykova, Evelina; Kalinin, Oleksandr V.] Pryazovskyi State Tech Univ, Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine",Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Pryazovskyi State Technical University,"Kamyshnykova, E (通讯作者)，Pryazovskyi State Tech Univ, Mariupol, Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine.",,"Kalinin, Oleksandr/AAE-7548-2020; Kamyshnykova, Evelina/N-2895-2018",,,,,,7,0,0,3,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,345,352,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200045,0

Organizations around the world have replicated this model successfully. This essay takes the comparative case more explicitly to read against the tendency to understand microfinance as the globally institutionalized and realized norm, and local unruly credit economies as the exception. We go beyond comparing credit in India and Paraguay in order to illustrate how comparison is actually central to the banking practices of microfinance. Moreover, it is the collaborative anthropological project that helps to show this, allowing not only for empirical grounds of comparison, but also raising theoretical and methodological questions of comparison itself. In juxtaposing microfinance in our two fieldsites, we find that as credit proliferates globally, so do the comparative projects both of borrowers and lenders in the disparate worlds of Kolkata and Ciudad del Este. At the same time, these were constrained by the global financial comparisons between countries made by investors. Ethnographic methods are vital for understanding how microfinance becomes part of a wider repertoire of financial strategies used by women while simultaneously offering the grounds for women to undertake their own acts of comparison.","[Kar, Sohini] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Dev, London, England; [Schuster, Caroline] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Acton, Australia",Australian National University,"Schuster, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Acton, Australia.",caroline.schuster@anu.edu.au,,"Schuster, Caroline/0000-0003-4229-2921; Kar, Sohini/0000-0002-9029-5214","National Science Foundation [1022746]; Social Science Research Council; Wenner-Gren Foundation; FLAS Title VI fellowship; Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion (IMTFI); Fulbright-Hays DDRA program [P022A090011]; Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [1022746] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science Research Council; Wenner-Gren Foundation; FLAS Title VI fellowship; Institute for Money, Technology and Financial Inclusion (IMTFI); Fulbright-Hays DDRA program; Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Funding for Sohini Kar's research was provided by the National Science Foundation [grant number 1022746], the Social Science Research Council and the Wenner-Gren Foundation.

Satisfaction in our research represents an outcome of post-purchase evaluations in terms of how positively seniors view a store and whether its attributes have met or exceeded their expectations. Two principal aims are formulated for our paper: 1) to identify the factors affecting grocery store satisfaction in elderly customers segment, 2) to propose the ways for retail management and marketing aiming at better consideration of senior's customer segment. To evaluate the effects of store attributes that influence food store satisfaction we applied the qualitative research method with focus group aiming to provide an in-depth, complex understanding of how seniors see and interpret their satisfaction. The qualitative analytical approach chosen in this research was thematic analysis. The purpose of employing focus group interviews lies in selecting information-rich cases for study in depth. The results indicate that age dimensions influence perceptions and behaviour related to store evaluation and thus contribute to the understanding of the growing segment of elderly shoppers. From a retail management and marketing point of view our findings call for a stronger consideration of senior's customer segment in store layout, product display in shelves and signage provision to enable a better orientation within the store.","[Lesakova, Dagmar; Dano, Ferdinand] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Lesáková, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Bratislava, Slovakia.",lesakova@euba.sk; dano@euba.sk,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,10,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,270,280,,,,,,11,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100025,0

We explore this and find it to be suitable for different types of additive noise including Laplacian noise density. We show that the proposed parameter selection for SVR achieves a good generalization performance by testing several regression problems (low- and high-dimensional data). Moreover, the proposed method is effective for finding the optimal parameters of SVR for all kinds of noise, including Laplacian noise. The generalization performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the PLSN method, with some numerical studies for Gaussian noise as well as non-Gaussian noise.

The Growing Growers Farmer Education program was established to address this need and to train these new farmers on effective growing practices. As a collaboration between K-State Research and Extension, University of Missouri Research and Extension, Lincoln University Cooperative Extension, the Kansas City Food Circle, Cultivate Kansas City, and the Kansas Rural Center, we set the goal of providing educational opportunities to help new growers get started and established ones get better at what they do. We do this by providing apprenticeships for new growers at established vegetable farms. Farm apprentices work on a local farm during the growing season to get first-hand, practical experience; they attend monthly workshops; and they get direct one-on-one training from their host farmer. The monthly workshops address many of the skill sets required to run a local farm, from soil management to production planning to marketing to farm business management. We've also developed a listserv for area networking, which includes area growers, restaurateurs, grocery stores, and others interested in the local farming industry that has been highly successful at maintaining communication between all of these entities. Finally, we organize special events to help develop the local farming industry. As local food networks continue to grow, vegetable grower education and mentoring programs will be instrumental to the development of a stable local food system.","[Rivard, L.; Fusselman, M.

As the dependent variable is considered real GDP as representatives of economic growth, and as independent variables besides the variable of FDI, are reviewed a range of other macroeconomic variables like export, import, employment, consumer price index, trade openness and human capital. Also in the model is incorporated an artificial variable (dummy) to explore the effects of the global financial crises into the dynamics of FDI. Besides static models, estimated with the OLS method, it is made a long-term analysis of the linkage between FDI and economic growth, using dynamic VAR model and Granger causality test.

The market price is expressed with the demand and supply functions for the commodity. The distributed time delay is introduced in the demand and supply prices. It is assumed that the consumer and producer behavior depends on the weighted function of the past prices. The demand can take into account the recent price and the past demand price. The producer can consider the past supply price. Thus, we obtain two nonlinear mathematical models for the price dynamics. In some conditions, there is only one positive equilibrium point. The stability of the equilibrium point and the existence of periodic solutions are investigated. We find the conditions so that the equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable.

This occurred after a period of enrolment decline attributable to range of factors including loss of staff and major structural changes to University courses. The turnaround in numbers has affected two major qualifications at Burnley, The Associate Degree in Urban Horticulture and the Master of Urban Horticulture. We discuss how the increasing enrolments at Burnley can be attributed to developing a clear narrative around what constitutes urban horticulture. The renewal and revitalisation process that has occurred in enrolments continues and we emphasise that much work still needs to be done to keep programs alive. The paper explores the importance of a coherent narrative of urban horticulture, which is enhanced and made authentic for students when teaching staff actively engage and network with industry to promote and develop new forms of urban horticulture. A case study is provided of how this high level of engagement in the developing area of urban agriculture has been used to generate further research and teaching opportunities. We argue that this networking helps create vocational opportunities for graduates and develops interest and motivation for future student enrolments. This is despite the fact that student expectations of urban agriculture before enrolment can differ from core elements of their training once study commences.

For EM countries the concept shows certain specifics both in theoretical background and empirical performance. The paper further focuses on analyzing these peculiarities. If the proper measurement of the basis in the standard case of only hard currency debt being issued is still problematic, the situation is much more complicated in a multi-curve setting when a further contingent claim on the sovereign risk in the face of local currency debt curve appears.

Our aim was to better understand the impacts of wildlife tourism on the forest ecosystem, village structure, solidarity and institutions and consider the implications of this for tiger conservation management and policy. Our results indicate that while wildlife tourism established linkages between the village society and the global economy, it negatively impacted the local community and ecology. It also created a new village entity, tourist resorts, which are neither an individual nor a village member making dispute-resolution impossible under existing institutional structures. Our results suggest that future forest and conservation policy and management strategies should de-emphasize the monetary function of wildlife-tourism, and instead focus on building social capital and strengthening local institutions. This will likely increase the adaptive capacity of villages to the impacts of tourism and mitigate the associated ecological impacts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods A systematic search was conducted to identify studies reporting health state utility values obtained using EQ-5D, SF-6D, or HUI3 alongside other HRQL measures or clinical indices for patients with skin conditions. Data on test-retest analysis for reliability, known group differences or correlation and regression analyses for validity, and change over time or responsiveness indices analysis were extracted and reviewed. Results A total of 16 papers reporting EQ-5D utilities in people with skin conditions were included in the final review. No papers for SF-6D and HUI3 were found. Evidence of reliability was not found for any of these measures. The majority of studies included in the review (12 out of 16) examined patients with plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis and the remaining four studies examined patients with either acne, hidradenitis suppurativa, hand eczema, or venous leg ulcers. The findings were generally positive in terms of performance of EQ-5D. Six studies showed that EQ-5D was able to reflect differences between severity groups and only one reported differences that were not statistically significant. Four studies found that EQ-5D detected differences between patients and the general population, and differences were statistically different for three of them. Further, moderate-to-strong correlation coefficients were found between EQ-5D and other skin-specific HRQL measures in four studies. Eight studies showed that EQ-5D was able to detect change in HRQL appropriately over time and the changes were statistically significant in seven studies. Conclusions Overall, the validity and responsiveness of the EQ-5D was found to be good in people with skin diseases, especially plaque psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. No evidence on SF-6D and HUI3 was available to enable any judgments to be made on their performance.","[Yang, Yaling] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, New Radcliffe House,Walton St, Oxford OX2 6NW, England; [Brazier, John] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England",University of Oxford; University of Sheffield; Brunel University,"Yang, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Primary Care Hlth Sci, New Radcliffe House,Walton St, Oxford OX2 6NW, England.",yaling.yang@phc.ox.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",UK Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Programme [G0901486]; NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research center; Medical Research Council [G0901486] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [G0901486] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Programme; NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research center; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This review has been conducted as part of the NICEQoL project, which is funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC)-National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Programme (ref: G0901486).

A philosophical approach to design and scenarios,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Deleuze; Design; Future; Innovation; Scenarios; Style,FORESIGHT; WORK,"Since the end of the 1980s - the Decade of Style (Mort, 1996) - the value of style in design has fallen. Recent times (Whicher et al., 2015) see a focus on style as,a sign of design's immaturity, while a more mature design should be attending to process, strategy and policy creation. Design Thinking has been enjoying its success in the same spirit, where it is championed (Brown, 2008; Martin, 2009; Neumeier, 2009 Martin, 2009; Neumeier, 2009) as a way of taking design away from its early stage as 'mere' styling, towards the more thoughtful, serious matters of business. The philosopher Gilles Deleuze is of a different mind however. 'Style,' he writes Deleuze (1995, p.31), 'amounts to innovation.' For us this engages not only a rethinking of design practice in particular, but also a reconsideration of the guiding principles of scenario planning. Deleuze's thought entails the opportunity for styling to be an act that participates in driving all creativity towards making a successful future impact (Flynn and Chatman, 2004; Cox, 2005). A philosophical disruption of current design and scenarios orthodoxies offers a way of considering that style has a key role in the production of the future. Here, then, we will investigate the creative, even innovative, opportunities that emerge from a reworking of the value of style that comes from a critique of Design Thinking, a perspective on future-thinking (especially scenario planning (e.g. Schwartz, 1991; Li, 2014; Ramirez & Selin, 2014), but also some work from organisation and management studies (e.g. Tsoukas, 2005, 2015)), and an encounter with philosophy (particularly the work of Deleuze & Guattari (1984, 1987, 1994). We will highlight the affective capacities of style - in design and scenarios, both as creative constructing of futures - by way of creatively accessing uncertainty, complexity and indeterminacy in the production of strategic maps for living (both individuals and organisations).

We examine this set of interrelated challenges, as well as some ways of meeting those challenges, through the lens of a particular case of TR: the Kaikoura Biowaste Project (KBP). We find that the KBP was at least partly successful in meeting each of the four interrelated challenges. Key to that success was our partnership with the local Maori (indigenous) community. External challenges of institutional barriers and political implementation complicated the task of meeting some internal challenges; the KBP had some but not complete success in overcoming these. We find that some familiar factors-co-leadership with an appropriate community partner, early involvement of stakeholders, significant time spent by members of the research team in the case-study community, and sensitivity to communication styles-did indeed contribute to the success of TR. In addition: strong leadership and bridging skills in the research team are key resources for overcoming institutional barriers to integration; pragmatic integration can be accomplished without epistemological interpenetration; and the active cultivation of reflexivity among researchers promotes integration. Reflexivity was facilitated by locating the process in a setting shaped and governed by a worldview different from the dominant scientific discourse, suggesting that, rather than on neutral ground, interactions with less dominant communities should take place in settings and through processes that are familiar to the community but relatively unfamiliar and therefore more challenging to the researchers.

Community, land conflict and State Forest Companies (SFCs) in Vietnam",FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Land conflicts; State Forest Company; Community; Agricultural commodities; Vietnam,,"In much of Southeast Asia, the rise of rural land conflicts and struggles often parallels market expansion into frontiers, a collage of historical state interventions, negotiations over state authority and contested legitimacy. Scholarship on Vietnam has yielded important insights on the changes wrought by new commodity booms and hybrid forms of state engagement in markets. With the recent escalation of land conflict between Vietnam's State Forest Companies (SFCs) and farmers, this paper builds on past research to examine why this current wave of SFC-farmer conflict is occurring, and what it means for the relationships between SFCs, farming communities and the central state. Based on our analysis of two sites of intense conflict, we argue that changes to SFC governance, together with rapidly evolving commodity markets and livelihood pressures are bringing a new edge to land negotiations. Policy changes that aimed to improve the efficiency of Vietnam's state companies have transformed SFCs from state-run businesses into hybrid state-private entities that are required to sustain a profit. Yet SFCs' ongoing connection with the state ensures their continued control of valuable forestlands, and emboldens SFCs to flout state rules to monopolize land and,engage local farmers in exploitative 'tenancy' contracts. For farmers, the SFC has changed from the local 'face' of the state, that heavily exploited timber, restricted local forest access and provided some local infrastructure and services, to a privileged market actor bent on profit. This situation has intensified with growing local demand for land to sustain livelihoods and to feed Chinese and global demand for cassava and softwood. While Vietnamese markets continue to reflect a strong state hand, we show that SFCs' hybrid identity as both a state and market actor poses new risks for the central state. When farmers openly challenge SFCs over land and reference colonial arrangements through the language of a 'new landlord', they question the legitimacy and role of the state in the face of new market pressures and opportunities.

Struggles over concepts and meanings in the debate about the conservation of the Bialowieza Forest in Poland,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Bialowieza Forest; Concepts; Conservation; Discourse analysis; Strategic use of discourse; Forest conflict,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; EUROPEAN-UNION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLICY; MANAGEMENT; IMPLEMENTATION; DISCOURSES; CONFLICT; LINES,"This paper addresses the long-standing debate over the conservation and management of the Bialowieza Forest in North-eastern Poland, frequently referred to as the last, large, close-to-natural, temperate, lowland forest in Europe. With the present research we aim to document how particular conceptualisations of forest shaped the debate and the fate of the Bialowieza Forest. Based on our reconstruction and analysis of argumentation, three dominant discourses could be distinguished, each offering different concepts of forest and people-forest relationships: 1. 'managerial' - with foresters presented as stewards of the forest, actively managing it for sustainable outcomes; 2. 'livelihood' - considering the forest as local heritage and underlining its role in fulfilling people's needs; and 3. 'primaeval' - highlighting the forest's intrinsic value and natural processes, being an international concern. The three discourses remained remarkably stable over the past two decades, but their status of institutionalisation evolved, which in turn influenced their hegemony and power. Importantly, our study demonstrates the active role of parties involved in the debate as they used particular concepts (their own, those of others or new ones) for strategic purposes. We conclude that both the achieved hegemony of a discourse and the particular ways by which its concepts are mobilised by actors may play a decisive role in shaping debate and its policy outcomes. We suggest that future research should focus more on the role of actors in strategically using particular forest-related concepts in concrete situations and to what effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing together literatures stressing the dependence of income inequality on the structural bargaining power of capital relative to labour, and of the dependence of accumulation on underlying institutionalized modes of state regulation, it shows that financialization has significantly enhanced top income shares net of underlying controls. Whilst the income shares of the top 1% appear responsive to variables typical of wider studies of personal income inequality, we emphasize distinctive mechanisms of top income growth linked to the rising dominance of financial instruments and actors, facilitated by a historically specific regulatory order. These conditions were key to the emergence of a state of 'asymmetric bargaining' which disproportionately enhanced the fortunes of the wealthy. Results thus emphasize the importance of class-biased power resources and underlying regulatory structures, as determinants both of income concentration and of the distribution of economic rewards beyond growth capacity alone.","Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Sociol Social Policy & Social Work, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland",Queens University Belfast,"Flaherty, E (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Sociol Social Policy & Social Work, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",e.flaherty@qub.ac.uk,,,Irish Research Council; European Research council,"Irish Research Council(Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology); European Research council(European Research Council (ERC))","This research was funded by the Irish Research Council, and the European Research council.",,94,57,61,1,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The sale of government-owned electricity companies has contributed to that liberalisation and a quarter of the proceeds of one of the world's largest privatisation programmes. In 2014, the state governments of New South Wales and Queensland announced further electricity privatisations if re-elected. Advocates claim private ownership will mean more productive investment, lower costs leading to more efficient operations, lower prices for all consumers and better market functioning without government interference. Opponents contend that the true value of government businesses is not being realised at sale, retention can achieve returns greater than those from a sale, and that follow sale, prices will rise and jobs will be lost. This article demonstrates that the claims of either lower or higher prices, of job losses and of more efficient operations are tantamount to being myths of privatisation not borne out by reality.","[Chester, Lynne] Univ Sydney, Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Chester, L (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",lynne.chester@sydney.edu.au,"Chester, Lynne/G-9854-2011","Chester, Lynne/0000-0003-2679-7401",,,,,46,14,14,0,6,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Notably, no published research has examined the labor supply mechanism by which crowd-out could occur. This study examines the effects of expansions in Medicaid eligibility for pregnant women in the late 1980s and the early 1990s on labor supply, which is one of the possible mechanisms underlying crowd-out. Estimates suggest that the 20 percentage point increase in Medicaid eligibility during the sample period was associated with an 11-13 percent decrease in the probability that a woman who gave birth in the past year was employed. Among unmarried women with less than a high school education, the change in Medicaid eligibility reduced employment by approximately 13 percent to 16 percent. We find that most of this reduction in labor supply was associated with crowd-out (i.e., movement from private to public insurance concurrent with the shift in labor supply).","[Dave, Dhaval] Bentley Univ, Dept Econ, Waltham, MA USA; [Dave, Dhaval; Kaestner, Robert; Simon, Kosali I.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Decker, Sandra L.] Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA; [Kaestner, Robert] Univ Illinois, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Simon, Kosali I.] Indiana Univ, Sch Environm & Publ Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Bentley University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centers for Disease Control & Prevention - USA; CDC National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS); University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Decker, SL (通讯作者)，Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Ctr Hlth Stat, Atlanta, GA 30333 USA.",sdecker@cdc.gov,,"simon, kosali/0000-0002-3231-1466",Intramural CDC HHS [CC999999] Funding Source: Medline,Intramural CDC HHS,,,38,37,44,0,8,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

The paper is developed based on reviews of polices, assessments of project activities, interviews with key informants, and observation of ongoing REDD + related public discussions. We found that the REDD + initiatives so far appear to have prioritized technical issues such as carbon assessment, reference scenario, and measurement, reporting and verification of emissions. However, a major policy challenge in Nepal is the substantial deforestation and degradation going on, which leads to substantial challenges of leakage and threatens Nepal's National REDD + policy ambition. The key drivers of deforestation and degradation in Nepal are still poorly identified, analyzed and understood. Inadequate focus of Nepal's present REDD + readiness on the core issues of contested forest tenure and frail governance entails that an unrealistic policy and institutional measures would be developed in addressing these issues of deforestation and degradation. Consequently, it would seriously undermine the prospect of achieving emission reduction the very goal of REDD+. It is suggested that a robust analysis, collective understanding and broadly agreed policy measures for curbing deforestation must be at the core of REDD + readiness process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Recognizing the ecosystem perspective, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory and transdisciplinary collaboration as conceptual opportunities to developing innovative and socially robust solutions is an important step in the right direction. However, because ecosystems are constantly evolving, human co-development has to account for inherent ecological uncertainty. Thus, sustainability depends on a continuous reevaluation of objectives, continuous knowledge generation, stakeholder involvement and a deeper understanding of evolving social and ecological dynamics. These requirements of continuity are hardly met by current approaches consisting of consecutive transdisciplinary projects focused on solving the most urgent problems of mismanagement at hand. Therefore, in this paper we argue for an organizational setup when pursuing an ecosystem approach and outline essential characteristics, inherent opportunities and fundamental challenges. Promising benefits of this approach include tested yet proactive interventions, public credibility, resource efficiency, long-term relationship building, community participation and ultimately sustainable development. Thereby, sustainability is aspired to and supported by a shared vision, organizational co-evolution, an organizational culture promoting innovation and an external autonomy to self-organize.

We investigate the impact of 11 self-reported long-standing health conditions on HRQoL using the EQ-5D in a UK sample. We used data from 13,955 patients in the South Yorkshire Cohort study collected between 2010 and 2012 containing the EQ-5D, a preference-based measure. Ordinary least squares (OLS), Tobit and two-part regression analyses were undertaken to estimate the impact of 11 long-standing health conditions on HRQoL at the individual level. The results varied significantly with the regression models employed. In the OLS and Tobit models, pain had the largest negative impact on HRQoL, followed by depression, osteoarthritis and anxiety/nerves, after controlling for all other conditions and sociodemographic characteristics. The magnitude of coefficients was higher in the Tobit model than in the OLS model. In the two-part model, these four long-standing health conditions were statistically significant, but the magnitude of coefficients decreased significantly compared to that in the OLS and Tobit models and was ranked from pain followed by depression, anxiety/nerves and osteoarthritis. Pain, depression, osteoarthritis and anxiety/nerves are associated with the greatest losses of HRQoL in the UK population. The estimates presented in this article should be used to inform economic evaluations when assessing health care interventions, though improvements can be made in terms of diagnostic information and obtaining longitudinal data.","[Wu, Mengjun] Univ Nottingham, Inst Mental Hlth, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England; [Brazier, John E.; Kearns, Benjamin; Relton, Clare; Cooper, Cindy L.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Smith, Christine] Barnsley Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, Dept Res & Dev, Barnsley S75 2EP, England",University of Nottingham; University of Sheffield,"Wu, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Inst Mental Hlth, Innovat Pk,Jubilee Campus,Triumph Rd, Nottingham NG7 2TU, England.",Mengjun.Wu@nottingham.ac.uk,"Cooper, Cindy L/A-2670-2010; Kearns, Benjamin/H-3686-2019; brazier, john e/B-1936-2008","Kearns, Benjamin/0000-0001-7730-668X; Relton, Clare/0000-0001-8530-5011; Cooper, Cindy/0000-0002-2995-5447; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Methodology Fellowship; Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (CLAHRC SY); NIHR,National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Methodology Fellowship(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care for South Yorkshire (CLAHRC SY); NIHR(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Ethical approval of this study was given by the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) Ethics Committee at the University of Sheffield.

While environmental successes have been made under community forestry, economic improvements, particularly for poor and marginalised groups, have proved elusive. This study examines how personal and social attributes influence the membership of the Executive Committee of Community Forestry User Groups (CFUG) in Nepal, and whether there are factors that enable the poor and disadvantaged to gain membership of the Executive Committee of CFUGs. Statistical analysis using data from the middle hill district of Baglung, Nepal indicates that decision-making positions are dominated by the local elite, who are typically from higher castes and relatively wealthy, as measured by land holdings, livestock units, food sufficiency and off-farm income. The results also suggest that leadership experience gained through participation in NGOs provides poor and disadvantaged people the ability to overcome their lower socio-economic status and gain leadership positions within CFUGs. This is an important outcome in that it provides an opening for policy initiatives that encourage the development of leadership skills for the poor and disadvantaged, which in turn will improve representation of these groups.

When an RCT is infeasible, regression modeling or statistical matching are often used instead. Nonexperimental methods such as these could produce unbiased estimates if the underlying assumptions hold, but those assumptions are usually not testable. Most prior studies testing nonexperimental designs find that they fail to produce unbiased estimates, but these studies have examined weaker evaluation designs. The present study addresses these limitations using student-level data based on a large-scale RCT of charter schools for which standardized achievement tests are the key outcome measure. The use of baseline data that are strongly predictive of the key outcome measures considerably reduces but might not completely eliminate bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Community forests provide a range of benefits, from direct forest products such as timber and non-provisioning ecosystem services such as soil protection. There is a need to understand the extent to which environmental and community benefits are joint products or substitutes. Stochastic frontier production analysis (SFPA) was used to study the production relationship between environmental and community benefits and production efficiency analysis to study the extent to which communities were able to achieve maximum benefits. SFPA indicated that the magnitude of direct forest product benefits was influenced by various socioeconomic and forest related factors such as distance to the government office, community forest size, and group heterogeneity negatively affect community forest products benefits. On the other hand, links to the market, forest products dependency, and the number of households in the community augment benefits from community forests. In addition, forest product benefits and environmental benefits were complementary to each other. Production efficiency analysis showed that communities were not producing forest products efficiently. Factors such as social capital contributed positively to production efficiency, whereas caste heterogeneity in the executive committees of community forest user groups was negatively associated with efficiency. These findings can contribute to better implementation of community forestry programmes in Nepal, improving the welfare of communities by increasing direct forest product benefits without environmental harm.

The idea that the principles, axioms, adages and devices elaborated by its proponents any longer possess traction in the present is rarely countenanced. In contrast to this customary view, the present article seeks to indicate the continuing significance of classical organization theory, for both analysing and intervening in organizational life. This necessitates a reconstruction of the conventional understanding of this received term, one in which classical organization theory is viewed less as 'theory' in the conventional sense, but rather as a geographically dispersed, institutionally disconnected and historically discontinuous 'stance', characterized, inter alia, by a pragmatist call to experience, an antithetical attitude to 'high' or transcendental theorizing, and, not least, an ethical focus on organizational effectiveness born of a close connection to 'the work itself' or 'the situation at hand'. Deploying the term 'classic organization theory' in this way, to refer to a stance, attitude or comportment, and an associated persona that bears it, we are able to highlight the significant differences between this comportment and the increasingly 'metaphysical' attitude characterizing many contemporary approaches to organization and organizing, not simply in organization studies, but also more widely in sociology and cultural economy.","[Du Gay, Paul] Copenhagen Business Sch IOA, Kilen Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg F, Denmark",,"Du Gay, P (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch IOA, Kilen Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg F, Denmark.",pdg.ioa@cbs.dk,,"du Gay, Paul/0000-0002-9182-6830",Velux Foundation in Denmark,Velux Foundation in Denmark,The research supporting this article was funded by the Velux Foundation in Denmark.,,43,5,8,4,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The raising education is in the interest of each country, because the economic activity of its inhabitants has been increased. The aim of this work was to analyze and evaluate the education development of the population the European Union, its level and variability in the set 27 member countries and the education effect on the labor market. The subject analysis was a productive part of the population aged 25-64 in the period 2000-2011. The initial data were obtained from the statistical evidence Eurostat for the analysis. The analysis was based on the chosen indicators: people percentage with at least upper secondary education, graduates percentage of lifelong learning and the unemployment rate. The development was observed throughout the European Union. A positive development was proved on higher educational attainment for the person percentage. The growth was increased during the reporting period and men showed higher values than women. Over time, the differences decreased gradually. In the case of graduate percentage of lifelong education took a sharp increase followed by a slow decrease to 2005, while the women percentage was higher than among men. The empirical values both education indicators were aligned appropriate trendy polynomial functions such as linear and quadratic functions. The trend was also expressed in the unemployment rate as selected labor market indicators, and in this case it was a polynomial of higher degree. The set of all the 27 member countries was evaluated in the last year that in 2011, while the selected indicators of development have belonged to the European Union as a whole unit. Due to the fact that more or less differences were occurred among the countries, they were divided into homogeneous groups and then evaluated according to the indicators of education and unemployment. The determination groups and classification countries were done using cluster analysis, namely the farthest neighbor method for Euclidean distances. The initial values were converted to standardized values of zero and unit-level variability for the application cluster analysis. 4 groups (clusters) were created based on the dendrogram and depicted in the graph of clusters including the classification individual countries. Southern European countries have showed a low level of education especially (Malta, Portugal, Italy, Spain), while the high education of the population has been achieved in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Lithuania, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Germany). The unemployment is highest in Spain. The set of countries of the European Union was described summarized characteristics of level and variability in terms of education and unemployment. The level was incomparable. The variability was approximately twice as large in unemployment than in education. The frequency distribution figure emphasizes the right-sided education partition versus left-sided unemployment partition. The education quantification and its impact on the unemployment has been an important result. Indirect and very low dependence was proved in the value the correlation coefficient r = -0.1042 in terms direction and degree. The regression function (y' = 12.09 -0.029 x) indicates a 10 % increase in population proportion of the aged 25-64 with upper secondary and tertiary education has led to reduction the unemployment by an average of 0.29 %. In the case of the group formation was proved highly significant difference among groups in the unemployment level according to standard education classification levels 0-2, 3-4, 5-6 (ISCED 1997). The dependence of the unemployment on education has been confirmed.","[Dufek, Jaroslav; Somerlikova, Kristina] Mendelova Univ, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Ustav Demografie & Aplikovane Stat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sapakova, Eva] Mendelova Univ, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Ustav Jazykovych & Kulturnich Studii, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Dufek, J (通讯作者)，Mendelova Univ, Fak Regionalniho Rozvoje & Mezinarodnich Studii, Ustav Demografie & Aplikovane Stat, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",dufek@mendelu.cz; somerlik@mendelu.cz; eva.sapakova@mendelu.cz,"Somerlikova, Kristina/E-4852-2018","Somerlikova, Kristina/0000-0001-9093-6707",,,,,6,0,0,0,3,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,175,185,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800017,0

Subsequently, the COPRAS-G method is utilized to select the best IB branch. For the case study IB branches of four Turkish banks are evaluated. With the use of FAHP method, security is the most important factor affecting IB performance and followed by complexity. Furthermore, Garanti Bankasi has the best IB branch in Turkey. Consequently, the proposed model provides comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluate the performance of IB branches and can be recommended to banks so that they can improve their IB operations to achieve a higher performance and client satisfaction level under fuzzy environments.","Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Afyon, Turkey",Afyon Kocatepe University,"Ecer, F (通讯作者)，Afyon Kocatepe Univ, Afyon, Turkey.",fecer@aku.edu.tr,"Ecer, Fatih/AAE-8455-2020","Ecer, Fatih/0000-0002-6174-3241",,,,,25,22,22,0,17,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

J,"Gavin, B",,,,"Gavin, Brigid",,,Sustainable Development of China's Rare Earth Industry within and without the WTO,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"China's rise to become the dominant global producer of rare earth minerals has caused severe environmental damage and rapid depletion of its natural resources. To rectify these problems and achieve sustainable development of the industry, the Chinese government has adopted a policy of export restrictions which has led to conflict with its trade partners. A World Trade Organization (WTO) panel has judged China's policy to be in violation of its trade obligations which has been upheld in appeal. This article presents a broad analysis of sustainable development relating to the rare earth industry. In recognizing growing global demand for these minerals, which provide essential inputs for the new green technologies, it explores how a more complementary relationship between economic development and conservation of natural capital can be achieved. Improving resource efficiency throughout the whole production chain is of key importance for resource conservation. The use of adequate environmental technologies and effective environmental policies are key to minimizing the risks for environmental damage and human health. The new initiative for liberalization of Environmental Goods and Services (EGS) in the WTO can make leading environmental technologies available at a lower cost for China. But green trade liberalization alone cannot achieve sustainable development. A new form of international cooperation in the form of networked governance must operate alongside the WTO to combine governance of global economic and ecological integration. Since the publication of the Brundtland Report, the concept of sustainable development has been generally understood as the requirement to meet the needs of the current generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.(1) But this is a vague concept which has proved difficult to implement in practice. There is no internationally agreed method for measuring sustainable development and no internationally accepted indicators to monitor its progress in practice.(2) In particular; there is no satisfactory indicator for 'natural capital' which is central to achieving sustainable development. Natural capital is defined as the stock of natural resources or, environmental assets that yields allow of useful goods and services into the future.; This concept creates a new synthesis integrating two previously opposing world views. On the one hand, man-made capital which comprises physical, financial and human capital, has well-established roots in economic theory. On the other hand, natural capital, comprising natural resources and the environment has been developed more recently by ecological economics. Whereas, man-made capital has been traditionally treated as a scarce good which is priced accordingly in the market, natural capital has for long been considered as part of the 'global commons' and so largely treated as a free good.(4) But this dichotomy is no longer tenable today. The financial sector now acknowledges that natural capital has a real monetary value, estimating that ecosystem goods and services from natural capital are worth trillions of US Dollars every year which constitute essentials such as food, fibre, water, health, energy etc. At the Rio+20 Earth Summit (2012) financial institutions endorsed The Natural Capital Declaration' which commits them to integrating natural capital considerations into financial products and services for the twenty-first century. To support this goal, they called upon governments and the private sector to move beyond financial accounting and to incorporate natural capital into their accounts in order to recognize the true cost of economic growth. The declaration aims to provide 'the roadmap to a green economy'.(5) Rare earth minerals are a crucially important part of global natural capital. Because of their unique properties, they provide essential components for high technology applications in industry, defence and civilian sectors. But they will be even more important in the future because of their use in the new green technologies such as renewable energy, hybrid electric vehicles, energy efficient lighting and so forth. This begs the question how to ensure a sustainable supply of rare earths that is produced in a way that will minimize the negative impact on the environment. China has now become the dominant global power in the rare earth industry as it has gradually overtaken the US to become the global leader since the 1980s. Up to then, the US supplied 100% of its domestic demand and 30% of global demand. But since the active mining operations of Mountain Pass mine in California ceased in 2002, China has risen to a position of global dominance. Although rare earths are spread over the earth's crust, China has the most concentrated reserves, accounting for some 30% of total global reserves; it currently produces over 90% of the world's rare earth minerals and consumes some 60% of those raw materials in its downstream processing industries.(6) In recent years, China has demonstrated its ability to use its dominant economic power by progressively restricting exports of rare earth minerals thereby distorting international markets. As China's industry expanded rapidly from 1985 to 2005, China supplied an abundance of rare earths to the rest of the world at extremely low prices. Since 2006, however, the Chinese government has imposed increasingly restrictive export measures. The year 2010 was a major turning point when export quotas were cut back significantly - by up to 40%, resulting in a major imbalance between global supply and demand and fear of shortages in the importing countries. As the demand for rare earths in coming years is predicted to grow faster than global production, this has turned rare earths into an issue of global importance for the global economy and, especially, for the emergence of a global green economy. The Chinese government vigorously defends its policy of export restrictions on the grounds of its commitment to sustainable development. In 2011, the State Council published a high level policy pan for comprehensive regulation of the industry emphasizing sustainable development. This was followed by an operational White Paper in 2012 and on the occasion of its publication the Vice-Minister of Industry and Information Technology told a press conference that China's imposition of export quotas and tougher regulations for the rare earth sector are aimed at protecting the environment and public health.(8) These official publications indicate that China places primary importance on sustainable development in its current restructuring of the industry. Few would dispute that China's successful economic development has come at a high price for the environment. That is true, in particular, for the rare earth sector where the last forty years of development has left a legacy of serious environmental damage. It is in this context that the WTO has recently handed down a severe judgment on China's rare earth policy, in response to the formal complaint launched by the US, the European Union (EU) and Japan. The Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) concluded that China's export restrictions were designed more for industrial policy than for conservation of natural resources and the environment. While the WTO allows its member countries to take measures for conservation and environment but it does not allow any member to control the international market for a natural resource, which is what China has actually done. Moreover, the Chinese measures have served to encourage domestic production and secure preferential use of those materials by Chinese mamifacturers.(9) How does this judgment fit with the international community's commitment to sustainable development? Since its foundation in 1994, the WTO has espoused sustainable development as a general principle and has constantly affirmed the positive relationship between its work of trade liberalization and the broader efforts of the United Nations (UN) to achieve sustainable development. But the breakdown of the Doha Round negotiations has led to institutional stalemate with the result that there is no robust mechanism for sustainable development in the WTO. This is a major obstacle because it prevents the kind of global governance necessary for management of economic and ecological interdependence that is indispensable for the achievement of sustainable development.(10) This article addresses the broader issues of sustainable development in the rare earth industry and explores what can be done within and without the WTO irrespective of the judgment handed down on China's policy. Section one reviews the contribution of economic analysis to sustainable development. Section two provides a diagnostic profile of China's economic development of the industry and its environmental impact. Section three discusses the new initiative for the liberalization of EGS in the WTO and how this needs to be supported by new forms of international policy cooperation outside of the WTO. The final section presents our conclusion.","[Gavin, Brigid] European Inst Asian Studies, Brussels, Belgium; [Gavin, Brigid] Europa Acad Otzenhausen, EU Asia Trade Relat, Nonnweiler, Germany",,"Gavin, B (通讯作者)，European Inst Asian Studies, Brussels, Belgium.",brigid.gavin@skynet.be,,,,,,,33,8,8,4,94,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Our results suggest that in the absence of a strong institutional and regulatory framework, economic policies have only a limited effect on stabilizing an emerging market.","[Hussain, Syed Mujahid; Korkeamaki, Timo] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Financial Econ, Helsinki, Finland; [Xu, Danielle] Gonzaga Univ, Sch Business, Spokane, WA 99258 USA; [Khan, Ashfaque Hasan] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Business, Islamabad, Pakistan",Hanken School of Economics; Gonzaga University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Hussain, SM (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Financial Econ, Helsinki, Finland.",syed.mujahid@hanken.fi,"Hussain, Syed Mujahid/X-6917-2019; Korkeamäki, Timo/ABF-1538-2020","Hussain, Syed Mujahid/0000-0001-7714-9602; Korkeamäki, Timo/0000-0002-8925-6103",OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation,Financial support from the OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,,38,7,7,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Project management methods are very important and have successfully and effectively been used by many international and national companies especially in the field of regional development. In this age of globalization, efforts to effectively and consistently manage, lead and coordinate the various processes in a company, plays an increasingly important role in the integrity and homogeneity of management principles. This effort corresponds to the implementation and application of the principles of project management (project management - PM), whose standards (baselines) provide the desired uniform approach and procedures in the management process. An effort was made in the Czech Republic in the 1990s to implement the principles and knowledge of project management methods. However, when it became necessary for the collaboration and cooperation, especially with international IT companies or banking with foreign partners, it became important to provide sufficient motivation for the development and dissemination of training courses to train prospective workers issue them with certificates in this field. Its important role included the possibility of obtaining European projects, whose conditions for realization depended on the guarantee of quality and experienced project team. We can therefore assume that these facts increased or contributed to the significant interest in project management as a discipline. The are two possible ways to be educated in the field of project management in the Czech Republic. The first option is to attend a project management courses run by project management professionals in both theory and practical experience to obtain an International certificate (IPMA, PMI, PRINCE 2) at the end of the course. The second option, are courses run by Universities as part of their curriculum to bring the awareness of project management to their students. It is not imaginable to develop cities and regions without the projects and all these projects must be managed by professionally competent and experienced project managers. The purpose of this paper is to suggest the minimum requirements for the position of professional managers to ensure effective management of regional projects. Finally, from the obtained results, the paper will outline the necessary techniques and tools that a project manager must perfectly know in order to fulfil the objectives of the project and thus contribute to the achievement of the anticipated benefits. Comparative analysis methods will be used to compare the following international standards IPMA, PMI and PRINCE 2 and come out with recommendations for their use in the management of regional projects.",,,,,"Máchal, Pavel/J-2599-2018",,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,631,640,,,,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800061,0

We consider the correlation of memes as DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic Acid) of the mind with knowledge and the organizational context. Our approach is interpretivist, reflective and dialectic (Cecez-Kecmanovic, 2011). It seeks to overcome the limits of knowledge induced by the highly mathematical models that are featured in specialized literature and often taken over in software applications. Yet we have to consider the subjectivism of the information that we process (Von Bayer, 2004). Depending on the country or the region, we can notice that there are discrepancies between our own perceptions and the perceptions of our fellows. Human behaviour adjusts depending on our own experiences that are also specific to the environment in which we live (Lorenz, 1969). Can actual information security risk assessment models provide objective, sci-entific information on a wide range of social and technological risks? Can indi-viduals develop unique and precise judgments that can be limited only to math-ematic forms and calculus? Risk does not exist 'out there', independent of our minds and cultures, waiting to be measured (Slovic, 1992).

The developed framework uses the Anghel bankruptcy prediction model which is ranked by the local specialists as one of the most representative and actual autochthonous model. Also, our decision regarding the modeling of Anghel bankruptcy prediction function was based on the high accuracy rate of the model which is higher that 95%. Thus, through the UML modeling of the Anghel function it was intended to highlight the extent to which current economic transactions, carried out within the company (sales, purchasing, commissioning), submit through accounting operations (which supplies the balance of accounts) items in the annual financial statements information that determines the final score of Anghel function. Due to such application, any company could be able to find out at any moment the Anghel score value and hence the company's financial status (which can be either financial stability or bankruptcy risk). Owning such information could be vital for the company because, in the case of financial instability warning, the top management will have a sufficient margin of time to bring the activity to a healthy state and thus to prevent the bankruptcy settlement. Furthermore, the current UML developed model can be acquired by a add-on computer application and integrated into an ERP system within a Business Intelligence Component or a Scorecard component/module. Through such integration, the application will benefit from the computerization of other ERP modules from which will be able to retrieve information regarding the account balances. Such information is necessary to determine the cumulative, multi-level hierarchical Z-score value function as presented in our detailed UML model. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Likewise, the supplier may have a distorted idea of how much individual parameters of the offer are important to the customers when choosing a supplier and how they evaluate the offer. Evaluation of the supplier performance by customers was the subject of a quantitative research that was conducted in body shops in the Czech Republic. A partial aim of the research was to determine the criteria according to which current and potential customers choose suppliers of material for their body shops and how they are satisfied with them. To analyse data obtained through personal and Internet inquiries in particular body shops, methods of descriptive and inferential statistics were used, while maps of perception were used to show the differences between the assessment of the significance and the level of individual criteria. An analysis of the results showed that even though existing customers are positive about those parameters of the supplier's offer that are important to them, the potential for improvement is in the area of improving product quality, speed of response to customer requests, comprehensiveness and quality of services and prices of the delivered material. While being also positive about their existing supplier, potential customers see reserves primarily in various forms of sales promotion and offer of loyalty programs, in communication and professionalism of the supplier and the range of products and delivery dates. The research has shown ways to improve the company's performance in relation to existing customers and parameters of the supply on which the company should focus when attracting new customers.

Politicians on both sides talked about deep economic integration, 'a stake in the internal market', 'everything but institutions', and arrangements that could be as close as what the EU has with countries like Norway or Iceland in the European Economic Area. This article aims to examine to what extent the great hopes with which the ENP was greeted both in the EU and in Israel have materialized, in particular in the field of international trade and economic integration. The article compares the actual achievements with the original goals of the ENP Action Plan and finds more disappointments than. achievements. Among the achievements, the article describes and analyses the Agreement on Conformity Assessment and Acceptance for industrial products concluded in 2012 and the bilateral aviation agreement ('Open Skies'), as well as Israel's accession and successful participation in the EU scientific research and technical development programmes (including the 'Horizon 2020'). The list of what could and should have been done, however, is longer and more disappointing, and it includes issues such as trade facilitation through modernization of customs administration, revision of outdated protectionist rules of origin, and the EU's failure to contribute to peace in the Middle East by refusing to recognize diagonal cumulation of origin between Israel and its neighbours. Likewise, the lack of any progress on important topics such as competition rules, public procurement, trade in financial and professional services, e-commerce and investment, to name a few, outweighs the few achievements that can be noted.

As a consequence, the European Commission is taking action on enhancing entrepreneurship and recommends appropriate entrepreneurship training in schools and higher education. Besides other factors, entrepreneurship education is often characterised by creativity, problem solving, interdisciplinarity and practice orientation. With respect to these aspects, universities might not be the right environment to launch an education for entrepreneurship and creativity. They are often inflexible institutions characterised by bureaucratic structures, laborious decision processes, and highly regulated procedures. Although they should teach entrepreneurship and creativity, they are caught up in bureaucracy and stagnancy themselves. Nevertheless, universities are obliged by government to contribute essentially to entrepreneurship education. In this case study, we examined the integration of entrepreneurship education under the challenging circumstances mentioned above. The university in this case study is home to more than 32,000 students and 4,000 employees, 6 faculties, 76 departments, and about 120 study programs. Due to cooperation with other institutions, about 60,000 students are allowed to participate. The program in this study provides basics in management, entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship to increase general employability and to promote creativity, interdisciplinary thinking and entrepreneurial acting. The findings of our study indicate the importance of a setting that allows students to participate irrespective of their discipline or the progress in their studies. Moreover, it seems advantageous that students can customise the program according to their specific needs. The importance of flexible integration into regular academic studies has to be emphasised. In this study, we provide an adequate solution to master this challenge in a bureaucratic environment.","[Rybnicek, Robert; Ruhri, Matthias; Suk, Katharina] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Rybnicek, R (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria.",robert.rybnicek@uni-graz.at; matthias.ruhri@uni-graz.at; katharina.suk@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,542,550,,,,,,9,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000049,0

It discusses definitions of terrorism, introduces basic typologies of terrorism, and focuses on the group dynamics of terrorist groups. Terrorism is a form of organized, systematic and calculated violence, which is typically directed against uninvolved people and their property, with subsequent media coverage of attacks, in which the perpetrators communicate their demands and define their goals. Fear, then controls public opinion, helping them to achieve their political, religious and ideological objectives. The secondary, psychological dimensions of a terrorist act are more important than its primary effect, because the main aim is to terrorize civilians, police officers, and government authorities; hence, the provocation of insecurity, and the causing of tension and doubt, which is intended to distract officials from a responsible and reliable performance of their duties and responsibilities. A substantial part of the paper is devoted to the causes, conditions, motives (rational, psychological, cultural) and effects of terrorism (fear, uncertainty in financial markets, restrictions placed on personal freedom, etc.). Global terrorism, affects the social, economic and psychological experience of individuals and social groups, and is therefore discussed. Global terrorism is considered to be the fourth wave of terrorism, and is associated with the phenomenon of globalization. It is characterized by a decentralized organizational structure and a very loose ideological vision. On the basis of the methods employed in a terrorist act, terrorism may be classified as either (1) conventional terrorism or (2) modern terrorism, also now known as new global terrorism. Even opponents of the division of terrorism into old and new, agree on several features that have characterized terrorism in recent years; these include attacks on city centers, large numbers of casualties, intent to have economic impact, kidnapping for extortion, and stronger links with organized crime. Certainly, the consequences of terrorism are well known: victims and injuries, material damage, international instability, economic losses (such as declines in stock markets, declines in the price of oil and other commodities, safety measures, etc.), uncertainty and tension. The paper discusses the influence of the media (television, internet) and its portrayal of global terrorism. Information for this contribution was derived from a review of various sources on the psychosocial aspects of terrorism, including peer-reviewed articles, books and book chapters, news items, reports, and personal communications with terrorism experts in the Czech Republic.","[Smolik, Josef] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Smolik, J (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Trida Gen Piky 2005-7, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",josef.smolik@mendelu.cz,"Smolik, Josef/E-2442-2018","Smolik, Josef/0000-0001-5841-8598",,,,,50,0,0,4,26,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,1033,1043,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800099,0

The EAU guidelines on prostate cancer consider that radical prostatectomy in high risk disease represents an option for selected patients alone or in association with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and/or hormonal therapy (HoT). Objective: This article presents our experience in the management of men with locally advanced prostate cancer using open radical prostatectomy as the first step in a multimodal approach. Material and Method: We conducted a retrospective study during 2008-2014 which included 204 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who underwent open radical prostatectomy with extended bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection (eLND) in our Center. Biochemical recurrence was considered an increase in postoperative PSA >0.2 ng/dl confirmed by a second measurement after a minimum of 2 weeks. Local recurrence was detected by digital rectal examination and/or imaging studies. Salvage treatment (EBRT +/- HoT) was decided by the urologists depending on pathological and imaging findings at the time of BCR. Primary endpoints were considered cancer specific survival (CSS), overall survival (OS), biochemical recurrence (BCR) at 5 years. In order to identify predictive factors in BCR we constructed several models using logistic, probabilistic regressions and Bayesian analysis (recognition of forms). Results: In our study median age at surgery was 65 years (range, 52 to 74). Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 17.9 ng/ml (interval 4.9-24.9) and median follow-up was 55.3 months (interval: 12-63). Mean time to biochemical recurrence was 21.11 months (interval 15-54), with a higher PSA doubling time in patients with multiple adverse characteristics (positive surgical margins, LNI, high pathological stage). High-risk patients with poorly differentiated tumors showed significantly lower survival and higher progression rates compared to those with well or moderately differentiated tumors. The biochemical recurrence-free survival at 5 years was 55.89% while cancer-specific survival varied only marginally from OS at 5 years (80.8% and 82.84% respectively). The results obtained by these regression models were similar in terms of parameter significance, thus confirming the validity and consistency of the results. Conclusions. Our data showed excellent long-term outcome for patients with high risk prostate cancer treated with surgery as first step in a multimodal approach. High risk patients with multiple adverse Actors have presented early biochemical recurrence and need adjuvant treatment following surgery.","[Surcel, Cristian; Mirvald, Cristian; Sinescu, I.] Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Bucharest, Romania; [Surcel, Cristian; Mirvald, Cristian; Pavelescu, Cristian; Mihai, Victor; Najjar, Salam; Sinescu, I.] Fundeni Clin Inst, Ctr Urol Surg Dialysis & Renal Transplantat, Bucharest, Romania; [Savu, Carmen] Ctr Urol Surg, Anesthesiol & Intens Care Unit, Dialysis, Bucharest, Romania; [Savu, Carmen] Fundeni Clin Inst, Renal Transplantat, Bucharest, Romania",Carol Davila University of Medicine & Pharmacy; Institutul Clinic Fundeni; Institutul Clinic Fundeni,"Surcel, C (通讯作者)，Carol Davila Univ Med & Pharm, Bucharest, Romania.",drsurcel@gmail.com,"Cristian, Mirvald/AAG-4704-2021; Surcel, Cristian Iulius/ADU-8784-2022; SINESCU, IOANEL/JJG-2360-2023","Cristian, Mirvald/0000-0002-7278-5551; Surcel, Cristian Iulius/0009-0000-7658-1540; SINESCU, IOANEL/0000-0002-7646-9804",,,,,23,0,0,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The first set of tools is an accounting methodology solution; the second is the computational procedure using calculations. The synthesis solution is implied in the construction of the so-called conversion matrix. The importance of corporate accounting is in recognition of the initial breakdown of costs in terms of business as a whole. This system, however, in addition to the automatic control allows extension to lower economic units in the form of so-called internal accounting circuit, which is more flexible due to the extent of its richness of detail and cost breakdown, apparently rendered to internal registers. Internal accounting circuit cannot work without linkages to other economic management tools. One of them is a preliminary calculation of direct costs. The second tool is budget in overhead costs. These links need to cover the mentioned two aspects, namely the aspect of power and formations.

We present an approach to modelling extremal claim severity using regression model based on the individual characteristics (rating factors) of policyholders because the model based on the risk theory for all claims is not as convenient when we need to obtain estimates of individual claims. Thus, we assume that the individual claim severity follows mixed distribution using the gamma distribution and generalized Pareto (GP) distribution with various parameters for all of the policyholders. However, while the claim frequency is known, the frequency of regular and extremal claims is not. So, we also present a method how to identify the threshold value (location parameter of GP distribution) which defines the extremal claims and we estimate the generalized Pareto regression model for extremal events using the real block of motor hull insurance policies.","[Valecky, Jiri] VSB TU, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Valecky, J (通讯作者)，VSB TU, Fac Econ, Dept Finance, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jiri.valecky@vsb.cz,"Valecký, Jiří/I-3625-2018","Valecký, Jiří/0000-0002-5978-6111",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,865,869,,,,,,5,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900148,0

An analysis of policy documents, research statements, and national accounts reveals this paradoxical coexistence of anxiety and progress in the discourse on knowledge economies. While the concept is often hailed as a temporal concept (superseding other forms of economic production), this article argues that a knowledge economy is best understood as a spatial concept - it is a way of contending with global reorganizations of production. This spatial approach is elaborated to tackle three paradoxes. (1) A knowledge economy enfolds defeat with progress. (2) A knowledge economy downplays the importance of industrial labor and simultaneously depends on it to materialize its ideas. (3) While seemingly intangible and ephemeral, a knowledge economy is fixed in place in national economies through government and corporate policy (including through the emergent phenomenon of 'knowledge-adjusted gross domestic products'). A spatial approach provides a view of the tenuous global interconnections and specific conditions that prop up a knowledge economy, and shows how the concept is mobilized to redraw the map so that endangered economies can regain their challenged sense of centrality in a world economy.","[van Eekelen, Bregje] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hist Soc, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"van Eekelen, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Dept Hist Soc, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",vaneekelen@eshcc.eur.nl,,,University of California; UvA Employability Fund Fellowship; Catharina van Tussenbroek Fellowship; Henriette 575 Sara De Lanoy Meijer Fellowship,University of California(University of California System); UvA Employability Fund Fellowship; Catharina van Tussenbroek Fellowship; Henriette 575 Sara De Lanoy Meijer Fellowship,"Research for this article was funded by a University of California Chancellor's Fellowship, UvA Employability Fund Fellowship, Catharina van Tussenbroek Fellowship, and Henriette 575 Sara De Lanoy Meijer Fellowship.

For elementary school teachers, effectiveness measures are highly stable across subgroups, with correlations upward of 0.9. The estimated cross-subject correlation between math and English language arts is around 0.7, suggesting some differential effectiveness by subject. To understand the magnitude of this correlation, I simulate targeted re-sorting of teachers to classrooms based on their comparative advantage.

Given a predominance of family forests in the southern United States, forest management decisions of family forest owners are important in influencing the quantity and types of ecosystem services produced. The main study objective was to determine the proportion of family forest land in Mississippi that landowners would be interested in managing for the production of ecosystem services based on a mail survey of 2025 landowners. Approximately, 64% of landowners were interested in managing their forest land for ecosystem services indicating a potential for increasing the production of these services in Mississippi. Weighted least squares (WLS) regression results indicated that importance of personal recreation ownership goal, percentage of forest land area under bottomland hardwoods, percentage of forest land area under natural mixed forests, and past participation in conservation programs were positively associated with the proportion of forest area that landowners were interested in managing for ecosystem services (p < 0.05). Future programs should reflect the needs of different landowner socioeconomic groups-and incorporate their forest ownership objectives to increase the production of ecosystem services.

This article shows that the process of deforestation and the rapid oil palm expansion cannot be viewed in isolation from broader development contexts. Various actors at local, national, and global levels have used development narratives and poverty alleviation through various policies and institutional setting to create spaces and opportunities for oil palm development. These actors also deliberately created the notion of forest crisis by omitting the values of forest environmental services to justify forest conversion into oil palm plantations. These multiple factors shaped the speed and the direction of oil palm expansion in Indonesia. This rapid oil palm expansion in Indonesia has resulted in massive LUCC and serious environmental problems. Given these complexities, a single policy will not be sufficient when it comes to managing the consequences of rapid oil palm expansion in Indonesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Without institutions that facilitate appropriate health care transactions, patients tend to navigate health care markets from one inappropriate provider to another, receiving sub-optimal care, before they find appropriate providers; all the while incurring personal transaction costs. But the top-down interventions to address this barrier to accessing care are hampered by weak governments, as informal providers are entrenched in communities. To explore the role that communities could play in limiting informal providers, we applied the transaction costs theory of the firm which predicts that economic agents tend to organise production within firms when the costs of coordinating exchange through the market are greater than within a firm. In a realist analysis of qualitative data from Nigeria, we found that community health committees sometimes seek to limit informal providers in a manner that is consistent with the transaction costs theory of the firm. The committees deal not through legal sanction but by subtle influence and persuasion in a slow and faltering process of institutional change, leveraging the authority and resources available within their community, and from governments and NGOs. First, they provide information to reduce the market share controlled by informal providers, and then regulation to keep informal providers at bay while making the formal provider more competitive. When these efforts are ineffective or insufficient, committees are faced with a make-or-buy decision. The make decision involves coordination to co-produce formal health services and facilitate referrals from informal to formal providers. What sometimes results is a quasi-firm-informal and formal providers are networked in a single but loose production unit. These findings suggest that efforts to limit informal providers should seek to, among other things, augment existing community responses.","[Abimbola, Seye; Charles-Okoli, Augustina N.; Negin, Joel; Martiniuk, Alexandra L.; Jan, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sch Publ Hlth, Rm 128C,Edward Ford Bldg A27, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Abimbola, Seye] Natl Primary Hlth Care Dev, Abuja, Fct, Nigeria; [Abimbola, Seye; Martiniuk, Alexandra L.; Jan, Stephen] George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Ogunsina, Kemi] Univ Alabama Birmingham, Dept Epidemiol, Birmingham, AL USA; [Charles-Okoli, Augustina N.] Univ Nigeria, Teaching Hosp, Dept Community Med, Ituku Ozalla, Enugu, Nigeria; [Martiniuk, Alexandra L.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Sydney; University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Birmingham; University of Nigeria; University of Toronto,"Abimbola, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney Med Sch, Sch Publ Hlth, Rm 128C,Edward Ford Bldg A27, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Abimbola, S (通讯作者)，Natl Primary Hlth Care Dev, Abuja, Fct, Nigeria.;Abimbola, S (通讯作者)，George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",seye.abimbola@sydney.edu.au,"Ogunsina, Kemi/AAZ-1393-2020; Peters, Dorien/AFH-8507-2022; Martiniuk, Alexandra/K-2600-2019; Jan, Stephen/AAG-3333-2021","Ogunsina, Kemi/0000-0002-1616-0944; Peters, Dorien/0000-0001-6974-7143; Martiniuk, Alexandra/0000-0003-1368-8206; Jan, Stephen/0000-0003-2839-1405; Abimbola, Seye/0000-0003-1294-3850",,,,,58,15,16,0,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

To that end, several policies, including hybrid price-quantity mechanisms and the newly introduced market stability reserve (MSR) systems, have been introduced and even implemented in some cases. I develop a stochastic dynamic model of a cap-and-trade system, parameterized to values relevant to the European Union's Emission Trading System (EU ETS) to analyze the performance of these policies aimed at adding stability to the system or at least at reducing perceived over allocations of permits. Results suggest that adaptive-allocation mechanisms such as a price collar or MSR can reduce permit over-allocations and permit price volatility in a more cost-effective manner than simply reducing scheduled permit allocations. However, it is also found that the performance of these adaptive allocation policies, and in particular the MSR, are greatly affected by assumed discount rates and policy parameters.

Chinese trends in R&D and patenting are compared to those of the countries of the 'triad' (the European Union, Japan and the US), as well as to those of other large emerging economies (Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa). The analysis demonstrates how both in innovation inputs and outputs China reflects an innovation reality closer to that of the most developed areas of the world than to that of other emerging countries. However, the rapid ascent of Chinese innovation has generated a distinct set of territorial dynamics, with innovation much more geographically concentrated than elsewhere in the world and more reliant on agglomeration forces than on more traditional 'innovative' drivers. Such a distinct geography of innovation may have until now facilitated the innovation surge in China, but poses serious future risks in terms of the sustainability of the system.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; Wilkie, Callum] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk; j.c.wilkie@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union/ERC [269868],European Research Council under the European Union/ERC(European Research Council (ERC)),"We would like to thank Steven Brakman and Charles van Marrewijk for encouragement in writing this paper, as well as three anonymous reviewers for incisive suggestions to earlier versions of the manuscript.

This article explores the integration of NTFPs into forest policy discourse in Mexico as a strategy to support livelihood, conservation and cultural goals. Building on the scientific global literature on the subject, we identified 13 prominent NTFP management questions, including the ecological impacts of marketing NTFPs, the distribution of benefits of NTFP production among local populations, and rights of access to NTFP collection. To structure the analysis of Mexican policy we addressed these questions and processed three general dimensions most relevant to policy implementation-these are associated with the oftentimes competing policy goals of supporting rural peoples livelihoods, environmental conservation, and strengthening culture (not only of indigenous peoples, but rural people in general). Subsequently we performed an evaluation of key forest policy instruments in Mexico, based on the three dimensions identified, in the effort to learn how successfully forest policy has integrated these dimensions. We conclude that although NTFPs are integrated into Mexican forest policy, drawbacks to their integration remain, related to the diversity in thenature, scale and marketing of these products, as well as to the diversity of local actors involved.

This article conceptualizes the conditions in which venture capital (VC) demonstrates patience in an effort to better understand the sources of patient capital available for start-up companies. VC investment stage is identified as a key determinant of VC patience. VC 'seed stage' investing demonstrates patience through its long intended investment horizon, engagement focused on long-term value and loyalty in the face of poor short-term performance. Companies receiving seed funding, then 'follow-on' funding, receive the most patient form of VC. An empirical analysis reveals that VC seed activity has proliferated across the USA, UK, Germany and Japan since the run-up to the Global Financial Crisis. The article concludes that VC is a growing source of patient capital for high-growth start-up companies, though several factors confound its intertemporal and intra-portfolio patience.","[Klingler-Vidra, Robyn] Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Int Polit Econ, Room 4-21 Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NR, England",University of London; King's College London,"Klingler-Vidra, R (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Int Polit Econ, Room 4-21 Virginia Woolf Bldg,22 Kingsway, London WC2B 6NR, England.",Robyn_Klingler.Vidra@kcl.ac.uk,,"Klingler-Vidra, Robyn/0000-0003-4215-2320",,,,,57,16,20,4,32,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Such scholarship attributes investment preferences to either set assumptions about what various actors are likely to want from their pension systems or to macro-level institutional factors. Comparing the preferences of business and labor actors in the occupational pension systems in Finland, the Netherlands, and the USA, we argue that preferences are better explained more dynamically and emerge from meso-level institutional forces. We find that financing needs and capacities, governance capacities and financial regulations explain changes in labor and business preferences with regard to fund investment. In each of the cases, a combination of these three institutional factors explains a preference shift toward more varied and more impatient investing.","[McCarthy, Michael A.] Marquette Univ, Dept Social & Cultural Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Sorsa, Ville-Pekka] Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Helsinki, Finland; [van der Zwan, Natascha] Leiden Univ, Inst Publ Adm, The Hague, Netherlands",Marquette University; Hanken School of Economics; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Sorsa, VP (通讯作者)，Hanken Sch Econ, Dept Management & Org, Helsinki, Finland.",ville-pekka.sorsa@hanken.fi,"McCarthy, Michael Anthony/G-1848-2010; Sorsa, Ville-Pekka/I-8598-2019","McCarthy, Michael Anthony/0000-0002-5288-3613; Sorsa, Ville-Pekka/0000-0002-8539-092X; van der Zwan, Natascha/0000-0002-7967-0757",,,,,73,29,33,2,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

Childhood food experiences are important guides to eating behaviour in adults. Food is full of properties that we perceive with our senses of smell, touch, hearing, sight and taste. We live in individual sensory worlds, and our food perception processes are also individual. Children actively investigate food during eating and cooking. By encouraging their excursion into the world of food culture and food activities, we support them in expanding their food preferences. This paper is based on the Future for food education workshop in the Future for Food Conference and focuses on the knowledge applied to the sensory-based food education for children. Examples of food education practices from Finland and Denmark are presented. The learning cafe method was used for the workshop attendees to outline the food education possibilities. The key issues were discussed in groups and included such topics as: Who should perform the food education activities? and Who will benefit in the future from food education? The workshop presentations and discussions indicate that there is a need for the advancement and research of food education for children. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Care costs varied widely dependent on the characteristics of the relapse. The mean (SD) cost when a relapse was not treated with steroids was A 381 pound (A 780) pound, whilst the equivalent cost was A 3579 pound (A 1727) pound when a relapse resulted in hospitalization.

However, there has been limited exploration of the role of institutions in driving this transition. Consequently, this paper sought to explore the role of institutions in producing space for tourism within National Forest Parks (NFPs) in China. To achieve this objective 68 national level policy documents from 1949 to 2014 were collected and analyzed. Findings demonstrate a transformation in the role of NFPs, orchestrated by the state, capital and society for tourism. In particular, NFPs, as an ideological space in national development, were not only an outcome of economic, social, political, and ecological processes, but also balanced the power between the state, capital and society. Institutional changes mirrored the dynamic relationship between the state, capital and society in China. Future research should focus on the role of institutions in producing space for tourism for and within parks at the local level, especially in developing contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TCE proposes that under certain circumstances and depending on the nature of the production process and context of exchange, different forms of organization play a role in reducing transaction costs in market exchange. Through fieldwork carried out in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico, this paper finds that hierarchical, collective organization is not the only way to reduce transaction costs for CFEs. Although market transactions can expose communities to opportunistic behaviour and hazards in many jurisdictions, capacity-building and skilling will decrease information costs and asymmetries for CFEs of organizational forms that rely on market contracting for production. Additionally, this research found that CFEs and their business partners value relationships that reduce the range of transaction costs even if this represents trade-offs in prices and making concessions such as informal loans. We recommend that policy should not focus on driving specific organizational forms in communities that attempt to eliminate intermediaries, contractors and service providers. Efforts should concentrate primarily on creating enabling environments by reducing transaction costs, particularly information costs and asymmetries that hinder productive relations between CFEs and their exchange partners. Better commercial relationships, social innovation and entrepreneurship can develop in conditions in which both CFEs and trading partners stand on even footing. Transaction cost theory should further investigate the role of learning in reducing transaction costs and its effect on organizational choice. It should consider that transaction costs may be experienced differently by individuals with different skills and abilities. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We find that 10.9 percent of those products fail a basic assessment of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), and the majority of the failures are substandard (7 percent) as they contain some correct API but the amount of API is underdosed. The distribution of these substandard products is not random: they are more likely to be found as unregistered products in Africa than in India or non-African countries. Moreover, our finding is robust for manufacturer-drug fixed effects, and is unlikely to be explained by differences in storage conditions as the five Indian cities in our sample are on average more likely to have high temperatures, above 25 degrees C or 30 degrees C, than the other African or non-African cities. A more likely explanation is that Indian pharmaceutical firms and/or their export intermediaries differentiate drug quality according to the destination of consumption.","[Bate, Roger; Mathur, Aparna] Amer Enterprise Inst Publ Policy Res, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Jin, Ginger Zhe] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Attaran, Amir] Univ Ottawa, Inst Populat Hlth, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada",American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; University of Ottawa,"Jin, GZ (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",jin@econ.umd.edu,,,Legatum Institute; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Legatum Institute; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"The Legatum Institute funded the collection of medicines and testing, and a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada provided subsequent funding to cover analysis of drug samples.

This paper analyzes major challenges in its rule development, implementation, and interpretation. The author argues,first, that rule development encounters market liberalization, regulatory cooperation and coherence, as well as sectoral challenges. Second, the fundamental issue for rule implementation and interpretation is the lack of a 'systemic' response to the relationship among FTA chapters, and to the relationship among the China-Korea FTA, domestic law, and international law. Finally, the relationship between the China-Korea FTA and World Wade Organization (WTO) law deserves special attention, which consists of five categories of circumstances. A number of questions are analyzed: which WTO rules apply to the China-Korea FTA? Do WTO rules apply to WTO-plus obligations? Can WTO jurisprudence be applied to the China-Korea FTA? The issue of the applicability of WTO rules and jurisprudence to PTA obligations including WTO-plus obligations remains open. These challenges are not unique to the China-Korea FTA and are likely to exist in other Chinese PTAs.","[Wang, Heng] UNSW Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia",,"Wang, H (通讯作者)，UNSW Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",,"Wang, Heng/S-8117-2019","Wang, Heng/0000-0003-2410-6144",,,,,25,3,3,0,34,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Several studies have estimated the cost-effectiveness of diabetes-prevention trials for different countries. Nevertheless, it is still controversial if prevention conducted in more real-world settings and among people with increased risk but not yet exhibiting increased glucose tolerance can be a cost-saving strategy to cope with the obesity epidemic. We examine this question in a simulation model based on the results of the M.O.B.I.L.I.S program, a German lifestyle intervention to reduce obesity, which is directed on the high-risk group of people who are already obese. The contribution of this paper is the use of 4-year follow-up data on the intervention group and a comparison with a control group formed by SOEP respondents as inputs in a Markov model of the long-term cost savings through this intervention due to the prevention of type 2 diabetes. We show that from the point of view of a health insurer, these programs can pay for themselves.","[Haeussler, Jan; Breyer, Friedrich] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Fach 135, D-78457 Constance, Germany",University of Konstanz,"Häussler, J (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Fach 135, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",haeussler.jan@gmail.com,,,German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) [0315671]; BARMER GEK,German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); BARMER GEK,"This research was funded by the German Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) under the grant no. 0315671 and by BARMER GEK.

We design an intertemporal market experiment with negative externalities to examine how delaying the benefits of taxation affects support for taxes. We find that when negative externalities occur immediately, people learn to adopt Pigouvian taxes, which are aimed at reducing negative externalities and restoring market efficiency. By contrast, when negative externalities are delayed, people are less receptive to taxation. This effect persists over time. Our data reveal that the strong negative delay effect can be explained in large part by narrow bracketing and the increased perceived complexity of the environment, rather than by time discounting per-se. We argue and demonstrate that increasing the transparency of intertemporal tradeoffs can effectively promote support for taxation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper applies content analysis of policy documents, semi-structured interviews and case study analysis to examine the interplay between REDD + rules and Kenyan sectorial policies and local socioeconomic settings. Results reveal that the preparation of national REDD + strategies in Kenya is usefully coordinated by the Kenyan forestry sector drawing on the sector's policy mandate and past experiences in forest management. This sectoral mainstreaming however degenerates into negative vertical policy interplay caused by poor consultations with key sectors outside the forestry sector e.g. lands and agriculture and is further exacerbated by sectoral competition for climate finance. Analysis of REDD + coherences with sectoral policies revealed that forest polices on reforestation and decentralisation are coherent with REDD+ rules (horizontal interplay) but this coherence is impeded by limited implementation of these measures e.g. poor support and coordination of Community Forest Associations. Lack of coherence was mainly observed between REDD+ rules and resettlement and agricultural mechanisation policies prescribed in the lands and agriculture policies. Agricultural mechanisation and resettlement policies are synonymous with deforestation especially through illegal and politically motivated agricultural or settlement expansions into Kenya's forest areas. At the local level, REDD + showed potential to positively influence local livelihoods but the aforementioned national institutional gaps and strict carbon standards and prices lead to negative trade-offs between carbon sequestration and alternative livelihoods. The paper advocates for strong multi-stakeholder consultative mechanism so that both Kenyan policy and socioeconomic settings can support effective REDD+ implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We aim, first, to present such a method and, second, to assess the relevance of the associated gain in numerical efficiency. We propose a prevalence-based, top-down regression approach consisting of five steps: aggregating the data; fitting a generalized additive model (GAM); predicting costs via the fitted GAM; comparing predicted costs between prevalent and non-prevalent subjects; and quantifying the stochastic uncertainty via error propagation. To demonstrate the method, it was applied to aggregated data in the context of chronic lung disease to German sickness funds data (from 1999), covering over 7.3 million insured. To assess the gain in numerical efficiency, the computational time of the innovative approach has been compared with corresponding GAMs applied to simulated individual-level data. Furthermore, the probability of model failure was modeled via logistic regression. Applying the innovative method was reasonably fast (19 min). In contrast, regarding patient-level data, computational time increased disproportionately by sample size.

The analysis is carried out using exchange rate classifications based on both the officially declared regimes and the actual exchange rate behavior. The results show that international reserves reduce sovereign spreads for all levels of exchange rate flexibility using both classifications.

This paper therefore investigates these challenges and explores capabilities forestry professionals require to overcome them. We employed mixed qualitative and quantitative methods. Data were collected through interviews, focus group discussions and a survey with forestry sector stakeholders. Qualitative data were analysed by clustering related issues into dominant themes and quantitative data by using Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Key challenges identified relate to political culture, particularly the power position of some elites in forest management and a culture of corruption. Non-compliance and poor enforcement of rules were also highlighted. To overcome these challenges, key capabilities forestry professionals require include leadership, authority and autonomy, alongside the capacity to initiate and manage change. We conclude that to improve forest governance in Ghana, beyond having state-of-the-art technical knowledge, professional education should place more emphasis on developing non-technical capabilities. We recommend an integrated approach to professional education that simultaneously develops knowledge, skills, attitudes and mind-sets necessary for producing graduates who can effectively address governance challenges.

The reason for these effects of ICT on economic results of service companies is the fact that they rationalise corporate activities in the field of marketing, enterprise resource planning, management of relationships with customers and suppliers and allow service companies to optimise their processes, create new products and increase their efficiency on the demand side. Economic performance in the field of service production is quantifiable by several traditional performance indicators, such as total turnover, gross value added, production value and others. The factor of efficiency expression is included in the indicator of labour productivity expressed as gross value added per employee. The contribution verifies the effects of ICT usage on economic performance in the environment of production of knowledge-intensive services in the Slovak Republic. At the same time, the relation between the use of ICT in the selected sections of services and achieved labour productivity is thereby a key criterion for observation. By applying the chosen methodological apparatus the positive relationship was confirmed only partially. Enterprises representing the M section demonstrate a mutual dependence of the extent of ICT utilization and achieving favourable economic effects in the service enterprises in the Slovak Republic, as opposed to companies belonging to section J, which did not confirm this relationship.","[Benesova, Dana; Kubickova, Viera; Husek, Miroslav] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Serv & Tourism, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Benesová, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Commerce, Dept Serv & Tourism, Bratislava, Slovakia.",dana.benesova@euba.sk; viera.kubickova@euba.sk; miroslav.husek@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,0,OECONOMICA PUBLISHING HOUSE,PRAGUE 3,"UNIV ECONOMICS, PRAGUE, W CHURCHILL SQ 4, PRAGUE 3, 130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-245-2145-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,20,33,,,,,,14,Area Studies; Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Area Studies; Business & Economics,BG7GX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391263100003,0

There are, definitely, many factors influencing this process but undoubtedly, culture is the most effective factor on a consumer's behavior which is presented in the values and norms a society emphasizes. Culture affects consumer's buying behavior due to its emergence in the values they focus. Since values are long lasting, efforts to change them are useless. So, marketers almost always try to swim along the waves of culture rather than against them. Every culture consists of a series of values which are transferred to its members. One of the most common views in brand preferences studies is the self-congruity theory, according to which a consumer's behavior is to a great extent defined by comparing one's self image with the brand personality of a product. This theory plays an important role in marketing as it is mentioned that consumers are mainly influenced by their self-image, especially when making fashion buying decisions. This paper focuses on how much brand preferences are identified by cultural values of consumers and to what extent each construct of values can explain brand preferences in Iranian context. Brand preference in this research is measured using a brand personality scale. Values are also measured using list of values (LOV). Hence, a sample of 313 consumers of Adidas, Nike and Holiday sports clothes was selected in Tehran. Structural equation modeling technique and one-way ANOVA were utilized for data analysis.

Using a case study of university press officers' work, I analyse how this form of media relations PR stages competition between UK universities through the media. A key form of this competition centres on the accumulation and circulation of what I term 'reputational capital'. I focus on one core element of reputational capital - media stories about HE research and the circulation of research metrics. I argue that the assemblage of the public relations (PR) University pulls the HE sector into dialogue with PR principles and practices in the context of recent shifts towards market rationalities. But this relationship is not a simple cause and effect model in which increasing HE 'marketisation' creates a boom in universities' PR practices, or intensifying investment in PR by universities merely amplifies or legitimises existing market tendencies in the sector. I argue that the PR University as assemblage starts generating its own logics around which actors in the field must orient themselves. More broadly, the PR University operates not only to promote an individual university's market position, but also acts upon public debates about the social role, legitimacy and financing of UK Higher Education.","[Cronin, Anne M.] Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England",Lancaster University,"Cronin, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Dept Sociol, Lancaster, England.",a.cronin@lancaster.ac.uk,"Cronin, Anne/AAZ-6640-2021","Cronin, Anne/0000-0002-3127-996X",,,,,48,23,25,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The indicators of integrated assessment attractiveness of tourism resources and quality of service infrastructure, as well as generalized indicators of settlements under these characteristics have been experimentally tested. The basis of the assessment of tourist resources consists of: museums, monuments, historical buildings, mansions, religious sites, natural areas, arts and crafts enterprises, industrial and agricultural enterprises as display objects. The objects of service infrastructure evaluation are the following: collective means of accommodation, catering facilities, entertainment facilities and parks. The results of the ranking of settlements of the KMD on the summarized indexes have been described. Differences in the distribution of tourism potential in the settlements located on the territory of the KMD have been revealed. The factors that have the most significant impact on the development of a tourist complex of the KMD have been established. The tourism system development strategy, according to which the zoning of the KMD is carried out in such a way as to strengthen the weak areas at the expense of the most developed ones in respect of tourism, taking into account the existing regional differences in the distribution of tourism resources and service infrastructure, has been substantiated. We propose specific design solutions for the development of service infrastructure. Using the example of the KMD it is experimentally confirmed that the factor analysis and expert procedures, based on the appraisal by points of the resource potential of the tourist destinations, are the most effective tools for service infrastructure design. It is experimentally confirmed that the development of service infrastructure can become the backbone factor for the development of a tourist destination, on which territory the tourist resources are unevenly distributed.","[Fedulin, A.

We shed new light on this puzzle by examining a region in which previous research has established that firms' financial leverage choices are motivated by factors other than maximizing shareholders' wealth: we hypothesize that this must be reflected in both how financial leverage is priced and the book-price ratio.

Technical analysis is one of the most popular methods supporting investment decisions and it is much more popular among future market traders than among neophyte investors. The concept of processing information was used to explain this phenomenon. Neophyte investors are more experiential and intuition-driven while using technical analysis models, while futures market traders are more rationally driven. Technical analysis methods help professional traders on futures markets, which are less transparent than regulated stock markets, to process information; those methods are perceived by them as rational, cognitive tools supporting their decision making.","[Kubinska, Elzbieta; Czupryna, Marcin; Czekaj, Jan] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Financial Markets, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Markiewicz, Lukasz] Kozminski Univ, Ctr Econ Psychol & Decis Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Kozminski University,"Kubinska, E (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Financial Markets, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",kubinska@uek.krakow.pl,"Markiewicz, Lukasz/G-7183-2011","Markiewicz, Lukasz/0000-0003-4554-1559; Czupryna, Marcin/0000-0002-8858-4615",National Science Centre of Poland [2015/17/B/HS4/02708]; MAESTRO grant - National Science Centre of Poland [DEC-2012/04/A/HS6/00614],"National Science Centre of Poland(National Science Centre, Poland); MAESTRO grant - National Science Centre of Poland","Jan Czekaj, Marcin Czupryna, and Elzbieta Kubinska were supported by a grant awarded by the National Science Centre of Poland under the project title Behavioral and microstructural aspects of the financial and alternative investments markets, Decision no. 2015/17/B/HS4/02708.

Traditionally amongst the most equal societies, West European countries have recently witnessed a stark increase in income inequality. European integration is often presented as one of the main driving factors of this development. This raises the question whether Europeans blame the EU for the widening gap between the rich and the poor, and consequently develop eurosceptic attitudes. A multilevel analysis of 79 pooled Eurobarometer survey waves across 12 countries from 1975 to 2009 confirms that increasing income inequality boosts euroscepticism especially amongst the low educated. The findings are consistent with previous research on the link between income inequality and democratic legitimacy. They also provide empirical support for a new educational divide in the wake of European integration and globalisation, and deepen our knowledge on the predictors of EU support.","[Kuhn, Theresa; van Elsas, Erika; Hakhverdian, Armen; van der Brug, Wouter] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Kuhn, T (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",theresa.kuhn@uva.nl,"van der Brug, Wouter/R-7048-2019","van der Brug, Wouter/0000-0003-4117-1255; Kuhn, Theresa/0000-0001-8784-1731",Volkswagen Foundation [83601]; EU's 7th Framework Programme 'GINI: Growing Inequalities' Impacts' [SSH-CT-2009-244592],Volkswagen Foundation(Volkswagen); EU's 7th Framework Programme 'GINI: Growing Inequalities' Impacts'(European Union (EU)),"This work was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation [83601 to Theresa Kuhn], EU's 7th Framework Programme 'GINI: Growing Inequalities' Impacts' [SSH-CT-2009-244592 to Erika van Elsas], and the research focal area 'Institutions and Inequality' at the Amsterdam Centre for Inequality Studies, University of Amsterdam.",,89,56,58,0,57,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The basic methodology of the research was a survey carried out through a questionnaire and guided interview. The research showed that associations of municipalities are created mostly for the benefits from grants, because of privatization, economic benefit for the municipality or the establishment of cooperation between municipalities. Associations of municipalities do not use the possibilities of cooperation with scientific research centres. Most associations are economically so weak that they search for funding for their operation and main activities because the amount of money they get is never sufficient. The associations of municipalities are even not interested in cooperation with scientific research centres, mainly because the representatives consider it unnecessary, unjustified, do not have enough financial resources or even have not thought about it at all. Most associations of municipalities consider their operation as effective. In conclusion roughly half of associations have been created with the purpose to build water supply, sewerage or wastewater treatment plants. Other prevalent purposes are environment, culture, tourism and the local or regional development of tourism in general. About half of the associations are multi-purpose and thus outside the main activity they focus on the cultural and sports activities, training, expert consultancy and transfer of expertise. The purposes for which the association is created and what is necessary to be done for it, have to be in compliance with the law.","[Linkeschova, Dana; Kocourkova, Gabriela; Krestova, Veronika] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Linkeschová, D (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Civil Engn, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",,"Kocourkova, Gabriela/AAD-9545-2019",,"Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports [LO1408, FAST-S-16-3474]","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This paper has been created under the project no.

In this article, we investigate the impact on demand for salmon in Norway with a single equation specification as well as a demand system. As Norway is a large salmon producer, the media coverage is highly varied. Our media coverage data can be broken down into 10 different categories, which vary from positive coverage such as cooking recipes to negative coverage of production problems such as disease. Our results indicate that in aggregate, the media coverage has little impact on demand for salmon. There are some indications that the positive coverage increases demand. There are also spillover effects relatively to other goods (cod, poultry and red meat).","[Liu, Pei; Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Lien, Kristin] Norwegian Seafood Council, Tromso, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Liu, P (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",pei.c.liu@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728",Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council,Norwegian Seafood Research Fund; Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),We thank the Norwegian Seafood Research Fund and Norwegian Research Council for financial support.,,32,16,17,1,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The rated strategies are then benchmarked against a range of country characteristics.

Due to the undertaken research it turned out that eight out of fifteen analysed organizations do not report almost none social information. The other seven organizations report social information in a diverse range. Almost all organizations report information regarding labour practices and decent work. In addition, they do so at a similar level. The sub-category product responsibility is the one with the lowest average compliance level.

A monopoly renewable resource manager, such as a harvester cooperative, may create a gain relative to a rent-dissipating sector because of its internalization of the impact of harvesting on the resource stock. As the monopolist reduces harvest, resource stocks recover and resource rent is generated through reduced harvesting costs. Thus, it is possible that the monopoly harvest exceeds the rent-dissipated harvest over time, leaving both producers and consumers better off. We argue that local resource management institutions that exert market power should not be considered violations of antitrust laws without first considering the costs and benefits of monopoly management. In cases where outside management has not had success, local management with monopoly power could represent a second-best solution.","[Manning, Dale T.] Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1172 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA; [Uchida, Hirotsugu] Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA",Colorado State University; University of Rhode Island,"Manning, DT (通讯作者)，Colorado State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, 1172 Campus Delivery, Ft Collins, CO 80523 USA.;Uchida, H (通讯作者)，Univ Rhode Isl, Dept Environm & Nat Resource Econ, 1 Greenhouse Rd, Kingston, RI 02881 USA.",dale.manning@colostate.edu; huchida@uri.edu,"Uchida, Hirotsugu/AAD-2401-2019","Uchida, Hirotsugu/0000-0003-3675-806X",,,,,53,5,5,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The necessity for implementation of e-enforcement Gateway to the enforcement by the means of information system of enforcement is justified by the fulfilment of legal requirements and the potential effect this Gateway e-enforcement may have had. There are requirements for the judiciary in terms of interfaces and how to exercise procedural rights electronically. As far as intelligence technologies develop provision for a regulatory framework with which to regulate the dynamic relationship. As for management of personnel in enterprises one of the most difficult task is to determine the effectiveness of training costs due to its branching and sophisticated feedback caused by improved production results of staff who took part in it.

Since 2003, producers have increasingly targeted the domestic market, and now most of the farmed shrimp production is consumed domestically. However, the domestic market has traditionally been supplied by shrimp from fisheries, mainly seabob and redspotted shrimp, creating the potential for competition between wild and farmed shrimp. The fact that these fisheries are generally considered overexploited may limit the impact of the competition. The degree of competition will be investigated by testing the degree of market integration between farmed and wild shrimp species in the domestic Brazilian market. The results indicate that the domestic markets for shrimp are integrated, as the price of shrimp supplied by fisheries and aquaculture form part of a system of shrimp prices.","[Pincinato, Ruth Beatriz Mezzalira; Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Prod, Gainesville, FL USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Pincinato, RBM (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Fac Sci & Technol, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",ruth.b.pincinato@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Pincinato, Ruth/0000-0002-8320-680X",National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq); Norwegian Research Council,National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)); Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),Financial support from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) and the Norwegian Research Council is acknowledged.,,44,24,25,0,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Expressed in the terms of synergetics, a crisis increases entropy in a system, i.e. it ruins its organized structure from within, thus leading to mounting chaos. In economics, crises manifest themselves as production decline, capital means idleness, unemployment and bankruptcy rates rise, material and financial asset depreciation, mutual settlements system disruption, banking structures collapse etc. [8] As applied to modern market economy which has existed for over 200 years, two types of economic crisis should be focused on periodic crises stemming from the cyclicality of market economy development and systemic crises stemming from the exhaustion of sustainable development capabilities in the long-established economic system pattern due to inherent contradictions having emerged within it. Differences between the two types of economic crisis above are the following. In the first scenario, when the economy recovers from its crisis, its two basic constituents that are the predominant techno-economic paradigm and the system of institutional structures that define the economy, remain practically unchanged qualitatively, albeit modernized in certain respects. Above all, that involves modernizing technological infrastructure in view of mass physical replacement of fixed assets that still happens based on existing technologies. As for the second scenario, crisis recovery means on the one hand transitioning to a new techno-economic paradigm, and on the other hand profound transformations in the established system of institutional relationships. Therefore, in each kind of economic crisis business sphere operators and services companies should design their survival strategies so as to take into account the opportunities and threats offered by the economic environment shaped by the crisis and modernize their activities accordingly. Currently Russia's economy is stricken by a new crisis caused by a weakening rouble, economic sanctions, an array of geopolitical conflicts and various limitations resulting from them, both official and informal. Given the present crisis situation, it is advisable for Russian companies and individual entrepreneurs to seek ways of modifying management patterns and business development tendencies.","[Plotnikov, Vladimir A.; Volkova, Albina A.] St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia",Saint-Petersburg State University of Economics,"Plotnikov, VA (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ Econ, St Petersburg, Russia.",,"Plotnikov, Vladimir/A-4854-2014",,[NSH-9726.2016.6],,This article was prepared within the Grant for State Support of Leading Scientific Schools NSH-9726.2016.6 The implementation of state economic policy through the development of tools of strategic and indicative planning.,,12,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,765,772,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100100,0

They have determined the need for a study on adaptation to EU directives aimed at sustainable economic development. This study will try to highlight how the integration of sustainable development policies as mandatory for setting up an agricultural cooperative can be a favorable factor and shorten the process of adapting the new structure to the changing European economy. Romania has shortcomings both in the chapter of sustainable economy and that of the establishment of agricultural cooperatives. This kind of structures is considered to be the global food security solution for a growing population. However, the environment degradation level, especially in rural Romanian is not very advanced, and the ability of the population to absorb information is very high. Also, the learning process of the cooperative principles based on the European model is only at the beginning in Romania and the number of agricultural cooperatives existing in this country, at last count, was only 66. The authors want to demonstrate that the integration of the sustainable development in agricultural cooperatives operating principles while the Romanian rural population is only now learning the cooperative regulations can represent a shortcut meant to catch up for some of the years that Romania has behind western Europe. The work methodology will consist of a feasibility study, starting from the structure recommended by the Romanian Agency for Funding Rural Investment to create an agricultural cooperative in the Romanian rural area. In this study, the environmental policies have major importance so as to demonstrate that the possibility of creating such a cooperative is valid, regardless of the implementation region and that it may be a solution to fill the gaps between regions.","[Preda, Maria Claudia; Chirculescu, Raluca Emilia] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Preda, MC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",,"Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/AAP-1430-2021; Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/K-6501-2019","Diaconeasa, Maria Claudia/0000-0002-7406-7879",,,,,6,0,0,2,7,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,377,384,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200049,0

Canada is a large exporter of goods and so it has an interest in the regulation of safety standards, both at the multilateral level through its membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and, most especially, at the bilateral and regional level through its Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). Canada has signed PTAs with provisions that go beyond the obligations of WTO Members under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. This article analyses the nature and enforceability of WTO-plus provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary standards (SPS) as well as product standards (TBT) in Canada's PTAs, from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Canada, Mexico, and the United States to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union. First, it finds that the inclusion of WTO-plus SPS and TBT provisions in Canada's PTAs is a relatively recent practice that is still in development. Only about half of Canada's PTAs contain WTO-plus SPS and TBT provisions and, those treaties that do, commonly concern institutions for regulatory cooperation and information exchange arrangements, without much commitment to harmonization. Secondly, it finds that nearly half of the SPS and TBT provisions in Canada's PTAs are unenforceable. They either are in a language that is too imprecise for enforcement or do not allow access to a dispute settlement mechanism. Thirdly, it finds that, by global standards, most of Canada's PTAs are modest in their approach to SPS and TBT issues, with NAFTA and CETA as key exceptions. The article concludes that the extent to which regulatory convergence occurs on safety standards for Canada is dependent more on political cooperation between the parties than on the nature and enforceability of SPS and TBT provisions in its PTAs.","[Puig, Gonzalo Villalta] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Dalke, Eric D.] Dentons Canada LLP, Toronto, ON, Canada",Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Puig, GV (通讯作者)，Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Law, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,30,3,3,0,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JAN,2016,15,1.0,,,,,51,83,,10.1017/S1474745615000464,0.0,,,33,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DH0GI,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372460500004,0

It has revealed that while optimizing the structure of commercial range of goods, enterprises must consider both the internal capabilities of an enterprise in the initial period of production planning and the requirements of the external environment markets for output product. On this basis, there were suggested some methodologies that make it possible to estimate the probability of products purchase bya certain group and to calculate a numerical value of potential consumers for a specific type of product. In addition, these methodologies allow one to calculate the required amount of product release for a particular list and, thus, solve the problems of product management and marketing. There were used predictable and theoretically modelled results of products supply and sales for the estimated period in order to develop methodologies. Methodologies includea set of measures to promote marketing and presentation of goods to the end consumer. The method of determining the economic efficiency of integrated measuresfor merchandising is to compare the supplies of products before and after research. As a result of appraisal of the proposed activities program,there has been developed a methodology for calculating the potential purchaser and defining a forecast quantity of shipped goodsfor trade outlets. The proposed methodologies will allow both a manufacturing enterprise and a trade company to organize their business activities so that companies will produce as much product as trade outlets will subsequently be able to sell. In this regard, the risks of both businesses will be decreasing.","[Pyanikova, Elvira Anatolyevna; Kovaleva, Anna Yevgenyevna] South West State Univ, FSBEI HE, Kursk, Kurskaya Oblast, Russia",Southwest State University - Russia,"Pyanikova, EA (通讯作者)，South West State Univ, FSBEI HE, Kursk, Kurskaya Oblast, Russia.",,"Pyanikova, Elvira/GOJ-9470-2022",,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,417,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100055,0

This research, following the Just and Pope framework, has made use of Kumbhakar's (2002) extended stochastic frontier model (SFM) to estimate production risk and technical efficiency (TE) in Thai koi farming. Results show that feed is the most important input significantly influencing production. Zeolite and pesticide appear to be risk-reducing, while fingerlings, labor, feed and salt turn out to be risk-increasing inputs. The inefficiency model indicates that labor and pond area significantly reduce the technical inefficiency. Feed, fingerling and lime also act as TE-improving factors. Education of farmers improves TE, while experience, training and frequency of water change do not impact the TE. The mean TE scores are 0.73 and 0.96 for the flexible risk estimate and conventional SFM estimates, respectively. TE values appear to become exaggerated when production risk is excluded from the model. SFM recognizes that risk is involved in Thai koi farming that causes lower TE.","[Sarker, Md.

We empirically examine the effectiveness of Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) in reducing information asymmetry among equity traders in an emerging market. Specifically, we test whether fair disclosure activity is negatively related to the probability of informed trading (PIN). Multivariate tests on a sample of listed companies in Korea subject to Reg FD reveal the following: (1) more frequent disclosure under Reg FD is related to lower information asymmetry, and (2) this relation differs across the types of disclosure, with the effect of qualitative disclosures on the PIN being weaker than that of quantitative disclosures. Evidence also indicates that the negative association between fair disclosure activities and information asymmetry is more (less) pronounced for firms with poorer (better) information environments where selective information leakage is more (less) likely. The results are robust to sensitivity tests.

There are at least three sets of knowledge required to deal with this situation. First, there are several issues which relate to the properties of fruit and vegetables in the context of global public health challenges and the changing paradigms in human nutrition sciences. Second, there is increasing evidence about the importance of consumption factors such as dietary patterns and meal contents and contexts as well as changes in consumers' lifestyles relating to the rise of convenience products and the informalisation of food practices. It is essential to appreciate the needs and wants of different types of food consumers, and the contexts in which they purchase, prepare and consume fruit and vegetables. The different problems facing fruit versus vegetables will be described. Third, there are opportunities to arrest the decline in fruit and vegetable consumption at three levels: consumer decision-making, industry and government. For consumers, skills education, marketing at point of purchase and supportive communication systems for household gatekeepers may be useful. At the industry level, partnerships with health and consumer organisations, collaboration between growers of different fruit and vegetables, the creation of high quality products based on fruit and vegetables, and more concerted responses to market competitors are important strategies. At the government level, awareness raising campaigns, preferential purchasing, promotion of fruit and vegetables in a range of settings, and the application of public interest criteria to relevant policies, should be considered.","[Worsley, A.] Deakin Univ, Ctr Phys Act & Nutr Res, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia",Deakin University,"Worsley, A (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Ctr Phys Act & Nutr Res, 221 Burwood Highway, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",,,"Worsley, Anthony/0000-0002-4635-6059",Australian Research Council; Meat and Livestock Australia; Deakin University,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Meat and Livestock Australia(Meat and Livestock Australia); Deakin University,"The author gratefully acknowledges support for his research from The Australian Research Council, Meat and Livestock Australia, and Deakin University, and for advice and assistance from Associate Professor Mike Reid, Dr. Wei Wang.

Research is focused on two tax burden indicators. A tax quota is used in most of similar studies and World Tax Index as an alternative. These indicators are separately added in the augmented endogenous growth model with physical capital approximation and other control variables. The fixed-effect panel regression was used as a method to analyze any tax burden effects in a time period 2000-2013. Because of nature of annual data, time fixed-effects were also added to regression. Main findings of this paper are that a tax quota has significant adverse effects on growth whether time fixed-effects are used or not. World Tax Index has significant adverse effects only when time dummies are used.","[Zimcik, Petr] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Zimcík, P (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",petr.zimcik@mail.muni.cz,"Zimcik, Petr/JVN-5892-2024",,specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration [MUNI/A/1055/2015],specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration,This work was supported by funding of specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration - project MUNI/A/1055/2015.

The effect of CON on technology supply has not been well established. In part this is because analyses have focused on state-level supply effects, which may reflect either the consequence of CON regulation on supply or the cause for its adoption or retention. Instead, we focus on the cross border effects of CON. We compare the number and location of magnetic resonance imaging providers in counties that border states with a different regulatory regime to (1) counties in the interior of states, (2) counties on state borders with the same regulatory regime on both sides, and (3) counties on borders with different regulatory regimes, but with a large river on the border. We find there are 6.4 fewer MRIs per million people in regulated counties that border counties in unregulated states than in unregulated counties that border regulated counties. This statistically significant finding that regulatory spill over can be sizable should be accounted for in future research on state-based health technology regulation. In addition, it suggests state experiences may not accurately predict the effects of CON if it were implemented nationally.","[Horwitz, Jill R.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Horwitz, Jill R.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA USA; [Polsky, Daniel] Univ Penn, Perelman Sch Med, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Polsky, Daniel] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Polsky, Daniel] Leonard Davis Inst Hlth Econ, Philadelphia, PA USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania,"Horwitz, JR (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Sch Law, Los Angeles, CA USA.",horwitz@law.ucla.edu,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

The programme consists in generous incentives: it targets university students from low-income families and is awarded upon both merit and demonstrated financial need. We exploit data from a survey conducted on a sample of upper secondary graduates linked to administrative records and employ a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of the intervention on the university enrolment decisions. We find that the programme has no significant effect on enrolment rates, but it exerts a positive effect on redirecting students already bound for university to enrol outside the place of residence.

For example, targeting observable traits within a population can impact genetic diversity and targeting valuable species can impact biodiversity at the ecosystem level. The bioeconomic literature, however, has given little attention to the effect of fishing on population diversity, even though population diversity contributes to ecosystem services and estimates of population extinction rates are three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates. Here we develop a stochastic bioeconomic model that links the harvest of multiple salmon populations in a single commercial fishery to the trajectory of population diversity in a salmon stock complex. We parameterize our model with biological and economic data from the Copper River Chinook salmon fishery. We show that markets can incentivize the degradation of population diversity, reducing infra-marginal fishery rents, and increasing variability in economic returns. We also show that second-best management can conserve population diversity and improve welfare. Furthermore, depending on fishermen's time preferences, this management strategy is potentially self-financing. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our points of departure are the need in scenario practice to embrace uncertainty, discomfort and knowledge gaps, and the connected need to capture and make productive fundamental plurality among understandings of the future. To help respond to these needs, we introduce what Nelson Goodman calls worldmaking. It holds that there is no singular, objective world (or real reality), and instead that worlds are multiple, constructed through creative processes instead of given, and always in the process of becoming. We then explore how worldmaking can operationalise discordant pluralism in scenario practice by allowing participants to approach not only the future but also the present in a constructivist and pluralistic fashion; and by extending pluralism to ontological domains. Building on this, we investigate how scenario worldmaking could lead to more imaginative scenarios: worldmaking is framed as a fully creative process which gives participants ontological agency, and it helps make contrasts, tensions and complementarities between worlds productive. We go on to propose questions that can be used to operationalize scenario worldmaking, and conclude with the expected potential and limitations the approach, as well as suggestions for practical experimentation.

In the 1980s and 1990s, after US policymakers tried to include language governing the free flow of information in trade agreements, other nations feared a threat to their sovereignty and their ability to restrict cross-border data flows in the interest of privacy or national security. In the twenty-first century, again many states have not responded positively to US and EU efforts to facilitate the free flow of information. They worry that the US dominates both the Internet economy and Internet governance in ways that benefit its interests. After the Snowden allegations, many states adopted strategies that restricted rather than enhanced the free flow of information. Without deliberate intent, efforts to set information free through trade liberalization may be making the Internet less free. Finally, the two trade giants are not fully in agreement on Internet freedom, but neither has linked policies to promote the free flow of information with policies to advance digital rights. Moreover, they do not agree as to when restrictions on information are necessary and when they are protectionist.","[Aaronson, Susan] GWU, Inst Int Econ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA",,"Aaronson, S (通讯作者)，GWU, Inst Int Econ Policy, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",saaronso@gwu.edu,,,,,,,70,20,23,8,97,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2015,14,4.0,,,,,671,700,,10.1017/S1474745615000014,0.0,,,30,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CW4HO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364952400005,0

The conclusion is that the sectoral IS for Czech forestry is established but the IS does not fulfil all three main functions completely - it provides sufficient supportive functions but the information function fulfils only partially and the conflict management function performs poorly.

The results indicate that two-thirds of the sluggish recovery in credit demand can be explained by changes in household endowments such as income reduction and lower income expectations, while one-third remains unexplained and is ascribed to changes in behavioral relations.

EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE FROM CHICAGO'S EXCELLENCE IN TEACHING PROJECT,EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT,"Chicago Public Schools initiated the Excellence in Teaching Project, a teacher evaluation program designed to increase student learning by improving classroom instruction through structured principal-teacher dialogue. The pilot began in forty-four elementary schools in 2008-09 (cohort 1) and scaled up to include an additional forty-eight elementary schools in 2009-10 (cohort 2). Leveraging the experimental design of the rollout, cohort 1 schools performed better in reading and math than cohort 2 schools at the end of the first year, though the math effects are not statistically significant. We find the initial improvement for cohort 1 schools remains even after cohort 2 schools adopted the program. Moreover, the pilot differentially impacted schools with different characteristics. Higher-achieving and lower-poverty schools were the primary beneficiaries, suggesting the intervention was most successful in more advantaged schools. These findings are relevant for policy makers and school leaders who are implementing evaluation systems that incorporate classroom observations.","[Steinberg, Matthew P.] Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Sartain, Lauren] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Consortium Chicago Sch Res, Chicago, IL 60622 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Chicago,"Steinberg, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Grad Sch Educ, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",steima@gse.upenn.edu; lsartain@uchicago.edu,,"Sartain, Lauren/0000-0001-5068-2300",Joyce Foundation; Spencer Foundation,Joyce Foundation; Spencer Foundation,"The authors thank Dan Black, Ofer Malamud, Lisa Barrow, Elaine Allensworth, Sue Sporte, Emily Krone, and Sheila Cashman for helpful suggestions on earlier drafts of this paper.

The results help identify the level of price risk found within the aquaculture industry across species and products. In addition, we differentiate between technologies comparing wild-caught fish with aquaculture products. The results also help us consider the relative riskiness of aquaculture compared to other industries. The results indicate that in aggregate, price volatility for aquacultured products is substantially lower than for wild.

Classical World Trade Organization (WTO) dispute settlement cases mostly originate in domestic firms instigating their public authorities to bring a complaint against foreign trade barriers incompatible with WTO law. In recent years, however, we have witnessed the rise of WTO cases in which firms get a foreign government to file a case against its own authorities. By analysing transnational lobbying by EU firms in the WTO footwear case filed by China against the EU, and by US firms in the WTO gambling case Antigua brought against the US, we highlight the increasing resemblance between trade disputes and investment disputes.","[Eckhardt, Jappe] Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [De Bievre, Dirk] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit ACIM, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium",Simon Fraser University; University of Antwerp,"Eckhardt, J (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Fac Hlth Sci, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",jappe.eckhardt@gmail.com; dirk.debievre@uantwerpen.be,"De Bièvre, Dirk/G-2323-2018","De Bièvre, Dirk/0000-0003-3030-6492; Eckhardt, Jappe/0000-0002-8823-0905",NCCR Trade Regulation,NCCR Trade Regulation,Support from the NCCR Trade Regulation (www.nccr-trade.org) is acknowledged.,,43,18,18,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,JUL,2015,14,3.0,,,,,507,530,,10.1017/S1474745614000500,0.0,,,24,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CR7ZJ,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361570500005,0

This paper examines how modern insights about bounded rationality, social interaction and learning can contribute to making transition polices more effective in addressing barriers and opportunities to realize a sustainability transition in the near future. We argue that the behavioral underpinnings of features like lock-in, surprises in innovation systems and network interactions have been insufficiently elaborated and connected to policy design. We identify and illustrate the most important behavioral features of relevant stakeholders in transition processes. By focusing on behavioral features at both individual and organizational levels, we arrive at recommendations for policy makers regarding important barriers to change and how to overcome these. Specific policy insights are offered at multiple levels, for different stakeholders, and associated with both behavioral biases and social interactions. The analysis combines insights from the literatures on sustainability transitions, environmental-behavioral economics, and behavioral foundations of learning and innovation. Our framework may serve as a basis for coherent behavior studies of transitions that otherwise run the risk of being ad hoc.

This specification also applies to biomass so that for waste wood recycling is given priority over energy recovery. Previous lifecycle assessment studies show the environmental benefits of the waste hierarchy with regard to waste wood. However, they do not take into account the current context of energy policy which relies on an increased use of biomass as an energy carrier. If this factor and its effects on biomass availability are included in the system of lifecycle analysis, wood recycling and waste to-energy are essentially equal in terms of environmental assessment. Political intervention in the waste wood market, such as prioritising recycling, therefore deserves close examination. It is time for a discussion on whether the stated benefit of cascade use of wood (and biomass) should be fundamentally questioned. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

CF methods often can be justified in situations where plug-in approaches are known to produce inconsistent estimators of parameters and partial effects. Usually, CF approaches require fewer assumptions than maximum likelihood, and CF methods are computationally simpler. The recent focus on estimating average partial effects, along with theoretical results on nonparametric identification, suggests some simple, flexible parametric CF strategies.

The economic welfare of fishermen depends to a great extent on the price received for fish. The price of fish is set by external factors exogenous to fishermen. It is important in understanding the welfare of fishermen to understand the price links in the fish supply chain and the factors that impact the ex-vessel price of fish. This article uses three models to investigate price determination in the ex-vessel market; ARMAX, inverse demand equation and margin equation.

Amendment to the Act on Income Tax established a payment of corporate income tax also for the companies which had reported a zero tax liability. This paper also describes the tax license from its material point of view and deals with the analysis of its impact on the corporate entities in the Slovak Republic. Introduction of the tax license in Slovakia will influence many corporate entities, some to a greater and other to a lesser extent. We also analyse the impact of the tax license on the corporate entity from different aspects, to determine whether the introduction of the tax license has changed the business situation. The analysis applies the data from the financial statements of selected companies for the years 2013 and 2014.

High performing, effective boards are needed to challenge executive management. This means that boards need independent non-executive members with diverse views, skills and appropriate professional experience. Such members must also be willing to invest sufficient time in the work of the board. The article addresses the following subjects which are at the heart of good corporate governance: Comply or explain approach: The 'comply or explain' principle is an important tool for the application of the corporate governance rules in the EU. Most corporate governance is soft law and guidelines are included in voluntary national codes of conduct. In principle, member countries decide upon what type of legal instrument to use, in the respective field: mandatory or 'comply or explain'. Board of directors, structure and composition: There is no uniform approach as regard structure of corporate governance. As generally known, there are two basic concepts of the public limited (joint stock) companies' corporate governance structures: one and two tier system. In EU, different board structures coexist. Depending on the country, listed companies may put in place either a 'single board' system (also called 'monistic' or 'unitary board' system), a two-tier (or 'dual board') system or some form of mixed system. Non-executive or supervisory directors: The administrative, managerial and supervisory bodies should include an appropriate balance of executive (managing) and non-executive (supervisory) directors such that no individual or small group of individuals can dominate decision-making on the part of these bodies. A sufficient number of independent non-executive or supervisory directors should be elected to the (supervisory) board of companies to ensure that any material conflict of interest involving directors will be properly dealt with. Independent directors: A director should be considered to be independent only if he is free of any business, family or other relationship, with the company, its controlling shareholder or the management of either, that creates a conflict of interest such as to impair his judgement. duties is assured (Annex II, which identifies a number of situations reflecting the relationships or circumstances usually recognised as likely to generate material conflict of interest). Boards should be organised in such a way that a sufficient number of independent non-executive or supervisory directors play an effective role in key areas where the potential for conflict of interest is particularly high. Board committees: Nomination, remuneration and audit committees should be created. The nomination, remuneration and audit committees should make recommendations aimed at preparing the decisions to be taken by the (supervisory) board itself. The primary purpose of the committees should be to increase the efficiency of the (supervisory) board by making sure that decisions are based on due consideration, and to help organise its work with a view to ensuring that the decisions it takes are free of material conflicts of interest.","[Bohinc, Rado] Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Bohinc, R (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",Rado.Bohinc@fdv.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,410,420,,,,,,11,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000037,0

In our opinion, this phenomenon seriously threatens the sustainability of capacities, which can be a key issue of future tourism development policies.","[Bujdoso, Zoltan] Karoly Robert Univ Coll, Gyongyos, Hungary; [David, Lorant] Eszterhazy Karoly Univ Appl Sci, Eger, Hungary; [Madaras, Szilard] Sapientia Hungarian Univ Transilvania, Miercurea Ciuc, Romania; [Nedelea, Alexandru] Univ Stefan Cel Mare, Sucava, Romania",Eszterhazy Karoly Catholic University; Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania; Stefan cel Mare University of Suceava,"Bujdosó, Z (通讯作者)，Karoly Robert Univ Coll, Gyongyos, Hungary.",zbujdoso@karolyrobert.hu; david.lorant@ektf.hu; madaras.szilard@gmail.com; penzesjani@yahoo.co.uk; alexandrun@seap.usv.ro,"David, Lorant Denes/AAN-4640-2020; Pénzes, János/AAA-6975-2019; Pénzes, János/AAC-9939-2020","Pénzes, János/0000-0002-4870-087X; Dr. David, Lorant Denes/0000-0001-7880-9860","European Union and the State of Hungary; European Social Fund [TAMOP-4.2.4.A/ 2-11/1-2012-0001, TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0013]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences",European Union and the State of Hungary; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences),"This research was supported by the European Union and the State of Hungary, co-financed by the European Social Fund in the framework of TAMOP-4.2.4.A/ 2-11/1-2012-0001 'National Excellence Program'.; This paper was supported by the Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.; This research was supported by the European Union and the State of Hungary, co-financed by the European Social Fund in the framework of TAMOP-4.2.1.D-15/1/KONV-2015-0013.",,12,2,2,0,2,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,394,399,,,,,,6,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200048,0

In the present context of increasing competitiveness, inducted by the globalization process, to avoid being marginalized or given up, Italian socio-economic systems need to think out models of differentiated development on a local level and based on the exploitation of territorial resources. In this context, taking into consideration that 92% of national surface is classified as rural, it is indispensable to think up models of development whose main reference point is agriculture. Agriculture is indeed the fulcrum of agribusiness system that counts for 15% of national wealth and it is the productive activity which more than others set the characteristics of a territory. It takes on both the role of producer of goods and promoter of a socio, cultural and environmental context able to put together the different territorial entities, making them operating as a system. It is therefore evident that agriculture is not a separate sector but an entity strictly integrated with the other components of the socio-economic system and thanks to this it is able to play a fundamental role for the territorial development. In this paper it is highlighted how the creation of an economic model revolving around the concept of identity, through the exploitation of territorial resources, if well organized and supported by incisive political actions can be an occasion of economic recovery. Identity and uniqueness can be the right answer to the homologation and standardization of globalization. The aim of the paper is to underline how agriculture operating in an integrated way with tourism, handcraft and the other territorial activities is strategic to develop and carry out a development model where the territory is the landmark.","[Calabro, Grazia] Univ Messina, Dept SEAM, Messina, Italy; [Vieri, Simone] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Management, Rome, Italy",University of Messina; Sapienza University Rome,"Calabrò, G (通讯作者)，Univ Messina, Dept SEAM, Messina, Italy.",grazia.calabro@unime.it; simonevieri@uniroma1.it,"Vieri, Simone/GQZ-3803-2022",,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701631, ROMANIA",2457-483X,,,PROC BASIQ,,,2015,,,,,,,164,170,,,,,,7,Business; Economics; Environmental Studies,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BK2IL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000432877200021,0

The European Union's (EU's) capacity to rise to this challenge depends on the international mode of governance it decides to pursue and the determination with which it does so. The EU has always been a strong advocate of competition law within a WTO context. Recently, however, it has been far more active on a bilateral level, embedding competition provisions in a wide array of agreements. Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) constitute one of the venues the EU has chosen to include competition provisions. The evolution of the global trade system, and in particular the place of competition law within this system, is complex and uncertain. This article aims to contribute to the debate on whether, and if so, how competition regulation should fit into the global trade scheme, by focusing on competition chapters in FTAs. In order to fully assess their value, this contribution first analyses the need for such provisions, following which the past attempts of integrating competition in a trade context are studied, finally proceeding to an analysis and assessment of competition chapters in a selection of bilateral FTAs.","[Demedts, Valerie] Univ Ghent, GELI, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Demedts, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, GELI, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Valerie.Demedts@ugent.be,,,,,,,42,3,4,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

In this regard. CSR embraces the companies' social responsibilities towards its shareholders, customers, environment, employees, and community. Notwithstanding several efforts tried to determine different type of measurements for CSR activities, still remains unclear how companies' stakeholders are influenced by these activities. Within this broad domain of CSR, relatively little is known in the literature how companies' employees perceive CSR activities and how these activities influence them. This paper aim is to develop a measurement scale for CSR activities as regard the influence on employees in relation with company performance based on stakeholder framework. Our research is based on data collected for listed companies in Romania between 2009-2013 years. We covered our designed scale measurement into OLS regression models along with financial measures that we used, respectively ROE and ROA, and we found a positive relation between CSR activities and companies' employees in relation with firm performance. The purpose of this study is to cast light in the current literature by filling some research gaps on this issue.

Data was collected at a grocery chain focused on niche markets in Portland, Oregon. Each label is found to have a significant influence on consumer choice, with local labels and ecolabels yielding the largest estimates of consumer mean willingness to pay. Ecolabels yield a wider range of individual willingness to pay estimates compared to the other labels, and preferences for the local label are not affected by the appearance of additional information labels on the same product.

The performed statistical data analysis enables to state that strong economy, stable financial system, high level of new technologies, viable innovation development and high level of entrepreneurship are obtained by countries which promote the improvement of the quality of higher education and business development opportunities. It should be noted that until now the country's tax system in terms of entrepreneurship promotion was not analysed as a set of specific variables influencing the entrepreneurship of self-employed individuals or companies. Thus, a scientific problem is formed as a lack of a complex tool which would evaluate the influence of the tax system on the entrepreneurship of self-employed individuals and companies. The latter is based on the lack of scientific research in this field, on the demand for a complex tax system evaluation in terms of entrepreneurship and on the significance of the formation of a tax system which would promote entrepreneurship. Thus, the aim of this research is, after carrying out a practical research on countries with different economic levels, to provide guidelines for the formation of a tax system which would promote the entrepreneurship of both companies and self-employed individuals. Methods such as induction, deduction, abstraction, research and comparative scientific literature analysis, statistical data analysis and interpretation were used in order to reach this aim. Results obtained during the statistical data analysis enable to state that the more evenly the country's tax system promotes the entrepreneurship of both companies and self-employed individuals, the higher the level of entrepreneurship in the country the country's tax system must be formed to evenly promote the entrepreneurship of all subjects in order to extensively develop entrepreneurship in the country. Such obtained results only enable to confirm the theoretical assumption that the country's tax system can be used as a certain tool to extensively promote or restrict entrepreneurship in the country. According to the results obtained during the research, guidelines were provided for the formation of a tax system promoting entrepreneurship which enable to carry out further studies in this field.","[Giriunas, Lukas; Giriuniene, Gintare] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University,"Giriunas, L (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Vilnius, Lithuania.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,387,394,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200050,0

Organic farming is guided by the principles of sustainability, social responsibility and respect of ecological principles to the production of healthier and better foods. Differences between organic and conventional farming are manifested mainly in the application of production processes and evaluation of product quality. Recently, comparison of both system authors use also in case of various economic indicators. This article focuses on the economic evaluation of production factors (labour, land and capital) listed in both systems in period 2009-2012. We processed data of more than 1,050 farms of which over 15% were organic farms. Values of the individual parameters are expressed by mean, median and percentiles. For verifying the hypotheses the verification of statistical significance by t-test is used. For analysis, data were selected according to the type of production to subset of the conventional producers and organic producers. We included only active organic producers (those enterprises generating sales from organic farming) into subset of organic producers. Only data for production cooperatives and companies (Ltd., JSC.) were available and no data for family farms and soleholders. Prerequistite of this study is that there are a statistical significant differences between using factors of production in the organic and conventional farming in Slovakia. This analysis is based on verifying each factor of production separately. The factor, labour was evaluated by indicators employees per hectare (EH) and personal costs per hectare (PC). Factor, capital is analyzed truth total assets per hectare (TA) and equity per hectare (EQ). In case of production factor, land we considered the total organic land area, the share of organic land and average organic farm size in Slovakia. For comparison we used the data of EU countries with developed organic farming. Evaluation of the, labour in our analyses is based on hypothesis H1 that organic farming is more difficult in sense of manual work and therefore organic farms have a higher number of employees and consequently higher labour costs (both per hectare) than conventional farms. Calculations in this case indicated that we can reject this hypothesis because there is no statistic significant difference between both systems in number of employees per hectare in observed period in Slovakia. In case of factor, capital the hypothesis H2 is set that there is statistical significant higher equity and assets per hectare than in the conventional system. In this article we prove, that this hypothesis can be rejected based on the data of Slovak agriculture farms. In the evaluation of the production factor, land we focus on the UAA of organic and conventional farms. Except total land use and share of organic land, the average organic farm will be analyzed in broader context of CAP impacts (subsidies) and its specifics in Slovakia. In this part we show the differences between organic land use in EU leaders of organic implementation (Austria, Swiss, ect.) and in Slovakia (where subsidy policy caused extreme organic farming boom).","[Lancaric, Drahoslav; Kozakova, Jana; Toth, Marian; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Lancaric, D (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; jana.kozakova@uniag.sk; radovan.savov@uniag.sk; marian.toth@uniag.sk,"Tóth, Marián/AAD-8706-2019; Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053",,,,,23,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,569,581,,,,,,13,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800055,0

Today transdisciplinarity is known and referenced in the natural and social sciences, and the humanities, as well as numerous professions. Hence it is appropriate to take stock of what has been achieved in both education and research during the last 10 years. These achievements include development of conceptual and analytical frameworks, a diversification of methods and approaches in precise localities, specific cases showing the creative, reflexive and transformative capacity of transdisciplinary inquiry, and concerns about the asymmetries of power and control of participants during processes of the co-production of knowledge. However, conceptual and institutional barriers for transdisciplinary inquiry are still common whereas incentives remain rare.

China has been the largest exporter and the United States has been the largest importer in this increasingly globalized market. After the trade dispute and intervention between China and the United States in 2005, China has continued to export more wooden bedroom furniture to the world. In this study, the impact of economic factors and trade intervention on the import demand of wooden bedroom furniture was analyzed for leading exporters in four selected individual markets (i.e., the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan). Main findings were that the antidumping duty against China in the United States generated a negative depression effect on China's exports to the United States and positive diversion effect on the exports from other countries. Furthermore, China has expanded its exports to other markets, especially to the United Kingdom and Australia, and maintained strong trade growth in wooden bedroom furniture worldwide. These results revealed that trade intervention in one market against an individual country could generate worldwide impacts. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The approach is based on combination of Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP) methods. The DEMATEL is a comprehensive method for building and analyzing a structural model involving causal relationships between complex factors. The evaluation of relationships is based on expert judgements. The ANP is a method that makes it possible to deal systematically with all kinds of dependence and feedback. The structure of the ANP model is described by clusters of elements connected by their dependence on one another. These connections indicate the flow of influence between the elements. The approach proceeds in two steps. The DEMATEL method is used in the first step to filter of some parts in the model based on expert threshold values. In the second step, the ANP is applied for more precise evaluation of relations by multiple criteria. Dynamic analysis of the systems use time dependent priorities that can be expressed by combination of forecasting using pairwise comparison functions and predictions based on using of compositional data exponential smoothing. The combination of these methods gives a powerful instrument for dynamic analysis of network systems by multiple criteria. The proposed approach is applied for dynamic project portfolio management.","[Majovska, Renata] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic; [Fiala, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat Prague, Dept Econometr, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Majovská, R (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",renata.majovska@vsb.cz; pfiala@vse.cz,"Fiala, Petr/K-6823-2015",,,,,,12,0,0,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,484,490,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900083,0

Different hypothetical configurations for outreach services are presented using a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE). Responses are analysed using Random Parameters Logit and Generalised Mixed Logit (GMXL) models in preference space and a GMXL model parameterised in willingness-to-pay space. Simulations are used to estimate the proportion of respondents expected to choose different service packages as elements are varied individually and in combination. Results: Responses were collected from 537 young people aged 15-24. Results show that when considering attending an outreach service to access family planning young people value confidentiality and the availability of HIV services including HIV counselling and testing (HCT) and HIV treatment, though significant observable and unobservable heterogeneity is present. Female respondents and those aged 20-24 were less concerned with service confidentiality compared to male respondents and those aged 15-19; respondents who were in a relationship at the time of the survey valued confidentiality more than those who reported being single. The addition of sports and recreation for young people may also be an attractive feature of a youth-friendly service; however, preferences for this attribute vary according to respondent gender. Results of the simulation modelling indicate that the most preferred service package is one that offers confidential services, both HCT and HIV treatment and sports for youth, with up to 32% of respondents expected to choose this service over a service where clients may have concerns over confidentiality, only HCT is available and there are no additional activities for young people. Estimates of willingness-to-pay for service attributes indicate that respondents were willing to pay up to USD$ 1.76 for confidentiality, USD$ 0.65 for a service offering both HCT and HIV treatment and USD$ 0.26 for a service including sports for youth. Conclusions: Young people were able to complete a complex DCE and appeared to trade between the different characteristics used to describe the outreach services. These findings may offer important insight to policy makers designing youth friendly SRH outreach services and providers aiming to improve the acceptability and uptake of FP services.","[Michaels-Igbokwe, Christine; Integra Initiative Fern Terris-Pre] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England; [Lagarde, Mylene; Cairns, John] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy Hlth Serv Res & Policy, London WC1H 9SH, England",University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Michaels-Igbokwe, C (通讯作者)，London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Fac Publ Hlth & Policy, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, 15-17 Tavistock Pl, London WC1H 9SH, England.",christine.michaels-igbokwe@lshtm.ac.uk,"Cairns, John/AAD-1168-2020; Lagarde, Mylene/GVS-9289-2022","Terris-Prestholt, Fern/0000-0003-1693-5196; Michaels-Igbokwe, Christine/0000-0003-0469-7055",,,,,52,22,24,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

More than 85% of the land has a rural character. The question is: Is it able to use the potential of itself? We can say that agrotourism mostly serves to capture new farm customers, educate the public about agriculture and enhance the quality of life for the farm family, which represents both economic and noneconomic benefits. At present, there is no day without stress. In this period, it is a return to the traditions of man, to activities which directly procure basic needs of subsistence, the return of man to nature, manual labour on the soil, planting and help farmers to animal welfare, which can be seen as a major article in agrotourism. This all can be seen like the world trend. Aim of this paper is not only to analyse the holiday behaviour of the Slovak population, but also visitor's perception of rural tourism and agrotourism in the Slovak Republic. Background data were obtained from the World Economic Forum, Statistical Office of the Slovak republic, Slovak tourist board and from our electronic surveys. In our survey 386 respondents participated. Information from Slovak tourist board used as the background data for creation of this paper were the result of a quantitative market research and public opinion of citizens of Slovakia with the aim to know their behaviour in travel, choosing vacation destinations. Random sample of 1,245 respondents aged over 18 was representative in terms of region, place of residence, gender and age. We have compared their survey with our survey connected with analysis of holiday behaviour of citizens of the Slovak Republic. The random sample is representative in terms of region, age and gender. By the processing and evaluation of holiday behaviour in rural tourism and agrotourism of respondents we have used many methods of comparison, synthesis, mathematical and statistical methods. Examined data were statistically processed and analysed in MS Excel 2010. We have determined the range of sample with statistical method and we selected option without repeating. The basic set, population of Slovakia by the date of 12th of December 2012 was 5,410,836 people according to Statistical Office of the SR. Sampling error is set to 5 % and the variability on 65. Calculation was made for significance level of 95 %. From this data we obtained respondents in sample, which are 649 people. In terms of time we could not analyse the whole sample. Querying was done on 386 respondents willing to answer through an electronic questionnaire. For data processing were used some tests, e.g. Friedman test to calculate the results, statistic formula: F = 12/nk(k+1) R - 3n(k + 1) Based on the current and the potential offer of rural tourism, we can assume three basic types of clients, among which we would qualify for less affluent visitors as families with children, pensioners. To the second and third groups, we included ''eco-friendly'' and affluent clientele, which will search facilities of rural tourism or agrotourism with higher levels of amenities. Holidays usually takes up to two weeks, only occasionally visitors opt for a shorter or a longer vacation. Less Slovaks (32% of respondents) spend in the Slovak Republic vacation less than a week. Slovaks are spending more and more in terms of homeland shorter stays, mainly weekends. In the field of rural tourism and agrotourism, visitors prefer holiday in foreign country, mainly for two fundamental reasons like providing better services and more elaborate program of holidays.","[Palkechova, Lucia] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94901, Slovakia; [Svoradova, Lucia] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Econ, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94901, Slovakia; [Viragh, Roderik] Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Informat, Fac Econ & Management, Nitra 94901, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Palkechová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Dept Management, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94901, Slovakia.",xpalkechova@is.uniag.sk; xsvoradoval@is.uniag.sk; xviragh@is.uniag.sk,,,,,,,6,1,1,0,9,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,782,792,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800074,0

In spite of public concerns about the emergence of such sites, the authors demonstrate the lack of strong adverse reaction between these variables. At the same time, they indicate that Natura 2000 is not a stimulant of socioeconomic development either. The authors analysed the indicators as selected based on literature studies, which showed the level of development in the social, economic, and environmental aspects, of the year 2013, which in turn allowed the calculation of synthetic quantities on the basis thereof.

The independent Slovak agricultural policy was abolished after entering the European Union and it was needed to adopt the unified agricultural policy, which represents a set of economic, institutional, legislative, and policy instruments to ensure a homogenous market. The Common Agricultural Policy develops not only the traditional role of agriculture, a food production, but shapes the face of country, affects the quality of an environment and also helps to increase the potential of tourism development through the cooperation of direct payments system, capping and greening. The Common Agricultural Policy greatly affects the agriculture in the European Union mainly through the subsidies as they are an indispensable source of funding of agricultural firms. The long-awaited European Commission's proposal of the Common Agricultural Policy reform has become the target of criticism, mainly from the central Europe countries. Its opponents argue that it does not sufficiently pay an attention on a fairer distribution of funds, increasing the competitiveness of the sector and the promotion of green farming practices. However, positive or negative consequences of it cannot be taken into a consideration without a deep analysis. To demonstrate whether the new Common Agricultural Policy successfully deals with problems of its predecessor, it is necessary to get through several factors reflecting the impact of European Union's decisions on the Slovak agriculture development, as a representative country of V-4. Joining the European Union in 2004, Slovakia has accepted rules of support to the agricultural sector, what means adapting the same support mechanisms as those used in the European Union and gradual increasing of farmers contributions from the European Union budget until 2013. However, there is a significant difference between the Slovak and European agriculture. Slovakia is perceived as a leader among the European countries due to its size of farms. Despite of a high concentration of farms - up to 95.1% of the utilized agricultural land is farmed by large farms - the Slovak agriculture is considerably less productive. Using the knowledge of a macroeconomics, statistical analysis and econometrics, the interaction of various Slovak economic indicators such as Gross Domestic Product, gross output, and employment are analysed due to respect of the Common Agricultural Policy's regulations in the period 2005 - 2013. The overall intention is to analyse the influence of three most important points of the Common Agricultural Policy for years 2014 - 2020 - distribution of direct payments, capping and greening - on the Slovak agriculture; as well as to analyze the impact of Common Agricultural Policy on the economy of farms based on the analysis of a unique set of agricultural entities operating in Slovak Republic.","[Rasovska, Adriana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Rasovská, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",adriana.rasovska@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,1,1,0,7,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,886,902,,,,,,17,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800085,0

Taking into consideration theories of authors such as Putnam (Capital); Giddens and Beck (Risk) and Acemoglu and Robinson (Institutions), the article seeks to understand why the risk society is incredulous and disappointed with their institutions. To illustrate the potential destruction of the risk society, the article inspired question has become: What is the influence of social capital in relation to the perception of the environmental risks? The study concludes that while political and economic institutions do not offer alternatives to individuals in positions of social struggles, the social capital will not overcome the obstacles to collective action, not having a perspective for building up a reflexive awareness of people regarding environmental risks.","[Rodrigo Pessoa Borja, Oscar; Wahrendorff Caldas, Ricardo] Univ Brasilia, SQN 408, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"Borja, ORP (通讯作者)，Univ Brasilia, SQN 408, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",phdborja@hotmail.com; ricardocaldas@uol.com.br,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,45,53,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800006,0

In order to assess the possible application of the TBT Agreement to the EU ETS in aviation, the measures laid down in Directive 2008/101/EC, as well as in the recently adopted amending Regulation, are qualified as measures affecting trade in goods. Such a finding leads us to consider whether they fall under the definition of 'technical regulation' laid down in Annex 1.1 of the TBT Agreement. To that effect, the three-tier test in EC-Asbestos and EC-Sardines is applied in light of the recent findings in EU-Seals. Finally, practical implications can be drawn in both senses. Should it be deemed inapplicable, GATT would continue to apply. Should it be considered to come within the scope of the TBT Agreement by virtue of Annex 1.1, an assessment of compatibility with Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the TBT Agreement would be required.","[Sanchez-Tabernero, Soledad R.] Univ Salamanca, Dept Publ Int Law, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain",University of Salamanca,"Sánchez-Tabernero, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Salamanca, Dept Publ Int Law, E-37008 Salamanca, Spain.",soledadrst@usal.es,,,,,,,24,3,3,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Current studies on 11 garlic varieties from the Centre of the Region Hanna at an altitude of 210 m showed high abundance of Aceria tulipae on 10 varieties. Bolting garlic varieties (Bzenecky Mutant VF, Sochi 25, Tiraspol, Zailijskij) were highly infested, non-bolting varieties (Czerga, SIR 10 new breeding, Gjirokaster) were infested weakly or not at all (Kelcyre). The highest abundance of mite was found out in semi-bolting garlic variety (Plovdiv Rogosh) with total number up to 1500 individuals in one clove. Significant differences in infestation between external and internal part of the clove were observed in 4 of 11 evaluated varieties. Root segment was significantly the most infested part of the clove. The most resistant kinds to mite infestation were the Kelcyre, Gjirokaster and SIR 10 new breeding varieties. The highest mite introduction to inside cloves was observed in the Plovdiv Rogosh variety. The choice of suitable varieties can significantly eliminate occurrence of A. tulipae and their infestation. In the recent years, Czech growers have produced only about 700 tons of the crop yearly. The areas concentrated on garlic planting have been changed in a significant way.","[Sapakova, Eva; Svobodova, Zuzana] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Sefrova, Hana; Hasikova, Lea] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Sapakova, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Reg Dev & Int Studies, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.sapakova@mendelu.cz; zuzana.svobodova@mendelu.cz; lea.hasikova@mendelu.cz,"Šefrová, Hana/J-3788-2018; Svobodová, Zuzana/O-1267-2018","Šefrová, Hana/0000-0002-0649-9143; Svobodová, Zuzana/0000-0003-4498-6994",,,,,24,0,0,0,2,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,958,968,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800092,0

In order to minimize and effectively manage the cost of financial risk, agencies need the ability to quantify that risk. A fundamental aim of this research effort, therefore, is to develop a process for generating risk-based metrics for annual suppression costs. Our modeling process borrows from actuarial science and the process of assigning insurance premiums based on distributions for the frequency and magnitude of claims, generating parameterized probability distributions for fire occurrence and fire cost. A compound model of annual suppression costs is built from the coupling of a wildfire simulation model and a suppression cost model. We present cost modeling results for a set of high cost National Forests, with results indicating variation in expected costs due to variation in factors driving financial risk. We describe how our probabilistic cost models can be used for a variety of applications, in the process furthering the Forest Service's movement towards increased adoption of risk management principles for wildfire management. We review potential strengths and limitations of the cost modeling process, and conclude by discussing policy implications and research needs.

Validity and reliability of these scales are crucial and special tests have been developed in this respect. Reliability concerns often arise, due to external factors that can influence the power and significance of such tests. Even for standardized instruments variations are possible, and they could seriously affect research results. The purpose of the present study is to investigate if and how external factors could influence a largely used reliability estimator - Cronbach Alpha. Several scales commonly used in marketing researches were tested, using a bootstrapping technique. Results show that important differences in the values of Cronbach Alpha are possible due to indirect influence from external factors - respondents' age, gender, level of study, religiousness, rural/urban living, survey type and relevance of the research subject for the participants to the survey.

Recently crowd investing has become one attractive variety. Crowd investing has evolved from the original idea of crowd sourcing with the focus on finance. This method has advantages on both sides, the investors can diversify their investment risks and the borrowers have fast access to realize their projects. In this paper we review the different kinds of crowd funding with the emphasis on crowd investing. It is mainly used for financing projects of start-up companies, but these projects have a high failure rate. The key idea of crowd investing is that a potential loss of the risky project can be absorbed easier if the amount of each investment is very small. The common procedure is constructed simply and is implemented via platforms in the Internet. The project initiators present their projects on the platform. Registered investors can choose among the projects if they like to support one. For a secure processing and safe contract design on both sides a trustee is involved. The investor's motivation evolves mainly from getting broad information and easy entrance to all business sectors. Particularly, for SMEs and start-up companies crowd investing is a new financing instrument to realize projects quickly. Internal financing sources are limited and underlie the fluctuations of economy. Thus, the use of crowd investing as additional financing source can increase the performance of economy.","Berlin Sch Econ & Law Inst, Berlin, Germany; Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Kosice, Slovakia",Berlin School of Economics & Law; Technical University Kosice,"Uzík, M (通讯作者)，Badensche Str 50-51, D-10825 Berlin, Germany.",marin.uzik@hwr-berlin.de; christian.hoffmeister@student.tuke.sk,"Uzik, Martin/Q-2851-2016",,,,,,9,0,0,0,6,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,737,742,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500086,0

One region of the world for which little robust empirical evidence exists on gendered employment effects is Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). To identify whether there is an impact of economic and trade structure on women's relative access to work, this contribution empirically explores these issues for thirty-eight SSA countries, and for two subgroups. Panel data for the period 1991-2010 is examined using fixed effects, random effects and two-stage least-squares estimation techniques. Findings suggest that trade liberalization has gendered employment effects, with the direction depending on the structure of the economy. However, the more robust finding is that a country's infrastructure has played a determining role in gendered labor market outcomes in SSA since the early 1990s.","[Wamboye, Evelyn F.] Penn State Univ, Business, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA; [Seguino, Stephanie] Univ Vermont, Econ, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; University of Vermont,"Wamboye, EF (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Business, Du Bois, PA 15801 USA.",efw10@psu.edu; stephanie.seguino@uvm.edu,,,,,,,36,26,29,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

In order to solve the flaws considered above, an improved method is here proposed by introducing additional variables to the original Granger test equation and defining a new test statistic through Monte Carlo method. Furthermore, a simulation analysis for validation and an empirical analysis in stock market risk transmission or application were both made.

According to theory, several elements are responsible for technology diffusion: (1) time reflecting the rate of adaption within the social system, (2) communication channels, and (3) the degree of incremental innovation, e.g., the modifications of existing active ingredient's strength. We investigated diffusion in two ways: (1) generic market share (percentage of generic prescriptions of all prescriptions of a substance) and, (2) generic sales quantity (number of units sold) over time. We specified mixed regression models. Generic diffusion takes considerable time. An average generic market share of about 75 % was achieved not until 48 months. There was a positive effect of time since generic entry on generic market share (p < 0.001) and sales (p < 0.001). Variables describing the communication channels and the degree of innovation influenced generic market share (mostly p < 0.001), but not generic sales quantity. Market structure, e.g., the number of generic manufacturers (p < 0.001) and prices influenced both generic market share and sales. Imperfections in generic uptake through informational cascades seem to be largely present.

Following existing carbon crediting schemes, the use of reduced impact logging techniques (RIL) allows a forest manager to apply for carbon credits whereas conventional logging (CL) does not. This paper is the first to develop a Hartman model with selective cutting in this setting that takes additionality of carbon sequestration explicitly into account. We apply the model using data for Kalimantan, Indonesia, for both private and government forest managers. The latter have a lower discount rate and are exempt from taxes. RIL leads to less damages on the residual stand than CL and has lower variable but higher fixed costs. We find that a system of carbon credits through REDD+ can increase carbon stored per hectare by 15.8% if the forest is privately managed and by 22% under government management if the carbon price equals the average 2015 price in the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Interestingly, awarding carbon credits to carbon stored in end-use wood products does not increase the amount of carbon stored, nor Land Expectation Value. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The international process on measurement, reporting and verification of REDD+ outcomes (REDD+ MRV) expands the scope of forest inventories to include quantification of forest carbon stocks and their changes for results-based REDD + payments. UNFCCC decisions also specify methods to be used, and actors to be involved. Although forest management in developing countries has clearly been influenced by international processes in the past, exactly how and to what extent REDD + MRV has affected institutional arrangements for forest assessments in developing countries remains unknown. Using as a theoretical framework Discursive-Institutionalism, a concept derived from political science, this paper examines (1) the historical evolution of institutional arrangements for forest inventories in Peru; and (2) how and to what extent their development has been shaped by international processes on forests, and, more recently, specifically by REDD+ MRV. The findings show that the international REDD + MRV discussion has expanded the objectives of forest assessments in Peru, inspired the mobilization of new actors and resources, and spawned the development of new protocols for forest assessments. However, the 'depth' of these changes is not yet extensive, since the new rules for forest inventories have not yet been formally adopted, and the institutes envisaged to implement forest inventories, including measurement of carbon stocks and their changes, have not been established.

Moreover, individual-level evidence shows a negative effect of economic adversity on survival. We revisit this question using county-level data and two additional macroeconomic measures: poverty rates and median incomes. Examining county-level mortality among nonelderly adults from 1993 to 2012, we find that higher unemployment has modest negative impacts on mortality, in contrast to prior work using older state-level data. More notably, county-level poverty rates and lower median incomes produce larger and consistently negative effects on mortality, both in the short term and also for several years afterwards. These findings are consistent across multiple causes of death and for different subgroups of adults. While previous research has found that higher unemployment may produce small beneficial effects on survival, our analysis using more recent and granular data suggests this relationship no longer holds, and other economic measures such as median income and poverty rates provide stronger evidence that adverse economic conditions lead to higher mortality.","[Gordon, Sarah H.] Brown Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Sommers, Benjamin D.] Harvard Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA 02115 USA",Brown University; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

This study investigates the behaviour of two output prices potentially associated with growing improved poplars in Canada: hardwood pulp and ethanol. Time series techniques are used to assess the processes and volatility of hardwood pulp and ethanol price series. The findings indicate that price series for hardwood pulp and ethanol are best characterized by mean reverting processes around constant averages, indicating more predictability for poplar producers than would be the case for random walks. However, the results from the volatility analysis suggest substantial uncertainty for producers. The volatility of both markets is found be to be highly related to past volatilities, and therefore persistent. To the extent that future prices are more volatile, the importance of producers considering multiple product options for pulp plantations increases, as do complexities for policy makers to predict the impacts of policies to support biofuels.

The economic downturn in the forest economy in Kenora, Ontario in the 2000s opened pathways for new collaborative partnerships to emerge in governance systems that include industry and local, provincial, federal and First Nations governments. In order to enhance our collective understanding of collaborative governance in the forest sector we set out to describe the institutions and institutional changes that made cross-cultural collaboration possible and explain cross-cultural collaboration in terms of meta-governance (values, norms, and principles), particularly in relation to substantive decision-making. Using a review of policy and management documents and semi-structured interviews with governance actors, we examined regional shifts in tenure, the governance system of a leading example of collaboration, and procedures, processes, and organizational structures that helped establish equal decision-making authority that facilitated collaborative relationships, We found that tenure reforms allowed for structural changes in the governance system for the Kenora Forest, these led to formal partnerships between First Nations and industry, and the new governance system involved power sharing in decision-making authority. Conclusions of the work include that future tenure reforms should continue to promote collaboration in the region, and that the case study represents a novel type of collaboration between industry and First Nations in Canada.

In a country such as Finland, non-industrial private forest (NIPF) owners can be used as a proxy for a high-involvement group engaged in forest ecosystem service provision and consumption. NIPF owners constitute a large proportion of the Finnish population and, based on previous research, the values they ascribe to forest meaning and use have become more diverse, strongly emphasizing recreational and conservation values alongside timber production. We thus hypothesize that understanding the NIPFs consumer perceptions better offers new insights into future consumer value creation in Finnish society overall, especially concerning the segment of consumers associated with the lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS). First, the theoretical aim of the study was to validate a measurement model for forest owners engaged in pro-environmental consumption behavior and its effect on the meaning of forest for them. Second, the empirical aim was to identify different consumer categories among NIPF owners by classifying them into groups based on their sustainability orientation, and determine how the valuation of various uses of forests differs between these groups. The data set of 394 forest owners was collected in Finland in 2013 by telephone interview and was analysed using multivariate methods. The findings indicate that the owners with the highest sustainability orientation have a greater emphasis on multiple benefits of forests than owners who have a lower orientation to sustainable consumption behavior, and that they could be therefore considered as an interesting peer group for developing new service offerings in the changing forestry markets as well.

Bidding patterns between highly competitive and less competitive groups are also examined. Price differentials are further decomposed to explain factors that account for the gap. We find that a high level of competitiveness and more winning experiences induce manufacturers to behave aggressively and make lower bids. Moreover, bidders in a less competitive group are less sensitive to the number of potential bidders and the experience of past wins. The decomposition results indicate that the characteristics of bidders are not the main driver for the large price differentials between those groups.","[Yao, Ying; Tanaka, Makoto] Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan",National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies,"Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Natl Grad Inst Policy Studies GRIPS, Minato Ku, 7-22-1 Roppongi, Tokyo 1068677, Japan.",yyaoying@gmail.com; mtanaka@grips.ac.jp,"Tanaka, Makoto/M-9489-2014","Tanaka, Makoto/0000-0002-8606-865X; Yao, Ying/0000-0003-4494-0259",,,,,38,4,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

There is a varied range of PPP models with different degrees of responsibility from simple public sector contracts with the private, up to the complete privatisation of the service. As such, we may say the involvement of the private sector embraces the development, financing and provision of public infrastructures and delivery services. In this paper, one of the oldest PPP initiatives developed in Spain and transferred to other European and Latin American countries is evaluated for first time: the integrated healthcare delivery Alzira model. Through a comparison of public and PPP hospital performance, cost and quality indicators, the efficiency of the PPP experience in five hospitals is evaluated to identify the influence of private management in the results.

Theoretically, performance payments distributed to lower organisational levels are more effective in increasing performance than payments directed to the hospital level, but the empirical evidence for this expectation is scarce. This paper compares the performance of hospital departments at hospitals that do and do not redistribute performance payments to the department level. We study a Danish P4P scheme to provide patients with case managers. Applying difference in differences analysis, we estimate a 5 percentage points higher performance at hospital departments that are subject to a direct financial incentive. Our results suggest that payers can improve the effectiveness of P4P payments by distributing payments to the department level rather than the hospital level.","[Kristensen, Soren Rud] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Kristensen, Soren Rud; Bech, Mickael; Lauridsen, Jorgen T.] Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark",University of Manchester; University of Southern Denmark,"Kristensen, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.;Kristensen, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, COHERE Ctr Hlth Econ Res, Dept Econ & Business, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",soren.kristensen@manchester.ac.uk,"Bech, Mickael/G-2588-2011","Kristensen, Soren Rud/0000-0002-6608-7132; Lauridsen, Jorgen T./0000-0001-9889-6236; Bech, Mickael/0000-0003-3084-2068",,,,,33,9,10,2,19,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

In this article, we explore the broader interest group environment in which financial industry advocacy operates. Using new data on interest group participation in financial regulatory consultations, we provide the first comprehensive analysis of the ecology of interest groups that populate financial regulatory policymaking. Through a new measure of 'mobilized dissent', we find evidence that the level of interest group pluralism in financial regulatory policymaking is constrained by the limited mobilization of voices outside of the business community. We analyse how mobilized dissent towards the regulated financial industry changes in response to different institutional environments. While technical complexity, institutional context and the global financial crisis are found to impact the level of mobilized dissent, the impact of these environmental conditions varies across different groups. This analysis reveals not only that organized opposition to the financial industry is relatively weak, but also that it is relatively disjointed.","[Pagliari, Stefano] City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London, England; [Young, Kevin] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",City University London; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Young, K (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Polit Sci, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",Stefano.Pagliari@city.ac.uk; kevinlyoung@polsci.umass.edu,,"Pagliari, Stefano/0000-0003-0612-5296",,,,,94,64,67,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The economic crisis precipitated austerity measures concentrated on expenditure reductions with the intention of reducing the public deficit. Because the public sector pay bill comprises over half of current public spending, achieving deficit reduction has major consequences for the total pay bill and the workforce. This article assesses the restructuring of the public sector and public sector employment relations in Britain and identifies underlying continuities in public sector restructuring over recent decades. Drawing on and repositioning New Labour's legacy, the Coalition government used the economic crisis to establish a pro-austerity frame that has legitimated deep cuts in public sector employment and involved measures to refashion public sector employment relations. The article considers the consequences of this agenda and responses by trade unions and indicates some of the limits and uncertain prospects for public sector restructuring under conditions of austerity.","[Bach, Stephen] Kings Coll London, Employment Relat, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Bach, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Sch Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,Waterloo Campus, London SE1 9NH, England.",stephen.bach@kcl.ac.uk,,"Bach, Stephen David/0000-0003-3359-2594",,,,,69,29,32,1,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Generally, not all citizens respond as expected. One of the potential reasons is that citizens' frames do not always align with the policy frame. Combining insights from the literature on frame analysis and scenario planning, especially the idea of wind tunnelling, this paper presents a conceptual framework in which citizens' frames are used as test conditions for policy measures. The framework consists of three steps: the reconstruction of a policy frame, the reconstruction of contrasting citizens' frames and wind tunnelling. We studied two cases in the justice domain. The results indicate that the framework induces policy-makers to look beyond the official policy frame, to anticipate diverse reactions to policy measures, and to consider a broader set of policy options.

The Liberal/National (Coalition) opposition won office in 2013, promising public sector cuts. In this context, the Walton et al. concept of a forcing strategy helps analyse the 2014-2016 bargaining round in the Australian Public Service. A forcing strategy involves three negotiating processes: distributive bargaining to achieve concessions in pay and working conditions, the structuring of attitudes to heighten animosity between the negotiating parties, and the management of internal differences to minimise intragroup conflicts. The Liberal/National (Coalition) government adopted elements of these approaches, requiring Australian Public Service agencies to reduce a range of employment conditions to justify pay increases. Interactions between Australian Public Service management and the principal Australian Public Service trade union, the Community and Public Sector Union became increasingly hostile over the course of the bargaining round. In addition, internal differences emerged between the Australian Public Service Commission, which oversaw the bargaining process, and individual Australian Public Service agencies. We consider the efficacy of this forcing strategy in light of the potential for the Community and Public Sector Union to mobilise its membership to resist such an approach to pay negotiations.","[Williamson, Sue; O'Donnell, Michael] Univ New S Wales, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia; [Roles, Cameron] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian National University,"Williamson, S (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Business, POB 7916, Canberra, ACT 2610, Australia.",s.williamson@adfa.edu.au,"Roles, Cameron/V-1425-2018","Roles, Cameron/0000-0003-2089-2571; Williamson, Sue/0000-0001-9061-7466","University of New South Wales, Canberra, as part of an international symposium on Austerity in the Public Services","University of New South Wales, Canberra, as part of an international symposium on Austerity in the Public Services","The research for this article was funded by the University of New South Wales, Canberra, as part of an international symposium on Austerity in the Public Services held on 25-27 March 2015.",,55,5,6,0,4,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

By taking advantage of synergistic interactions between species, IMTA can help aquaculture evolve towards more responsible and sustainable systems. This study uses data from a contingent valuation survey to provide an estimation of the non-use benefits that, in the form of biomitigation of the external costs imposed on the marine environment, would be derived by Canadians from the adoption of IMTA for Atlantic salmon aquaculture.

In addition, the Diebold-Mariano test shows that there are no significant differences in forecast ability for all models.","[Ah-Hin, Pooi] Sunway Univ, Dept Financial Math & Stat, Sch Business, Subang Jaya, Malaysia; [Kok-Haur, Ng] Univ Malaya, Inst Math Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Huei-Ching, Soo] Heriot Watt Univ, Sch Math & Comp Sci, Putrajaya, Malaysia",Sunway University; Universiti Malaya,"Ah-Hin, P (通讯作者)，Sunway Univ, Dept Financial Math & Stat, Sch Business, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",ahhinp@sunway.edu.my; kokhaur@um.edu.my; h.soo@hw.ac.uk,"Ng, Kok Haur/B-9228-2010","Ng, Kok Haur/0000-0002-8763-7586",UMRG grant of the University of Malaya [RG260-13AFR],UMRG grant of the University of Malaya,The second author greatly acknowledges that this work is partially supported by the UMRG grant no: RG260-13AFR of the University of Malaya.,,25,3,3,0,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

In this crisis, America and European Union are trying to change Russia's behavior by imposing large volume of commercial and financial embargo and sanctions against individuals. On the other hand, Russia tries to deal with Western sanctions by imposing sanctions on Europe's citrus as well as European officials. In general, there is an obstacle, called the right of veto, for consensus on the sanctions against Russia and on the other hand, the other multilateral and unilateral sanctions outside the mechanism of the Charter is not contraindicated, but they cannot be imposed unlimitedly and regardless of imperative laws, the general principles of law, the specific rules of the Charter, human rights and humanitarian law.

Analysing human flaws regarding the way we process information in the light of behavioural findings, the provision of data for consumers of financial products should be further optimised. Despite the information overload the provision of information must not be condemned; this would mean throwing the baby out with the bath water. Disclosure can be used and function's also as a nudge; thus the way information is framed matters a lot. However, inundating customers with too much information does not help. Valueing the positive outcome of simple rules of thumb might complement to an optimised cognition and perception of human behaviour as it should be imputed to individuals when designing regulation. Enhanced prevention based on smarter information requirements will give consumers a better chance to avoid human flaws. Additionally, education could, at least partially, compensate negative outcomes of human flaws. However, nudging should avoid weakening the motivation of individuals to actively inform themselves. Combined with a strict Code of Conduct at the point of sale, a Suitability Test including the real risk perceptions of the consumer leads to an enhanced level of investor protection.

We used framework foresight to suggest how learning and internal factors such as CEO's origin, tenure and turnover, could affect the firm's reactions to one particular external factor, economic recession. The paper draws on empirical observations of a large sample of small and medium family firms operating in Italy between 2002 and 2011 to identify the baseline future, an expected future for these firms. This analysis may be of interest to both management scholars and practitioners. We hope to contribute to the debate on how internal and external factors interact to affect firm success, measured as sales growth. The implications for the future viability of an economic system based on family businesses are straightforward, as the turbulence and instability of the economic environment has grown significantly in the last decade, especially in more developed countries. Whether the ability of a company to adapt and survive to negative shocks depends on its governance provides a rationale for exploring alternative perspectives on the competitiveness of the economic system and the ability of different owners to cope with future negative events.

The process is modelled with a finite single-server queue with a server subject to two classes of failures - non-preemptive failures and so-called catastrophes. The non-preemptive failures correspond to secondary shunting and we consider that they do not interrupt the service process (primary shunting of inbound freight trains); we consider that it is possible to finish the classification process of the inbound freight train before we begin secondary shunting. The catastrophes represent failures of the infrastructure of the marshalling yard that is necessary to carry out both primary and secondary shunting.

This paper proposes the use of Marzano's taxonomy to aid in this endeavor. It provides a clear functional delineation between lower-and higher-order thinking, and serves as a natural way to systematically build a course around incrementally building up student thinking skills. We outline how it was used in course design for drafting student learning outcomes (SLOs), creating assessments for a Principles of Economics course, and leveraging it as a tool to provide more targeted feedback for students.

Payoffs from interest rate derivatives usually depend on LIBOR. This means that the valuation of interest rate derivatives depends on the evolution of two different term structures. The spread between OIS and LIBOR rates is often assumed to be constant or deterministic. This paper explores how this assumption can be relaxed. It shows how well-established methods used to represent one-factor interest rate models in the form of a binomial or trinomial tree can be extended so that the OIS rate and a LIBOR rate are jointly modelled in a three-dimensional tree. The procedures are illustrated with the valuation of spread options and Bermudan swap options.

We also examine whether the predictive power of the term spread for real economic activity can be enhanced by such a decomposition. The basic finding is that both the expectations effect and the term premium effect are relevant for predicting economic fluctuations.

Financial analysis results serve as a starting point for decision making by management, by owners and by other external but involved parties. The centre of attention of a financial analysis is the short-term financial situation (ability to pay in one year horizon) as well as the long-term financial situation (ability to pay for long-term obligations). Effective functioning of the relevant sector has also an impact on financial health (achievement of profits). Despite the fact that financial analysis is based on past periods data its main reason is to give forward looking information. Financial analysis is used as a support tool for decision-making processes. The financial analysis of the land and the pipeline transportation in the Czech Republic is executed as an external fmancial analysis.

Although comparative advantages have changed considerably during the previous ten years, most studies have focused on industrial products in the literature, with agri-food sectors usually neglected in empirical works. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to analyse the changing structure of comparative advantage of NMS vegetables trade in light of the 10 years of EU membership. Results suggest that EU accession has enhanced the value of trade relations with the EU, though NMS vegetables imports have increased faster than vegetables exports, but the trade balance still exceeds pre-accession levels. Both exports and imports are highly concentrated by product group and trading partner. Results show that revealed comparative advantages have weakened after accession in the sector in all countries analysed. By using a non-parametric Kaplan-Meier product limit estimator to analyse the duration of revealed comparative advantage in NMS vegetables trade, it is clear that accession has radically changed the survival time of vegetables trade, in that revealed comparative advantage is shown not to be persistent over the period analysed. On the whole, results confirm that revealed comparative advantages have weakened after accession and that the vast majority of products had a revealed comparative disadvantage after 2004. Reasons behind these changes are also identified in the paper.","[Jambor, A.] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary; [Ehret-Berczi, I.] Res Inst Agr Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Jámbor, A (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",attila.jambor@uni-corvinus.hu; berczi@aki.gov.hu,,"Jambor, Attila/0000-0001-8089-7222",,,,,6,1,1,0,0,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,65,71,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.9,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400009,0

Most real-world decision-making problems involve a great variety of factors and aspects that should be considered. Making decisions in such environments can often be a difficult operation to perform. For this reason, we need multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods and techniques, which can assist us for dealing with such complex problems. The aim of this paper is to present a new COmbinative Distance-based ASsessment (CODAS) method to handle MCDM problems. To determine the desirability of an alternative, this method uses the Euclidean distance as the primary and the Taxicab distance as the secondary measure, and these distances are calculated according to the negative ideal point. The alternative which has greater distances is more desirable in the CODAS method. Some numerical examples are used to illustrate the process of the proposed method. We also perform a comparative sensitivity analysis to examine the results of CODAS and compare it by some existing MCDM methods. These analyses show that the proposed method is efficient, and the results are stable.","[Keshavarz Ghorabaee, Mehdi] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Turskis, Zenonas; Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",m.keshavarz_gh@yahoo.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; zenonas.turskis@vgtu.lt; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Turskis, Zenonas/H-3035-2018; Turskis, Zenonas/AAA-9159-2021; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Turskis, Zenonas/0000-0002-5835-9388; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216",,,,,35,354,358,9,69,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The picture of a return to neoliberal business-asusual, however, sits uneasily with the popular discontent and democratic energies unleashed by the crisis. Indeed, in the USA it is precisely the mobilization of populist forces that has been a driving force behind the turn to austerity. The paper seeks to shed light on this paradoxical connection through a selective genealogy of economy that foregrounds its theological content. Economy is conceptualized as a paradoxical logic of governance, capable of organizing authority and belief in a secularized context that rejects the idolatrous worship of mundane signs. Austerity is not merely or primarily a 'wrong policy' but an article of faith, holding out a promise of purification that commands considerable ethical appeal and mobilizational capacity.","[Konings, Martijn] Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Konings, Martijn] NYU, Inst Publ Knowledge, New York, NY 10003 USA",University of Sydney; New York University,"Konings, M (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Dept Polit Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.;Konings, M (通讯作者)，NYU, Inst Publ Knowledge, New York, NY 10003 USA.",martijn.konings@sydney.edu.au,,,,,,,85,8,9,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

To answer these questions, an extended Mincer wage equation was estimated using OLS on the basis of data from the nationwide tracer survey of Polish graduates conducted in 2007 (Graduate Tracer Study 2007). The dependent variable in the wage equation was hourly net wage rate in the first job after graduating from a secondary school or academy. Parents' investments in the education of their child have been depicted in the model with two groups of variables: the education level of each parent and participation in extra-curricular activities in the period of education in the last completed school or academy. The results of the analysis show that parents' investments in the education of their children have a strong, positive, direct impact on the first earnings after the end of formal education. This relationship occurs both when the investment is depicted with the education level of each parent, as well as when represented by participating in various extra-curricular activities. In addition, parents' investments affect their children's wages also indirectly, as indicated by the decline in the wage premium from education after including in the wage equation each group of variables depicting the parents' investments. Thus, the omission of parents' investments in the wage equation leads to an upward bias of the wage premium from formal education.","[Liwinski, Jacek; Bedyk, Emilia] Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Liwinski, J (通讯作者)，Univ Warsaw, Fac Econ Sci, PL-00325 Warsaw, Poland.",,"Liwiński, Jacek/H-3350-2018","Liwiński, Jacek/0000-0002-3572-2973",,,,,23,0,0,1,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,905,916,,,,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200118,0

Young people are more often unemployed than older workers, they also are frequently employed in insecure temporary jobs or/and the jobs within the secondary labor market with lower wages and a lower level of social security. This integration of young people into the labor market became a significant agenda for EU member states. Unemployment among young people under 25 years in Slovakia belongs to one of the highest ones among the EU28 countries. One of the basic socio-demographic peculiarities of the young population aged between 15 and 24, respectively between 15 and 29 years, is the fact that the age range is associated with the end of school education (ie. the completion of a certain degree of educational attainment) and entering the labor market. Future career trajectory of young people depends on a successful mastering the transition from education system to the labor market. Labor market's ability to absorb increases in the labor force is also dependent on an extent of total and youth unemployment. Under conditions of high unemployment rate, the chances to find a first job among young people have declined due to strong competitive pressure from employers, who are preferring workforce that has practical skills and professional experience. According to OECD, if young people face the unemployment immediately after completing their preparation for professional life, it may result in so-called scarecrow effect of unemployment e.g. increased inclination towards unemployment also in the future. The graduate unemployment in the Slovak Republic is marked by a typical strong cyclical nature, which is characterized by a period / periods of massive influx of unemployed individuals after leaving the education system, and by a subsequent period of gradual integration into the workforce. This also applies to the unemployment of university graduates.","[Martincova, Marta] Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Martincová, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,,,[VEGA c. 1/0409/14],,This article was elaborated in the framework of the research project VEGA c. 1/0409/14 Development trends of comparative economic systems.,,9,1,1,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,937,943,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100122,0

On the basis of the knowledge of their ideas and opinions are defined those of them, which are the greatest asset for economic theory, as well as for economic practice. The leaders of the radical political economy point to a number of the shortcomings of the capitalist society and the economy. One of them is the uneven distribution of income, wealth and power in different countries the existence of the too-wealthy minority, which is too small in comparison with the poor majority. The persistence of poverty in rich countries is the result of an incorrect distribution of income. The radical economists also point to the incorrect allocation of resources in individual countries. Too many resources are destined for the production of private goods, and very few resources are intended for the production of public goods and services. The radicals claim that there was an artificial division of economics and other social sciences and require to establish a common front of the social sciences.

The first step is to make functional transformation of the original socioeconomic indicators to dimensionless form that is necessary for their joint analysis. After functional conversion indicators become dimensionless and vary in the same range which makes it possible to analyze them on a graph. The paper presents the main options of functional changes that are based on using various linear and nonlinear functions. Using nonlinear functions provides an opportunity to increase the dynamic range of imaging results. It is shown that the function must be selected individually for each indicator for converting the economic system. The next step of the proposed method is aggregation of information. This stage is one of the approaches to evaluation of socio-economic systems. The composite indexes are calculated, on their basis separate components of socio-economic system and the system as a whole can be seen. Different approaches to formation of generalized indexes based on the concepts of weak and strong sustainability are presented. The article describes the various options for formation of the scale of weights in aggregating information into composite index. In particular, there is an adaptive approach based on assumption that the farther away the indicator is from its threshold or reference level, the more weight it has in the system. It has been shown that over time the weight of the indicators may vary. In the extreme case rotation of indicators is possible (substitution of one for another, deletion or addition of indicators). Indicators should be regarded as the most important when they are farthest from the threshold. The method of calculation of generalized indexes can be used to analyze the socio-economic systems of various levels (country, region, company, etc.).","[Mityakov, S. N.; Mityakov, E.

The specific focus is upon the press conferences of the Bank of England, which coincide with the release of their Financial Stability Reports and results of their stress testing exercises. Three positions in the debate about financial performativity are identified and outlined - namely, 'Austinian', 'generic', and 'layered' performativities. Analysis of the transcripts and video footage of the press conferences shows that both Austinian and Generic performativity are at work in the 'layered performances' of financial stability by the Bank: the manner in which technical devices affect the economy intersects with the way reiterative practices bring about the effect they name. Moreover, drawing on the writings of Derrida, Deleuze and Sedgwick on iterability, difference and performativity, the article analyses the disruption, creativity and drama that is also present in the central bank's press conferences. The ostensible production of financial stability by the Bank is thus shown to draw attention to an additional layer of financial performativity that has been previously neglected in cultural economy research - that which I group together under the umbrella term of 'lively practices'.","[Morris, John Hogan] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham, England",Durham University,"Morris, JH (通讯作者)，UCL, 132 Hampstead Rd, London NW1 2PS, England.",john.morris@ucl.ac.uk,,"Morris, John/0000-0003-3866-2475",European Research Council's Starting Grants Scheme under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [ERC] [283754]; European Research Council (ERC) [283754] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council's Starting Grants Scheme under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) [ERC](European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This work was supported by the European Research Council's Starting Grants Scheme under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) [ERC grant agreement no 283754].,,70,16,17,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The control variables of this study are the market value of the equity and the ratio of book value to market value of the equity. The results, which are based on estimated generalized least square method, indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between ownership concentration, Board independence, CEO duality and CEO tenure and return on assets. On the other hand, there is a significant negative relationship between institutional ownership and Board size and return on assets. Besides there is a significant positive relationship between institutional ownership, Board independence, CEO duality and CEO tenure with stock return.

This implies that trade openness is a significant determinant of economic growth of the country.","[Selimi, Nasir; Sadiku, Murat] South East European Univ, Skopje, North Macedonia; [Sadiku, Luljeta] Int Balkan Univ, Skopje, North Macedonia",,"Selimi, N (通讯作者)，South East European Univ, Skopje, North Macedonia.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,291,297,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100039,0

Specifically, the essay analyses the impact of the collapse of the fact/value dichotomy on rational choice and behavioural law and economics. Not only does a nudge require an ex-ante value judgment, but facts and values are almost always inextricably entangled. Thus, the real problem does not lie in getting the facts right (i.e. judging people as neutrally as possible), but in the so-called facts themselves, which already contain value judgments. In the context of rational choice and behavioural law and economics, the term 'rational' is at the same time used in its positive meaning (how things are) and in its normative meaning (how things ought to be). As a result, researchers in BLE engage in both positive and normative science. Instead of accepting the normative and making it explicit, however, it is often shunned by researchers. In doing so, an unscientific double standard is maintained with the explicit positive science in the fore and the implicit normative science looming in the background. As a result, the normative concept 'rationality' is maximized under the guise of it being a positive concept while 'autonomy' is rejected as a legitimate concept for maximization on grounds of it being normatively laden. Pragmatic ethics could serve as a basis to make the normative transparent while at the same time not exclude it from scientific discourse.","[Steffen, Ariel David] Univ Lucerne, Fac Law, Frohburgstr 3, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Steffen, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Fac Law, Frohburgstr 3, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",ariel.steffen@unilu.ch,,,,,,,62,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,978-3-319-29562-6; 978-3-319-29560-2,ECON ANAL LAW EUR,,,2016,,,,,,,69,89,,10.1007/978-3-319-29562-6_6,0.0,,,21,Economics; Ethics; Law; Sociology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics; Government & Law; Sociology,BG6NY,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390674500007,0

Integrating these values into the forest planning process frequently requires that not only forest owners but also other stakeholders be involved. The objective of this study is to assess the potential of future scenario development as a tool in forest planning. In a case study of the Vilhelmina municipality in northern Sweden, forest owners and stakeholders were interviewed, and a workshop was held to discuss important factors for the future development of the local landscape regarding ecological, socioeconomic and political issues. Combined with a researcher-conducted process, this resulted in three alternative scenarios. We conclude that the scenario development process has produced information that can be used in forest planning. The participatory element of the scenario development process could be extended further to enhance communication, learning and knowledge exchange. The participants' contribution to the scenario construction could also be elaborated, e.g., by further involving stakeholders in the formulation of alternative future manifestations and in the elaboration of scenarios. To achieve this, it is necessary to adapt the quantitative methods to the participatory situation, to foster discussion qualities, to secure representation and increase motivation for participation in different ways.

To estimate healthcare and non-healthcare obesity impacts, many studies rely on body mass index (BMI) as a measure of obesity. However BMI is considered to be a noisy measure of total body fat that unlike some other measures does not capture fat distribution. This study uses one such measure, the waist-to-hip ratio, as both an alternative and in conjunction with BMI in the estimation of the relationship between adiposity and health service use.

However, effective movement towards this model requires attention to design and to management particularly in relation to the expectations of partners (both university and non-university) who are used to traditional models of knowledge production and linear processes of knowledge extension. Based on our survey and literature review, we argue that in the short-term, the objective of producing applied research requires that forest research networks prioritize diverse and tailored knowledge mobilization strategies, rather than emphasizing knowledge production. With regards to the longer-term objective of facilitating new avenues for innovation in the forest sector this requires a knowledge mobilization strategy that entails a level of engagement with partners that is creative and transformative rather than mainly informative. Building an organizational culture of innovation requires a different approach to producing applied research, although many of the same skills are required. Our analysis suggest that if networks are to be effective in both these short and long term objectives, they should foster openness by establishing transparent and responsive organizational processes. Although such policies may exist and be available to partners, we found relatively little information available on the processes of transparency, accountability and conflict resolution within the websites of the networks we compared. Establishing clear roles and consistent channels of communications is imperative to facilitate the efficient and effective management of the network and manage partners' expectations, regardless of the partnership model.

Therefore, if dependence on international capital exists, the Brazilian economic policy makers must monitor the movements in yield and analyze its feedback frequently in order to guide their plans and decisions.","[D'Avila de Araujo, Luiz Alberto] Bank Brasil, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [de Andrade, Joaquim Pinto] Univ Brasilia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil",Universidade de Brasilia,"de Araújo, LAD (通讯作者)，Setor Bancario Sul, Ed Sede 3,16 Andar, BR-70073901 Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",davila@bb.com.br,,,,,,,25,1,1,1,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Empirical studies reveal that some interbank networks have features of scale-free networks. We explore the characteristics of financial contagion in networks whose distribution of links approaches a power law, using a model that defines banks' balance sheets from information on network connectivity. By varying the parameters for the creation of the network, several interbank networks are built, in which the concentration of debt and credit comes from the distribution of links. The results suggest that networks that are more connected and have a high concentration of credit are more resilient to contagion than other types of networks analyzed.","[De Quadros, Vanessa Hoffmann; Gonzalez-Avella, Juan Carlos; Iglesias, Jose Roberto] Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Fis, BR-90501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil; [Iglesias, Jose Roberto] Univ Vale Rio dos Sinos, Programa Mestrado Econ, Sao Leopoldo, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (Unisinos),"De Quadros, VH (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Rio Grande do Sul, Inst Fis, Caixa Postal 15051, BR-90501970 Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.",vhquadros@gmail.com,"Iglesias, Jose Roberto/D-7011-2014","Iglesias, Jose Roberto/0000-0002-0232-299X",,,,,19,3,3,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The unprecedented growth we witness today is also rapidly driving resource consumption to unsustainable levels. Local production and consumption-led growth is causing a considerable increase in external costs, such as deforestation, and knock-on effects, such as increased emissions including greenhouse gas (GHG); depletion of non-renewable resources; pollution of rivers; desertification; flooding; and long term climate change. Currently, the region accounts for about 40% of GHG emissions, which is expected to rise to almost 50% by 2030 if the business-as-usual trajectory projected for the region is not altered. Countries in the region are taking action when it comes to the transition to a green economy. When compared to other regions, Asia has the highest rate of policy innovations that can help in the transition to a green economy. Even though fiscal instruments in-use are to some extent already altering aggregate demand of resources and economic activities, resource allocation, and distributive capacity of the economy, instrument such as carbon tax that has the real potential to contain rising emissions and save economies from getting locked into carbon-intensive pathways are yet to be adopted widely. Tax on natural resources extraction is yet to be implemented in wider scale despite of rampant destruction of natural resources and environments and increase in associated GHG emissions. Sporadic adoption of fiscal instruments is not going to be enough, if Asia as a region, is to transition to a green economy. In addition, there are substantial implementation barriers that need to be eased for wide-scale adoption and diffusion of green fiscal instruments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors interrogate what scenario exercises are in actual practice, in the context of what they are used for and how they are designed, before then considering the criteria for determining 'success' for a scenario exercise. The particular focus of the literature analysed is in the emergence of the discipline of 'environmental scenarios', being scenarios concerned with 21st Century environmental challenges such as the influence of climate change on the notion of natural hazards.

Special emphasis is put on the impact of health system characteristics. Four factors are taken into account: the density of doctors or dentists, the rules governing access to practitioners, the method of paying primary care physicians, and the amount of out-of-pocket payments. The analysis is carried out using multilevel logistic regression models. Separate regressions are estimated for medical and dental services. The dependent variable is whether respondents reported that, at least once in the last 12 months, they needed care but did not receive it. The estimation results show that the probability of experiencing unmet medical or dental needs varies noticeably across countries. This inter-country variability seems to be partly explained by the differences in the financing of health care. Indeed, a positive link is found between the share of households' out-of-pocket payments in total health expenditure and the probability of unmet needs. The other contextual factors do not seem to play a significant role.","[Chaupain-Guillot, Sabine; Guillot, Olivier] Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Chaupain-Guillot, Sabine; Guillot, Olivier] Univ Lorraine, F-54035 Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universite de Lorraine,"Guillot, O (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, CNRS, Bur Econ Theor & Appl, 13 Pl Carnot,CO 70026, F-54035 Nancy, France.",Sabine.Chaupain@univ-lorraine.fr; Olivier.Guillot@univ-lorraine.fr,,"Guillot, Olivier/0000-0002-5949-6720",Region Lorraine; University of Lorraine,Region Lorraine(Region Grand-Est); University of Lorraine,"This study was carried out with the financial support of the Region Lorraine and the University of Lorraine.

We sought the Community Forest Organisations' views on the strengths and limitations of the initiative, whether they were equipped to achieve the aims expected of the policy, and the degree to which the policy aims were their priorities. We found that community forests in BC assess themselves as having been broadly successful in terms of policy aims of public participation and environmental stewardship of forests, but that the policy has not enabled economic diversification. Corroborating other studies we report that community forests found that encouraging participation requires sustained effort, that diversifying from conventional forestry is desired but not usually achievable and that motivations for involvement in community forests are diverse.

Scottish HGFs differ in a number of respects from the stylised facts in the literature. They create less employment than their counterparts elsewhere in the UK. Most have a significant physical presence outside of Scotland, thereby reducing their Scottish 'footprint' and domestic job creation. Scottish HGFs appear to have a high propensity to be acquired, increasing the susceptibility of the head office to closure. The evidence suggests that the tendency towards 'policy universalism' in the sphere of entrepreneurship policy is problematic.","[Mason, Colin] Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Brown, Ross] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, North Haugh St Andrews KY16 9RJ, Fife, Scotland; [Hart, Mark; Anyadike-Danes, Michael] Aston Univ, Econ & Strategy Grp, Aston Business Sch, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England",University of Glasgow; University of St Andrews; Aston University,"Mason, C (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Adam Smith Business Sch, Univ Ave, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",colin.mason@glasgow.ac.uk; ross.brown@st-andrews.ac.uk; mark.hart@aston.ac.uk; m.anyadike-danes@aston.ac.uk,,"Brown, Ross/0000-0002-6164-7639; Hart, Mark/0000-0002-0402-4128",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,89,32,35,3,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

The issue of health care entitlements for children is particularly pertinent given the strong causal links that have been demonstrated between eligibility for free care, utilisation and health outcomes. The Irish health care system is unusual in requiring the majority of the population to pay the full out-of-pocket cost of GP care. In contrast, all Scottish residents are entitled to free GP care at the point of use. This difference in public health care entitlements between Ireland and Scotland allows us to examine the impact of differences in financing structures on equity in GP care. In this paper, we use data from two nationally representative surveys of children in Ireland and Scotland to examine the degree of income-related inequity in the utilisation of GP services in both countries. We find that while the distribution of GP care is significantly pro-poor in Ireland, even after adjustment for health need, there is little or no significant inequity in GP utilisation among Scottish children. However, focusing just on children who pay the full price of GP care in Ireland, we find some evidence for a significant pro-rich distribution of GP visits. These results reflect the particular structure of health care entitlements that exist in two systems.","[Layte, Richard; Nolan, Anne] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Layte, Richard; Nolan, Anne] Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); Trinity College Dublin,"Nolan, A (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.",anne.nolan@esri.ie,,"Layte, Richard/0000-0002-3170-767X; Nolan, Anne/0000-0002-4597-180X",Health Research Board,Health Research Board,"This research was conducted as part of the research programme 'The Longitudinal Analysis of Child Health and Development in Ireland' (2010-2013), funded by the Health Research Board.

Recent events have revealed profound uncertainty at the heart of financial markets, the manifest existence of emotion and the way confidence is crucial to orderly market functioning. Using findings from two interview studies, supported by ethnographic observation, we elaborate on the irreducible cognitive and emotional conflicts which face actors engaged in financial markets and threaten their daily operations. We introduce the term conviction narrative to analyse how they manage these conflicts on a day-to-day basis, and with what collective consequences. Our thesis is that expertise and conviction in financial markets have constantly to be created and renewed through a combination of psychological and social action with the implication at the macro level that while financial markets can be orderly they are so in an intrinsically fragile way.","[Chong, Kimberly; Tuckett, David] UCL, Ctr Study Decis Making Uncertainty, London WC1 6BT, England; [Chong, Kimberly] UCL, Dept Anthropol, London WC1 6BT, England",University of London; University College London; University of London; University College London,"Chong, K (通讯作者)，UCL, Ctr Study Decis Making Uncertainty, Gower St, London WC1 6BT, England.",kimberly.chong@ucl.ac.uk,,,Institute for New Economic Thinking [IN01100025],Institute for New Economic Thinking,This paper was supported by a grant from the Institute for New Economic Thinking for a project (research grant IN01100025) entitled 'A Proposal to Develop Emotional Finance'.,,76,50,58,1,20,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The framework considers: seven topics (e.g., environment, human health and safety, and education); nine engagement types (e.g., volunteerism, research and innovation, and political engagement); six organizational types (e.g., advisory body, social enterprise, and individual); three strategies (socialization, influence, and power); and three scales of impacts (individual, community/inter-organizational, and national/international). Using this framework, empirical research provides evidence of how youth - defined as young people 15-24 years of age - have been agents of change in Canada over the 35 years from 1978 to 2012. A media content analysis of 264 articles, combined with frequency and chi-square tests, were completed to study the factors and the relationships among them. The results show a strong relationship between the impact and the strategy, topic, engagement type, and organizational type. The results also show a strong relationship between the strategy and the impact, engagement type and organizational type. The findings have implications for youth leaders and those who advocate for, work with, support, and educate them, and for those interested in evaluating social change efforts. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this study, I estimate the differential responses to alcohol prices on alcohol demand for young adults by asking whether heavy drinkers are more responsive to higher alcohol prices than light and moderate drinkers. To conduct the analysis, I use the data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97) for the years 1997 to 2008. To answer the research question on hand, I implement three different econometric methods: (1) pooled quantile regression; (2) quantile regression for panel data; and (3) finite mixture models. Findings from these methods consistently suggest that heavy drinkers respond to higher alcohol prices by lowering their alcohol intake. Since alcohol-related externalities are likely to be caused by heavy drinkers, the results emphasize the possibility of higher alcohol taxes curbing alcohol-related externalities associated with young adults by lowering the alcohol consumption among the heavy drinkers.","[Shrestha, Vinish] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",Emory University,"Shrestha, V (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",shresthavinish@gmail.com,,"Shrestha, Vinish/0000-0003-3062-7931",,,,,56,9,11,1,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

This article argues that they should not overlook imports for two main reasons. First, imports are an important determinant of export peformance. Therefore, the success of an export-led growth strategy will be reduced if it only focuses on exports promotion and ignores barriers to imports. Second, there is abundant evidence that imports also foster productivity. Therefore, imports contribute to growth directly by stimulating productivity and indirectly by increasing export performance, making them a key component of a trade-led growth strategy. This article also elaborates on the channels through which imports affects growth and investigates if the export and growth impact of imports is limited to imports of goods.","GEM, Paris, France",,"Hallaert, JJ (通讯作者)，GEM, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,80,2,2,0,13,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Causality has rarely been assessed due to the challenges posed by the endogeneity of health service supply. In this study, using data from Mozambique, we investigate the effect of healthcare service availability, measured as the type of health facilities and their level of staffing and equipment, on the individual decision to seek care. We apply an instrumental variable approach to test for causality in the effect of staff and equipment availability on the decision to seek care and we explore heterogeneous effects based on the distance of households to the closest health facility. We find that living in the proximity of a health facility increases the probability of seeking care. A greater availability of referral health services in the locality has no significant effect on decision to seek care, while greater availability of staff and equipment increases the probability of seeking care when ill. Demand side barriers to health care use exist, but have a smaller impact when health care services are available within one hour walking distance.","[Anselmi, Laura] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Lagarde, Mylene] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Hlth Serv Res, London, England; [Hanson, Kara] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England",University of Manchester; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Anselmi, L (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",laura.anselmi@manchester.ac.uk,"Lagarde, Mylene/GVS-9289-2022",,,,,,45,38,41,1,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Social capital is usually understood as mutual connections among individuals or groups in society, however, different opinions still exist. There are also different approaches to the measurement and assessment of social capital, usually manifested as development of various quantitative and qualitative indicators. Where social capital is regarded as a resource for territorial development, it is important to define suitable indicators. The purpose of this study is to define indicators for the assessment of social capital on the basis of information freely available in the databases of various agencies which store statistics in Latvia. Five local municipalities in three regions of Latvia have been chosen as research territories where consultations were undertaken and situation was explored to define social capital indicators and identify possibilities for its assessment. The outcomes of research demonstrate that, when carrying out an assessment of social capital, it is equally important to include information on population as creators of social capital, and on civic participation in social processes as well as social interaction and networks, which is the component of social capital least easily assessed and requiring a quality-based approach.","[Cimdins, Rudolfs; Skinkis, Peteris; Usca, Maija] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Usca, M (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",maijausca@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,1,1,5,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,186,195,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400018,0

However, a common understanding of the term social innovation itself has not yet emerged. Within the research social innovation is defined as new, sustainable and effective solution to pressing social problems in the society, and as a result of social innovation is created the social value. There is little conceptual work on the barriers to social innovation; thus, the aim of the research paper is to study the influencing factors of social innovation in Latvia. Social innovation is influenced by factors at the environmental, organizational, and individual levels. Social innovation factors which are related to the external environment are classified according to PEST analysis political, economic, social and technological ones. Social innovation influencing factors which are related to the organization guide the identification of innovation influencing factors at the organizational level - resources, level of risk, social innovation strategy, social innovation management practice, organizational learning, and organizational culture. Social innovation influencing factors related to the individuals within the organization are related to employees' abilities, skills and attitudes.

The results are robust to the use of different samples of the data set, different econometric methods, and different modeling approaches. We find that export experience acquired by plants in years before the previous year has an important effect on plant productivity and that the effect of export experience on productivity is nonsignificant for exporters that stopped exporting in the previous year.

There are three key businesses on the market operating mobile networks and providing mobile telecommunication services. They are similarly successful businesses achieving high yields, which are, however, gradually losing their privileged positions and profits due to greater deregulation of the telecommunications market as well as stronger competition. Today it is already obvious that only such a provider will retain its position on the market in the long term that will be able to create and maintain positive relationships with its customers, enabling it to gain efficient feedback and constantly innovate the services provided in order to create a higher value than that offered by the competitors. Telecommunication services need to be tailored to suit diverse customer needs and preferences, jointly shared by the enterprise and the customer 11]. Through an effective feedback, the enterprise needs to reveal key attributes of the service provided that will contribute to the satisfaction and loyalty of its customers. However, literature currently does not state how such a system of getting feedback in the telecommunications enterprise should look like. Therefore, the issue became the subject of the primary research conducted at the turn of 2014 and 2015. It was examined in the selected telecommunications company what methods the company uses to obtain information from various customers and customer segments, and whether the methods used allow a systemic and systematic collection of necessary information, on the basis of which it is possible to create individual attributes of the telecommunications services.

The demand for agricultural land was low during the first decade after the collapse of the Soviet agriculture system. The situation is changing and the demand for agricultural land is increasing at the present time. Yet, simultaneously, the formation of arable land prices is not studied much. There are several factors affecting land prices and spatial characteristics are among them. The aim of the study is to estimate the impact of spatial characteristics of land parcels on the price of arable land in Estonia. Correlation and regression analyses were used in order to find the possible impact of spatial characteristics (e.g. soil productivity, access conditions and distance from cities) on arable land prices. Data about the 86 rural municipalities were used for the study. The results of the study show that the impact of spatial characteristics of land explain about 20 percent of the arable land price variation. Quality of land and the access conditions to land plots had a statistically significant impact on arable land prices. The impact of the distance from cities and the shape of arable land plots on arable land prices were not detected in the study.","[Maasikamaee, Siim; Luik, Kersti; Aasmaee, Kristjan] Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia",Estonian University of Life Sciences,"Maasikamäe, S (通讯作者)，Estonian Univ Life Sci, Tartu, Estonia.",Siim.Maasikamae@emu.ee,"Maasikamae, Siim/H-7951-2016","Maasikamae, Siim/0000-0003-4721-2329",,,,,16,2,2,0,4,LATVIA UNIV AGRICULTURE,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,31,38,,,,,,8,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400003,0

Uzbekistan adhered to the 'gradual path' of reforms by retaining partial state control over the agricultural sector. Land market reforms succeeded to transfer land from large-scale state and collective farms to small private and dekhkan farms. However, private ownership is not recognized; farms can access land only through lease arrangements from the state. Further, strong market regulations were introduced in the output and input markets through centralized state procurement system. Labor productivity, crop yields and TFP increased significantly over the two decades of reforms induced by land use rights transfer to private farms and dekhkans and by partial deregulation of output markets.","[Nurmetov, Kudrat; Pokrivcak, Jan] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia; [Ciaian, Pavel] European Commission, Joint Res Ctr, Inst Prospect Technol Studies, Seville, Spain; [Pulatov, Alim] Tashkent Inst Irrigat & Meliorat, EcoGIS Ctr, Tashkent 100000, Uzbekistan",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; European Commission Joint Research Centre; EC JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS); Tashkent Institute of Irrigation & Agricultural Mechanization Engineers,"Nurmetov, K (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Tr Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",kudrat_n@mail.ru; xnurmetov@uniag.sk,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Ciaian, Pavel/B-4468-2010","Ciaian, Pavel/0000-0003-2405-5850",,,,,21,0,0,1,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,741,762,,,,,,22,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800071,0

Contemporary endogenous and neo-endogenous approaches to rural development emphasize greater involvement of local communities in development processes providing both opportunities of involvement in decision making and support instruments. However, communities lack capability to recognize and seize the opportunities in many cases. It is not conceivable that rural development policy objectives would be achieved without viable rural communities. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to characterize capability of rural communities as precondition for sustainability of rural areas, and to analyse factors affecting community's capability. Case study approach was chosen for the research, which was carried out in 2014 and 2015. Empirical data were obtained in three rural municipalities (novadi) representing three regions of Latvia: Riebini municipality (Latgale region), Rundale municipality (Zemgale region), and Strenci municipality (Vidzeme region). The research findings reveal that rural communities have strong cultural and social capability, whereas economic capability is very weak. Both internal and external factors affect capability, for example, migration and population mobility, availability of financial and human resources. These factors have positive as well as negative impact on capability of rural communities.","Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia",Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies,"Paula, L (通讯作者)，Latvia Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Social Dev, Jelgava, Latvia.",Liga.Paula@llu.lv,"Paula, Liga/AAS-1803-2020","Paula, Liga/0000-0002-1718-4446",,,,,14,2,2,1,4,LATVIA UNIV LIFE SCIENCES & TECHNOLOGIES,JELGAVA,"LIELA IELA 2, JELGAVA, LV-3001, LATVIA",1691-3078,2255-9930,978-9984-48-188-3,ECON SCI RURAL DEV,,,2015,,38.0,,,,,103,112,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BD3PO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360010400010,0

Despite the increasing body of business decision-making literature using intuitionistic fuzzy sets, no attention has been paid to business applications of iFCMs. This paper develops an iFCM model for corporate performance modeling. Here we combined text analysis with knowledge acquisition from experts to assess the connections in the iFCMs. In the analysis of the designed system, we focus on the target concepts represented by sales, costs and profitability. We tested two models of iFCMs, one with hesitancy in connections and the other one with hesitancy in both connections and concept values.

As a result of competition and globalisation, education and knowledge management had to be adapted. Universities were forced to establish a modern management system primarily known from the private sector. In 2002, the Austrian government implemented a revised Universities Act to integrate these concepts. But changing has led to strong resistance, as the law seems to question the self-conception of the universities. The objective of this study was twofold. Firstly, we analysed the challenges for a modern university management. Secondly, we investigated specific characteristics that may affect the attitude towards a modern university management. Referring to our first objective, literature review has revealed severe contradictions between modern university management and the traditional understanding of universities. While the traditional scheme has focused mainly on research, teaching is becoming more relevant in the new demand-driven university. Also, the freedom of science and teaching is limited by the strong orientation on goals that have been agreed upon with the government. Further contradictions can be identified in budgeting, leadership, hierarchy, and employee participation. To examine the second research aim, we sent a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to all members of the university under investigation. A total of 414 respondents (51% women; 58% academic members; 12.58% response rate) have submitted full data. Canonical correlations indicate that a higher engagement in research and leadership positions results in a higher acceptance of a modern university management. Interestingly, no significant differences were measured regarding the area of science. Our findings identify the challenging factors for a modern knowledge and education management at universities and can certainly help to understand the ambivalent attitude towards modern university management.","[Rybnicek, Robert] Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Rybnicek, R (通讯作者)，Karl Franzens Univ Graz, Graz, Austria.",robert.rybnicek@uni-graz.at,,,,,,,17,0,0,0,0,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",,,978-953-6125-16-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,76,85,,,,,,10,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BL4MO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000450585000009,0

Socio-economic features were proxy by secondary school enrolment, government expenditure on health, per capita income, unemployment rate and the Naira foreign exchange rate. It was found that, the conventional socio-economic variables such as per capita income, education and government expenditure on health considered to be highly effective in determining life expectancy of developing countries are not significant in the case of Nigeria. The study however suggests that, life expectancy in Nigeria could be improved if attention is given to quality of government health expenditure, unemployment and measures to halt the depreciation of the Nigerian Naira against major foreign currency.","[Sede, Peter I.] Univ Benin, Dept Econ & Stat, Benin, Edo State, Nigeria; [Ohemeng, Williams] GIMPA, Accra, Ghana",University of Benin,"Ohemeng, W (通讯作者)，GIMPA, Accra, Ghana.",ohens@yahoo.com,"Ohemeng, Williams/JDN-0694-2023","Ohemeng, Williams/0000-0001-8804-6940",,,,,36,34,39,1,12,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

The pharmaceutical sector argues that, if broadly used, it can be detrimental to innovation. We model the interaction between a company in the North that holds the patent for a certain drug and a government in the South that needs to purchase it. We show that both access to drugs and pharmaceutical innovation depend largely on the Southern country's ability to manufacture a generic version. If the manufacturing cost is too high, compulsory licensing is not exercised. As the cost decreases, it becomes a credible threat forcing prices down, but reducing both access and innovation. When the cost is low enough, the South produces its own generic version and access reaches its highest value, despite a reduction in innovation. The global welfare analysis shows that the overall impact of compulsory licensing can be positive, even when accounting for its impact on innovation. We also consider the interaction between compulsory licensing and the strength of intellectual property rights, which can have global repercussions in other markets beyond the South.","[Stavropoulou, Charitini] Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Valletti, Tommaso] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, I-00173 Rome, Italy; [Valletti, Tommaso] CEPR, London, England",University of Surrey; Imperial College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Stavropoulou, C (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Guildford GU2 5XH, Surrey, England.",c.stavropoulou@surrey.ac.uk; t.valletti@imperial.ac.uk,,"Stavropoulou, Charitini/0000-0003-4307-1848; Valletti, Tommaso/0000-0001-9728-5513",,,,,38,18,19,2,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

Seen as a means to promote a sustainable city and new forms of ecology, and valued for their 'planet friendly' character, these systems have become a hallmark for cities that want to become part of the so-called green culture. Drawing from the experience of the Velib' programme in Paris and adopting a pragmatist perspective, this paper analyses the controversies which developed as this transportation infrastructure was implemented, as well as the definitions of 'ecology' which were at the centre of the dispute. In doing so it shows the capacity of the private firm involved in the system, JCDecaux, to 'hijack' and integrate the ecological critique, its rather powerful capacity to persuade other actors, and the popularity that the project achieved through a hard-won process of justification. At the same time, this paper argues that the mobility turn played a performative role in the justification and the definition of this new transport project.","[Tironi, Martin] Pontificia Univ Catolica Chile, Sch Design, El Comendador 1916,CL-753-0091, Santiago, Chile",Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile,"Tironi, M (通讯作者)，Mines ParisTech, Ctr Sociol Innovat, 60 Blvd St Michel, F-75006 Paris, France.",martintironi@gmail.com,,,,,,,57,20,22,2,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The aim of this article is to identify young people preference for buying IT&C products from companies that distribute them across multiple channels. In this regard, an exploratory research was conducted on a sample of 340 students. The main results showed the high frequency use of Internet as a means of searching the information needed for purchasing IT&C products, the low share of exclusively online purchase, the fact that they are being perceived by students as both a need and a desire, and weak expression of views about products purchased in the virtual environment. Price and quality are the main criteria in choosing them. Originality is determined by identifying youth preference for firms practicing multi-channel distribution strategy for IT&C products.

An alternative approach is to econometrically estimate land allocations from historical transactions, but this approach requires extensive historical econometric data sets, which may not be available, and may be difficult to model spatially. We show that a geographically explicit net present value approach inclusive of an option value to defer land conversion can be a viable and insightful alternative to econometric approaches. The model is applied to Alberta, Canada where historical land use change data are not available. The elasticity estimates of converting agricultural land to afforestation, 0.21 to 0.37, are similar to other North American estimates from econometric studies.

A logit fire occurrence model was generated from observed historic fires to provide required fire ignition input data. Wildfire likelihood and intensity were estimated by modeling 50,000 fires with the minimum travel time algorithm (MTT) at 30 m resolution under 97th percentile fire weather conditions. Post-fire tree mortality due to burning fire intensity at different successional stages ranged from 0.67% in the latest stages to 9.22% in the earliest.

A fire risk map of the target areas was provided for forest management and risk mitigation purposes at the individual stand level. The approach proposed in this work has a wide potential for decision support, policy making and risk mitigation in southern European commercial conifer forests where large wildfires are the main natural hazard.

The evidence at first seems contradictory, as the quality of instruction appears to decline following turnover despite the fact that most work shows higher attrition for less effective teachers. This raises concerns that confounding factors bias estimates of transition differences in teacher effectiveness, the adverse effects of turnover or both. After taking more extensive steps to account for nonrandom sorting of students into classrooms and endogenous teacher exits and grade switching, we replicate existing findings of adverse selection out of schools and negative effects of turnover in lower-achievement schools. But we find that these turnover effects can be fully accounted for by the resulting loss in experience and productivity loss following the reallocation of some incumbent teachers to different grades.

Evidence from a natural experiment in Ethiopia,ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Medium of instruction; Primary school education; Difference-in-differences model; Ethiopia,LANGUAGE-SKILLS; EDUCATION; EARNINGS,"This paper offers empirical evidence on whether learning in mother tongue improves educational outcomes in primary school. We exploit the variation in changes in medium of instruction across schools located in different districts in Ethiopia following the 1994 education reform. This reform has provided opportunity for states in Ethiopia to choose the medium of instruction in primary schools located within their jurisdictions. Since the reform has affected only schools in some districts, but not in others, we assign children into treatment and control groups depending on whether the medium of instruction in the districts in which children live has changed following the reform. Using data from the 2% public-use microdata samples of the 1994 and 2007 Ethiopian population censuses as pre- and post-reform data, respectively, we estimate difference-in-differences models. The results from our preferred specification suggest that the 1994 education reform has increased the probabilities of both enrollment in primary school and whether a child attends the right grade for her/his age, and the effects are relatively stronger for kids in rural areas. Falsification tests suggest that our results are not confounded by other factors. This evidence supports the argument that mother-tongue instruction improves educational outcomes in primary school.

We offer two case-studies, one an ancient account of deliberation and decision making, the other from a modern newspaper article, to illustrate our argument that the aesthetic is an essential element in various stages of the process of decision making, from determining what needs to be decided, through identifying the basis for decision making, to the act of decision making itself. In that context, we highlight the role of the aesthetic in the framing of future possibilities in the process of scenario planning. In conclusion, we propose that focusing on the aesthetics of story-telling as a technology to create and share plausibility is a useful way to analyse scenario stories in scenario planning work; we hope that it may be a useful concept with which to develop further research in this area.

We undertook a literature review to investigate the methodologies used. In a framework of developing a new health-economic model for evaluating different screening strategies for primary prevention of CVD in Europe (EPIC-CVD project), we identified seven key modeling issues and reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2013 to assess how they were addressed. We found 13 relevant health-economic modeling studies of screening to prevent CVD in primary care. The models varied in their degree of complexity, with between two and 33 health states. Programmes that screen the whole population by a fixed cut-off (e.g., predicted 10-year CVD risk > 20 %) identify predominantly elderly people, who may not be those most likely to benefit from long-term treatment. Uncertainty and model validation were generally poorly addressed. Few studies considered the disutility of taking drugs in otherwise healthy individuals or the budget impact of the programme. Model validation, incorporation of parameter uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses for assumptions made are all important components of model building and reporting, and deserve more attention. Complex models may not necessarily give more accurate predictions. Availability of a large enough source dataset to reliably estimate all relevant input parameters is crucial for achieving credible results. Decision criteria should consider budget impact and the medicalization of the population as well as cost-effectiveness thresholds.","[Epstein, David] Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Epstein, David; Garcia-Mochon, Leticia] Escuela Andaluza Salud Publ, Granada, Spain; [Kaptoge, Stephen; Thompson, Simon G.] Univ Cambridge, Dept Publ Hlth & Primary Care, Cambridge, England",University of Granada; Escuela Andaluza de Salud Publica; University of Cambridge,"Epstein, D (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, Dept Appl Econ, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain.;Epstein, D (通讯作者)，Escuela Andaluza Salud Publ, Granada, Spain.",davidepstein@ugr.es,"Epstein, David/I-2839-2019; Garcia, Leticia/AGV-7679-2022","Epstein, David/0000-0002-2275-0916; Garcia-Mochon, Leticia/0000-0002-6300-2738","EPIC-CVD project; EPIC-CVD is a European Commission; Medical Research Council; British Heart Foundation; European Research Council; British Heart Foundation [RG/08/014/24067] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [MR/L003120/1, G0800270] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0512-10165] Funding Source: researchfish; MRC [MR/L003120/1, G0800270] Funding Source: UKRI",EPIC-CVD project; EPIC-CVD is a European Commission; Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); British Heart Foundation(British Heart Foundation); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"This work was financially supported by the EPIC-CVD project.

Systematic Community Engagement (SCE) in healthcare quality assessment remains a grey area in many health systems in Africa, albeit the increasing importance in promoting universal access to quality basic healthcare services. Purpose/objective: Design and implement SCE interventions that involve existing community groups engaged in healthcare quality assessment in 32 intervention primary health facilities. Methods: The SCE interventions form part of a four year randomized controlled trial (RCT) in the Greater Accra and Western regions of Ghana. Community groups (n = 52) were purposively recruited and engaged to assess non-technical components of healthcare quality, recommend quality improvement plans and reward best performing facilities. The interventions comprised of five cyclical implementation steps executed for nearly a year. Wilcoxon sign rank test was used to ascertain differences in group perceptions of service quality during the first and second assessments, and ordered logistic regression analysis performed to determine factors associated with groups' perception of healthcare quality. Results: Healthcare quality was perceived to be lowest in non-technical areas such as: information provision to clients, directional signs in clinics, drug availability, fairness in queuing, waiting times, and information provision on use of suggestion boxes and feedback on clients' complaints. Overall, services in private health facilities were perceived to be better than public facilities (p < 0.05). Community groups dominated by artisans and elderly members (60(+) years) had better perspectives on healthcare quality than youthful groups (Coef. = 1.78; 95 % CI = [-0.16 3.72]) and other categories of community groups (Coef. = 0.98; 95 % CI = [-0.10 2.06]). Conclusions: Non-technical components of healthcare quality remain critical to clients and communities served by primary healthcare providers. The SCE concept is a potential innovative and complementary quality improvement strategy that could help enhance client experiences, trust and confidence in healthcare providers. SCE interventions are more cost effective, community-focused and could easily be scaled-up and sustained by local health authorities.","[Alhassan, Robert Kaba] Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Alhassan, Robert Kaba; Arhinful, Daniel Kojo] Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Epidemiol, Legon, Accra, Ghana; [Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward] Univ Ghana, Dept Econ, Legon, Legon, Ghana",University of Amsterdam; University of Ghana; University of Ghana,"Alhassan, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam Inst Global Hlth & Dev, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Alhassan, RK (通讯作者)，Univ Ghana, Noguchi Mem Inst Med Res, Dept Epidemiol, Legon, Accra, Ghana.",arkabason@gmail.com,"Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/S-9239-2019","Nketiah-Amponsah, Edward/0000-0002-9754-1983; Alhassan, Robert Kaba/0000-0003-4227-4854",Netherlands government [W07.45.104.00],Netherlands government(Netherlands GovernmentPain in Motion),"This study emanates from the field data of the WOTRO-COHEiSION Ghana project (2014).

This comparative empirical dimension offers a more accurate picture of the global contours of regionalization as they relate to the juridical aspects of trade governance, suggesting that the decentralization of dispute settlement inferred by the rapid development of regional bodies has been overstated.","[Froese, Marc D.] Burman Univ, Int Studies Program, Lacombe, AB, Canada",,"Froese, MD (通讯作者)，Burman Univ, Int Studies Program, Lacombe, AB, Canada.",mfroese@burmanu.ca,,,,,,,44,9,10,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2016,15,4.0,,,,,563,585,,10.1017/S1474745616000057,0.0,,,23,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DY8BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385352300002,0

Examining the potential for expanding bean eating in a meat-eating culture,FUTURES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Beans; Plant protein; Meanings; Consumption; Intentions; Attitudes; Food culture,FOOD-CONSUMPTION; SOY; BELIEFS; PROTEIN; DIETS,"A transition towards more sustainable food consumption requires changes in everyday eating patterns, particularly a substitution of animal protein with plant-based protein sources. However, in many European countries plant protein consumption is low compared to meat consumption. The article explores plant protein consumption frequencies, future intentions to increase bean consumption, and the associations of frequent bean eating with socioeconomic factors and bean-related meanings, material issues and competence. A population web-based survey was conducted in 2013 among 15-64-year-old Finns (n=1048). The results showed that beans and soy-based plant proteins were infrequently consumed. A fifth of the respondents intended to increase their bean consumption in the future, intention being the greatest among those who already included beans in their diets. Frequent bean consumption was most likely among persons aged 25-34, living around the capital district, with education higher than comprehensive or vocational school, and who were vegetarian. Perceiving beans as culturally acceptable and good-tasting, and having competence in preparing bean meals were positively associated with the frequent eating of beans. The results suggest that for plant proteins to replace meat, new meanings and competences related to preparing and eating pulse-based dishes are needed. Based on our results, we build alternative future scenarios for plant protein consumption and the related requirements for changes. Several actor groups, such as NGOs, politicians, celebrity chefs and teachers of home economics have a central role in the developments. (C) 2016 The Authors.

It was captured by a four-class latent class model used to segment a sample of residents of Ljubljana (the capital of Slovenia), who responded to a choice experiment-based poll. The survey focused on the Roznik urban forest, for which preferences (also willingness-to-pay) for hypothetical changes in the attributes were assessed. Respondents in class 1 were invariant to changes in the recreation setting. Those in class 2 and 4 stated positive preferences for having more outstanding trees. Class 3 and 4 were in favour of increasing the area of forest openings and enhancing the maintenance of waymarks and information boards. Those in class 4 expressed positive preferences for more walking trails, whereas class 3 valued this negatively.

Duplication, delays or discrimination in CAPs can significantly increase trade costs, and this risk is reflected in their growing importance in World Trade Organization (WTO) discussions and bilateral and regional free trade agreements. This article conducts an empirical study of the trade issues that WTO Members encounter with CAPs as described in specific trade concerns (STCs) raised in the WTO Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) during 2010-2014. We observe that CAPs raise proportionally more concern among WTO Members than technical regulations do, and that testing and certification are the procedures that most frequently give rise to trade problems. The authors present the legal discipline applicable to CAPs under the TBT Agreement, describe the actors involved in their implementation as well as the common features of CAPs, and finally present with case studies how Members characterize CAP-related trade concerns in light of the framework of the TBT Agreement.","[McDaniels, Devin] World Trade Org, Environm Div, Geneva, Switzerland; [Karttunen, Marianna] European Univ Inst, Florence, Italy",World Trade Organization; European University Institute,"McDaniels, D (通讯作者)，World Trade Org, Environm Div, Geneva, Switzerland.",devin.mcdaniels@wto.org; marianna.karttunen@EUI.eu,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,KLUWER LAW INT,THE HAGUE,"CARNEGIEPLEIN 5D, PO BOX 85889, 2508 CN THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The Ecuadorian government instituted the 'Socio Bosque Program' (PSB) in 2008 in an effort to incentivize the conservation of privately-owned native forests. This study is the first to examine the PSB additionality in prevented deforestation through use of a geographic information system. Moreover, face-to-face surveys were conducted and analyzed to create a typology of forest owners based on their estimated likelihood to engage in forest land changes and elicit corresponding preferences for PSB-like forest conservation program participation. The survey data were collected from individual Ecuadorian forest owners in the Western region of the province of Pichincha. We estimate that less than 1% of forestland enrolled in the PSB would have been deforested were it not enrolled in the program. Landowners more likely to engage in deforestation practices denoted greater interest in participating in a conservation program when contracts allowed for the sustainable harvesting of timber. Landowners likely to conserve, showed greater interest in participating in a conservation program contingent on the amount of financial incentive provided. A design strategy, counter to the traditional focus, points to the allowance of sustainable forest harvesting, as a means of more effectively preventing deforestation in the Tropics.

A clear conceptualisation would separate out five analytical levels: precariousness in employment, precarious work, precarious workers individually and as an emerging class, and precarity as a general condition of social life. To illustrate the need to avoid slippage between the concepts of precarious work and precarious workers, we present one theory-relevant' example - full-time secondary school students in Australia who hold part-time jobs in the retail sector. Their part-time jobs are indeed precarious but the negative effects on the student-workers are modest, both because participation in precarious work is limited (moderate weekly hours and intermittent work within the framework of a brief stage of the life course) and because many (though not all) of the associated risks are cushioned by structural forces such as access to alternative income sources and career paths. At the same time, however, a longitudinal perspective reveals that the same group of student-workers faces major risks in the future, as a result of increasingly insecure labour markets. Reflections on this example help to identify conceptual tools that can be applied to a wide range of other examples of precarious work.","[Campbell, Iain] RMIT Univ, Ctr Appl Social Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia; [Price, Robin] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Business, Management, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Campbell, I (通讯作者)，RMIT Univ, Ctr Appl Social Res, GPO Box 2476, Melbourne, Vic 3001, Australia.",iain.campbell@rmit.edu.au,"Price, Robin/I-9856-2012","Price, Robin/0000-0003-3795-7351",,,,,77,165,183,6,90,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The adoption of improved agricultural technologies is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural development. In this paper we investigate the adoption dynamics of improved seed by farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa. Farmers' expectation is found to be a particularly important element in defining the adoption decision process. The aim of this study is to assess ways to stimulate future expectation. Using survey data from Malawi, we examine the role of expectation in the decision-making process of farmers adopting improved seed. We use these data in a dynamic simulation model to assess historical seed adoption patterns in Malawi and examine how counterfeit seed and branding affect farmers expectations and adoption.

J,"Will, U",,,,"Will, Ulrike",,,The Extra-Jurisdictional Effects of Environmental Measures in the WTO Law Balancing Process,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE,"This article enlarges the discussion on trade and environment conflicts in World Trade Organization (WTO) law by examining different approaches on how to deal with extra jurisdictional effects. WTO Member States have the regulatory autonomy to define whether they want to protect an environmental concern or not. They decide on the level of protection and choose the respective instrument. If environmental policies restrict WTO free trade rules, they need to fulfil balancing requirements, that is the necessity test or the 'relating to' requirements and criteria to exclude disguised discrimination. These balancing approaches result mainly from case law where Article XX General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)and Articles 2.1 and 2.2 Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) Agreementwere interpreted. However, if environmental measures restrict not only free trade rules but also competing environmental policies, these tests might not always resolve the legal conflict conclusively. Even the least trade-restrictive measure without disguised discrimination might restrict competing environmental policies. WTO adjudicating bodies recognized this conflict and its dimension of extra-jurisdictional effects. Yet, either the problem was left open addressing other, more obvious violations of WTO law or a recognition of competing policy goals was required while ignoring the possibility of incompatible measures. If, however, parties bring up the extra-jurisdictional effects on their environmental policies being the only violation of WTO rules, more differentiated balancing approaches might be needed. The article discusses three approaches: the comparison of the intensity of extra-jurisdictional effects, the comparison of the connection to the environmental concern and the re-evaluation of the significance of the regulatory goal. It is asserted that they contain shortcomings.","[Will, Ulrike] Univ Dresden, Sch Int Studies, Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Will, U (通讯作者)，Univ Dresden, Sch Int Studies, Dresden, Germany.",ulrike.will@gmx.de,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within its programme on Economics of Climate Change [01LA1139A],German Federal Ministry of Education and Research within its programme on Economics of Climate Change,"Ulrike Will is a teaching assistant at the School of International Studies at the University of Dresden, Germany.

Objective To provide a detailed estimate of the health resource utilization (HRU) burden associated with SREs across eight European countries. Methods Eligible patients from centers in Austria, the Czech Republic, Finland, Greece, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland with bone metastases or lesions secondary to breast cancer, prostate, or lung cancer or multiple myeloma who had experienced at least one SRE (defined as radiation to bone, long-bone pathologic fracture, other bone pathologic fracture, surgery to bone or spinal cord compression) were entered into this study. HRU data were extracted retrospectively from the patients' charts from 3.5 months before the index SRE until 3 months after the index SRE (defined as an SRE preceded by an SRE-free period of at least 6.5 months). Results Overall, the mean number of inpatient stays per SRE increased from baseline by approximately 0.5-1.5 stays, with increases in the total duration of inpatient stays of approximately 6-37 days per event. All SREs were associated with substantial increases from baseline in the frequency of procedures and the number of outpatient and day-care visits. Conclusions SREs are associated with substantial HRU owing to considerable increases in the number and duration of inpatient stays, and in the number of procedures, outpatient visits, and day-care visits. These data collectively provide a valuable summary of the real-world SRE burden on European healthcare systems.","[Body, Jean-Jacques] Univ Libre Bruxelles, CHU Brugmann, Brussels, Belgium; [Pereira, Joao] Univ Nova Lisboa, Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Lisbon, Portugal; [Sleeboom, Harm] Haga Hosp, The Hague, Netherlands; [Maniadakis, Nikos] Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Management, Athens, Greece; [Terpos, Evangelos] Univ Athens, Sch Med, Alexandra Univ Hosp, Athens, Greece; [Acklin, Yves Pascal; von Moos, Roger] Kantonsspital Graubunden, Chur, Switzerland; [Finek, Jindrich] Univ Hosp, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Gunther, Oliver] Amgen Ltd, Ctr Observat Res, Uxbridge, Middx, England; [Hechmati, Guy] Amgen Europe GmbH, Hlth Econ, Zug, Switzerland; [Mossman, Tony] Amgen Ltd, Biostat, Cambridge, England; [Costa, Luis] Hosp Santa Maria, Inst Med Mol, Serv Oncol, Lisbon, Portugal; [Rogowski, Wojciech] ZOZ MSWiA Z Warminsko Mazurskim Ctr Onkol, Olszytn, Poland; [Nahi, Hareth] Karolinska Inst, Dept Med, Div Hematol, Stockholm, Sweden",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Universidade Nova de Lisboa; Haga Hospital; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens Medical School; Alexandra Hospital; Kantonsspital Graubunden; University Hospital Plzen; Amgen; Amgen Limited; Amgen; AMGEN Europe; Amgen; Amgen Limited; Universidade de Lisboa; Hospital Santa Maria; Karolinska Institutet,"Body, JJ (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, CHU Brugmann, Brussels, Belgium.",jean-jacques.body@chu-brugmann.be,"von Moos, Roger/AAG-4570-2020; Costa, Luis AM/E-5117-2015; Acklin, Yves/AAJ-8434-2020; Body, Jean-Jacques/G-9785-2015; Maniadakis, Nikos/AAZ-6794-2021; nahi, hareth/AAA-3445-2020; Terpos, Evangelos/AAD-3667-2019","nahi, hareth/0000-0003-4711-5094; Terpos, Evangelos/0000-0001-5133-1422; Finek, Jindrich/0000-0002-7750-9345; Costa, Luis/0000-0002-4782-7318",Amgen; Amgen (Europe) GmbH,Amgen(Amgen); Amgen (Europe) GmbH(Amgen),"This study was sponsored by Amgen.

However, FCA estimates are context dependent and influenced by extant macroeconomic conditions. We applied the FCA to estimate colorectal cancer labor productivity costs and assessed the impact of a changing macroeconomic environment on these estimates. Data from colorectal cancer survivors (n = 159) derived from a postal survey undertaken in Ireland March 2010 to January 2011 were combined with national wage data, population-level survival data, and occupation-specific friction periods to calculate temporary and permanent disability, and premature mortality costs using the FCA. The effects of changing labor market conditions between 2006 and 2013 on the friction period were modeled in scenario analyses. Costs were valued in 2008 euros. In the base-case, the total FCA per-person productivity cost for incident colorectal cancer patients of working age at diagnosis was a,not sign8543. In scenario 1 (a 2.2 % increase in unemployment), the fall in the friction period caused total productivity costs to decrease by up to 18 % compared to base-case estimates. In scenario 2 (a 9.2 % increase in unemployment), the largest decrease in productivity cost was up to 65 %. Adjusting for the vacancy rate reduced the effect of unemployment on the cost results. The friction period used in calculating labor productivity costs greatly affects the derived estimates; this friction period requires reassessment following changes in labor market conditions. The influence of changes in macroeconomic conditions on FCA-derived cost estimates may be substantial.","[Hanly, Paul] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Mayor St, Dublin 1, Ireland; [Koopmanschap, Marc] Erasmus Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sharp, Linda] Newcastle Univ, Inst Hlth & Soc, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",University College Dublin; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Newcastle University - UK,"Hanly, P (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Dublin, Mayor St, Dublin 1, Ireland.",paul.hanly@ncirl.ie,,"Hanly, Paul/0000-0002-5348-4825",Health Research Board [SA/2004/1]; COST Action [IS1211],Health Research Board; COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"Data collection was funded by the Health Research Board (SA/2004/1).

We investigate the impact of a unique high school-university partnership to support college-intending students to follow through on their college plans. Specifically, we facilitated a collaborative effort between the Albuquerque Public Schools (APS) and the University of New Mexico (UNM), and randomly assigned 1602 APS graduates admitted to UNM across three experimental conditions: (1) outreach from an APS-based counselor; (2) outreach from a UNM-based counselor; or (3) the control group. Among Hispanic males, who are underrepresented at UNM compared to their APS graduating class, summer outreach improved timely postsecondary matriculation, with suggestive evidence that college-based outreach may be particularly effective.

Focusing on Israel, we argue that the financialization of its sovereign debt and the professionalization of this debt's management reconfigured the state's relationship with its citizens and transformed it into a market relationship. Drawing on observations and in-depth interviews conducted in the Israeli Government Debt Management Unit, we develop a microanalysis of Israel's macro-economic policy on its debt. We follow the aftermath of a historical transition in Israel's debt management. In its first decades of existence, Israel issued and priced bonds through direct negotiations between state representatives and pension funds. In the 1990s and 2000s, the Israeli Ministry of Finance transitioned to issuing bonds to financial markets and directed pension funds to invest in these markets. The state assumed a Janus-faced agency: on the one hand, it became disentangled from pension funds and began interacting with them as an individualized, cost-minimizing financial market actor; on the other hand, the state operates as regulator of a market, which governs and disciplines pension funds. The article investigates three factors in Israel's debt management, which perform this new state agency in the present: the professionalization of sovereign debt management, the utilization of risk management models and the standardization of sovereign bonds.","[Livne, Roi] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Yonay, Yuval P.] Univ Haifa, Dept Sociol, Haifa, Israel",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Haifa,"Livne, R (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Sociol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",rlivne@berkeley.edu,,,,,,,80,24,25,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

One intervention consisted of a moral appeal message asking university employees to cut back on printing in general, and to use double-sided printing whenever possible. The other intervention tested whether people's tendency to stick with pre-set alternatives is applicable to resource use: at random points in time we changed the default setting on the university printers, from single-sided to double-sided printing. Whereas the moral appeal had no impact, the default change cut paper use by 15 percent. Further analysis adds two important insights. First, we show that defaults influence behavior also in the longer run. Second, we present results indicating that resource efficient defaults have the advantage of avoiding unintended behavioral responses. Overall, our findings send a clear message to anyone concerned about resource conservation: there are potentially large gains to be made from small interventions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This paper studies the effects of MSAs on health-care expenditures and suggests that there may be some inherent tension between the two purposes of MSAs: account holders are likely to discount MSA funds because of their restricted use, which renders MSAs to be less effective in controlling health-care costs. We exploit a quasi-natural experiment in China that exogenously reduced MSA funds for enrollees in certain age cohorts. We find that this reduction led to a large and statistically significant decrease in health-care expenditures that is unlikely due to an income effect. The effect was driven by enrollees who were likely to exhaust MSA funds and enter the deductible phase in which they paid out-of-pocket.","[Fan, Maoyong] Ball State Univ, Dept Econ, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Lei, Zhen] Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Liu, Gordon] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China",Ball State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Peking University,"Lei, Z (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Energy & Mineral Engn, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",zlei@psu.edu,"Lei, Zhen/JOJ-8587-2023","Lei, Zhen/0000-0002-6544-023X",,,,,29,2,2,0,15,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Stakeholders are increasingly not aware of the relevant role they have in supporting policy-making processes, even if they are usually keen to express their opinions. The aim of the study is to suggest policy-makers and practitioners a way to change their approach to long-term strategies definition in areas with traditionally scarce experience in stakeholder participation and where 'good governance' often lacks. On the whole, empirical results are very positive. The study allowed us to combine both puzzling and powering required by long-term strategies with a positive effect on the democratisation of the policymaking. In particular, both the e-mail survey and the workshop were important moments to sharing knowledge with experts, to putting together the different visions from stakeholders and to drawing possible policy actions (puzzling). Moreover, the backcasting timeline that clearly indicates the sequence of events and the involved stakeholders, and the strategy's validation questionnaires can be intended as a step towards a guide as to how power can be organised for each stage of the process (powering).

The power industry company has realized to have a crucial problem in the area of communication as the adequate information was not delivered to proper people. That was an impulse for us to commence the research survey related to the importance of feelings of self-worth within the group of managers and the way how miscellaneous aspects of work of managers shall be assessed in connection with the fact that managers have been working in a variety of hierarchical levels in the power industry company. The target group comprised of the total number of 200 managers. Finally, the amount of 116 managers responded to our research survey electronically. Managers classified in four hierarchical management levels assessed miscellaneous aspects of work, whereas a majority of them have been satisfied with feelings of their self-worth. Each of these particular levels of management hierarchy exhibits distinctive specifics. The most highly positioned is the top management of the given structure of the organization, their deputies are positioned on the second level of hierarchy, another third level of hierarchy shall be occupied by country level managers of the pertinent country, and the fourth level is represented by the line managers who take control directly over the appropriate positions. Managers in different managerial levels assessed 12 major information resources based on the AIMQ methodology. The research survey was amended with a few additional questions related to their mutual communication channels and dependency on feelings of their self-worth. Results demonstrate considerable differences in dependence on managers' hierarchical levels. Managers' degree of self-action turns out to be considered a key factor and a predictor of the personal feeling of their concerns. Thus, our research output accentuates the fact that miscellaneous information must be distributed only to the managerial level concerned within the hierarchy of the power industry company. On basis of such an internal company research, the power industry company received prescriptions to make changes that would optimize internal communication processes.","[Bendova, Sarka] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Bendová, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Human Resources Management, Prague, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,265,271,,,,,,7,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200035,0

They randomly assigned classes into an experimental and a conventional teaching group, or a control group that received no specific instruction. Both teaching treatments improve economic understanding considerably, while effect sizes between teaching treatments are almost identical. However, preexisting economic competencies crucially affect learning outcomes as more competent students seem to benefit disproportionately from classroom experiments, while weaker students lose out. Supplemental data indicate that the experimental treatment crowded out time for adequately discussing the subject, which may have limited less competent students to generate a profound understanding.","[Eisenkopf, Gerald] Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 131, D-78457 Constance, Germany; [Eisenkopf, Gerald] Thurgau Inst Econ, Kreuzlingen, Switzerland; [Sulser, Pascal A.] eBay Inc, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Konstanz; eBay Inc.,"Eisenkopf, G (通讯作者)，Univ Konstanz, Dept Econ, Box 131, D-78457 Constance, Germany.",gerald.eisenkopf@uni-konstanz.de,,,Swiss National Bank,Swiss National Bank,The authors gratefully acknowledge financial and logistical support from the Swiss National Bank.,,27,4,4,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0022-0485,2152-4068,,J ECON EDUC,J.

Job scheduling is a vital task in cloud computing as the customer has to pay for used resources depends upon the time and cost. In existence, scheduling algorithms are established in the job length and the speed of the resources. The job execution in the cloud necessities multiple nodes to execute the single job. This approach is not sufficient to predict the optimal cost in the multi node execution platform. The cost of the network transmission is also not considered for scheduling cost. To overwhelm these complications, a Hierarchical Job Scheduling Algorithm (HJSA) is proposed. The major objective of the proposed work is to schedule the jobs with respect to the parameters of transmission cost, transfer cost, and execution cost of each job. Subsequently, it also foresees the multiple resources for job completion at the specific time. This is considered as the deadline of the workflow that provided by the customer in the cloud environment. To accomplish the deadline, the jobs are allocated using application splitting jobs to the small level task. A novel computational algorithm is introduced for predicting the optimum resources to complete the job with the defined cost and time. The experimental analysis depicts the lower time and cost, and also the higher reliability and throughput than the existing techniques.","[Kamarajapandian, Pown; Chitra, Pandian] Thiagarajar Coll Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India",Thiagarajar College of Engineering,"Kamarajapandian, P (通讯作者)，Thiagarajar Coll Engn, Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India.",kamarajapandianp@gmail.com; pccse@tce.edu,"Chitra, P./AAQ-4817-2020","P, Chitra/0000-0002-0235-1205",,,,,22,0,0,1,7,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Type-1 fuzzy sets are usually used by decision-makers (DMs) to express their evaluations in the process of decision-making. Interval type-2 fuzzy sets (IT2FSs), which are extensions of type-1 fuzzy sets, have more degrees of flexibility in modeling of uncertainty. In this research, a new ranking method to calculate the ranking values of interval type-2 fuzzy sets is proposed. A comparison is performed to show the efficiency of this ranking method. Using the proposed ranking method and the arithmetic operations of IT2FSs, a new method of Assessment based on Fuzzy Ranking and Aggregated Weights (AFRAW)is developed for multi-criteria group decision-making. To obtain more realistic and practical weights for the criteria, the subjective weights expressed by DMs and objective weights calculated based on a deviation-based method are combined, and the aggregated weights are used in the proposed method. A numerical example related to assessment of suppliers in a supply chain and selecting the best one is used to illustrate the procedure of the proposed method. Moreover, a comparison and a sensitivity analysis are performed in this study. The results of these analyses show the validity and stability of the proposed method.","[Keshavarz Ghorabaee, Mehdi; Amiri, Maghsoud] Allameh Tabatabai Univ, Fac Management & Accounting, Dept Ind Management, Tehran, Iran; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras; Antucheviciene, Jurgita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania",Allameh Tabataba'i University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Zavadskas, EK (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Civil Engn, Dept Construct Technol & Management, Vilnius, Lithuania.",m.keshavarz_gh@yahoo.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt; amiri@atu.ac.ir; jurgita.antucheviciene@vgtu.lt,"Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/J-5488-2014; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/W-6112-2018; Amiri, Maghsoud/Z-3160-2019","Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Keshavarz-Ghorabaee, Mehdi/0000-0002-0362-1633; Antucheviciene, Jurgita/0000-0002-1734-3216; Amiri, Maghsoud/0000-0002-0650-2584",,,,,53,35,35,0,22,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Indeed in 2013, Poland exported 600,000 tons of apples to Russia, about one half of its total fresh apple exports. Within the European Union, Poland has become the largest apple producer surpassing Italy, while in 2013 Poland was also the largest world apple exporter. However, following the annexation of Crimea, the EU introduced embargo on selected exports to Russia, while Russia retaliated with its own set of sanctions. This paper discusses the current embargo on apple exports from Poland to Russia in the context of the importance of Russian market for the expanding apple production. The discussion describes the macroeconomic indicators and their relation to the unexpected and sudden increase of domestic supply and the change in apple prices for the domestic consumers. Furthermore, the presentation includes the adopted attempts to compensate Polish apple producers by the EC for lost export markets. Finally, efforts to find new export markets for Polish apples are illustrated with examples from North America, Africa and the Middle East. The paper is primarily descriptive and supported by statistical data illustrating the development of apple production and exports prior to the introduction of embargo, changes in the food price level and the overall inflation, and effects on the agricultural balance of trade. The unprecedented low apple prices on the domestic prices may have the positive effect on reversing the decline in per capita apple consumption observed in recent decades and the eroding position of fresh apples as the dominant fresh fruit. Increased apple supply also led to the development of innovative products including apple cider and apple beverages earlier little known to Polish consumers. The future of the Polish apple sector is at stake unless increasing demand increases lifts prices.","[Klepacka, A. M.] Warsaw Univ Life Sci, Fac Prod Engn, SGGW, Warsaw, Poland; [Florkowski, W.

It focusses on the representations of value that exist in the epistemologies and methodologies of cultural impact evaluation and the discrepancies between these official discourses and the discourses that correspond to cultural practitioners themselves. First the article outlines the critique of dominant forms of cultural impact evaluation, particularly the instrumentalisation of culture. In the second half of the article we draw upon qualitative research conducted with arts practitioners in the East Midlands region of England during 2013 and 2014. In so doing we introduce the concept of the 'infrapolitics' of cultural value that draws on the work of radical anthropologist Scott [(1992) Domination and the Arts of Resistance: Hidden Transcripts, Yale University Press, London]. The central argument is that representations of cultural value are discursive constructions constituted through the epistemologies and methodologies of cultural evaluation, and that there are key differences between these dominant discourses and the discourses of value of cultural practitioners themselves. One important although overlooked element of the significance of cultural value is therefore as a record of the performance of power within the cultural sector, an 'official transcript' that represents dominant discourse of cultural value in opposition to the 'hidden transcripts' that correspond to cultural practitioners. We argue for a research agenda that represents cultural value from practitioners' point of view.","[Newsinger, Jack] Univ Leicester, Dept Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England; [Green, William] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Leicester, Leics, England",University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Newsinger, J (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Dept Media & Commun, Leicester, Leics, England.",jn107@leicester.ac.uk,"Newsinger, Jack/HSG-0851-2023; Green, William/HGB-7114-2022; Green, William/R-6576-2016","Newsinger, Jack/0000-0002-6908-755X; Green, William/0000-0003-4161-4490",College of Social Science at the University of Leicester,College of Social Science at the University of Leicester,The research on which this article is based was made possible through a grant from the College of Social Science at the University of Leicester and a period of academic study leave.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for reflection on current academic training in this profession in the process of consulting services for landscaping and urban horticulture. In the south of Brazil, due to European origins, there is increasing real estate value of peri-urban areas and a consistent annual increase of 20% in the floriculture market. This visual product in urban landscaping is sketched out in agronomy through studies and extension projects in nurseries, gardens, squares and tree planting (urban and highway). Knowledge of botany and plant ecophysiology ally science and art with production of native flowers, medicinal plants, fruit-bearing plants and vegetable growing. From seedling production up to consumption or plant use in landscaping this chain has fulfilled many social functions, such as an increase in employment prospects, engagement in social and philanthropic type projects, and alternatives for occupational therapy with income and product generation. The aim of this study is to help current Brazilian agronomy rescue the origin of horticulture and integrate these new concepts.","[Petry, C.; Dallagnese, L.; Ventura, M. E.; Garcia, N. B.

The license of the firms' disclosure quality which is published by Tehran Stock Exchange is used to measure the disclosure quality, and for better understanding of the ownership structure, this structure is divided into two classes of government and managerial ownership. The results of the study revealed that managerial ownership has a negative and significant effect on disclosure quality, but no significant relationship was observed between governmental ownership and disclosure quality. The results show that the governmental ownership does not affect the quality of disclosure, meaning these companies have a low attention and concern on the quality of their disclosures. Adversely, private companies because of the need to absorb capital from market try to enhance the quality of their disclosures. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Possible consequences of such changes can be unfavourable for economies but can be also a chance for the development of currently not used or even not perceived potential. The aim of research presented in this article is to highlight possibilities and advantages resulting from the introduction of the silver economy concept into the economical system in the situation of forecasted demographic changes. The work analyses the situation of Poland and Czech Republic with respect to the European Union. The elaboration uses the desk research method. Basing on the presented data, we have to state that the demographic transformation will be milder in Czech Republic compared to Poland. It concerns changes in the overall population as well as more detailed measures, including fertility rate, median age, and life expectancy at birth or indexes depicting the situation of older people on the labour market. The major part of analysed data concerning both Czech Republic and Poland exhibits the same direction of changes present in these countries but Czech economy in the perspective till 2100 will better manage the process of ageing, according to predictions of demographers.","[Sobolewska-Poniedzialek, Ewa] Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Podgorna 50, PL-65001 Zielona Gora, Poland",University of Zielona Gora,"Sobolewska-Poniedzialek, E (通讯作者)，Univ Zielona Gora, Fac Econ & Management, Podgorna 50, PL-65001 Zielona Gora, Poland.",e.sobolewska-poniedzialek@wez.uz.zgora.pl,,,,,,,15,2,2,1,5,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

Concurrent to these challenges has been an increased emphasis on reforming and transforming Indian cities in line with neoliberal logics; rationalised under the auspices of achieving equity, efficiency and sustain ability of urban infrastructures, government institutions and space. The extent to which this neoliberal trajectory will result in inclusive cities, especially for the poor, is however questionable. This chapter explores the intersections between the neoliberalisation of water and sanitation in Bangalore and the rights to these services for the poor. By examining efforts to extend services to the city's slums, and the water and sanitation conditions of the homeless who have received no attention in government initiatives to provide services, the chapter reveals the elusive character of the 'inclusive city' when neoliberal logics take trumps over human rights.","[Walters, Vicky] Massey Univ, Sociol, POB 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand",Massey University,"Walters, V (通讯作者)，Massey Univ, Sociol, POB 11222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand.",v.walters@massey.ac.nz,,,,,,,24,2,2,0,5,SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE",2198-9923,,978-981-10-0454-4; 978-981-10-0453-7,DYNAM ASIAN DEVEL,,,2016,,,,,,,171,185,,10.1007/978-981-10-0454-4_9,0.0,,,15,Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BG8KZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392399800009,0

Most existing studies, regardless of whether they endorse or criticise the growing influence of statistical analysis in professional sports, attribute agential capacities exclusively to humans. In this conceptual article, we challenge both what we call 'instrumentalist' and 'romantic' approaches by applying insights from the expanding literature on the performative effects of statistical models in economic markets to the area of sports. Rather than understanding statistics as mirrors of an objective reality, we conceptualise them as interventions in the analysis and conduct of sports. The use of sophisticated techniques for data collection and analysis by scouts, managers, referees and athletes has profound feedback effects on how these sports professionals come to understand their sport and seek to improve their performance. An interdisciplinary performative understanding of statistics allows for an unpacking of the socio-material mechanisms through which data-heavy analytical technologies shape processes of valuation, commercialisation and regulation in professional sports.","[Yarrow, David; Kranke, Matthias] Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Yarrow, D (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Polit & Int Studies, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",david.yarrow@warwick.ac.uk,"Kranke, Matthias/AAJ-6162-2021","Kranke, Matthias/0000-0002-7693-5748",Economic and Social Research Council [1499886]; University of Warwick's Development and Alumni Relations Office scholarship scheme; Economic and Social Research Council [1499886] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); University of Warwick's Development and Alumni Relations Office scholarship scheme; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was supported by the Economic and Social Research Council [grant number 1499886], and the University of Warwick's Development and Alumni Relations Office scholarship scheme.",,74,8,9,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

It is unclear how much of this variation is due to differences in health state selection, the relative frequencies with which health states were valued, and model diagnostics, rather than to genuine differences in population preferences. Using aggregate data from a recent review, we noted all model specifications that were used. For each country the country's own model was re-fitted, as were all other model specifications. This was done twice: once using all valued health states for each country, and again using a common set of 17 health states for all countries. Goodness of fit was assessed using the following model diagnostics: mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and rho (the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed mean utilities), both with and without leave-one-out cross-validation. Thirteen countries contributed data. Even when using a common set of health states, the preferred model varied across countries. However, choice of health states did impact the preferred model specification: when using cross-validation, the preferred specification changed in five of ten countries when moving from 17 health states to all valued health states. The relative frequency with which health states were valued had little impact on the preferred model. Variation in choices of health states to value is responsible for some, but not all, of the observed heterogeneity in model specification. Relative frequency of health state valuation and choice of model diagnostic has a limited impact on model preference, however, use of cross-validation has a substantial impact. The use of cross-validation, implemented through omitting health states rather than respondents, is recommended as one approach to assessing model fit.","[Pullenayegum, Eleanor M.] Hosp Sick Children, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Perampaladas, Kuhan; Gaebel, Kathryn; Xie, Feng] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Doble, Brett] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Clayton, Vic, Australia",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); McMaster University; Monash University,"Pullenayegum, EM (通讯作者)，Hosp Sick Children, Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, 555 Univ Ave, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",eleanor.pullenayegum@sickkids.ca,"Pullenayegum, Eleanor/AAT-1712-2020","Pullenayegum, Eleanor/0000-0003-4265-1330; Doble, Brett/0000-0002-4948-8831",Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Ontario Health Quality Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council,Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Ontario Health Quality Council; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)),"Eleanor Pullenayegum and Feng Xie are funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research New Investigator Salary Awards.

This study follows similar surveys of the same population in 1973 and 1985. The results show that woodlot management activities are strongly integrated into respondents' lifestyles, although respondents' socio-economic characteristics have changed over the last 40 years. A majority of respondents own a woodlot that is located near their residence; have owned it for more than 20 years; visit it several times a year; use it to carry out complementary activities, mainly for enjoyment; and plan to transfer it the next generation, thus keeping it in the family. A majority of respondents view generating an income from forest activities as a secondary objective. For most of them, timber harvesting and hunting do not conflict with their desire to protect their natural environment. These results confirm the existing literature emphasizing the primacy of intrinsically individual factors such as personal or family values over external incentives in order to explain landowners' degree of involvement in forest management activities.

This article develops a formal explanation of the way in which the credible threat to resort to and the actual use of WTO litigation can influence multilateral trade negotiations. We contend that the ability to impose costs on a defendant by way of litigation increases the complainant's bargaining power, opening a bargaining window and ultimately increasing the chances for cooperation in multilateral trade negotiations. On the other hand, the complainant's preference for loss-mitigation over gains from retaliation and its expectations about the likelihood that the defendant will not comply with an adverse ruling can augment the defendant's bargaining leverage. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, increased enforcement does not necessarily make actors shy away from further cooperation, although the credibility of the defendant's non-compliant threats crucially affects the location of any potential negotiated agreement. Empirically, we show that the argument can account for how Brazil, a potential complainant, and the EU and the US, two potential defendants, approached and bargained agricultural negotiations in the Doha Round.","[Poletti, Arlo] LUISS Guido Carli, Dept Polit Sci, Rome, Italy; [Poletti, Arlo] LUISS Guido Carli, Sch Govt, Rome, Italy; [De Bievre, Dirk] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Inst & Multilevel Polit ACIM, Dept Polit Sci, Antwerp, Belgium; [Chatagnier, J.

In analyzing these, the article conceptualizes three sets of storylines and assesses which of the identified storylines resonate in the first Indian REDD + project, focusing on both stakeholders' views and project design. The three identified questions do not give rise to contentious debates among stakeholders of the REDD + project. Contrasting views on REDD + found in scholarly and political debates - such as carbon versus non-carbon objectives, authority of technical experts versus local communities, and market versus fund-based approaches - are not prevalent among project stakeholders, who believe that different approaches to REDD + can be combined and can even reinforce each other. Project stakeholders prefer non-carbon benefits as the project's main objective to be monitored jointly by experts and local communities, and favor a mix of fund- and market-based approaches. This is also reflected in the project design. The conclusion reflects on the insights that the multi-level discourse analysis in this article generated, including for REDD + in general.

This study shows that an expansion of the scale of urbanization, and its transformation into the focal point of the hub-and-spoke eco-city model will enable China to advance as an international pioneer, by the creation of a new socio-technical regime dependent on green and ecologically sustainable systems. In particular, the potential capacity of China's new socio-technical regime, built on eco-cities, is based on its capability to (1) create a vision for a smart energy system; (2) drive down the cost of renewable energy equipment and devices; (3) support local industrial clusters for socio-economic development; (4) implement effective policies for city-level solutions; and (5) standardize and replicate these strategies in the new regime as a whole. In the top-down landscape approach, the public authority's integrated administrative capability and capacity is important as a means by which to link the various types of stakeholders. This has to be done, in the process of managing a city's transition and reducing the risk of transformational failure, by reinforcing the four types of capital assets - namely manufacturing capital, natural capital, human capital, and social capital.

This tendency represents a shift away from a model characterised by individual responsibility in favour of one that focuses on so-called 'obesogenic environments'. Although an extensive body of literature stresses the importance of urban design in helping to eradicate obesity, there is, nevertheless, significant uncertainty in the science surrounding the relationship between body size and broad geographic areas. In this paper, we therefore widen the perspective from urban area planning to land planning. Specifically, we outline the incidence of forests helping to create an environment more favourable to outdoor physical activities, which at least improve health by lowering body mass index.

This article provides an overview of the multifaceted relationships between national-level institutions and the three dominant forms of nonstandard employment, that is, temporary, part-time and solo self-employment. The article highlights the great heterogeneity that exists among the different forms of nonstandard work, both within and between countries. Neither welfare regime approaches nor dualization and precarization theories sufficiently capture the ongoing diversification of employment relationships across countries. However, the institution-specific analyses reviewed here are also not without challenges: high-quality macro-and microlevel data are scarce; institutions interact in complex ways with their environment and exert distinct effects on different groups of workers; moreover, the demographic composition of the work-force and the role of cultural characteristics make it difficult for researchers to correctly specify such macro-to-micro links in their empirical work. In addition to outlining several avenues for future research, the article informs ongoing debates on the relevance of nonstandard work for the study of social inequality and research in comparative political analysis.","[Hipp, Lena; Bernhardt, Janine; Allmendinger, Jutta] WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany",,"Hipp, L (通讯作者)，WZB Berlin Social Sci Ctr, Berlin, Germany.",lena.hipp@wzb.eu,"Hipp, Lena/ABI-4849-2020","Hipp, Lena/0000-0002-1535-8748",Hans-Bockler-Foundation [2010-342-4]; German Federal Ministry of Education [6101301],Hans-Bockler-Foundation; German Federal Ministry of Education(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)),Support for this research was provided by the Hans-Bockler-Foundation (Grant #2010-342-4) and the German Federal Ministry of Education (Grant # 6101301).,,178,100,108,3,66,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

This decision left us with bad law. Assuming that any momentous shift, especially in the current regulatory framework that does not provide for any express justification for good subsidies, is difficult, we speculate on what may lie ahead for future litigants and the dispute settlement. Either 'a wide' or 'a narrow road' can now be followed. After outlining the risks that a normalization and expansion of this ruling may pose (the 'wide road'), we have responded to the call for clarification and narrowing of this case (the 'narrow road') and speculated on how this could be done. The EU Altmark decision of the European Court of Justice, which was certainly on the minds of the EU litigators and whose ethos the Appellate Body embraced by referring to the use of 'price-discovery mechanisms', has inspired the analysis. The exercise has, however, exposed many challenges and difficulties, many of them having already occurred in EU law. The amount of helpful clarification the WTO judicature could offer is thus limited, and would probably be restricted to taking the link between market definition and benchmarking seriously. This unsatisfactory conclusion leads to suggest, once again, law reform as the only solution to the current status quo. Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.

I employ statelevel data on length of school terms and pupil-teacher ratios to examine these responses. Other literature has found that stricter compulsory schooling legislation failed to impact black students' education levels in terms of years of schooling, while having a modest increase on white students' years of schooling. I find that an increase in the age at which a child could receive a work permit led to a small increase in the term length in black schools relative to white schools. On the whole, however, the differential effects on school quality are small in scope and magnitude. This finding suggests that in the context I examine, changes in school quality are a minor issue when using compulsory schooling laws as an instrument for educational attainment or when estimating the overall impact of compulsory schooling laws on educational attainment.

Existing evidence suggests the transition from elementary to middle school is a decisive period for literacy development. In this paper I investigate the impact of extended learning time in literacy instruction on subsequent cognitive outcomes. I capitalize on the existence of a natural experiment born out of a district's use of an exogenously-determined cutoff in Iowa Test scores in fifth grade to assign students to an additional literacy course in middle school. My findings suggest that exposure to this intervention generates strong negative impacts for black students, and noisy positive impacts for white, Latino, and Asian students. My findings suggest that additional literacy instruction in middle school can have markedly different effects on students, and program differentiation or augmentation may be necessary to prevent harm for students of average literacy ability in fifth grade.","Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut,"Dougherty, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Neag Sch Educ, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",shaun.dougherty@uconn.edu,"Dougherty, Shaun/GVS-8504-2022","Dougherty, Shaun/0000-0003-3362-8948",,,,,47,9,9,0,7,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1557-3060,1557-3079,,EDUC FINANC POLICY,Educ.

The argument developed here is that their reasoning is not, any more than that of their heterodox critics, independent of ideology, power and ethics. The widespread belief in austerity policies as scientifically justified has prevented arguments against austerity gaining more traction; issues of ideology, power and ethics need to be brought to the fore as part of the arguments on both sides. In other words, awareness of the epistemological issues arising from an open-system ontology is critical to understanding the crisis and the policy response, and therefore to challenging that understanding and encouraging a radical policy shift. The critique of austerity policies would therefore be strengthened by a critique of the mainstream's rhetorical (mis)representation of economic theorising.","[Dow, Sheila C.] Univ Stirling, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland",University of Stirling,"Dow, SC (通讯作者)，Univ Stirling, Stirling Management Sch, Div Econ, Stirling FK9 4LA, Scotland.",s.c.dow@stir.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,9,10,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

The manufacturers possessing significant economic and political clout have almost invariably escaped the sanctions of the national legal system.

It argues that such a trade restriction regime should neither be country nor even industry-wide, rather be targeted to rouge manufacturers acting in violation of safety laws.

This includes references to some laws and regulations of the subjects of the Russian Federation (such as Republics, Oblast, Krai)(1) as well as the Federal legislation applicable to the entire territory of the Russian Federation. Second, it analyses the adoption of SPS measures by the CU in relation to trade within the CU and with other countries, taking into account background provided in a related article by the same authors.(2) Russia is a key for understanding the issues of trade regulation because Russia's case for joining WTO was made on the basis of the CU. For this reason, the adoption of SPS measures by Kazakhstan (in accession negotiations) and by the Kyrgyz Republic (WTO Member since 1998 and candidate for membership of CU) are discussed and compared. The article concludes with a discussion of the key issues about SPS measures and trade in the CU that were raised in the introduction. It is intended that this will provide the legal/regulatory background for economic analysis of trade in food and other agricultural products within the CU and between the CU and third countries.","[Black, Robert] Univ Greenwich, Law, London SE18 6PF, England; [Kireeva, Irina] NCTM OConnor, Brussels, Belgium",University of Greenwich,"Black, R (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, London SE18 6PF, England.;Black, R (通讯作者)，Univ Greenwich, Law, London SE18 6PF, England.",r.black@gre.ac.uk; i.kireeva@nctm.it,,,,,,,7,4,4,0,7,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

Due to increasing role of information in business management, institutional managers' awareness increases regarding the need to have a good knowledge of competition in business environment and to arrange internal processes of organisation to be able to respond efficiently to the changes caused by the external environment. To enable knowledge sharing within the company, a special role is paid by the existing organisational culture, since certain organisational cultures promote more open information movement among members. Researchers increasingly emphasize the positive role of knowledge sharing and the advantages to be gained from it by private individuals and organisations. To make organisations successful, specific attention is required for provision of information interaction. The object of the research is to evaluate knowledge sharing techniques and their importance to implement competitive intelligence in Latvian enterprises based on the analyses of scientific literature and the results of the survey data. The result of the research of management of competitive intelligence in Latvia pointed out the necessity to improve the communication system of enterprises.

Data have been processed with correspondence analysis and proved that consumers see more the similarities between the regional labels - they symbolise above all quality, only few people consider that food with regional label must be a symbol of higher price. To analyse the media presence of the regional brands in Vysocina, the company Newton Media, provided the texts that included both existing regional labels.

This study is valuable in order to achieve the assumption for economic development. Even though World population has increase in the last period, most of European's countries experience very low fertility levels, well below the replacement level. Romania has seen in the last two decades a dramatically decline of the total fertility rate (TFR) well below the population replacement level, thus leading to a decrease in the number of inhabitants and the aging of the population. In the same period, the unemplyment rate has been above the average for the European Union and the human development index (HDI) became also high. The Total Fertility Rate measures the average number of living new born per woman in her fertile life. The goal of this article is to estimate the effect of unemployment rate and HDI in the fertility modifications from the last 20 years in Romania. Our findings suggest that unemployment have a strong negative effect on childbearing while HDI has a very strong negative influence on fertility.

The proportion of working capital that is financed with bank loans is higher for these firms. A higher portion of working capital is financed with purchases on credit from suppliers and advances from customers by firms that are larger and firms that are younger. Firms with lower export intensity finance a higher portion of fixed asset investments with internal funds. The proportion of fixed asset investments that is financed with bank loans is lower for older firms. Older firms and firms with a lower percentage of sales made on credit use internal financing more intensively to finance both working capital and fixed asset investments.

It follows the frontiers of their effects with one particularly consequential practice of scientific reductionism through its implication with vitamin A deficiency. I open up how the scientific articulation of vitamin A is not simply about reductionism as a process of limiting, but one that unfolds as something more malleable, more multiple; how it is a shifting, distributed reality that speaks of the ongoing effects of reductionism as giving life to, among other things, emotive abstractions, and efforts to widen a distinctly humanitarian promise. I show how this scientific practice puts into play a set of emotive abstractions around the figure of the 'Third World child', un/remaking the problem as a morally tense 'bio-expectation' that ensures the survival of children across the generalised expanse of the Global South.","[Factor, David] Univ Sydney, 1-466 Oxford St, Sydney, NSW 2021, Australia",University of Sydney,"Factor, D (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, 1-466 Oxford St, Sydney, NSW 2021, Australia.",david.factor.designer@gmail.com,,,,,,,66,0,0,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

In addition to providing empirical results regarding the important local fishery, it offers a useful example of the potential for inverse demand systems for seafood where quantities are often defined prior to prices and a variety of products are obtained from a single species. This is done using a non-linear Inverse Almost Ideal Demand System coupled with seasonal patterns and controlling for endogeneity. The model used here is able to address seasonality in demand in terms of varying flexibilities over seasons and deals with endogeneity in accordance with biological stock assessment data. Empirical results show significant season-varying market behaviors and the presence of endogeneity in the demand system. All market categories are price inflexible across seasons. Cross-category flexibilities suggest that the categories are quantity substitutes in the market.","Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Huang, P (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, 2124 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",peihuang@tamu.edu,,,"Maryland Sea Grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce [R/FISH/EC-103]","Maryland Sea Grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce","This research was conducted with support from Maryland Sea Grant under award R/FISH/EC-103 from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, US Department of Commerce.

Firstly, the agency costs resulting from relationship between shareholders and management are rising. Moreover, new subjects and new partnerships, e.g. partnership with underwriting company or with investors interested in IPO, are created. These new partnerships could be typical of agency costs phenomena as well. I therefore examine whether IPO process increases agency costs and I quantify the impact of major sources on agency costs. Firstly, I assembled the sample of newly publicly traded companies between 2011-2014. In the next step, I identified drivers that influenced agency costs and described their impact on total agency costs.

On the other hand, a liberal trade policy became possible even under divided government if Democrats and Republicans agreed on labor provisions for trade agreements.

In standard macroeconomics theory of open economies, it is argued that an increase in government expenditure leads to an appreciation of the domestic currency. More recent papers, in contrast, find the opposite results. Unlike the previous studies, this paper synthesizes the two competing paradigms to empirically investigate whether it has had any relationship with the exchange rate stabilization instead of the exchange rate determination. After analyzing the quarterly data covering 1998-2012 in the case of Indonesia by employing auto-regressive distributed lag model, the study found that the impact of discretionary fiscal policy on the exchange rate stabilization typically depends on the characteristics of fiscal policy shock In one hand, the government spending policy shock reduces the exchange rate volatility. In contrast, the discretionary of fiscal policy shock induces the exchange rate volatility. The results are robust across three types of exchange rates volatility specification. Those findings above suggest that fiscal policy should be conducted based on the fiscal rule to maintain exchange rates stabilization.","State Univ Jakarta, Fac Econ, Jakarta, Indonesia",Universitas Negeri Jakarta,"Kuncoro, H (通讯作者)，State Univ Jakarta, Fac Econ, Jakarta, Indonesia.",har_kun@feunj.ac.id,"Wiralaga, Harya Kuncara/GQO-9107-2022","Kuncoro, Haryo/0000-0002-4512-1389",,,,,25,0,0,0,4,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

As IT develops, IT paradigm has been changed in enterprises from location-centric and centralized Industrial Era to collaborative and peer-to-peer based Work 2.0. The latest key IT paradigm emerging after Work 2.0 is Smart Work. Despite enterprises' awareness of the positive correlation between business productivity and Smart Work usage, application of the Smart Work model in business environment is still in adoption staging as many organizational workers confront entry barriers such as but not limited to technical difficulties and security issues. Although many researches study on the correlation between environment's productivity and Smart Work model usage, there are relatively little analysis on the relationship between Smart Work services users' usage intention and their job performance. The research is about analysis about the relationship between Smart Work services users' usage intention and their job performance. Also it is studied on the possible positive influencing factors and entry barriers to the adoption of the Smart Work model in the organizational working environments. This empirical analysis covers Enterprise Smart Applications (ESA) among various Smart Work services, ranging from ESA services to pervasive cloud-based network services and shared drives, and examines a questionnaire survey to the ESA service users to collect their perceived usefulness for task purpose and perceived facilities of use for task purpose. Based on the questionnaire results, this study further analyses how their level of perception impacts to their usage intention of ESA and the key factors promoting individuals' efficient adoption of ESA services in organizational working environment, enhancing their actual job performances. While former studies on ESA technology acceptance model focused on users' involuntary technology acceptance and usage for PC-based Enterprise Application Program, this study investigates on users' voluntary technology acceptance, driven by personalization trend in ESA technology acceptance model based on ESA's mobility.","[Lee, Veronica] Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, New York, NY 10080 USA",Bank of America Corporation,"Lee, V (通讯作者)，Bank Amer Merrill Lynch, New York, NY 10080 USA.",veronica.sm.lee@gmail.com,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,600,608,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800058,0

Data transformation is a conventional method to decrease skewness, but there are some disadvantages. Some recent studies have employed generalized linear models (GLMs) and Cox proportional hazard regression as alternative estimators. The aim of this study was to investigate how well these alternative estimators perform in terms of bias and precision when the data are skewed. The primary outcome was an estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the secondary outcome was the impact of a covariate on healthcare cost. Alternative estimators, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) for Ln(y) or Log(y), Gamma, Weibull and Cox proportional hazard regression models, were compared using Monte Carlo simulation under different situations, which were generated from skewed distributions. We found that there was not one best model across all generated conditions. However, GLMs, especially the Gamma regression model, behaved well in the estimation of population means of healthcare costs. The results showed that the Cox proportional hazard model exhibited a poor estimation of population means of healthcare costs and the beta(1) even under proportional hazard data. Approximately results are consistent by increasing the sample size. However, increasing the sample size could improve the performance of the OLS-based model.","[Malehi, Amal Saki; Pourmotahari, Fatemeh; Angali, Kambiz Ahmadi] Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ahvaz, Iran",Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (AJUMS),"Malehi, AS (通讯作者)，Ahvaz Jundishapur Univ Med Sci, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat & Epidemiol, Ahvaz, Iran.",amalsaki@gmail.com,"Pourmotahari, Fatemeh/HJA-4354-2022","Pourmotahari, Fatemeh/0000-0002-0645-990X; ahmadi angali, kambiz/0000-0002-1530-2349; ahmadi angali, kambiz/0000-0002-6816-4517",Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences,Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences,This study is part of biostatistics MS degree thesis of Fatemeh Pourmotahari and it was supported by the Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.,,14,155,174,1,10,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

However the empirical evidence for the positive impact of growth in productivity of tradables on real exchange rate is at least mixed and depends on productivity proxies used to test this hypothesis. In our paper, we use a panel estimation framework to investigate the impact of labour productivity shocks on real effective exchange rates among individual euro area countries over the period 1999 - 2013. Besides the commonly used indicator of the overall tradable-sector productivity we also apply a set of sector-specific indicators of labour productivity for agriculture, construction, manufacturing and services, which enables us to assess the impact of productivity shocks on real exchange rates stemming both from the tradable and the non-tradable sector of the economy. We find evidence that the intra-euro-area real effective exchange rate is affected by productivity shocks stemming both from the tradable and non-tradable sector of the economy, which contradicts the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis.","[Plecita, Klara] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Finance, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic; [Grochova, Ladislava Issever] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Econ, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Plecitá, K (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Finance, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic.",klara.plecita@mendelu.cz; ladislava.grochova@mendelu.cz,"Grochová, Ladislava Issever/AAE-9065-2021; Plecitá, Klára/V-9021-2018; Issever Grochova, Ladislava/E-6841-2013","Grochová, Ladislava Issever/0000-0002-9983-4077;",,,,,19,1,1,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,659,664,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900113,0

This paper presents a first explorative study on positional concerns in the context of health. Using a 'two-world' survey method, a convenience sample of 143 people chose between two options (having more in absolute terms or having more in relative terms) in several health and non-health domains. Our results for the non-health domains compare reasonably well to previous studies, with 22-47 % of respondents preferring the positional option. In the health domain, these percentages were significantly lower, indicating a stronger focus on absolute positions. The finding that positional concerns are less prominent in the health domain has important implications for health policy, for instance in balancing reduction of socio-economic inequalities and absolute health improvements.","[Wouters, S.; van Exel, N.

Healthcare resource group (HRG) costing relies on a top-down approach. We aimed to quantify the direct cost of intermediate complexity PPV. Five NHS vitreoretinal units prospectively recorded all consumables, equipment and staff salaries during PPV undertaken for vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane and macular hole. Out-of-surgery costs between admission and discharge were estimated using a representative accounting method. The average patient time in theatre for 57 PPVs was 72 min. The average in-surgery cost for staff was A 297 pound, consumables A 619 pound, and equipment A 82 pound (total A 997) pound. The average out-of-surgery costs were A 260 pound, including nursing and medical staff, other consumables, eye drops and hospitalisation. The total cost was therefore A 1634 pound, including 30 % overheads. This cost estimate was an under-estimate because it did not include out-of-theatre consumables or equipment. The average reimbursed HRG tariff was A 1701 pound. The cost of undertaking PPV of intermediate complexity is likely to be higher than the reimbursed tariff, except for hospitals with high throughput, where amortisation costs benefit from economies of scale.

In 2012, the Appellate Body adjudicated on three TBT disputes: US-Clove Cigarettes, US-Tuna II, and US-COOL, aiming to officially interpret and clarify Articles 2.1 and 2.2 of the Agreement by creating a distinct test for a measure's consistency with these Articles. This paper explores the relevant decisions of both the Panel and Appellate Body in the three disputes which led to the creation of the 'legitimate regulatory distinction' test. The substance behind this phrase, placed in context, is dissected along with the associated idea of 'even-handedness'. The test attempts to simplify future interpretations regarding what will constitute unjustifiable discrimination, but at the cost of the necessary distinction between the GATT and the TBT Agreement being blurred. The result is a test which is incomplete and which fails to take account of the special circumstances surrounding the TBT Agreement.","[Houston-McMillan, Jason] Rhodes Univ, Grahamstown, South Africa",Rhodes University,"Houston-McMillan, J (通讯作者)，Rhodes Univ, Grahamstown, South Africa.",JasonHM121@gmail.com,,,,,,,13,10,11,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2016,15,4.0,,,,,543,562,,10.1017/S1474745616000239,0.0,,,20,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,DY8BD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385352300001,0

We allow past education and criminal activities to affect current crime and educational decisions. We take advantage of a rich panel dataset on serious juvenile offenders, the Pathways to Desistance. Using a series of psychometric tests, we estimate a model of cognitive and social/emotional skills which feed into the crime and education model. This allows us to separately identify the roles of state dependence, returns to experience, and heterogeneity in driving crime and enrollment decisions among youth. We find small effects of experience and stronger evidence of state dependence and heterogeneity for crime and schooling. We provide evidence that, as a consequence, policies that affect individual heterogeneity (e.g., social/emotional skills), and those that temporarily keep youth away from crime, can have important and lasting effects even if criminal experience has already accumulated.

The primary focus of the research was the FSC system's impacts on FES management. What is unique about this study is that it evaluates the adaptability of key FSC stakeholders in temis of their ability to incorporate FES. We surveyed 270 FSC stakeholders to quantify the capacity of FSC certification bodies (e.g., auditors) to audit FES delivery, the preferences of FSC enabling partners (e.g., FSC national networks) to provide training; and the experiences and expectations of FSC certificate holders (e.g., forest owners) to manage and sell FES. The study results indicate that the stakeholder adaptability was high for biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, and provision of non-timber forest products, medium for watershed protection services, and low for ecotourism and agricultural products. This may help FSC establish priorities for capacity development for FES. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Case studies on the roles of researchers in Japanese and Swedish forest policy processes,FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Roles of researcher; Forest policy; RIU model; Scientific knowledge transfer,,"The aim of this study is to clarify the roles of researchers in forest policy development processes. Comparative case studies between Japan and Sweden were conducted. The research-integration-utilisation (RIU) model on scientific knowledge transfer was employed as a framework. Based on the RIU model, 'scientist', 'integrator', and 'policy entrepreneur' were defined as three hypothesised roles of researchers, discussed in conjunction with Pielke's 'honest broker' model. It was found that researchers played important roles, both as scientists and integrators in Japan. In Sweden, researchers played only the role of scientist. However, no researchers working as policy entrepreneurs were found in either country. These results indicate that the RIU model could work as a basis for the comparison between countries and the clarification of the roles of researchers in forest policy processes. The case study analysis also specified three additional topics for further discussion: (1) different types of science-based policy advice; (2) the relationship between power allies and consensus building; and (3) the reason why the roles of researchers differ between Japan and Sweden.

However, their ability to outgrow a protected niche characterized by feed-in tariffs, to regime level, is unclear. Drawing on qualitative interviews with key actors, the present study classifies Austrian CPIs in terms of them being market-based (profit-oriented business) or grassroots initiatives (civil-society based community activism), and compares these two types with respect to the three key processes of strategic niche management: actor network formation, learning, and expectations management. Market-based CPIs exhibit a relatively heterogeneous external actor network. They follow a policy of business development, engage in highly professionalized learning, and access a large, widespread customer base. In contrast, grassroots CPIs leverage a tightly-knit network of local actors, engage in informal learning and shared expectations. In some CPIs, market-based and grassroots motivations converge. Both types seem capable of achieving regime level, either through individual growth or by aggregation of multiple small-scale initiatives. As yet, few CPIs have outgrown their local niche status. This is mainly due to a lack of intermediary actors which may institutionalize knowledge and resources to support the foundation of new CPIs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our work focuses on forest management decisions rather than afforestation, allows full forest sector price adjustment to land-use changes, and incorporates time-dependent costs and restrictions of offset programs. The land-use model utilizes structure count data on some 21,000 plots spanning 30 years. The intertemporal optimizing forest sector model employs mill-level demand and FIA plot-level inventory. Our linked simulation modeling projects that an offset sales program could reduce forest land loss to development in western Oregon by about 4700 acres over the 2010-2060 simulation period for each $1 increase in the carbon price.

Under the new rule, students are dismissed if they fail 50 percent or more credits in any two semesters as opposed to two consecutive semesters. The results show students who had failed 50 percent or more credit hours in a semester are more likely to strategically enroll in leniently graded courses after the policy change, especially in classes with a low failure rate. Study time and class attendance increase significantly after the policy change, suggesting the policy has achieved its goal of encouraging student effort. Instructors are found to grade more leniently after the policy change and the effect remains strong after student effort is controlled for. More importantly, instructors lower grading standards mainly through failing fewer students, as opposed to giving higher grades.","[Keng, Shao-Hsun] Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",National University Kaohsiung,"Keng, SH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Kaohsiung, Dept Appl Econ, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",shkeng@nuk.edu.tw,"Keng, Shao-Hsun/W-6172-2019","Keng, Shao-Hsun/0000-0002-7153-5892",National Science Council [NSC-100-2410-H-390-015],"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)","I would like to thank two anonymous referees for their insightful comments and the National Science Council for its generous financial support (NSC-100-2410-H-390-015).

Using three urban household surveys for 1995, 2002 and 2007, the authors examine how change in enterprise ownership structure - one of the major features of China's economic transition - has contributed to widening urban wage inequality. While wage dispersion was higher in the private sector over the period 1995-2007, it increased faster in the public sector. However, over 50 per cent of the increase in urban wage inequality is associated with labour reallocation from the public to the private sector. Urban wage inequality may thus widen further if more labour is reallocated to the private sector.","[Whalley, John] Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Int Governance Innovat, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada; [Whalley, John] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Xing, Chunbing] Beijing Normal Univ, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Western University (University of Western Ontario); National Bureau of Economic Research; Beijing Normal University,"Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Ctr Int Governance Innovat, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.;Whalley, J (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",jwhalley@uwo.ca; xingchb@bnu.edu.cn,,,Ontario Research Fund,Ontario Research Fund,"The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Ontario Research Fund for support, and to Audra Bowlus, Chris Robinson, Terry Sicular and a seminar group at the University of Western Ontario for their comments on an earlier draft of this article.",,23,6,6,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0020-7780,1564-913X,,INT LABOUR REV,Int.

Using three European case studies - BedZed, Vauban and Hammarby - it investigates the processes of broadening and scaling up within cities, nations and across cities globally; and finds that transition experiments do influence the development regime in which they are embedded. The impact of experiments on the development regime does vary significantly with scale. The innovative components, which are assembled in experiments (cultural, structural and practices) also seem to have differing propensity to influence the development regime at different scales. Thus, cultural innovations have a greater propensity to influence the development regime across all scales, whilst the structural and practice innovations tend to influence the development regime locally and nationally. The case studies also demonstrated the significance of context (historical and geographical) in shaping experiments and influencing the transformation process. This finding suggests that the importance of broadening in the transformation process has been overstated. The experiments show that broadening across national boundaries and for prolonged periods, can result in expanding niche-regimes which become increasingly diverse. But it does not result in transformation. (C) 2016 The Author.

Collective action has been promoted to remedy those disadvantages. Using survey data of 421 women members and 210 nonmembers of a coffee producer cooperative in Western Uganda, this study investigates the determinants of women's participation in cooperatives and women's intensity of participation. The results highlight the importance of access to and control over land for women to join the cooperative in the first place. Participation intensity is measured through women's participation in collective coffee marketing and share capital contributions. It is found that duration of membership, access to extension services, more equal intrahousehold power relations, and joint land ownership positively influence women's ability to commit to collective action. These findings demonstrate the embeddedness of collective action in gender relations and the positive value of women's active participation for agricultural-marketing cooperatives.","[Selhausen, Felix Meier Zu] Univ Utrecht, Hist & Art Hist, NL-3512 BS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Selhausen, FMZ (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Econ, Jubilee Bldg 229, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",fm272@sussex.ac.uk,,"Meier zu Selhausen, Felix/0000-0001-8593-7983",,,,,63,51,54,2,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-5701,1466-4372,,FEM ECON,Fem.

Given the availability of comparable and relevant statistical data, the standard of living was studied between 2005 and 2012. The study was conducted with the use of taxonomic method - Hellwig's synthetic measure. The results indicated that in 2012 Poland and the Czech Republic recorded a growth in the standard of living compared to 2005. Between 2005 and 2008, Poland was in the group of countries with a relatively low standard of living. It was not until the 2012, that it entered the group of countries with a moderate standard of living, and was placed on the 20th position in the ranking of 25 countries. Faster (compared to Poland) transition to a higher class caused that finally in 2012 the Czech Republic was placed on the 11th position in the ranking of 25 countries, and on the 2nd position in the group of countries with a moderate standard of living. Undoubtedly, the improvement of living standards in both countries was affected by measures taken under the EU cohesion policy. It was associated with a specified stream of funding flowing into the new EU members. Poland was the main beneficiary of these funds, although after translating the quotas into the amounts per capita it turned out that only in the first programming period (2004 - 2006) funds per capita were higher for Poland than for the Czech Republic.","[Bobrowska, Agnieszka; Musial, Mateusz] Univ Opole, Fac Econ, Ozimska 46a, PL-45058 Opole, Poland",University of Opole,"Bobrowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Opole, Fac Econ, Ozimska 46a, PL-45058 Opole, Poland.",abobrowska@uni.opole.pl; mmusial@uni.opole.pl,,"Musial, Mateusz/0000-0001-6705-9750",,,,,8,0,0,0,1,VSB-TECH UNIV OSTRAVA,OSTRAVA,"FEECS, DEPT ELECTR POWER ENG, 17.

(Funding valuation adjustment: a consistent framework including CVA, DVA, collateral, netting rules and re-hypothecation, 2011, [11]). These equations take the form of semi-linear PDEs and Forward-Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (FBSDEs). After summarizing the cash flows definitions allowing us to extend valuation to credit risk and default closeout, including collateral margining with possible re-hypothecation, and treasury funding costs, we show how such cash flows, when present-valued in an arbitrage-free setting, lead to semi-linear PDEs or more generally to FBSDEs. We provide conditions for existence and uniqueness of such solutions in a classical sense, discussing the role of the hedging strategy. We show an invariance theorem stating that even though we start from a risk-neutral valuation approach based on a locally risk-free bank account growing at a risk-free rate, our final valuation equations do not depend on the risk-free rate. Indeed, our final semi-linear PDE or FBSDEs and their classical solutions depend only on contractual, market or treasury rates and we do not need to proxy the risk-free rate with a real market rate, since it acts as an instrumental variable.

The concept of a fuzzy event is used to calculate the net present value and assess the risk of each investment project.

Two novel variable selection methods are used to optimize the performance of prediction models. In order to identify) the most informative time series to predict a stock price, both methods are essentially based on the general forecasting error minimization when a certain stock price is expressed exclusively in terms of other indicators. After the variable selection is over, the forecasting is performed in terms of the historical values of the given stock price and selected variables respectively.

We introduce an analytical model with firm heterogeneity to distinguish between traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners, and inframarginal rent, which accrues to those with high skill. We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry. In our application to an important US fishery, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource, but without substantial free grandfathering, the top harvesters would rationally oppose the transition to property rights.","[Grainger, Corbett A.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Costello, Christopher] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Grainger, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Agr & Appl Econ, 427 Lorch St, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",corbett.grainger@wisc.edu; costello@bren.ucsb.edu,,"Grainger, Corbett/0000-0001-5789-3725",Walton Family Foundation; Waitt Foundation,Walton Family Foundation; Waitt Foundation,"For helpful comments and suggestions, we thank seminar and conference participants at: Iowa State University, California Workshop in Environmental and Resource Economics (UCSB), Institute Henri Poincare (Paris), IRD (Sete, France), University of Washington, LAMETA (Montpellier, France), Property and Environment Research Center, and World Congress for Environmental and Resource Economics (Istanbul).

This failure is due to the nature of the international legal framework that requires signatories only to cooperate but how to cooperate remains a choice variable. The result is that if it suits them, signatories take 'reservations' (e.g., on whether to abide by catch quotas in Regional Fisheries Management Organizations) with the effect that they continue to 'play' non-cooperatively. It is argued that environmental groups, such as Greenpeace, have an important role to play in aligning moral precepts and one day, perhaps, creating a coordination game between fishing nations in which 'reservations' are no longer taken.","[Hallwood, Paul] Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA; [Hallwood, Paul] Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA",University of Connecticut; University of Connecticut,"Hallwood, P (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.;Hallwood, P (通讯作者)，Univ Connecticut, Dept Econ, 365 Fairfield Way,Unit 1063, Storrs, CT 06269 USA.",paul.hallwood@uconn.edu,,,,,,,34,6,7,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0738-1360,2334-5985,,MAR RESOUR ECON,Mar.

The study combines the literature on women's careers in management, which has mostly focused on developed countries, with the development literature that has emphasized the importance of access to education.

However, it is unclear how such an approach can be designed in the scale necessary to match local, national and international interests in protecting forests. For this reason, the functions of intermediaries deserve explicit recognition by key actors in shaping REDD+ policy nationally and internationally. Indonesia is promoting the more localized Forest Management Unit (Kesatuan Pengelolaan Hutan or MPH) as a key element of forest governance reform for embracing REDD+ and related initiatives. Using a case study from eastern Indonesia, we analyzed local factors driving deforestation and forest degradation. We then reviewed the work of the local KPH to examine the necessary roles of a potential REDD+ intermediary. We argue that progress made by the local KPH in improving forest governance, including partnerships with local communities, is made possible by the MPH fulfilling the role of policy intermediary while taking on transformative roles reshaping internal and external relations. However, for the KPHs to fulfill their mandate as effective REDD+ intermediaries, more concerted efforts from the central and provincial governments, as well as from international donors, are still needed. These include greater consistency in government policies and regulations, improved policy communications, and the commitment to strengthening the capacity of individual KPHs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The authors used theoretical, statistical and econometric methods. Specifically, the structure of input data was investigated using descriptive statistics. Subsequently, linkages between variables and hypotheses were verified by assembling a linear regression model and the correlation analysis. The authors assumed a direct relationship between the both gross export and the share of high-tech export on total export and the statistical indicators on science and technology. By using the polynomial regression analysis, a correlation between the number of human resources in science and technology and high-tech export on total export was investigated. Finally, the authors confronted their findings with previous research in this field. The authors confirmed the relationship between the expenditure on R& D by business enterprise sector and high-tech export for Slovakia.

The estimation also contains a range of household specific variables which can be used to understand the impact of socio-economic characteristics such as urban vs rural dwelling, age, and the educational level.","[Kong, Dejing; Dickinson, David] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Kong, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Dept Econ, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",d.g.dickinson@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,28,2,2,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

It forces managers to manipulate the firm's earning for opportunistic reasons. Intense competition in product market forces manages to manipulate corporate earnings so that by reduction of financial pressures via acquisition of low-cost external financial resources and reduction of capital costs, the product prices are lowered; this in turn gives the firm a competitive advantage by which it acquires a greater share of the market and raises above other competitors. On this basis, the present paper studies the relationship between intense competition in the product market and earnings management. As far as the dimensions of competition are concerned, market size, entry costs, and centralization are the three factors used to measure the competition in product market. In order to examine the hypotheses, the financial statements of 77 companies listed in Tehran stock exchange in 5 industry levels over the time period 2002-2011 are analyzed using regression analysis. The results reveal that factors of entry cost and industry concentration have a significant relationship with earnings management. However, in contrast with existing research literature, the relationship between market size and earnings management is not confirmed. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Nature-food includes aspects such as food-safety, consumption with quiet conscience (sustainability) and organic products. In many studies, consumer preferences are determined using direct surveys. For this method social desirability is problematic. It leads to the effect that participants answer in a way which they perceive as desired by society. This causes, that the stated importance of certain features in these studies are not reflected in real purchasing decisions. The aim of the present study is to quantify the part-worth-utilities of product characteristics such as origin, price and food-labels and to support the assumption of social desirability. The real purchasing situation was simulated in a quasi-experiment using a choice-based-conjoint-analysis. The part-worth-utilities are then compared with the results of a conventional preference assessment (Likertscale). For this purpose 645 consumers from all over Germany were surveyed in 2014. The participants were on average 44 years old and 68.8% were women. The results of the conjoint-analysis (part-worth-utilities determined using a Cox-regression) report the highest part-worth-utility for the lowest price, followed by the characteristic grown locally. For the labels, the German organic label shows the highest partworth- utility followed by Fairtrade/ A heart for the producer. It is remarkable that the carbon-footprint-labels have negative part-worth-utilities compared to tomatoes without a label. The results support the assumption of a social desirability effect, as the price is ranked 12th in the importance of the characteristics on purchasing tomatoes in the survey with a Likert-scale, whereas it is 1st in the evaluation of the quasi-experiment (conjoint-analysis).","[Meyerding, S.] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Hort Prod Syst, Ctr Business Management Hort & Appl Res, Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Meyerding, S (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Hort Prod Syst, Ctr Business Management Hort & Appl Res, Hannover, Germany.",,,"Meyerding, Stephan/0000-0001-9540-3205",,,,,8,2,2,0,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62611-11-5,ACTA HORTIC,,,2016,1132,,,,,,17,24,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1132.3,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BG7DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391238400003,0

This study quantifies whether community forestry contribute to household income with equitable products and income distribution and gender inclusive participation; and community forests are managed applying the principles of sustainable harvest without compromising regeneration and productivity. We applied a combination of social and ecological methods using household interview and forest sampling plots. Our findings revealed that community forestry contributes to household income through harvesting and marketing of large trees, and non-wood forest products where markets are accessible. Household income, however, vary widely between rich and poor households with former capitalizing on commercial and latter on subsistence products. Timber harvesting is consistent with the principles of sustainable harvest without altering species composition, regeneration and productivity. To narrow income inequality, pro-poor approach to community forestry needs to target poor households with income diversification activities and market accessibility. The promising results are context-driven and warrant consolidation from other community forests experiencing harvest in Bhutan. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, much attention is paid to the development of the creative economy, which is based on intellectual activities, generation of new knowledge, design thinking, creative imagination and creativity. Creative, imaginative potential is becoming a major production resource. And a key element of this kind of economy is the category of people with creative thinking, people who are capable of creativity, who are able to create something new, attract attention. The ability to enter the market with the results of creativity gives rise to the creative industry, creation of the communities of creative enterprises, industries that generate a creative cluster. These theses generalize the definition of the term cluster. It was necessary to consider the concept of creative cluster in detail. The attention was paid to creative industries, as a phenomenon of our time, and as part of a creative cluster. Special attention was paid by the authors to the current examples of creative clusters, including those in the structure of accommodation means that according to their concept could be a part of a creative cluster, or even serve as a basic element for creation of a new cluster of the similar type. Special attention was paid to the museums as a social and cultural phenomenon, the actor of the development of the local territory, city or even of the whole region. Museums were presented as a product-generated core, determinant of tourist programs. A modern museum for the local community is a cultural and educational centre, appearing to be a platform for dialogue of a wide range of participants. There is now no need to argue that the museums affect the perception of the territory by its residents and tourists. Fashion museums are in demand by the visitors, who see them as a great alternative to other places of leisure. Museum space, formed in accordance with modern trends, is highly attractive and in demand by visitors and attracts tourist flows, which ultimately has a positive effect on the indicators of economic development of the territory (city, region) as a whole. In conjunction with the development of other infrastructure elements they change the image of the area by stimulating the development of new forms of social and community activities, attracting investment and promoting entrepreneurial initiatives. In its turn this leads to a new round of development of additional services, such as themed cafes, cinemas, lectures, children's art space, exposition and exhibition halls, galleries, etc. Scientific and practical novelty focuses on the synergistic effect of cluster initiatives of various stakeholders. The presentation of thesis materials is an attempt to identify the productive practices of interaction of modern museums with public, social and entrepreneurial initiatives, representation of harmonious differentiation of tourist products of one region from another one, presentation of best practices and technologies of promotion and uniqualization of cultural product of the area.","[Natalia, Platonova; Tatiana, Krivosheeva; Elena, Glinkina] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cherkizovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia",Russian State University of Tourism & Service,"Natalia, P (通讯作者)，Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cherkizovo, Moskovskaya Obl, Russia.",,,,,,,,6,3,3,0,14,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-75-9,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,921,928,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727100120,0

The investigation of the documents revealed that the activities required to prepare the annual report are performed in companies and this provides a prerequisite for the annual report to give a true and fair view.","[Nukka, Ave; Kasearu, Malle] Laane Viru Coll, Modriku, Estonia",,"Nukka, A (通讯作者)，Laane Viru Coll, Modriku, Estonia.",,,,,,,,1,1,1,0,1,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-261-9,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,27,,,,,,382,387,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH1PN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000398381700038,0

In organizations, the involvement in environmental protection by assimilating green IT and their specific practices depends by managers' vision, financial resources, education, culture and legal regulations. This papers focus on the criteria which evaluate the using of the green IT in organization in correlation with the three milestones of ecological sustainability: eco-efficiency, eco-equity and eco-effectiveness proposed in literature. We identify a set of characteristics that reflect the green dimension of IT on three directions: the potential to stimulate knowledge flows, the performance of organisation activities and the financial consequences of adopting green ICT.","[Radu, Laura-Diana] Alexandru Joan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Radu, LD (通讯作者)，Alexandru Joan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi, Romania.",glaura@uaic.ro,"Laura-Diana, Radu/C-4523-2017","Laura-Diana, Radu/0000-0002-1463-8369",,,,,19,0,0,0,5,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,499,504,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG0DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386192300079,0

WHO (2002) recommends that the daily intake of fresh fruit and vegetables at 400 g per day, but it falls below the recommended amount in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana stands out among African countries with relatively high average per capita fruit consumption but still at insufficient level (Hall et al., 2009). This paper examines factors that determine the consumption frequency of fresh fruit by urban consumers in Ghana. The illustration is based on three selected fruits: orange, pineapple, and apple. The selection is intended to account for domestically produced fruit, orange and pineapple, and the fruit that is imported, but familiar to many consumers, an apple. The study uses data collected from a survey among urban population in Ghana in 2011. The multivariate probit technique is applied to estimate three probit equations for consumption of three fruit given daily, weekly, or monthly frequency. Results show that daily consumption of all three fruit was strongly influenced by income, and selectively, by the employment status and location. Weekly consumption was influenced by location, employment status, and the level of education as well as household size. Monthly consumption frequency was primarily associated with location factors. Overall, fruit consumption is strongly positively influenced by income, having a government job, reporting at least a secondary level of education, but location and demographic characteristics have variable directional influence on consumption of the three fruit. Improving incomes and education level will lead to increased consumption of the three fruit.","[Wang, S.; Florkowski, W. J.; Chinnan, M. S.; Resurreccion, A. V.

Based on the empirical evidence that the changes of macroeconomic conditions such as business cycle impact on the values of credit products, we assume that the interest rate, the volatility parameter of the CEV process, and the parameters of default intensity function have switching dynamics governed by a continuous-time finite state Markov chain, whose states are deemed to represent the states of the underlying economy. We construct a recombining trinomial lattice and demonstrate the accuracy of the lattice framework. Within the framework, we derive the values of CDSs, European and Bermudan CDS options.

The purpose of this article is to evaluate macroeconomic stability in a New Keynesian open economy in which agents experience cognitive limitations. The (im)perfect credibility of various monetary policies (e.g., a Taylor-type rule, strict domestic inflation targeting, strict CPI inflation targeting, exchange rate peg) may lead agents to react according to their expectation rules, and then create various degrees of booms and busts in output and inflation. Therefore, relaxation of the rational expectation hypothesis has potential consequences for policy designs. Our simulations confirm that the business cycles induced by animal spirits are enhanced by strict inflation targeting. Furthermore, a Taylor-type (CPI or domestic inflation) rule or a credible exchange rate pegging system can improve social welfare and stability in an open economy.","[Yeh, Kuo-chun] Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan",National Taiwan University,"Yeh, KC (通讯作者)，Natl Taiwan Univ, Grad Inst Natl Dev, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 10617, Taiwan.",kuochunyeh@ntu.edu.tw,"Yeh, Kuo-chun/L-8588-2018","Yeh, Kuo-chun/0000-0002-2430-3802",Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology [MOST 103-2410-H-002-005],Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology,Financial support by Taiwan's Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 103-2410-H-002-005) is acknowledged.,,17,2,3,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

We use a heterogeneous dynamic panel model including a set of more than 380 large-scale natural disasters for about forty emerging market countries in the period 1999-2010. After testing for the sensitivity of the results, our main findings suggest that natural disasters significantly increase the sovereign default premium paid by bond holders. That is, investors perceive natural disasters as an adverse shock that makes the government debt less sustainable and eventually triggers a sovereign default. In particular, it turns out that geophysical and meteorological disasters increase the credit default premium in both the long run as well as in the short run, while hydrological disasters have only a temporary effect.","Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands",Wageningen University & Research,"Klomp, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, POB 8130, NL-6700 EW Wageningen, Netherlands.",jeroen.klomp@wur.nl,"Klomp, Jeroen/B-5422-2013","Klomp, Jeroen/0000-0002-4424-669X",,,,,63,10,11,2,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

The plans are intended to safeguard environmental values and are justified by their relevance in daily forest management. To serve these functions, the plans must be informed by accurate information about the forest and be actively used by local communities. Based on studies in Nepal, this paper seeks to further our understanding of the role of so-called scientific planning in community-level management through time series analyses of remote sensing images, detailed forest inventories and interviews with community forest managers and public forest authorities. Results indicate that technical forest management plans have been elaborated haphazardly and that local communities base their management on other sources of knowledge. Further, community-level managers appear well-informed about forest condition and their practices contribute to sustainable forest development. We suggest the need to further scrutinize the regime of scientific management planning as its practical relevance appears questionable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This article distinguishes social learning from interest and authority-based arguments in theories of institutional change and development. The argument of this article is that learning processes contributed to incremental developments that both Liberal and Social Democrat officials have made in employment policy since the Great Recession. Institutional structure and market-oriented interests are important, but the discovery of new knowledge about employment problems through a recursive policy planning process contributed to the reconfiguration of the networks of policy agents. The experimental accumulation of practical knowledge brought the government to a major reassessment of its employment strategy.","[Amberg, Stephen] Univ Texas San Antonio, Polit Sci & Geog, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA),"Amberg, S (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Polit Sci & Geog, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",stephen.amberg@utsa.edu,"Amberg, Stephen/CAE-9432-2022","Amberg, Stephen/0000-0002-1576-5984",Danish Fulbright Commission,Danish Fulbright Commission,This project was supported by an award from the Danish Fulbright Commission and by a Faculty Development Leave granted by the College of Liberal and Fine Arts of the University of Texas at San Antonio.,,87,2,2,0,25,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1475-1461,1475-147X,,SOCIO-ECON REV,Socio-Econ.

The TFA is the first multilateral agreement since the creation of the WTO in 1995 and includes novel measures to help developing countries build capacity, while also taking into consideration regulatory concerns of WTO members through the application of the general GATT exceptions to the new agreement. While the TFA may appear narrow in scope, with regards to goods it is arguably the broadest WTO Agreement besides the GATT, since all goods that cross national borders find themselves subject to trade facilitation measures. If the TFA is properly interpreted, the combination of capacity-building measures, a focus on technological improvements and the judicious invocation of Article XX could result in a win-win situation wherein routine positive trade is streamlined, reducing time required to cross borders, while negative trade is more easily controlled and regulated at the border. Despite regulatory questions concerning implementation, it is likely that the TFA will reduce the cost of trading across borders, while improving trade for developing countries and allowing WTO members to better control trade flows, through a combination of procedural streamlining and regulatory discretion.","[Eliason, Antonia] Univ Mississippi, Sch Law, University, MS 38677 USA",University of Mississippi,"Eliason, A (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Sch Law, University, MS 38677 USA.",aeliason@olemiss.edu,,,,,,,32,21,21,2,30,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1474-7456,1475-3138,,WORLD TRADE REV,World Trade Rev.,OCT,2015,14,4.0,,,,,643,670,,10.1017/S1474745615000191,0.0,,,28,Economics; International Relations; Law,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations; Government & Law,CW4HO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000364952400004,0

The temperature decline and the full set of environmental effects are known as nuclear winter. This paper surveys the range of actions that can confront the threat of nuclear winter, both now and in the future. Nuclear winter can be confronted by reducing the probability of nuclear war, reducing the environmental severity of nuclear winter, increasing humanity's resilience to nuclear winter, and through indirect interventions that enhance these other interventions. While some people may be able to help more than others, many people perhaps everyone across the world can make a difference. Likewise, the different opportunities available to different people suggests personalized evaluations of nuclear winter, and of catastrophic threats more generally, instead of a one-size-fits-all approach.

The book ably demonstrates the potential for serious thinking aimed at the long-term future. Bostrom succeeds in arguing that the development of superintelligent machines will, if not properly managed, create catastrophic risks to humanity. The book falls short in some respects, and some sections are more compelling and novel than others. Overall, however, Bostrom's book succeeds in demolishing the null hypothesis according to which the possibility and risks of superintelligence can continue to be ignored, and is a must-read for those interested in the long-term future of humanity.

Public perceptions of these threats, both their risks and reactions to them, are important in determining how humanity confronts and addresses the threats. This study investigated the perceived probability of threats to humanity and different responses to them (nihilism, fundamentalism and activism), in four Western nations: the US, UK, Canada and Australia. Overall, a majority (54%) rated the risk of our way of life ending within the next 100 years at 50% or greater, and a quarter (24%) rated the risk of humans being wiped out at 50% or greater. The responses were relatively uniform across countries, age groups, gender and education level, although statistically significant differences exist. Almost 80% agreed we need to transform our worldview and way of life if we are to create a better future for the world (activism). About a half agreed that the world's future looks grim so we have to focus on looking after ourselves and those we love (nihilism), and over a third that we are facing a final conflict between good and evil in the world (fundamentalism). The findings offer insight into the willingness of humanity to respond to the challenges identified by scientists and warrant increased consideration in scientific and political debate.

The extent of this use may be influenced by the promotional efforts of manufacturers. This paper investigates how a manufacturer makes promotional decisions in the presence of a price-volume agreement. We developed an optimization model in which the manufacturer maximizes its expected profit by choosing the level of marketing effort to promote uses for different indications. We considered several ways a volume threshold is determined. We also compared models in which off-label uses are reimbursed and those in which they are forbidden to illustrate the impact of off-label promotion on the optimal decisions and on the decision maker's performance. We found that the payer chooses a threshold which may be the same as the manufacturer's optimal decision. We also found that the manufacturer not only considers the promotional cost in promoting off-label uses but also considers the health benefit of off-label uses. In some situations, using a price-volume agreement to control leakage may be a better idea than simply preventing leakage without using the agreement, from a social welfare perspective.","[Zhang, Hui] Lakehead Univ, Fac Business Adm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Zaric, Gregory S.] Univ Western Ontario, Richard Ivey Sch Business, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Lakehead University; Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Zhang, H (通讯作者)，Lakehead Univ, Fac Business Adm, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada.",hzhang2@lakeheadu.ca; gzaric@ivey.ca,,,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC); Premier's Research Excellence Award,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)(Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)); Premier's Research Excellence Award,This work was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and a Premier's Research Excellence Award.

Product innovation allows for efficiency gains in the production of new services with unskilled labor, and no gains with skilled labor.

Their frequent use raises the question of how the use of the scenario influences the attitudes and actions of the individual stakeholders in the landscape. The study was performed in the area of two rural communities in western Slovenia and focused on two groups of stakeholders, farmers and decision-makers, because these groups have the ability to directly or indirectly impose landscape changes. The farmers were separated into a test and control group and participated in an experiment that included a scenario experience different for the test and control group and ended with a survey interview. Decision-makers participated in a two-round Delphi study, which also involved a scenario exercise. Overall, the results confirmed that landscape scenarios influence attitudes associated with the landscape. The impact on actions was only partially confirmed, as many external factors that might also influence future actions could not be excluded, such as personal characteristics, professional occupation or the characteristics of the farm. The study provides implications for further research, such as the magnitude of scenario impact and the interaction of scenario use with other factors which might affect the formation of and changes in attitudes and actions associated with landscape.

A shortcoming of this technique is that the number of outputs for each hospital generally outstrips the number of hospitals. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, involving the use of explicit weights to combine diverse outputs into a single index, thereby avoiding the need for DEA. Hospital productivity is measured as the ratio of outputs to inputs. Outputs capture quantity and quality of care for hospital patients; inputs include staff, equipment, and capital resources applied to patient care. Ordinary least squares regression is used to analyse why output and productivity varies between hospitals. We assess whether results are sensitive to consideration of quality. Hospital productivity varies substantially across hospitals but is highly correlated year on year. Allowing for quality has little impact on relative productivity. We find that productivity is lower in hospitals with greater financial autonomy, and where a large proportion of income derives from education, research and development, and training activities. Hospitals treating greater proportions of children or elderly patients also tend to be less productive. We have set out a means of assessing hospital productivity that captures their multiple outputs and inputs. We find substantial variation in productivity among English hospitals, suggesting scope for productivity improvement.","[Castelli, Adriana; Street, Andrew] Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Verzulli, Rossella] Univ Bologna, Scuola Super Polit Salute, Bologna, Italy; [Ward, Padraic] Natl Univ Ireland, Irish Ctr Social Gerontol, Galway, Ireland",University of York - UK; University of Bologna; Ollscoil na Gaillimhe-University of Galway,"Street, A (通讯作者)，Univ York, Ctr Hlth Econ, Alcuin A Block, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",andrew.street@york.ac.uk,,"VERZULLI, ROSSELLA/0000-0001-5944-4421; Castelli, Adriana/0000-0002-2546-419X; Street, Andrew David/0000-0002-2540-0364",Policy Research Programme in the English Department of Health,Policy Research Programme in the English Department of Health,"This is an independent study commissioned and funded by the Policy Research Programme in the English Department of Health.

The Panel upheld the United States' claims on the majority of the issues, which covered certain procedural aspects of the anti-dumping and countervailing investigations such as the right to disclosure of 'essential facts', as well as the substantive determinations including costing issues, the imposition of the 'all others' rate on the basis of 'facts available', the price effects' analyses, the sufficiency of the public notices, and others.

Engaging stakeholders in foresight processes can increase the robustness of foresight knowledge, broaden the spectrum of issues addressed, and create 'ownership' of the process. While in foresight practices stakeholder participation becomes more and more popular to resort to as enabling factor for generating salient, legitimate and credible foresight knowledge, participation can also compromise these qualities. We analysed two foresight projects conducted at the PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, one that developed future visions for Dutch nature policy and another that focused on future pathways for Dutch urban sustainable development policy. We illustrate that the dynamics of the research setting - changes in the socio-political context and the internal dynamics of the participatory efforts - complicated the balancing process. We conclude that one of the main challenges for futures practitioners is, therefore, to work within the dynamics of the research setting, and to position themselves strategically in this setting; by acting as 'reflective futures practitioners'.

Paper describes the main benefits of using this tool. Paper also discusses the issues of implementation and its barriers. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the benefits of the implementation of Business Intelligence and on the sample of Slovak companies to analyze its requirements and perception of Business Intelligence and its advantages. The study is based on our research and compares the results with existing studies.","[Carnicky, Stefan] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Bratislava, Slovakia; [Mesaros, Peter; Mondicak, Tomas] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Civil Engn, Kosice, Slovakia; [Habinakova, Martina] Univ Presov, Fac Management, Presov, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava; Technical University Kosice; University of Presov,"Carnicky, S (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Business Econ Seat Kosice, Bratislava, Slovakia.",,"Habiňaková, Martina/AAE-2147-2022; Mésároš, Peter/AAD-5028-2020","Habiňaková, Martina/0000-0002-9885-4658; Mésároš, Peter/0000-0002-8338-5684",,,,,10,0,0,0,3,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,51,58,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200007,0

The network is represented by an undirected graph. Each edge of the graph is characterized by its length (in km or in min.) and by the design cost necessary to recondition the track. Moreover, each edge and each vertex have a list of tourist points of interests (PoI) like waterfalls, memorials etc., occurring at it. Each PoI is evaluated by its attractiveness score (AtS). The problem is to find the feasible and the most attractive route connecting two given points. The paper shows how to define the AtS for an individual PoI and how to derive the total AtS for a given tourist route, connecting two vertices of the graph. The main purpose of the paper is to present a mathematical model enabling to find a tourist route, connecting two given vertices, not exceeding the limits of cost and length and maximizing its AtS. The model is extended in two senses. First, comparing to the classic minimization of costs, it incorporates the new objective attractiveness of the route. Second, it extends the class of admissible objective functions. So far, only additive functions, with respect to the edges and vertices, were considered, whereas the non-additive ones are admitted in the model as well.","[Cerna, Anna; Cerny, Jan; Pribyl, Vladimir] Univ Econ, Prague Fac Management, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic",,"Cerná, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Prague Fac Management, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic.",cerna@fm.vse.cz; cerny@fm.vse.cz; pribyl@fm.vse.cz,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,0,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,92,98,,,,,,7,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900016,0

The expenditure is further broken down by the methodology used by the European Commission which provides a more detailed picture of the thematic distribution of interventions in the Slovak regions. We show relationship between Cohesion policy interventions and regional GDP. Especially in the first years of implementation the majority of expenditure was spend in least developed regions. However, in 2013 and 2014 the EU spending was focused mainly on large infrastructure projects, which distorted the character of conducted regional policy, while the majority of EU funds were spent in regions which are not among the least developed.

Sectoral analysis and comparison of selected advanced economies has helped us to identify possible incorrect assumptions as reasons for different consequences of policy actions accomplished by responsible authorities.","[Hosoff, Boris] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia",Slovak Academy of Sciences,"Hosoff, B (通讯作者)，Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Econ Res, Sancova 56, Bratislava 81105, Slovakia.",boris.hosoff@savba.sk,,,project VEGA [2/0104/12],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper was supported by the project VEGA No.: 2/0104/12: Makroekonomicke aspekty dlhovej krizy - pripravenost krajin celit novym vyzvam.,,3,0,0,0,1,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,245,253,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500029,0

The orientation of this paradigm transformation in science has been under debate for four decades, generating important theoretical concepts, but they have had limited impact until now. This is due to a contradictory normative science policy framing that science has difficulties dealing with, not least of all because the dominant framing creates a lock-in. We postulate that in addition to introducing transdisciplinarity, science needs to strive for integration of the normative aspect of sustainable development at the meta-level. This requires a strategically managed niche within which scholars and practitioners from many different disciplines can engage in a long-term common learning process, in order to become a thought collective (Fleck) capable of initiating the paradigm transformation. Arguing with Piaget that decentration is essential to achieve normative orientation and coherence in a learning collective, we introduce a learning approach Cohn's Theme-Centred Interaction which provides a methodology for explicitly working with the objectivity and subjectivity of statements and positions in a real-world context, and for consciously integrating concerns of individuals in their interdependence with the world. This should enable a thought collective to address the epistemological and ethical barriers to science for sustainable development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditional economic evaluations often focus on quantifying cost-effectiveness, however, it is increasingly recognized that vaccinations may generate broader benefits not captured in cost-effectiveness analysis..he aim of this study was to evaluate the broader economic consequences associated with HPV vaccination in males and females and to conduct a lifetime cost-benefit analysis of investing in universal vaccination in Germany from the perspective of government. Methodologies from generational accounting, human capital and health economics were combined to estimate the broader economic consequences of HPV vaccination including the fiscal impact for the government. A cohort model was developed simulating the medical costs and average lifetime fiscal transfers between the government and 12-year-old immunized and non-immunized males and females. To estimate tax revenue attributed to vaccination-related changes in morbidity and mortality, direct and indirect tax rates were linked to differences in age-and gender-specific earnings. Based on HPV vaccination costs, the base case cost-benefit analysis demonstrated that investing (sic)1 in universal HPV vaccination could yield (sic)1.7 in gross tax revenue over the lifetime of the cohorts. After taking into consideration the governmental transfers, universal HPV vaccination in Germany could result in incremental positive net discounted taxes (i.e. tax revenue-transfers) from (sic)62 million for the German government.

In principle, it means the belief or philosophy of return to the nature and can be defined as a balanced agro-ecosystem which based on local and renewable resources. This system is using technology of plant cultivation and animal husbandry which minimize damage to the environment. It is also ensuring the production of quality and wholesome food and ultimately takes account of future generations. Austria is considered as a cradle of ogranic farming. The polymath, founder and anthroposophic Rudolf Steiner has created the spiritual and philosophical land management later called bio-dynamic farming in 1924. In the forties (last century) this movement spead to France, Netherlands and USA. The system has expanded wordwide after extension of the idea of enviromental protection in seventies. Later many countries began to apply organic principles in their legislative and IFOAM (International Federation of organic Agriculture Movements) was created in 1972. In Slovakia organic farming has aprox. 15 to 20 years younger history compared with the organic leader states (as Gemany, Netherlands, Austria or Denmark). This lag was coused by the political arrangement of the country and the subsequent regime change in 1989. Development of organic farming was initiated in 1991 by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food of the Slovak Republic following the trends abroad. Than the legislative basis The Organic Farming Application Form for Slovak Republic was enacted. This based on the principles, policies and requirements formulated by the IFOAM. Later the first organic farmers organized themselves into society NATURAL ALIMENTARIA, which was accepted as a member of IFOAM in 1992. Whereas in that time the three-year conversion process was respected, the first harvest of organic production was certified in 1994. Unfortunatelly, the domestic processors have not shown a sufficient interest in organic products, which launched the orientation of Slovak organic producers to export. This article provides an overview of the implementation of organic farming in Slovakia from its beggining in 1991 to present. An important part is devoted to the legislative rules and formal arrangement of governing bodies. The domestic law and standards are showed in following to the European Union legislation. In addition, attention is paid also to the national and EU development documents (Common Agriculture Policy, Plan of Rural Development in SR, The Action Plan of Organic Farming in Slovakia). In consequence of this we also shows the certification system of organic products in Slovakia and the need of Slovak producers to cooperation with foreign certification organisations. Attention is also paid to the system of product marking, organic logo using and control. This article also captures the development of basic organic indicators in Slovakia with special attention on revelsals and goverment interventions. Research included the data of whole Slovak republic available from the official goverment publications (The Green Repors, the data of CCTIA and Naturalis SK, l.t.d.). The reporting period was chosen from 1991 to 2011, considering the data availability. As the first indicator we examine the organic agricultural land (including land in conversion), respectively the increasing of land use in organic farming from 14 718 ha in 1991 to 180 261 ha in 2011. Than we watch the share of organic agricultural land in % and achieving the border ratio fixed by European Commission. After we are paying attention to the number of organic producers in Slovakia which increase from 37 producers in 1991 to 458 in 2009. Very interesting is the average farm size calculation which shows the extreme large farms in Slovakia (in 2001 it was more than 724 hectares per farm) and also the land use structure which shows more than 67 % proportion of pernament grasslands in 2011 (as a consequence of state subsidy policy).","[Kozakova, Jana] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kozáková, J (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",jana.kozakova@uniag.sk,"Kozáková, Jana/AAC-7916-2020","Kozáková, Jana/0000-0001-7913-9053",,,,,13,2,2,1,9,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,498,508,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800049,0

If this is the case, the usual decomposition cannot be used and other ways of modeling are sought, such as ARIMA or other stochastic models. There is, however, a connection between the two. In this paper we show that for most of the exponential smoothing models an ARIMA counterpart exists (and vice versa). The theoretical duality of these models is shown, including some inference. Both models are applied to simulated data in several software packages (SAS, eViews, and Statgraphics) and the results are compared.

We do not beg to differ. In this article, inspired by the behaviour of the European Union (EU), we ask whether the proliferation of PTAs and the negotiation of mega-regionals, like the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) between the EU and the United States (US), risk undermining the WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM), 'the crown jewel of the WTO system'. The EU is the world's biggest participant in PTAs. It is also, after the US, the most active participant to WTO disputes. Yet, in the twenty years since the creation of the WTO, it has only been involved in a tiny number of disputes with PTA partners. We find that, despite appearances to the contrary, the US has also been involved in very few WTO disputes with its PTA partners. Moreover, without assigning causal relationship to the signature of a PTA and the amount of litigation between preferential partners, we show that there is inverse correlation between the two. We find it likely therefore that the number of WTO disputes is likely to continue decreasing as WTO Members, including the EU and the US, continue signing PTAs.

But real-world decision making almost always involves some degree of uncertainty. In this paper uncertainty is modeled by interval numbers, and pairwise comparisons of all objects from the same hierarchy level form interval pairwise comparison matrices (IPCMs). The aim of the paper is to examine consistency of IPCMs in the AHP framework, and to propose several measures of IPCMs' degree of inconsistency, namely average random inconsistency, mid-point inconsistency and maximal inconsistency. Also, a measure of information uncertainty (entropy) of IPCMs is introduced as well. These measures provide useful information on quality of decision makers' judgments, and can be used, for instance, to estimate decision makers' (a posteriori) weights in a group decision making framework. The proposed approach is demonstrated with examples.","[Mazurek, Jiri] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math & Informat, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Opava 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Mazurek, J (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Math & Informat, Univ Namesti 1934-3, Opava 73340, Czech Republic.",mazurek@opf.slu.cz,"Mazurek, Jiri/Z-1303-2019",,,,,,9,0,0,0,1,UNIV WEST BOHEMIA,PLZEN,"PILSEN UNIVERZITNI 8, PLZEN 306 14, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-261-0539-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,519,524,,,,,,6,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics,BG3DR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387898900089,0

The importance of valuation of real options stem from the fact it provides more flexible tool for assessment of opportunities within investment projects. Hence, real options represent interesting managerial instrument for investment project evaluation along with traditional procedures based upon cash flows scenes as discounted cash flow methods. The paper discusses in detail a way of space domain discretization made by cubic finite elements, which possess node interpolation conditions of Hermitean type. The general form of such approximation depending upon selected node unknowns is described in detail.

If a potential customer can relate to previous experience with the identity of a brand, he surely developed a brand image and is more likely to prefer that specific brand. In this research paper the components of a brand identity are going to be studied in order to have a hierarchy of the importance of the elements and an impact dimension. All this will also result in arguments for the relevance of a brand identity strategy. Even though a vast amount of academic research regarding brand identity is available, there is not enough research regarding the correlation between brand identity strategy and brand image and no simple basic brand identity framework can be found. Associating your product with a strong brand identity is a key factor in competitive advantage and leads to great financial rewards. The smaller is the difference between the perceived brand image and the entity's aimed brand identity; the more efficient was the brand identity strategy.

This paper estimates the costs of dialysis for ESRD patients at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) in Tanzania in the year 2014. Methods: Cost calculations are based on the provider perspective and include only the direct cost of dialysis treatment. Cost of drugs and consumables were obtained from the price list issued by the Medical Stores Department (MSD) in Tanzania. Additional data were collected through face-to-face interview with experts at the dialysis unit. Results: MNH performs on average 442 hemodialysis per month (34 patients, with three sessions per week) with a personnel placement of 20 nurses, four nephrologists, eight registrars, one nutritionist, two biomedical engineers, four health attendants and nine dialysis machines. The respective average unit cost per hemodialysis is 176 US$. Consequently, an average patient requiring three dialyses per week (i.e. 156 dialyses per year) will cause annual costs of 27,440 US$. Conclusion: The cost of dialysis is enormous for a least developed country like Tanzania where resources and technology are rather limited. Thus, from the economic point of view, it seems rational to allocate health care budgets towards diseases that are curable, have a higher cost-effectiveness and cater for the majority of the population. However, before a final decision on allocation of budgets towards dialysis is made all effort must be invested to improve technical efficiency by cutting the enormous unit cost.","[Mushi, Lawrencia; Krohn, Markus; Flessa, Steffen] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Dept Hlth Care Management, Friedrich Loeffler Str 70, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany",Universitat Greifswald,"Flessa, S (通讯作者)，Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Fac Law & Econ, Dept Hlth Care Management, Friedrich Loeffler Str 70, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",steffen.flessa@uni-greifswald.de,"Flessa, Steffen/AEO-9609-2022",,Germany academic exchange service (DAAD); Mzumbe University Tanzania,Germany academic exchange service (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Mzumbe University Tanzania,We thank the Germany academic exchange service (DAAD) and Mzumbe University Tanzania for financial support.

First, a panel indeed has no margin of discretion to decline to exercise validly established jurisdiction. However, jurisdiction is not automatically validly established. Second, legal impediments precluding validly established jurisdiction exist. These are, it is argued, Articles 3.7 and 3.10 DSU. The article subsequently develops 'procedural' good filth in Article 3.10 DSU as a legal impediment and explains that the test for a violation of this provision demands a 'clear statement'. While the conditions for the fruitful invocation of a violation of 'procedural' good faith as in Article 3.10 DSU have never been met in WTO disputes, we nonetheless consider that case law has cleared the path for a dispute in which this would be possible.","[Natens, Bregt] Sidley Austin LLP, Brussels, Belgium; [Descheemaeker, Sidonie] World Trade Org, Geneva, Switzerland",World Trade Organization,"Natens, B (通讯作者)，Sidley Austin LLP, Brussels, Belgium.",bnatens@sidley.com; sidoniedescheemaeker@hotmail.com,,,,,,,17,4,4,0,8,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

The most commonly used tool for risk measure is Value at Risk, being considered a crucial milestone, because it shows the maximum loss in the value of a portfolio asset. The first comprehensive market risk management methodology was developed by JP Morgan in 1994, and was called RiskMetrics, which become extremely popular due to its easy implementation. This paper analyzes the capacity of RiskMetrics in forecasting the high volatility during the financial crisis for the financial Romanian market and to see if there is some differences regarding the value of decay factor estimated based on squared error loss, the RiskMetrics approach, and the values obtain from implementing the check error loss function in estimating the decay factors. We found that in the case of BET and BET- FI, the RiskMetrics estimations underestimate the decay factor, by attaching a lower weight to the most recent variance. Moreover, we proved that RiskMetrics model was good enough to forecast the volatility on Romanian financial market during the financial crisis period, only if we estimate the decay factor based on check error loss function.

Essential for effective functioning of grocery value chains is the final link in the chain, i.e. retail stores, which, because of their direct relation to the final consumers, significantly increase the value of the efforts of previous links in the chain. Collaboration among partners is increasingly focused not only on material and related information flows, but also on financial flows. For this reason, important are terms of payment applied on purchases of products and goods in the chains, i.e. also on purchases for retail stores. Payment terms are an important factor that affects not only the prosperity of each individual article, but indirectly also the satisfaction and loyalty of end customers. Examining the terms of payment applied on purchases of products was the subject of a quantitative research that was carried out in retail grocery stores in the Czech Republic. The main objective of the research was to determine what methods and terms of payment are applied on purchases and what factors affect the terms of payment. Methods of descriptive and inferential statistics were used to analyse data obtained through personal inquiries in various retail stores. The analysis of the results of the research has showed that the most frequently used methods of payment are cash payments and bank transfers. As for payment dates, primarily business loans with a maturity of 30 days are used, quite frequent are also requirements for payment on delivery. Although the date and method of payment for delivered goods are, according to retailers, affected by many factors, most important are experience from the past and the length of mutual cooperation. Interesting findings were brought by an analysis of the difference in the method and timing of payment depending on the size of retail stores and depending on whether they were separate stores or stores that are part of retail chains. The research has demonstrated a high level of requirements for payment in cash as well as the use of credit loans with a relatively short maturity, which is detrimental to operation of retail stores. It currently adversely affects the effective functioning of the entire grocery chain and should be subject to further improvement.","[Pecinova, Zuzana; Patak, Michal; Branska, Lenka] Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Pecinova, Z (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",,"Branská, Lenka/AAX-4437-2021; Patak, Michal/G-9285-2016","Patak, Michal/0000-0002-5025-8849",,,,,10,1,1,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-47-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,915,922,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE6YB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911200117,0

As a result, new ways to encourage activity of citizens are looked for while taking into account the rapidly changing environment. One of such possibilities is rapid development of information and communication methods which allow citizens' participation via internet and proper information gain in networks.

The authors analysed tendencies of internet penetration and activity of citizens` participation in election. Furthermore, causal relations between political participation in elections which happened from 2007 to 2014 and factors of internet penetration (households with internet access and individuals, who used internet daily or at least once per week) were analyzed in this article. According to this study the authors found a relation between activity of voters in the before mentioned elections and factors of internet penetration. There were not identified statistically significant differences between counties where the most part of the population are from rural areas and those, where prevailed urban population. The regular usage of internet has impact on voters` activity in the rarest settled counties.

J,"van der Marel, E",,,,"van der Marel, Erik",,,Positioning on the Global Value Chain Map: Where Do You Want to Be?,JOURNAL OF WORLD TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This article aims to understand which policy disciplines are associated with the positioning of countries in the Global Value Chain (GVC). In today's world production and trade takes place among multiple stages of a supply chain stretching many country participants around the world. This induces countries to specialize in a so-called 'slice' of the GVC which can be at the beginning (upstream), middle or end (downstream) of the chain. Yet, it is unclear how countries and industries specialize along these slices, and what type of policies are determining where countries and industries are placed on the GVC map. Hence, this paper first makes an attempt to examine where countries along the various GVC dimensions are positioned regarding production and trade based on recently developed measures. In a second step, it investigates what type of policies are significantly linked to the GVC position of these countries by including a battery of various policy disciplines in the analysis. This paper finds that depending on where countries specialize, many domestic economic policy barriers are correlated with a country's position on the GVC map. It therefore states that trade nowadays is interconnected with many other policy fields beyond traditional trade disciplines. Finally, the findings of this paper are applied to specific industries by developing three case studies.","[van der Marel, Erik] ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium",,"van der Marel, E (通讯作者)，ECIPE, Brussels, Belgium.",erik.vandermarel@ecipe.org,,,,,,,22,17,18,1,23,KLUWER LAW INT,ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN,"ZUIDPOOLSINGEL 2, PO BOX 316, 2400 AH ALPHEN AAN DEN RIJN, NETHERLANDS",1011-6702,2210-2795,,J WORLD TRADE,J.

We analyzed economic absolute and relative decline, length and speed of recovery at county level, covering the period 2008 to 2014. The results indicated a variety of situations: no decline, no recovery, complete or partial recovery, at different speeds. Since we identified the presence of spatial dependence in bur variables, a spatial autoregressive model has been developed in order to assess the influence of the development level upon the speed at which the counties recover after crisis. The main finding is that the pre-crisis GDP level is positive and highly significant in all model specifications, suggesting that developed counties tend to recover more quickly after economic shocks.","[Zaman, Gheorghe] Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania; [Goschin, Zizi] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Zaman, G (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",zizi.goschin@csie.ase.ro,"GOSCHIN, ZIZI/Y-1227-2019","GOSCHIN, ZIZI/0000-0002-9030-7772",,,,,26,9,9,1,5,EDITURA ASE,BUCURESTI,"PIATA ROMANA, NR 6, SECTOR 1, BUCURESTI, 701731, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Using a large, detailed panel of new obstetricians, we find that, even though physicians' maternal complication rates improve steadily with experience, initial skill (as measured by performance in a physician's first year of practice) explains more of the variation in physician performance over time than experience does. At the same time, we find that the trajectories of new physicians' delivery volume develop in a way consistent with Bayesian learning about physician quality. As physicians gain experience, their volume becomes increasingly sensitive to the information in their accumulated prior belief, while responses to information on recent performance are detectable in only selected settings (e.g., vaginal delivery, commercially insured patients).","[Epstein, Andrew J.; Asch, David A.] Philadelphia VAMC, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Epstein, Andrew J.; Asch, David A.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Nicholson, Sean] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of Pennsylvania; Cornell University,"Epstein, AJ (通讯作者)，Philadelphia VAMC, Ctr Hlth Equ Res & Promot, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.;Epstein, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",eandrew@mail.med.upenn.edu,,"Epstein, Andrew/0000-0001-5078-6564",,,,,36,8,10,0,14,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

Opportunity costs of staying in school decrease for a larger fraction of teens in areas where teen motherhood rates are higher prior to Title IX. I use this variation to test whether teens in areas with higher pre-Title IX teen motherhood rates exhibit larger educational gains than teens in other areas. Next I examine whether these gains are higher for teen mothers versus individuals who are not teen mothers. My results suggest that Title IX improved teen mothers' education outcomes and that these effects are most pronounced for black teen mothers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a nationally representative longitudinal data from China, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), to estimate the relationship between income and weight gain. We conduct both cross sectional and panel data analysis to study the causal effects of family income on weight development. Unlike other literature that found inverse relationship between prevalence of obesity and family income in developing countries, in this paper, we find that BMI will first increase with family income at a decreasing rate, and then decrease which suggests that the group of middle class may suffer the high risk of being overweight and obese.","[Asiseh, Fafanyo; Yao, Jianfeng] North Carolina Agr & Technol State Univ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University,"Yao, JF (通讯作者)，North Carolina Agr & Technol State Univ, Coll Business & Econ, 1601 E Market St, Greensboro, NC 27411 USA.",jyao@ncat.edu,"yao, johan/AAF-1230-2019",,,,,,28,6,6,0,9,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

It concerns a tension between two communities: to understand the basis of this dissonance, and to open lines of communication that seek to dispel it. More specifically, it relies on two frameworks (Walrasian general equilibrium theory, as in Arrow-Debreu-McKenzie-Uzawa-Gale-Nikaido-Kuhn and others, and the Ramseyian theory of optimal growth, as in Samuelson-Solow-Cass-Koopmans-Uzawa-Srinivasan and others), formalized and continually refined in the last half of the 20th century to deal with interaction and with time, both essential considerations in any kind of economics of forestry. It also gives prominence to the Muir-Pinchot controversy at the very beginning of the 20th century, and thereby underscores its relevance to current ongoing tensions and anxieties regarding issues of sustainability and global-warming. From a purely analytical point of view, it alludes in passing to the potential relevance to forestry economics of mean field theories in physics, and of subgame-perfect equilibria in the theory of non-cooperative games.

Policy implications grounded in this analysis are discussed.","[Wen, Yuyuan] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Thill, Jean-Claude] Univ N Carolina, Dept Geog & Earth Sci, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Renmin University of China; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Wen, YY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",wenyuyuan@ruc.edu.cn; jean-claude.thill@uncc.edu,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71573267]; Beijing Municipal Commission of Education,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Municipal Commission of Education(Beijing Municipal Commission of Education),"This work is part of a project funded under National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC): FDI location movement and urban agglomeration development response under new type urbanization context (No. 71573267), and also supported by a Specialized Fund from Beijing Municipal Commission of Education for the Transformation Project of Major Achievements by State Universities and Colleges Located in Beijing.",,30,5,8,1,33,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1752-1378,1752-1386,,CAMB J REG ECON SOC,Camb.

In Norway, family forest owners own 80% of productive forestland and play a central role in the management of the country's forests. Yet little is known about whether these landowners would be interested in increasing carbon sequestration on their land and selling carbon credits. Only a handful of studies have examined the factors that motivate family forest owners to participate in carbon offset programs, and all of these studies have been conducted in the United States. This study addresses this information gap using data from a mail survey of 1500 Norwegian family forest owners. A logistic regression model was developed to examine the effect of various carbon program, forestland, and landowner characteristics on participation in a hypothetical carbon offset program. Results suggest that there is a considerable amount of interest among Norwegian family forest owners and that the most important predictors of participation are payment amount offered, perceived barriers posed by management actions, importance placed on non-market forest amenities, and attitudes towards climate change.

The market of pellet production in Portugal has grown significantly since 2007, as in the rest of Europe. Pellet production can be obtained from industrial wood residues (sawdust, chips, shavings) or roundwood. The main raw material for pellet production in Portugal is roundwood obtained from Pinus pinaster forests, but the activity is developed without an ecological frame, and presently represents a serious problem of sustainability to the Portuguese forest sector and to the internal economy. It is relevant to mention that in Portugal not much private forest is certified via frameworks as FSC or PEFC. In this paper we propose a new indicator to assess the production capacity of pellets per forest area, I-PelletsForest and to support forest management practices and policies. ipeitetsForest is a tool to help decision makers to understand the dimension of the market production in relation to the forest area available, by economic region. Instead of capacity, the Portuguese real pellet productivity capacity in the period-2009-2012 in Portugal was 1068 Mt, which surpassed the total production of Central and South America, Africa and Oceania, and matched that of the entire Asian region, representing the most important pellet production region in the world. In conclusion, Portuguese real pellet productivity capacity per forest area is 344.7 t/ha (total forest ecosystem area) and 1526.3 (only P. pinaster forest ecosystem area). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to measure teaching quality, we employ a version of the value-added methodology which uses future performance of students to make inferences about the current teaching quality of their professors. We report a mild but positive and significant relation between publications on top journals and teaching quality. To all practical effects, this finding does not seem to be contaminated by the potential negotiating power of professors with high levels of top publications strategically choosing the best-performing groups. Additionally, we report evidence that the random assignment of students into class groups is reasonably satisfied. Finally, we argue that teaching effectiveness measures based on anonymous student evaluations are suspicious and debatable. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main result indicates that competition reduces toxic releases at the facility level. On average, each percentage-point reduction in the Herfindahl Index (HHI) results in a nearly two-percent reduction in a facility's toxic releases. At the same time, we find no evidence that competition increases aggregate pollution. Further analysis sheds some light on the mechanisms through which firms reduce pollution releases due to increased competition. In particular, we find suggestive evidence that this relationship is due to both reduced output and increases in abatement. We find no evidence that our result is driven by: consumer aversion to pollution, regulations changing with competition, or technologies introduced by new firms. Taken together, our results indicate that competition may be good, at least for public health in areas near polluting facilities, and fail to provide support for the hypothesis that competition leads to more socially undesirable behavior.

This paper uses IFs to provide Base Case forecasts of global transformations that appear to be unfolding in human development (special attention to education and aging), social development (distribution and power), and the relationship of humans with their environment (advancing mastery and sustainability challenges). It illustrates scenario analysis with alternative forecasts of global poverty, carbon emissions, global patterns of national governance, the human development index, and food and agricultural development.

A Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analysis is conducted to decompose the rural-urban differences in child nutrition outcomes into two components; one that is explained by regional differences in the level of the determinants (covariate effects), and another component that is explained by differences in the effect of the determinants on the child nutritional status (coefficient effects). Results show that the under-five stunting rates are 20 % in Egypt, 46.5 % in Yemen, and 7.7 % in Jordan. The rural-urban gap in child malnutrition was minor in the case of Egypt (2.3 %) and Jordan (1.5 %), while the regional gap was significant in the case of Yemen (17.7 %). Results of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition show that the covariate effect is dominant in the case of Yemen while the coefficients effect dominates in the case of Jordan. Income inequality between urban and rural households explains most of the malnutrition gap. Results were robust to the different decomposition weighting schemes. By identifying the underlying factors behind the rural-urban health disparities, the findings of this paper help in designing effective intervention measures aimed at reducing regional inequalities and improving population health outcomes.","[Sharaf, Mesbah Fathy] Univ Alberta, Fac Arts, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Rashad, Ahmed Shoukry] Frankfurt Sch Finance & Management, Frankfurt, Germany",University of Alberta; Frankfurt School Finance & Management,"Sharaf, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Alberta, Fac Arts, Dept Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada.",sharaf@ualberta.ca,"Sharaf, Mesbah Fathy/AGV-8732-2022","Shoukry Rashad, Ahmed/0000-0002-6317-4337; Sharaf, Mesbah/0000-0001-5391-0620",Economic Research Forum (ERF),Economic Research Forum (ERF),"We would like to thank the academic editor of this journal, and two anonymous reviewers, for the invaluable comments and suggestions that substantially improved the manuscript.

Research in economics and psychology now shows this convincingly. But research into the exact determinants of noncognitive skills has been slowed by a common data limitation: most large-scale datasets do not contain adequate measures of noncognitive skills. This is particularly problematic in education policy evaluation. We demonstrate that within any survey dataset, there is important latent information that can be used as a proxy measure of noncognitive skills. Specifically, we examine the amount of conscientious effort that students exhibit on surveys, as measured by their item response rates. We use six nationally-representative, longitudinal surveys of American youth. We find that the percentage of questions skipped during the baseline year when respondents were adolescents is a significant predictor of later-life educational attainment, net of cognitive ability. Insofar as item response rates affect employment and income, they do so through their effect on educational attainment. The pattern of findings gives compelling reasons to view item response rates as a promising behavioral measure of noncognitive skills for use in future research. We posit that response rates are a measure of conscientiousness, though additional research is required to determine what exact noncognitive skills are being captured by item response rates.

The purpose of this paper is to assess how the concept of dominance can help to improve scenario building and futures thinking as dominance transforms leadership within action processes. First, we examine power at work at different levels using concepts that relate to dominance and leadership shifts. Secondly, we discuss methodological proposals to implement the concepts of weak and strong dominance in action-based scenarios design and the implications of theses concepts for refining the approach of leadership in futures thinking. We conclude that paying attention to dominance transformations in scenarios is a promising direction to develop stakeholder and leadership analysis in scenario thinking. We suggest further research on the connection between history and futures thinking. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The typical enterprises and start-ups which emerge in this sector tend to be small-scale and family owned. We claim that there is a large unused potential for NWFP to support rural development and increase incomes of land owners and rural enterprises. In this article, we study what makes selected and so far successful product innovations in NWFPs special and subsequently what were the factors that supported their development and marketing? These questions we study at hand of four empirical innovative case studies in four European rural areas. We come to the conclusion that the entrepreneurs show some common features in the ways they started their business. However, they have applied individual strategies for the realisation of their own ideas. In line with recommendations from recent literature on creating innovations, all of them have used some external support, but at very different levels: They range from monetary support and consultation of effective support organisations to personal non-monetary exchange-relationships in social networks within a communal area. Our results contribute to an understanding of entrepreneurial behaviour as a very individual and.context-specific undertaking on the one hand and as a universal activity with common features and attributes on the other.

A key criticism of school voucher systems is that they make it easier for private schools to attract better teachers to the detriment of public schools. This paper uses longitudinal data from Chile to estimate a discrete choice dynamic programming (DCDP) model of teacher and nonteacher labor supply decisions and to explore how wage policies affect the composition of the teacher labor force in public and private schools. In the model, individuals first decide whether to get a teaching degree and then choose annually from among five work/home sector alternatives. Empirical results show that private voucher schools attract better teachers than public schools. However, the existence of the private voucher sector also draws higher-productivity individuals into the teaching profession.","[Behrman, Jere R.; Todd, Petra E.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; [Tincani, Michela M.] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Wolpin, Kenneth I.] Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",University of Pennsylvania; University of London; University College London; Rice University,"Todd, PE (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",petra@athena.sas.upenn.edu,"Behrman, Jere R/A-9734-2009",,Spencer Foundation,Spencer Foundation,"Jere R.

A cross-sectional study was carried out on adults and children with CF in eight European countries. Patients completed an anonymous questionnaire regarding their socio-demographic characteristics, use of healthcare services and presence of a caregiver. Costs were calculated with a bottom-up approach using unit costs from each participating country, and HRQOL was assessed using EQ-5D. The principal caregiver also answered a questionnaire on their characteristics, HRQOL and burden. A total of 905 patients with CF was included (399 adults and 506 children). The total average annual cost per patient varied from a,not sign21,144 in Bulgaria to a,not sign53,256 in Germany. Adults had higher direct healthcare costs than children, but children had much higher informal care costs (P < 0.0001). Total costs increased with patients' level of dependence. In adults, mean utility fell between 0.640 and 0.870, and the visual analogue scale ranged from 46.0 to 69.7. There was no difference in caregiver HRQOL regardless of whether they cared for an adult or a child. However, caregivers who looked after a child had a significantly higher burden (P = 0.0013).

Toronto, Canada, provides a world-renowned case of populist experimentation at the metropolitan scale, as the actions of Mayor Rob Ford typified this nexus of austerity and populism. Set in the context of Ford's term as Mayor of Toronto (2010-2014), this article asks how the combined rise of austerity and right populism creates both new challenges and new opportunities for public sector labour in urban spaces. We argue that public sector unions are central in both the making and unmaking of populist austerity and identify potential trajectories for organised labour in the face of the continuation of austerity-driven politics.","[Thomas, Mark] York Univ, Sociol, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Thomas, Mark] York Univ, Global Labour Res Ctr, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; [Tufts, Steven] York Univ, Dept Geog, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada",York University - Canada; York University - Canada; York University - Canada,"Thomas, M (通讯作者)，York Univ, Dept Sociol, 4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",mpthomas@yorku.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada [430-2012-0412],Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),This work was supported by a grant ( No. 430-2012-0412) from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada.,,56,7,8,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

RTI Foresight practitioners need to complement their well developed set of technology oriented methods with equally sophisticated approaches tackling societal aspects of innovation. In this paper we aim to make a contribution to this requirement. Building on user innovation theory we argue that demand oriented RTI Foresight needs to systematically integrate voices and hypotheses from the fringes of the innovation system. In order to develop a sound approach for this we set out from well established Foresight theory on weak signals and cognitive biases. Adopting a constructivist stance towards such signals leads us to the need to set up a socially robust, diverse discourse on seeds of change hypotheses. We then outline a practical implementation of such a discourse in the context of the recent Foresight process of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany. We describe and discuss the experience of this Foresight process and suggest avenues for further development of the approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate such spillover effects, a group of rapidly growing emerging economies collectively known as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) is selected. The findings of the paper are as follows. First, a substantial increase in the average conditional correlation is noticed within all BRICS stock markets during the GFC. When considering the ESDC period, we also observed an increase in all markets, except for Brazil. Furthermore, the dynamic evaluation significantly increased from 2007 and it remained high during the ESDC. Second, trade profiles can help in explaining the spillover and correlation levels between emerging and developed markets. Among the BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia and South Africa heavily depend on commodity exports and the results show that these economies have a higher correlation with the developed economies. Further, Brazil and Russia are the most volatile when compared to the other BRICS countries, since these countries' commodities are dominated by food and agricultural exports and fuel and agricultural exports, respectively.","[Bein, Murad A.] Cyprus Int Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Accounting & Finance, Lefkosa, North Cyprus, Turkey; [Tuna, Gulcay] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Famagusta, Turkey",Cyprus International University; Eastern Mediterranean University,"Bein, MA (通讯作者)，Cyprus Int Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Dept Accounting & Finance, Lefkosa, North Cyprus, Turkey.",mbein@ciu.edu.tr; gulcay.tuna@emu.edu.tr,"Bein, Murad Abdurahman/KBB-6401-2024","Bein, Murad Abdurahman/0000-0002-3248-4316",,,,,20,3,3,0,11,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

Although Basel III allows for hedging the CVA risk charge, mismatches between the regulatory (Basel III) and accounting (IFRS) rules lead to the fact that hedging the CVA risk charge is challenging. The reason is that the hedge instruments reducing the CVA risk charge cause additional Profit and Loss (P&L) volatility.

(2) How do economic systems that are more bank oriented perform compared to market-oriented systems? (3) What are the consequences on relationship banking of the recent structural bank regulation reforms adopted to separate specific investment and commercial banking activities? Building on some recent evidence, the main conclusions are as follows: (1) Relationship banks protect their clients in normal downturns; (2) when recessions coincide with a financial crisis, countries that rely relatively more on bank financing tend to be more severely hit; (3) the effects of structural bank regulation initiatives on relationship banking are uncertain.","[Gambacorta, Leonardo] Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland",Bank for International Settlements (BIS),"Gambacorta, L (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Monetary & Econ Dept, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",leonardo.gambacorta@bis.org,"Gambacorta, Leonardo/KDM-8428-2024",,,,,,16,8,8,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1540-496X,1558-0938,,EMERG MARK FINANC TR,Emerg.

Bauder's film focuses on a series on interviews with a former leading investment banker, Rainer Voss, high up in one of Frankfurt's deserted bank skyscrapers. Voss's statements, set against the skyline of Frankfurt's 'Mainhattan' financial sector, allow Bauder to constitute an aesthetic that, I argue, successfully addresses a key problem in moving image studies, namely how to find an appropriate film form to register the workings of contemporary finance. Bauder's film offers an unusual depiction of the self-constitution and self-understanding of a banker-turned-whistleblower, focusing on Voss's speech acts of explication and justification. Drawing on Judith Butler's analysis of performative agency and of the separation of economics and politics through iterative perlocutionary acts, I argue that Bauder's investigation into the performativity that establishes the autonomy of the financial sector and grants it extensive social power offers a significant aesthetic engagement with financial performativity and contributes to debates about documentary and performativity and about routes to a reconnection of economics and politics.","[King, Alasdair] Queen Mary Univ London, SLLF, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London,"King, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, SLLF, London, England.",a.king@qmul.ac.uk,,,Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD) [50068612],Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"This work was supported by the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), Re-invitation Programme for Former Scholarship Holders 2015 [grant number 50068612].",,26,1,1,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

Hedging is important because it allows for mitigation of the risk of adverse price changes in the spot market. We examine the hedging efficiency of three types of hedging strategies; unhedged, fully hedged and hedging using optimal hedging ratios. To find the optimal hedge ratio we use an estimated constant hedge ratio, optimal hedge ratios estimated with rolling 20-week and 52-week windows, and bivariate GARCH models. The results provide evidence that hedging using futures contracts listed on Fish Pool reduces risk for producers of farmed Atlantic salmon. The best hedging efficiency is achieved with a simple one-to-one hedge, closely followed by the bivariate GARCH approach.","[Misund, Bard] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Inst Sustainable Food Syst, Gainesville, FL USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Florida, Sch Forest Resources & Conservat, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Asche, Frank] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Misund, B (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",Bard.Misund@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020; Misund, Bård/J-8720-2016","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Misund, Bård/0000-0001-7069-5707",,,,,60,31,31,0,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

It explains the crisis by highlighting four basic mechanisms: first, the absence of a system of coordinated wage bargaining has been made responsible for the loss of cost competitiveness. Second, the specialization in price-sensitive medium-quality goods and the corresponding loss of market shares to emerging markets has been attributed to the weak innovation systems of Southern economies. Third, the loss of competitiveness has been masked temporarily by a strong increase of public indebtedness and, fourth, private household indebtedness.

Our focus lies mainly in the investigation and comparison of the labour market frictions present in these countries. We estimate a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for small open economies on four data sets between periods 2002Q1 and 2015Q4. The selected model contains several labour market and other types of rigidities, like wage and price adjustment costs. The explicitly defined labour market consists of a search and matching function and a Nash-type wage and working hours bargaining process. A switching mechanism is implemented for the Slovak Republic to differentiate between autonomous and joint monetary policies for periods before and after 2009. The model matches the behaviour of real macroeconomic variables relatively well. Our results suggest that the wage rigidities are weaker compared to the price frictions in all examined economies. Also, in most cases the monetary authority is capable of influencing the labour market variables. Finally, all countries except Poland show signs of high degree of openness.","[Papai, Adam] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Papai, A (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Brno, Czech Republic.",,,,specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration [MUNI/A/1040/2015],specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration,"This work was supported by funding of specific research at Faculty of Economics and Administration, project MUNI/A/1040/2015.

This study aims to arrange the various socioeconomic elasticities of environmental pollution in order of priority, depending on the length of time period, to establish the most effective policy. We employed a simultaneous equations system to find out the various socioeconomic elasticities in the long run and short run in Iran during 1974-2012. Based on the results, per capita CO2 emissions, GDP, energy consumption show the strongest interactions (relationships and elasticities) in the equations system as a whole in the long run. Moreover, it is the trade openness, labour force, financial development, and urbanization which show the most decisive effects in the short run. So the effectiveness of the system variables depends on the time period. Trade openness, labour force, and financial development play the most leading role in the short run, notwithstanding their limited role in the long run. However, energy consumption elasticity of CO2 emissions and urbanization elasticity of energy consumption are among the largest elasticities both in short run and long run. Therefore, energy consumption, economic growth and urbanization should be reduced and financial sector should be grown to decrease the environmental pollution. Moreover, economic growth is an effective factor for the long run; and trade openness and financial development are effective for the short run but urbanization and energy consumption are influential for both the long run and short run policies.

A weighted-average approach is used as a model for the product perception. Since this approach requires weights to be assigned to product features, and the weights are unknown and vary among customers, the procedure focuses on estimating expected weights of the entire market such weights are representative weights. The estimation is performed by constructing a confidence interval for the weights. Further, a more accurate location of the weights in the interval is proposed, the accuracy being based on additional information regarding inferior products. This information suggests that if a product is inferior, its value must be low. Therefore, the weights from the interval which minimize the value of an inferior product are suggested, the minimization serving as an approximation of what low value means. Since a minimization is involved, its existence and uniqueness is discussed.","[Tosenovsky, Filip] VSB TU Ostrava, Dept Qual Management, Ostrava, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Tosenovsky, F (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Dept Qual Management, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",filip.tosenovsky@vsb.cz,"Tosenovsky, Filip/ABH-1856-2020","Tosenovsky, Filip/0000-0003-3946-7815",Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [SP2015/91],"Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)","This paper was prepared under the specific research project No. SP2015/91 conducted at the Faculty of Metallurgy and Materials Engineering, VSB-TU Ostrava with the support of Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic.",,12,1,1,0,2,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

The results of the research have been obtained by analysing the planning documents of the re-emigration policy of the Baltic States, Statistical Bureaus' data regarding the migrant flow from 2010 to 2015, and by analysing the theoretical aspects of the impact of international migration of labour on the national economies. At the beginning of 21st century, the problem of international migration of labour in the whole world has gained very important theoretical and practical significance. The last global economic crisis has shown the flexibility of migration and further confirmed that the mobility of a person is an integral part of our globalized world. On the basis of the data of the World Bank, more than 215 m persons (3% of the world population) live outside their country of origin. However, migration is still a politically sensitive phenomenon that has a significant impact on countries' economies. International migration of labour of the Baltic States is an export with low added value (at macro level and mezzo level) and private investment in the joint capital of a person (at micro level). Migration is influenced by different economic, political and social factors in the country of origin of the migrant (factors facilitating the migration) or in the country of destination (connecting factors). The results of the research showed that migration has an impact on labour resources in all three Baltic States, however, an intensive emigration problem is expressed more in Latvia from the three Baltic States, but in the context of the policy, the economic growth rates of the Baltic States can decrease materially because there is a lack of labour attraction strategies, migration policy, and inaction of politicians and officials is observed in reduction of the negative consequences of emigration.","[Vasilevska, Daina; Lusena-Ezera, Inese] Liepaja Univ, Liepaja, Latvia; [Rivza, Baiba] Latvia Univ Agr, Jelgava, Latvia; [Libkovska, Una] Ventspils Univ Coll, Ventspils, Latvia",Liepaja University; Latvia University of Life Sciences & Technologies; Ventspils University College,"Vasilevska, D (通讯作者)，Liepaja Univ, Liepaja, Latvia.",,"Vasilevska, Daina L/N-5729-2017","Vasilevska, Daina L/0000-0002-0674-8218",,,,,3,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-76-6,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2016,,,,,,,447,454,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BH0OF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000395727200058,0

In this paper we develop a new method for financial decision making problems under intuitionistic linguistic environment and introduce the induced intuitionistic linguistic ordered weighted averaging distance (IILOWAD) operator. The main advantage of this operator is that it is able to consider complex attitudinal characters of the decision-maker by using order-inducing variables in the aggregation of the Hamming distance. Moreover, it is able to deal with uncertain environments where the information is very imprecise and can be assessed with intuitionistic linguistic numbers. We studied some of IILOWAD's main properties and different particular cases. We also develop an application of the new approach in a financial decisionmaking problem concerning the selection of civil engineering public project.","[Xiao, Yao] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chonghui] Zhejiang Univ Finance & Econ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University; Zhejiang University of Finance & Economics,"Xiao, Y (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",xiaoyao@188.com; ufo888833@163.com,"Wang, Yue/JRY-8962-2023","Wang, Yue/0000-0001-8673-6358",Youth Scholars Foundation of Beijing Normal University [SKXJS2014002]; National Social Science Fund [15BTJ010],Youth Scholars Foundation of Beijing Normal University; National Social Science Fund,This paper is supported by Youth Scholars Foundation of Beijing Normal University.(No. SKXJS2014002) and National Social Science Fund (No. 15BTJ010).,,24,6,6,1,6,ACAD ECONOMIC STUDIES,BUCHAREST,"15-17 CALEA DOROBANTI, SECTOR 1, BUCHAREST, 00000, ROMANIA",0424-267X,1842-3264,,ECON COMPUT ECON CYB,Econ.

We also find evidence that house-purchasing decisions are significantly affected by relatives-related variables such as number of immediate relatives in the same city, distance from parents, educational years of family head's father, and whether parents are alive.

For instance, the China International Jasmine Cultural Festival in Hengxian, the rape flower fields in Hongcun and the Dounan Flower Market in Kunming all achieve great success in attracting thousands of visitors from all over the world, leading to a substantial improvement of the local socio-economic benefits. With the flower fever constantly spreading to other regions, the management systems of this new industry become increasingly essential so as to ensure its sustainable development. This paper firstly presents the evolution process, industrial structure and social influence of the flower-themed tourism in China with a clue of time and space. After that, it summarizes the strategic nodes of the tourism operation in flower industries by the value chain analysis, which will lay a theoretical foundation for management decisions in the flower-themed tourism industry. Finally, typical management systems of successful cases in this country's flower-themed tourism are classified and analyzed by the case study method, aiming at providing ideas and suggestions for the further development of this type of tourism in China.","[Zhou, W.

It overviews research regarding the challenges of union organising and renewal, both in Australia and internationally. It provides a broad historical perspective on the origins and progress of the grassroots Organising Works agenda initiated by the peak union bodies, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Unions NSW. It explores how trade unions can best generate and sustain their spirit of mobilising and organising, while also ensuring the institutional legitimacy they require to effectively represent workers. Unions have had to manage the tension between two dynamics of trade union growth - the sense of movement involved in mobilising workers, and the institutional stability and legitimacy needed to represent workers. Unions have faced both the need to confront global capital restructuring through their own restructuring, and the need to renew and maintain a strong and democratic community base. To do so, they have built new networks and campaigning approaches, in order to organise an increasingly diverse and insecure workforce and build strong community links.","[Barnes, Alison] Macquarie Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Markey, Raymond] Macquarie Univ, Employment Relat, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Markey, Raymond] Macquarie Univ, Ctr Workforce Futures, Fac Business & Econ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Macquarie University; Macquarie University; Macquarie University,"Barnes, A (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Mkt & Management, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia.",alison.barnes@mq.edu.au,"Markey, Raymond/R-2836-2019","Barnes, Alison/0000-0002-0920-2990",,,,,36,6,6,0,5,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

It marked the beginning of what might be termed the organising turn', a shift across the international trade union movement towards the greater prioritisation of union organising. This article reviews the 20-year experience of the turn, reflecting upon three of its core attributes. The first is the origin of much activity at the apex of the official trade union movement and the consequences that flow from this point of origin. The second is the emphasis on diversity, with a particular priority in recent times in trying to organise low-wage migrant workers in precarious employment. The final attribute can be labelled neo-syndicalism'. This term refers to a switch towards the internal' renewal of trade unions and in this regard can be counterposed to attempts at revitalisation that focus on rebuilding relations with government and employers. The article concludes by arguing that organising can and must remain central to union strategy for renewal in Australia and beyond.","[Heery, Edmund] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Employment Relat, Cardiff CF10 3EU, Wales",Cardiff University,"Heery, E (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, Wales.",Heery@Cardiff.ac.uk,,,,,,,40,17,17,1,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

Yet union networks, particularly networks of delegates, and ways to build them, are still poorly understood. This is a study of the meaning that workplace union delegates assign to networks of support. It explores the characteristics of effective delegate and union networks and influences upon them. Effective networks are a combination of strong and weak ties, such that delegates sometimes do not recognise they are part of a network. Our three-stage research methodology involved delegate focus groups, a paper-based self-completion questionnaire of recently trained delegates (N=473) and a follow-up telephone survey (N=145). It found that organisers were key to creation of internal workplace networks (although they did not necessarily establish them) and in providing a bridge for delegates with external networks. They were the key support person for many delegates. Networks took a variety of forms. Only a minority were formalised. A majority were mainly internal to the workplace. Social media were rarely used, with little intention of using them more, and were, we suspect, underutilised.","[Peetz, David] Griffith Univ, Employment Relat, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Murray, Georgina] Griffith Univ, Humanities, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Muurlink, Olav] Cent Queensland Univ, Human Resource Management, Rockhampton, Qld 4702, Australia; [Peetz, David; May, Maggie] Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University; Central Queensland University; Griffith University,"Peetz, D (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Employment Relat & Human Resources, Kessels Rd Nathan, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",d.peetz@griffith.edu.au,"Muurlink, Olav/ABI-7658-2022","Muurlink, Olav/0000-0002-8251-9521",,,,,58,2,2,0,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

First, it outlines the policy reasons necessitating such legislation. Empirical evidence confirms that global value chains are a dominant feature of the global economy. It is contended that lead firms wield influence in global value chains in a manner which leads to poor outcomes for offshore workers. Second, the article sets out the minimum steps necessary for a domestic state to attribute the responsibility for transparency of global value chains to lead firms. Then, it proceeds to explore the possibilities and limits of the proposed scheme of regulation. Despite some complexities with implementing the scheme, it is argued that if domestic legislative regulation of global value chains strengthens even to a small extent the monitoring of global labour issues, it is worth pursuing.","[Rawling, Michael] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Law, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Rawling, M (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Law, POB 123 Broadway, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",michael.rawling@uts.edu.au,,"Rawling, Michael/0000-0002-0434-3452",Australian Research Council [DP120103162],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This article reports on research undertaken for an Australian Research Council funded project, Australian Supply Chain Regulation: Practical Operation and Regulatory Effectiveness, DP120103162.",,47,6,6,1,17,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1035-3046,1838-2673,,ECON LABOUR RELAT RE,Econ.

J,"Zweifel, P",,,,"Zweifel, Peter",,,Rationing of health care: is there an economic rationality to it?,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Editorial Material,,,,,,,,"The point of departure of this Editorial is the fact that we all are engaged in self-rationing in our everyday lives. We would like to spend more money on all sorts of nice things and devote more time to our cherished activities. Imposed rationing is characteristic of wartime governments, who seek to prevent the rich from gobbling up the resources left by the army. Since the publication in 1987 of David Callahan's Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987), rationing of health care has become a widely debated issue (the Internet is full of pertinent entries). While rationing has also been addressed by health economists, there are three puzzling observations. First, Callahan (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987) wrote for an American audience whereas rationing was introduced by the British National Health Service (NHS) well before 1987, with little debate. Second, the economic theory of rationing had been laid out by James Tobin [Ectrica 20(4): 521-533, 1952] as early as 1952-but health economists seem to have neglected his groundwork when writing about rationing. Third, they accept government-imposed rationing as inevitable in the case of health care, as though the self-rationing alternative was unavailable. An attempt is made here to provide rational explanations for these puzzles.","[Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland",University of Zurich,"Zweifel, P (通讯作者)，Kreuth 371, A-9531 Bad Bleiberg, Austria.",peter.zweifel@uzh.ch,,,,,,,20,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1618-7598,1618-7601,,EUR J HEALTH ECON,Eur.

They use a rich dataset from an intermediate microeconomics course from the fall of 2008 to the spring of 2013 at a public university in Taiwan. The estimation results reveal a significant and negative effect of peer attendance on individual students' examination performance. This result suggests that potential distraction from peers dominates the beneficial effect of peer attendance. In addition, the subsample estimation shows that the presence of peers produces a negative effect on better-motivated students' examination performance.

However, they are facing the risk of exclusion from the food system due to globalization and trade liberalization. To keep these farmers in modern supply chains, their relationships with other chain actors, foremost the collectors, need to be improved. Thus, this study explores the characteristics and constructs of the relationships between the small-scale shrimp growers and their collectors. Data was based on a survey on 83 small-scale shrimp growers, together with 16 unstructured interviews with growers (10) and collectors (6). It was revealed that the relationships between small-scale shrimp growers and collectors in TTH province are short-term and price-driven and are influenced by the power of collectors. The relationship strength was measured by five intercorrelated constructs including reliability, willingness-to-maintain, desire-fulfilment, negotiation capacity, and discussion capacity. Although some constructs were positively correlated, the strength of the relationships was weak. Both business linkages and social connections affected the grower-collector relationships. Female traders had stronger relationships with collectors than males. Therefore, interventions should be focused on business and social linkages as well as females' involvement in shrimp trade.","[Truong, Dung Q.] Hue Univ, Coll Econ, Fac Econ & Dev Studies, Hue 47000, Vietnam; [Ariyawardana, Anoma] Univ Queensland, Sch Agr & Food Sci, Fac Sci, Gatton, Australia",Hue University; University of Queensland,"Truong, DQ (通讯作者)，Hue Univ, Coll Econ, Fac Econ & Dev Studies, 99 Ho Dac Di, Hue 47000, Vietnam.",tquangdung230788@gmail.com,"Truong, Dung/AAE-8584-2021; Dung, Truong/V-7103-2019; Ariyawardana, Anoma/D-3585-2013","Truong, Dung/0000-0002-5108-5062; Ariyawardana, Anoma/0000-0003-0947-9559","Vietnam Government; University of Queensland, Australia","Vietnam Government; University of Queensland, Australia(University of Queensland)","Thanks are extended to the Vietnam Government and the University of Queensland, Australia, for providing the required financial support and conducting this research.",,54,1,2,1,16,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

The experimental design was aimed at neutralizing other differences in psychological attitudes, such as self-confidence and risk aversion, that are typically considered as potential explanations of gender differences in competitive environments. Students were invited to undertake a midterm exam under a tournament scheme having as a prize some bonus points to add to the final grade. Students competed in pairs of equal predicted ability but different gender composition. In a competitive setting in which risk aversion, feedback provision and self-confidence have little relevance, we find that women tend to perform similarly to men. The gender of one's competitor does not play any role in shaping students' behavior. Men and women perform similarly both in the competitive and in the non-competitive environment.

Compulsory schooling laws are exploited to isolate for causation. Cohorts who were teenagers before and after the health consequences of smoking were widely known are used to compare the effects of additional schooling in the presence and absence of widespread exposure to health-related information. Although the results for Great Britain indicate no causal role for education either before or after the consequences of smoking for health were widely known, the results for Northern Ireland suggest that, at least among men, schooling affected smoking decisions prior to the public dissemination of knowledge on the dangers of smoking for health.

We find no statistically significant SNAP effect among the 12- to 20-year-old participants when controlling for selection bias and more accurately defining the treatment and comparison groups. The results are robust to various robustness checks including redefining the treatment and comparison groups by excluding those who previously enrolled in the SNAP, using an alternative treatment definition based on SNAP benefits received, using different specifications of the propensity score equation, and employing different estimation techniques (covariate matching and inverse probability weighting). The robustness analyses regarding unobservables also find no statistically significant SNAP effects. This study differs from previous research in three major aspects. First, we carefully examine the intensity of SNAP participation (full-time versus part-time) and the amount of SNAP benefits received for one-, two-, and three-year durations. Second, we focus on the change in the BMI (body mass index) or the obesity status rather than the level and control for the pretreatment BMI to avoid the confounding effects of the time-invariant factors. Third, instead of making parametric assumptions on the outcomes, we employ a variety of semiparametric estimators to control for the selection bias of program participation. The results show that the SNAP is not responsible for the higher prevalence of obesity among adolescents of low-income households. Proposed SNAP changes such as more frequent benefit distribution and a focus on fresh fruits and vegetables are likely to be ineffective in reducing childhood obesity, although they might encourage healthy dietary practices among SNAP participants.","[Fan, Maoyong] Ball State Univ, Muncie, IN 47306 USA; [Jin, Yanhong] Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA",Ball State University; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick,"Jin, YH (通讯作者)，Rutgers State Univ, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",yjin@aesop.rutgers.edu,,,,,,,58,6,9,0,18,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",2332-3493,2332-3507,,AM J HEALTH ECON,AM.

We found low take-up rates among the 1,514 high-performing teachers who were offered the incentive, with minimal sorting on observable characteristics. Within the new schools, transfer teachers were less likely than their counterparts in a randomized control group to require mentoring and more likely to provide mentoring themselves.

We provide new evidence on this puzzle using register based Swedish data on the largest sample of twins used so far in the literature. In contrast to previous twin studies, our results confirm the importance of mothers' schooling. We also provide the first twin-based evidence of possible role model effects, where our estimates suggest that mother's schooling matters more than father's schooling for daughters schooling. One additional year of mothers' schooling raises daughter's schooling by a tenth of a year, which is similar to some of the previous IV-based estimates in the literature. Finally, we bring in new US twin data that for the first time allows a replication of previous twin-based estimates of the intergenerational transmission of schooling in the US. The results show no statistically significant effect of mothers' and fathers' schooling on children's schooling. Our results have implications for assessing the efficiency of policies that subsidize the schooling of men and women and are in contrast to most previous findings in the twin literature.

Participants were 506 university students in Aotearoa New Zealand invited to imagine a society in 2050 where most individuals consume a plant-based, vegetarian, or vegan diet. A thematic analysis was conducted on responses to an open-ended item asking how these future societies would be different to today. Participants reported a variety of potential positive and negative outcomes for individuals and wider society. Subsequent analyses of attitudes scales investigated the relationships between the collective dimensions of plant-based future societies and support for policies to promote plant-based diets. For a vegetarian future, the strongest predictor of current support for social change was the expectation that widespread vegetarianism would reduce societal dysfunction. For a vegan future, the strongest predictor of support for social change was an expectation of increased warmth in a vegan society. Implications for theory and advocacy are discussed.

The latest reforms have set numerous objectives related to semi-natural, rural and urban landscapes, with a key role attributed to the expansion of corridors and networks. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of the Scottish forest policy and planning framework to drive the right trees in the right places, and support the implementation of a spatially and ecologically coherent and multi-functional network of forest and woodland corridors and patches, using North East Scotland as case study. We provide empirical evidence of the lags related to the coherence and consistency of the existing policy and planning framework. We argue that spatially-explicit policy and planning instruments and a stronger degree of coordination amongst institutions and actors operating across policy levels and spatial-temporal scales are needed. We conclude by proposing some pathways forward.

In this article we look closer at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the Norwegian salmon farming industry. This is among the most common accounting measures of firm performance, and it is also used extensively in firm valuations. We find that the components of earnings have different time series behavior. Our empirical analysis shows that earnings from the Norwegian salmon farming industry can be characterized as a random walk.

We rely on patent data in fossil-fuel (FF) and renewable energy (REN) technologies for 5471 European firms over the 1978-2006 period. The novelty of our approach is in the focus on firm's heterogeneity in driving technological change. We make a distinction between small specialized firms, which innovate in only one type of technology, and large mixed firms, which innovate in both technologies, to analyse how REN patents can replace FF ones at the sector level both through a shift in innovation activities within existing firms and through firms' entry and exit. We use zero-inflated count data estimation techniques to identify the factors that affect specialized versus mixed firms' patenting behaviour both at the intensive (i.e., levels of innovation) and extensive (i.e., technological entry) margins. We further investigate the implications of our firm-level estimations for reducing the gap between REN and FF innovation at the aggregate level. We establish two key findings: (1) a decrease in the FF-REN technology gap mainly comes about through technological entry of specialized REN firms following an increase in REN market size; (2) increases in FF prices, FF market size, and FF knowledge stocks all increase the technology gap by increasing mixed firms FF innovation rates. An important implication of our results is that policies aimed at increasing REN innovation should focus on helping small firms to start and sustain innovation in the long-run. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Recently, public incentives in the renewable energy sector have been challenged through both dispute settlement procedures of the World Trade Organization and domestic countervailing duty investigations. One may expect that trade frictions in this field will intensify over time. This article argues that the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures - a multilateral trade treaty on subsidization and anti-subsidy measures - should be revised to give more policy space to national authorities in implementing their low-carbon programmes. The Appellate Body made a few climate-friendly interpretations in Canada-Renewable Energy/Canada-Feed-In Tariff Program. It is now members' turn to carry out meaningful rule-making reforms.

A binary logit model was developed to study the factors influencing preferences for live and fresh fish products. Results indicated that consumer preferences for live fish species vary by ethnic group. Live fish customers visited supermarkets at least two to three times a week and spent $16 to $20 a week to purchase medium size fish (0 to .91kg live fish, on average). Freshness and appearance (bright, free of bruises, healthy fish) were the most important attributes.

Results suggest that a 10% increase in advertising expenditure sponsored by the NSC makes the demand curve of Norwegian salmon and Canadian salmon rotate counterclockwise by 0.54% and 10.3%, respectively, and the curve for the Rest-of-World salmon rotate clockwise by 4.09%. In our empirical case of salmon demand, the impact of advertising-induced rotation on the optimal spending level and the change in producer surplus is significant when the advertising expenditure is greatly intensified, the export volume is huge and the supply is less elastic.","Univ Tromso, Sch Business & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway",UiT The Arctic University of Tromso,"Xie, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Tromso, Sch Business & Econ, N-9037 Tromso, Norway.",Xie.jinghua@uit.no,,,,,,,32,8,8,0,5,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",1365-7305,1551-8663,,AQUACULT ECON MANAG,Aquac.

Procurement contract clauses specify reporting procedures and sanctions for non-compliance, implying that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce minimum labour standards within contract performance management. In this article, the case of school cleaners employed under New South Wales government contracts between 2010 and 2011 is the vehicle for exploring the effectiveness of these protective clauses. We find that the inclusion of these protective clauses in procurement contracts is unnecessary in the Australian context, and any expectations that government contracting agencies will monitor and enforce labour standards are misleading.

This study examines how music training during childhood and youth affects the development of cognitive skills, school grades, personality, time use and ambition using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our findings suggest that adolescents with music training have better school grades, are more conscientious, open and ambitious. These effects are stronger among adolescents from lower socio-economic status. In order to address the non-random selection into playing music, we take into account detailed information on the child and its parents, which may determine both the decision to pursue music lessons and educational outcomes. While lacking truly exogenous variations in music activities, our results are robust to a large range of sensitivity tests. We thereby approach causality better than previous observational studies.

The importance of open versions arises e.g. from car-hire options. This paper describes new model of vehicle routing problem that allows combining classical capacited vehicle routing problem (CVRP) modeling the routes realized by own vehicles together with the possibility to realize open routes with hired vehicles (OVRP). Although hiring vehicles could be more expensive per unit distance traveled, their use could lead to considerable saving due to reduction of the total cost of the route.

The result of the globalization of the world economy has become the free flow of financial resources, which led to a sharp rise over the past three decades, the number and the economic power of multinational integrated companies. Such structural shifts in the world economy dictate new requirements for the formation of tax systems, and companies to open up opportunities for tax optimization. The structure of the tax systems of most countries based on the taxation of financial results. The value of income affects the size of the tax base for corporate income tax, value added tax, tax on capital gains. In turn, the income generated from the value of the revenue of the company and the amount of expenses incurred. The prices, at which transactions concluded, are a key factor influencing the amount of revenues and expenses. Thus, pricing provides many opportunities for the distribution of profit between affiliated organizations and, of course, this distribution carried out in the manner most favorable to the holding as a whole. For such a pricing system adopted in international practice, introduced the term transfer pricing. The global financial and economic crisis has led to an increase in budget deficits states.

The aim of this research paper is to assess business cycles' synchronization within the G7, emphasizing the role of the trade channel as a transmission vector. Annual growth rates for GDP and trade were filtered using the Hodrick-Prescott method and the results were correlated through the Pearson approach to obtain the degree of similarity between countries with respect to their economic fluctuations. The results highlight a stronger degree of synchronization during recessions, while in time of economic expansion there are 2 well-defined macro cycles corresponding to each continent: Europe, North America and the emergent Asian cycle. Furthermore, trade was proven to be an important business cycle vector just for some countries, while for the completeness of the study additional variables should be also taken into consideration. The significance of this study resides in the highlighting of the business cycle synchronization by means of the trade channel for the most influential economic powers of the world. This work can be transformed into a cybernetic model of the business cycle and, most of all it can offer solutions regarding the propagation of the crisis. (C) 2015 The Authors.

However, a pertinent question is how this new economic status has impacted on the wealth and health of her citizens. There is a dearth of empirical study on the wealth distribution in Nigeria which could be important in explaining the general disparities in their health seeking behavior. An adequate knowledge of Nigeria wealth distribution will no doubt inform policy makers in their decision making to improve the quality of life of Nigerians. Method: This study is a retrospective analysis of the assets of household in Nigeria collected during the 2012 National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey (NARHS Plus 2). We used the principal component analysis methods to construct wealth quintiles across households in Nigeria. At 5% significance level, we used ANOVA to determine differences in some health outcomes across the WQs and chi-square test to assess association between WQs and some reproductive health seeking behaviours. Result: The wealth quintiles were found to be internally valid and coherent. However, there is a wide gap in the reproductive health seeking behavior of household members across the wealth quintiles with members of households in lower quintiles having lesser likelihood (33.0%) to receive antenatal care than among those in the highest quintiles (91.9%). While only 3% were currently using modern contraceptives in the lowest wealth quintile, it was 17.4% among the highest wealth quintile (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The wealth quintiles showed a great disparity in the standard of living of Nigerian households across geo-political zones, states and rural-urban locations which had greatly influenced household health seeking behavior.","[Fagbamigbe, Adeniyi F.; Bamgboye, Elijah A.; Yusuf, Bidemi O.; Akinyemi, Joshua O.] Univ Ibadan, Coll Med, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Med Stat, Ibadan, Nigeria; [Issa, Bolakale K.; Ngige, Evelyn; Amida, Perpetua; Bashorun, Adebobola; Abatta, Emmanuel] Fed Minist Hlth, NASCP, Abuja, Nigeria",University of Ibadan,"Fagbamigbe, AF (通讯作者)，Univ Ibadan, Coll Med, Fac Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Med Stat, Ibadan, Nigeria.",franstel74@yahoo.com,"Fagbamigbe, Adeniyi Francis/X-2772-2019","Fagbamigbe, Adeniyi Francis/0000-0001-9184-8258; Akinyemi, Joshua/0000-0002-0675-2110",,,,,41,24,28,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2191-1991,,,HEALTH ECON REV,Health Econ.

Indeed, the indisputable urgency to address the negative impacts of climate change on the one hand, and the use of subsidies to boost and support a country's renewable energy sector on the other, provide momentum to better define the legal framework offered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). It is fundamental to ascertain whether the current framework represents an adequate model to address renewable energy subsidies, or whether a more flexible interpretation of WTO Agreements toward sustainable development and the protection of the environment should be adopted instead. In view of that, this paper carefully investigates the evolution of the WTO subsidies disciplines, focusing in particular on the approach of the WTO towards renewable energy subsidies. This article is divided in three sections. The first one offers an overview of WTO disputes involving subsidies in the renewable energy sector, the second one focuses on the recent decisions in the Canada - Renewable Energy and Canada - Feed-in Tariff Program disputes and on some important issues they raise, while in the last one we draw our conclusions.","[Farah, Paolo Davide] W Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Publ Adm, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [Farah, Paolo Davide] Coll Law, Morgantown, WV USA",West Virginia University,"Farah, PD (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Eberly Coll Arts & Sci, Dept Publ Adm, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",paolofarah@yahoo.com,,,People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under REA [269327],People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme under REA(European Union (EU)),"This scientific result is part of the West Virginia University Energy Institute and Multi-Disciplinary Center for Shale Gas Utilization (WV, USA).

While economic data were marginally known by the population, the crisis emerged in the words of Valenzani as a visual experience of the city landscape. 'Invisible presence' and 'visible absence' emerged as the fundamental keywords used by the community to describe the industry, its normality and change. The paper investigates these concepts, indicating the analysis of the sensorial experience and its rhetoric expression as a rich ground for an alternative, human understanding of economy. In so doing, it aims at aim at providing an example of a possible different way of writing economy that does not starts from econometric data, but from the very perception of the social life and space as experienced by its actors.","[Fontefrancesco, Michele F.] Univ Gastron Sci, Pollenzo, Bra, Italy; [Fontefrancesco, Michele F.] Univ Durham, Dept Anthropol, Durham, England",University of Gastronomic Sciences; Durham University,"Fontefrancesco, MF (通讯作者)，Univ Gastron Sci, Pollenzo, Bra, Italy.",m.f.fontefrancesco@durham.ac.uk,"FONTEFRANCESCO, Michele Filippo/AAD-1381-2020","FONTEFRANCESCO, Michele Filippo/0000-0003-3247-6110",,,,,63,0,0,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1753-0350,1753-0369,,J CULT ECON-UK,J.

The paper concludes that, despite the fact that Draft is only the first step, it brings substantial contributions: it has led to a better understanding of the differences which accompany this profession's development in different parts of globe. It enables better identification of common features, but also differences in profiles and professional orientations of professional accountants, auditors and professional accountants in business, and of managerial accountants or controllers whose quality professional development is the principle aim of this project. The important part of the project is the empirical research focused on changing the requirements of managers and controllers, and mapping the current situation in the Czech Republic in this area. The research compares the opinions of two groups of respondents experts who are responsible for the professional competence development of controllers on the one hand, and managers and controllers operating in a business environment on the other. The paper provides results relating to following areas: the general content of controllers' activities, controllers' authority and responsibility, requirements for controllers' education, professional skills and practical experience, ethical aspects of management accounting as well as the quality assurance of the controllers' work. Regarding the general content of controller's activities, both groups of respondents were almost unanimous regarding the desired content of the controllers'/management accountants' work. The correctness of data which are processed subsequently into the output information used in the managerial control and the successive quality, availability and transparency of the information rendered to company management belong into the responsibility of these experts. In compliance with the above stated role of the company's economic conscience, both groups of respondents also agreed that a controller/management accountant should not bear primary responsibility for the company's financial results; nevertheless, we can notice slightly higher level of average and mode of responses provided by the second group of respondents, i. e. managers and controllers. In our opinion, it is possible to interpret in a sense that while the first group strictly reject this responsibility for financial results, in practice controllers earn a part of their bonuses based on the results. Nevertheless, this tendency comes more from the necessity to communicate interest for the company's results across all company employees, regardless of whether they directly influence them or not. What is remarkable is that the results in the areas of coordination of activities connected with the company aims and means of their fulfilment formulation are significantly different. According to the first group, the role of these experts is crucially important in this area; however, according to the opinion of experts from companies, controllers do not support this area very intensively. In their view, controllers are more focused on the technical and process activities of controllership and information support of management, and they are not involved so much in general questions of strategy formulation and implementation. Also, a relatively low agreement exists between both groups of experts regarding whether a controller should act as an originator of an information system or its parts. Conversely, both groups found a consensus that a controller should not have the authority to influence source allocation (e. g. he/she should not decide about the sold products volume and structure, accept make-or-buy decisions or about the development/decline of customer, territory or distribution channels). In the area of requirements for education, both groups of respondents strongly highlight the knowledge of financial accounting and reporting, management accounting and corporate finance; on the other hand, knowledge of law, auditing, marketing and international aspects of business are considered to have lower importance; in the ICT area, the controller is considered to be mainly a user rather than an originator and verifier of processing and user quality; In the area of requirements for professional skills and practical experience, both groups of respondents consider soft skills to be important; nevertheless, they perceive technical skills even more relevant for the controllers' professional competence. According to the research, however, the recent situation in the Czech Republic in worse in the area of soft skills of controllers as company managers are not convinced about their importance; Both groups of respondents also confirm how important for a company it is to define, enhance, support and communicate effectively ethical principles and rules of undertaking; on the other hand, the research also confirms a very poor level of application of ethical principles and rules of business in practice; this is the reason why this aspect should be incorporated into the quality standards as a very important one; The results of the investigation into controllers' professional development needs confirm that both groups of respondents consider professional development to be quite crucial for the quality of the controllers' work; in this regard, management enables its controllers to continue their professional development, but it does not always verify whether controllers enhance their professional competence; The statistical results of quality assurance of the controllers' work confirm the necessity of evaluating controllers' work. On the other hand, answers to open questions such as  How is the controllers' work evaluated? were very general.","[Kral, Bohumil; Soljakova, Libuse] Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Kral, Bohumil; Soljakova, Libuse] Univ Econ, Fac Finance & Accounting, Management Accounting Dept, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Král, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kral@vse.cz; soljak@vse.cz,,,,,,,17,0,0,1,8,MENDEL UNIV BRNO,BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-223-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,515,530,,,,,,16,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5ND,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389579800051,0

In addition, sophisticated panel data models, such as panel unit root, co-integration,vector error correction model (VECM) and Granger causality test have been used. Results showed that there is a long-term relationship and co-integration between FDI and unemployment, and that FDI positively influence the reduction of unemployment in most countries of the WB.

Popularity of innovative entrepreneurship, amount of investments into innovations and potential reinforcement of economic growth has attracted the attention of corporate sector as well as government institutions and local municipalities. Creation of suitable environment for innovative entrepreneurship and peculiar start-ups has become much more significant over the last 15 years. From the academic point of view, this topic is rather new. Regarding the local self-governments, the creation of suitable environment and concept of the ecosystem for startups represent only one of the many key issues of city's development. Smart city is another distinctive movement that comes to the core. The main question dealt with in this paper is to what extent the targets related to the implementation of smart cities concept relates to the process of start-up ecosystem creation. Is there any relation between the indicators observing the level of smart cities and the factors based on which the suitability of startup ecosystems are evaluated? The link between both concepts is assumed based on the close interconnection of both approaches and IT technologies and computerisation of natural environment of the given city.","[Lavcak, Marek; Hudec, Oto] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Lavcák, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Nemcovej 32, Kosice 04001, Slovakia.",marek.lavcak@tuke.sk; oto.hudec@tuke.sk,"Hudec, Oto/F-4898-2019","Hudec, Oto/0000-0002-8877-8647",,,,,17,0,0,0,16,"TECHNICAL UNIV KOSICE, FAC ECONOMICS",KOSICE,"RAMPOVA 1731-7, KOSICE, DZUNGL A-DZUNGL A 040 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-553-2467-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,364,372,,,,,,9,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH7LE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000402646500042,0

Financial data have been widely used by researchers to predict financial crises; however, few studies have considered corporate governance indicators in building prediction models. This article presents a financial crisis prediction model that involves using a genetic algorithm for determining the optimal feature set and support vector machines (SVMs) to be used with XBRL. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms models based on only one type of information, either financial or corporate governance.
