The research focuses on Creativity and the Creative Industries, the final module of City University London's Masters in Innovation, Creativity and Leadership (MICL), an interdisciplinary Higher Education (HE) Masters designed for mature students with managerial experience. The module's teaching includes collaborative, experiential arts workshops (eg drama, classical music, improvisation and art) to support the students' group and individual artistic projects and final reflective journal and report. The paper outlines these theoretical propositions which inform the study's data analysis (Yin, 2008, p. 18): 1) That the module's learning processes are artistic, unfamiliar, disruptive, embodied experiences 2) That the students create an applied understanding of their learning through reflection and personal narrative 3) That critical incidents in the students' personal narratives will be expressed through metaphors of personal and professional identity 4) That both narrative (eg James and Brookfield, 2014, p. 106, citing Kubler-Ross's (1997) Change Curve) and personal change models (eg Heron, 1992, p. 122) will usefully inform the analysis. The study's primary analytical methodologies include content analysis (eg Charmaz, 2006), narrative analysis (Gregerson, 2013), thematic analysis (Van Manen, 2014) and critical incident analysis (Shiu, 2014) (Argyris, 1982; Bolton, 2014; Dewey, 1933; Downey & Clandinin, 2010; Dreyfus, 1996; James & Brookfield, 2014; King & Kitchener, 1994; McEwen et al., 2009; Merleau-Ponty, 1962/2002; Ricoeur, 2007; Schon, 1983, 1987). The research approach is consistent with work on threshold concepts (Meyer & Land, 2003), theory which links identity and narrative (eg Bruner, 2002; Boyd, 2009; Downey& Clandinin, 2010; Gottschall, 2012; Herman, 2013; McGilchrist, 2009) and arts-based and creativity research (eg Amabile, 1983; Bateson & Martin, 2015; Gregerson et al., 2013; Shiu, 2014; Sayer, 2012). The paper acknowledges the need for a reflexive approach, especially in HE and artistic contexts (eg Brookfield, 2010; Fleming, 2012; Foucault, 1980; Freire, 1970; Mezirow, 1998, 2000), as well as the risks of drawing broader lessons from a case study (Cohen, 2010; Yin, 2013). Consistent with this Track's theme of 'rattling' HE and organisational development through the application of arts-based initiatives, I conclude by discussing whether shifts in the students' narratives through the MICL programme and this might can be related to their personal and professional identities; and the degree to which these might in turn promote sustained impacts on their inter- and intrapersonal competence and self-efficacy.","City Univ London, Dept Culture & Creat Ind, London EC1V 0HB, England",City University London,"Kernan, MA (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Culture & Creat Ind, Northampton Sq, London EC1V 0HB, England.",,,,,,,,59,0,0,2,24,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2038,2047,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200159,0

There are many methods for visual modeling, but the selection of the right ones - is not evident for non-specialist. The authors previously suggested the approach for diagram classification and selection based on a semantic analysis, which links various knowledge types (know-what, know-how, etc.) with corresponding diagram type. The current paper provides and illustrates the resulting method for knowledge diagram classification and selection. The case-study shows the selection and usage of different diagram types within organizational development project in marketing domain of a medium-sized repair service company. Design/methodology/approach - the paper is in line with design science research - a research paradigm in which a researcher answers questions relevant to human problems via the creation of innovative artifacts, thereby contributing new knowledge to the body of scientific evidence (Hevner, Chatterjee, 2010). As Moody (Moody, 2003) and Rescher (Rescher, 1977) emphasized, the validity of a method can only be established by applicative success in practice. The authors demonstrate the use of the method to solve practical problem, so case study was used (Hevner, Chatterjee, 2010). This study involved project document analysis and interviews with project participants. Originality/value - The suggested case study for marketing domain of the medium-sized repair service company demonstrates relevance and applicability of a novel method for knowledge diagram classification and selection. This demonstration also helps to clarify how to use the method and gives directions for future research. Practical implications - The method and its demonstration helps manager to understand the potential of knowledge diagrams, to select and apply diagrams more effectively, to structure complex situations systemically and to shape future prospects clearly.","[Kudryavtsev, Dmitry; Gavrilova, Tatiana] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Grigoriev, Lev] Business Engn Grp, St Petersburg 191015, Russia",Saint Petersburg State University,"Kudryavtsev, D (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, Volkhovsky Pereulok 3, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.",,"Kudryavtsev, Dmitry V./G-1807-2015; Gavrilova, Tatiana/E-9154-2010",,,,,,23,1,1,0,2,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1203,1211,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200092,0

The article presents a model for evaluating the effectiveness of Internet agent based on informativity of its product portfolio. The model is based on the analysis of the product portfolio, gross income and transaction costs of online shops selling advantage of one type of goods. A model of the ideal online store is shown. The basis for the analysis is financial results and information about the product portfolio of the largest online Russian retailers. Results have shown that Internet agents that implement common advantage of ideal online products or stimulating demand products in the virtual market have a level of transaction costs lower than those online retailers that sell not stimulating demand products. Scientific novelty of the model lies in the development of research on effectiveness of theoretical apparatus of forming the online seller product portfolio. The practical significance of the model is the ability to determine the level of optimality of the product portfolio of any virtual consumer market player.

We have yet to find convincing solutions to the problems necessary to heal our world. Our ability to think, understand and most importantly act on today's major global issues remains attenuated. What knowledge do we need and how should we learn in order to act? Thinking in a systemic way, we see education as a crucial entry point to any deep change in the social and human dynamics. Therefore, we are embarking on creating a transformational journey, of ourselves, and the world. The aim of the project is to contribute to design and facilitate a creative experience-based learning space supporting individual and collective transformation. In coherence with a holistic worldview, where creativity is the basis of social ontology and complexity its epistemology, we initiate a philosophical project that will draw from several sources of knowledge to create a socially innovative process from which social innovations will emerge. We consider that this process must necessarily be reflexive and responsive, and in this sense partly mirror the changes we intend to disseminate. The key assumption that forms the basis of the project is: that transformational change occurs interdependently, and thus to transform the world, we need to transform ourselves and vice versa. This paper presents the project, its meta theoretical ground, initial guiding principles and emerging prototype. Design/methodology/approach - We propose a participative collective arts-and design-based approach to creating a learning space (also referred to as 'container'), both on a virtual platform and in presence. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence the role of artistic creative processes in creating learning spaces in which art-based learning methods, and arts as a creative means to learn about complexity, transformation processes, the self, the commons, and social innovation as key elements are mobilised. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application are a prototype of a learning space and process, which constitute a contribution to renew and/or provide a rich alternative to institutional education programs. It aims at sustaining the development of knowledge and competencies necessary to develop in order to be able to evolve individually and collectively and innovate socially.

Transport tax is treated as the tax price paid for the use of a motor vehicle and road network. Negative externalities of the use of motor vehicles are characterized. The authors establish the relationship between the types of negative externalities and types of transport fees to be paid to compensate for these negative effects. Fixed and variable externalities are identified. The conclusion is made that the majority of external negative effects varies depending on several factors. The most important factors are defined, including the number of users of road infrastructure. The requirements are formulated that ought to be met by transport taxes and fees built on the benefit principle.

The purpose of this study is to determine the attitudes of the local tourist organizations' managers in Croatia towards the importance of monitoring of the economic and environmental impact of wildlife tourism. For the needs of the research, the data were gathered from the managers of 35 tourist organizations, using a mail-back questionnaire. The results of a hierarchical cluster analysis show that management stakeholders can be divided into four clusters, Enthusiasts, Rationalists, Unconvinced and Sceptics. The profiles of four clusters show differences in attitudes, the biggest difference being in the belief that wildlife tourism could be the primary motive for the arrival of tourists. Similarities of opinions can be found in the view that the development of wildlife tourism represents an indirect incentive for generating additional income, which is an economic benefit. The results of analysis also indicate that the local tourist organizations' managers recognise the potential and are willing to actively participate in the development projects of wildlife tourism.","[Milohnic, Ines; Popadic, Mladenka] Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42,Pp 97, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Milohnic, I (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Tourism & Hospitality Management Opatija, Primorska 42,Pp 97, Rijeka, Croatia.",ines.milohnic@fthm.hr; mpopadic@fthm.hr,"MILOHNIĆ, INES/T-4982-2019","MILOHNIĆ, INES/0000-0001-7487-4286",,,,,30,1,1,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,416,424,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100040,0

This leads to the main research question; what are the ingredients of this creative, transformative learning space? Design/methodology/approach The discussion of polyphonic understanding is grounded in one of a series of Learning Jam events, which were co-created by practitioners and academics exploring the value of their own work based practice through the lenses of arts based initiatives (ABI's). The unit of analysis in the study is the evaluation process undertaken through the frame of Schiuma's (2011) Arts-Value Matrix. Originality/value The central idea of the matrix is that the potential effects of arts-based initiatives in an organization relate both to people and to organizational infrastructure. In this context learning as a part of knowledge management is conceptualised in the broad sense of collaborative action in which ABI's are coupled with research-based theater (Passila, et al., 2013; Adams & Owens, forthcoming 2015) to create forms of work-based learning with transformative potential. Teaching in this context demands reflexive and dialogical capabilities for those who hold the role of organizing and facilitating spaces for learning and transformation. We discuss this by Rancierre's critical theory. Practical implications When analyzing the Learning Jam we realised the need to question the relationship between 'teacher' and 'student' as traditionally configured, and the parallel relationship between 'performer' and 'audience'. We take these questions further by discussing equality as a way to create a space when the main idea is to lean on to something which is not yet. Reflection and imagination are underlined as relevant elements of learning through work. In the conclusion the back story of this type of learning and the pedagogical philosophy on which it is based is framed.","[Passila, Anne] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Dept LUT, Lahti Sch Business & Management, Lahti 15140, Finland; [Owens, Allan] Univ Chester, Fac Educ, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Owens, Allan] Univ Chester, Dept Performing Arts, Chester, Cheshire, England; [Pulkki, Maiju] Res Educ Creat & Arts Practice, Espoo, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT; University of Chester; University of Chester,"Pässilä, A (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Dept LUT, Lahti Sch Business & Management, Saimaankatu 11, Lahti 15140, Finland.",,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2030,2037,,,,,,8,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200158,0

The active role in business management, accounting primarily owed to the accounting choice, which offers possibility that with chosen accounting procedure and method affects the company business. Accounting choices are refer to the accounting policies adopted by company and which are defined as specific principles, rules and practices of financial reporting. Nowadays company business is marked by the dynamic and turbulent market trends within which the emphasis is on the availability of financial resources, respectively on the managing and obtaining the required financial funds and ensuring company liquidity and solvency. Exactly in the context of financial policies, companies trying to provide financial funds necessary for undisturbed business process. Terms of obtaining the financial resources are negotiate on the basis of published accounting information in the company financial statements. Starting from the fact, that companies with accounting policies choices affect the financial statement, which represent its business on financial markets and financial institutions with the aim of obtaining necessary financial resources, we put in relation the company accounting policies and costs of financial resources which arising from company financial policies. So the goal of research is to determine whether the companies which have a higher level of financial costs will try to present better business result by selecting accounting policies, which mitigates the negative impact of financial costs and improves the current business performance, with which company will ensure the attractive perception and better condition of obtaining financial resources.

AM symbiosis is thought to increase host resistance to salinity stress, a characteristic that could be interesting in areas where the scarcity of irrigation waters forces growers to use low-quality irrigation water. The type of AM colonization was analyzed to ascertain whether it is influenced by saline conditions. Seedlings of Citrus macrophylla Wester (CM) were inoculated with a mixture of two AM fungi. Ninety-six days after inoculation, plants were irrigated with Hoagland modificated solution containing 0, 20, 40, 60 or 80 mM NaCl. CM showed an Arum-type mycorrhiza. Epidermical cells were never colonized and, the infection developed longitudinally and radially in the cortex of the root by many intercellular hyphae. Branches from intercellular longitudinal hyphae gave rise to arbuscules in the cells. These arbuscules were scattered through the cells of the medium and inner cortex, with the outer cortical cell layers relatively free of intracellular fungal structures. The vesicles were also located in the intercellular spaces of the same cortical cell layers. Most of the mycorrhizal roots in the salt treatments showed a higher number of vesicles than the mycorrhizal roots without salt treatment. Under salinity stress, no differences were observed in the mycorrhizal colonization percentages. This could explain the increasing tolerance of mycorrhizal plants observed towards high levels of salinity.","[Rodriguez-Moran, Manuel; Navarro, Josefa M.] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain; [Morte, Asuncion] Univ Murcia, Fac Biol, Dept Biol Vegetal, Area Bot, Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Navarro, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain.",josefam.navarro2@carm.es,"Navarro, Josefa M/Q-6256-2016; Navarro, Josefa M./S-1831-2019; Morte, Asuncion/L-4536-2014","Navarro, Josefa M/0000-0002-8811-4576; Navarro, Josefa M./0000-0002-8811-4576; Morte, Asuncion/0000-0002-6426-0202",,,,,20,0,0,0,10,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1343,1349,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600170,0

In fact, the key inventor, who remains central in cultural industries, needs to interact with a team in the cultural products development (Taylor and Greve 2006; Tran 2010). Nevertheless, the characteristics of this particular team remain unclear (Stierand et al. 2014; Tan 2015). Thereby, the present paper aims to understand the composition of a team which has to support key inventors. Design/methodology/approach - The setting of our research is the haute cuisine, which belongs to cultural industries (Ferguson 1998; Messeni Petruzzelli and Savino 2014). In particular, we conducted an in-depth case study of Dal Pescatore. This is the Italian restaurant keeping the highest award previewed by Michelin Guide from the longer period of time. The main figures of the restaurant are the chefs: Nadia and Giovanni Santini. The former was the world's best female chef in 2013, the latter received the chef de l'avenir prize in 2012. Furthermore, many chefs learned the basics of the haute cuisine in this kitchen before the opening of their own restaurants. Originality/value - Scholars have hugely emphasized the centrality of key inventors' creativity for company's success (e.g. Stierand et al. 2014). However, a growing stream of literature has underlined how teams and their composition affect creativity (Taylor and Greve 2006; Perretti and Negro 2007). Nevertheless, existing research has treated teams and key inventors as alternative solutions (Taylor and Greve 2006). Conversely, recent studies have revealed cases in which key inventors are supported by a team (Cillo and Verona, 2008; Tran 2010). Accordingly, we focused on the composition of this particular team underlining the necessity to combine the experience of aged people with the suggestions of young foreign apprentices. Practical implications - We advance the managerial investigation in cultural industries, which are now attracting an increasing interest by both scholars and policy makers as an important source of economic growth (Chaston and Sadler-Smith 2012). In particular, this research provides useful implications to face the key challenge of innovation development in cultural industries (Taylor and Greve 2006; Cillo and Verona 2008). Hence, this study provides relevant suggestions to the increasing number of cultural firms which adopt an innovation process based on a key inventor sustained by a dedicated team.","[Savino, Tommaso; Petruzzelli, Antonio Messeni; Albino, Vito] Polytech Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Savino, T (通讯作者)，Polytech Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Viale Japigia 182, Bari, Italy.",,,,,,,,55,2,2,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1073,1084,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200082,0

The results come out from modelling of measurement system on the basis of relevant field of study with particular discriminant characteristics. The role of confidence interval is the expression of estimate accuracy for on-time probability. The accuracy is expressed as width of the confidence interval of on-time probability estimate. The probability distribution for modelling of on-time performance in simple random sample is based on relevant approximation of binomial distribution. Considered approximations are normal distribution, Agresti-Coull approximation and approximation by beta inverse function. The main objective of this paper is calculation of confidence interval by mentioned approximation methods, comparison and assessment of the results from viewpoint of next modelling. The results of on-time probability estimate accuracy are related to input assumptions, i.e. especially geographical coverage of postal services and geographical stratification on disjunctive set of postal areas.

The lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values were obtained with ammonium carbonate and EDTA (0.1% w/v), followed by boric acid, sodium carbonate and sodium metabisulfite (0.25% w/v). The mycelial growth was not affected by medium pH values in the range of 4.0 to 12.0. The most inhibiting salt compounds were then tested for their ability to reduce the arthrospore germination in vitro and sour rot incidence in vivo. The arthrospore germination was completely inhibited by 75 mM EDTA, boric acid, sodium metabisulfite, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate and sodium thiosulfate. Incidence of sour rot was reduced to 25.93% when mandarin fruits where treated with 3% sodium salicylate or boric acid, and to 38.89% when they were treated with 3% EDTA, compared with 100% rotten fruits of the untreated control. These results suggest that sodium salicylate, boric acid and EDTA may be useful compounds to control citrus sour rot, thus being a sustainable alternative to the use of guazatine mainly in organic production.","[Talibi, Idriss; Askarne, Latifa; Boubaker, Hassan; Boudyach, El Hassane; Ait Ben Oumar, Abdellah] Univ Ibn Zohr, Lab Biotechnol & Valorisat Ressources Nat, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Agadir, Morocco",Ibn Zohr University of Agadir,"Talibi, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ibn Zohr, Lab Biotechnol & Valorisat Ressources Nat, Dept Biol, Fac Sci, Agadir, Morocco.",drissdesa@gmail.com,"ASKARNE, Latifa/AFT-3165-2022","ASKARNE, Latifa/0000-0002-3139-2276",,,,,18,3,3,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1577,1583,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600201,0

Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head space was less than 0.5 degrees C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off cycle of the automatic defrosting system. Though temperature probes placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature reached a minimum level of about -0.8 degrees C, near the cold air outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal resistance of fruit boxes, and so making fruits mostly affected by the cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet.","[Tauriello, Antonella; Di Renzo, Giovanni Carlo; Altieri, Giuseppe; Genovese, Francesco] Univ Basilicata UNIBAS, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, Potenza, Italy; [Strano, Maria Concetta; Calandra, Mariarosaria] Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, Italy",University of Basilicata; Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Tauriello, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata UNIBAS, Scuola Sci Agr Forestali Alimentari & Ambientali, Potenza, Italy.",francesco.genovese@unibas.it,"Altieri, Giuseppe/AAD-8290-2022; GENOVESE, FRANCESCO/AAB-7694-2020; Di Renzo, Gian C./P-3819-2017; Strano, Maria Concetta/AFX-9225-2022","Altieri, Giuseppe/0000-0002-2110-0751; GENOVESE, FRANCESCO/0000-0002-9326-1183; Strano, Maria Concetta/0000-0001-7152-5064",,,,,24,2,2,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1685,1692,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600216,0

Local data were collected to characterize Walloon conventional and organic wheat production systems. Two functional units (FU) were investigated: 1 kg of wheat grains at 15% humidity and 1 ha used for wheat cropping. An uncertainty analysis assessed the significance of differences between conventional and organic systems. Using 1 kg of grains as FU, results are not significantly different in global warming and cumulative energy demand. Very highly significant differences for soil acidification and eutrophication, and significant differences for agricultural land occupation were found to be in favor of conventional wheat production. Due to the high yield level in conventional farming (8.5 t/ha at 15% humidity against 4.5 t/ha for organic wheat), organic winter wheat has an equivalent or even, in some impact categories, a higher impact than conventional winter wheat. Using 1 ha as FU, organic production is less impacting than conventional production, except for soil acidification and eutrophication. The choice of the FU has proven to be very sensitive. This study could be improved by accounting for rotation effects, by using more specific models to calculate emissions due to organic and mineral fertilization, and by accounting for carbon storage in soil.

It was also of major concern for the subsequent BIS regulatory policies resulting in Basel III and its request for higher capital requirements. It has now become highly relevant for the planned European banking union. Overleveraging of the banking sector exposes the financial sector and the macroeconomy to vulnerabilities, but also, as critics state, seems to constrain credit flows to the private sector. We present here a measure of overleveraging, defined as the difference between actual and sustainable debt, conduct an empirical study on overleveraging for 40 banks in Europe, and study the vulnerabilities and credit contractions that can arise subsequently. Before the year 2004 overleveraging had not been a serious problem as leverage was on a sustainable level. However, in the run-up to the financial crisis, actual and optimal debt spread apart and the banking sector began to suffer from overleveraging. We use a non-linear Vector STAR model to evaluate the hypothesis that periods of increasing debt levels are accompanied by more severe credit constraints than periods of low leveraging.

General awareness of the environmental consequences of car usage is high but fails to correspond to moderated car use. This paper contributes to an understanding of how university students' environmental beliefs affect decisions to engage in continued car use (persistence) and/or to discontinue or reduce car use (desistance). The aim of the research presented here was to explore the range of neutralizations and counter neutralizations (affirmations) employed by students and to examine the ways in which they are used to justify and maintain either persistence or desistance in car use. The research consisted of six focus group sessions with thirty-four UK-based Higher Education students. Analysis of the study's data highlights the range of neutralizations and counter-neutralizations employed by students in social settings. The article discusses the usefulness of neutralization theory in accounting for actual and/or intended non environmentally friendly behaviour such as car use. In addition, the study's findings are discussed in relation to prior research and to potential implications for public policy interventions which favour moderating car usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of tithes, long-run trends in agricultural output are drawn. After a long period of relative stability, output suffered a severe contraction during 1570-1620, followed by stagnation to 1650, and steady expansion thereafter. Output per head shifted from a relatively high to a low path that persisted until the nineteenth century. The decline in agricultural output per head and per worker from a relatively high level contributed to Spain falling behind and, hence, to the Little Divergence in Europe. Output per worker moved along labour force in agriculture over the long run, supporting the depiction of Spain as a frontier economy. Institutional factors, in a context of financial and monetary instability and war, along climatic anomalies, provide explanatory hypotheses that deserve further research.","[Alvarez-Nogal, Carlos; Prados De La Escsura, Leandro; Santiago-Caballero, Carlos] Univ Carlos III, Madrid, Spain; [Prados De La Escsura, Leandro] CEPR, Madrid, Spain; [Prados De La Escsura, Leandro] CAGE, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Alvarez-Nogal, C (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.",,"Santiago-Caballero, Carlos/B-8204-2011; Nogal, Carlos Alvarez/AAS-5873-2020; PRADOS DE LA ESCOSURA, LEANDRO/H-9476-2015","Nogal, Carlos Alvarez/0000-0002-0175-597X; PRADOS DE LA ESCOSURA, LEANDRO/0000-0002-2362-4305",Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant [ECO2012-38028]; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Our research has been supported by Spain's Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad Grant ECO2012-38028.,,71,15,15,1,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The article begins by identifying the major drawbacks concerning the transposition of prescriptions regarding fiscal federalism to the current E(M)U scenario, with the outlook that this appears to be an extemporaneous solution. It then indicates the alternative conception of an incomplete budgetary union, which is mostly characterized by the setting up of specific insurance mechanisms. These alternative measures are shown to be more realistic and feasible, since they combine path dependency with an innovative appropriation of specific features of the classic federalism model, modifying them to an E(M)U scenario in a heterodox way.","[Cabral, Nazare da Costa] Univ Lisbon, P-1699 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade de Lisboa,"Cabral, ND (通讯作者)，Univ Lisbon, Lisbon Law Sch, Fac Direito, Alameda Univ, P-1649014 Lisbon, Portugal.",nazarecabral@fd.ulisboa.pt,"Cabral, Nazare/AAS-1766-2021",,,,,,61,3,3,0,0,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In our model, a monopolist chooses whether to undertake an investment in energy efficiency, which is not observable by the regulator. We show that, in equilibrium, the monopolist chooses to exert positive effort more often under price cap regulation than under no regulation or mandated target regulation and that she exerts no effort under rate of return regulation. This result contrasts with an extensive literature that focuses on end-user energy conservation and shows that price caps are ineffective for achieving energy efficiency as utilities have an incentive to maximize sales volume. Thus, policies that are designed to promote demand-side energy conservation may diminish the utilities' incentives to pursue supply-side energy efficiency through minimizing network losses.","[Dutra, Joisa] FGV, Ctr Regulat, Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Menezes, Flavio M.; Zheng, Xuemei] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Getulio Vargas Foundation; University of Queensland,"Menezes, FM (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",f.menezes@uq.edu.au,"Saraiva, Joisa Campanher Dutra/AAD-3426-2019; Menezes, Flavio/L-4434-2019","Saraiva, Joisa Campanher Dutra/0000-0001-5970-7324; Menezes, Flavio/0000-0003-0889-9551",AusAid through an ALA Fellowship Award; FGV; Australian Research Council (ARC) [0663768]; Australian Institute of Business and Economics at the University of Queensland; China Scholarship Council; University of Queensland,AusAid through an ALA Fellowship Award; FGV; Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Australian Institute of Business and Economics at the University of Queensland; China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council); University of Queensland(University of Queensland),Dutra and Menezes acknowledge the financial support of AusAid through an ALA Fellowship Award and FGV and Menezes also acknowledges the financial assistance from the Australian Research Council (ARC Grant 0663768).

Participants were divided into a treatment group and a control group (residing <1/2 mile and >1/2 mile from a new light rail transit station, respectively). Self-reported walking (n = 204) and accelerometer-measured physical activity (n = 73) were obtained for both groups before and after the new light rail transit opened. This is the first application of an experimental-control group study design around light rail in California, and one of the first in the U.S. Our panel design provides an opportunity for stronger causal inference than is possible in the much more common study designs that use cross-sectional data. It also provides an opportunity to examine how an individual's previous activity behavior influences the role that new light rail transit access plays in promoting active travel behavior. The results show that, when not controlling for subject's before-opening walking or physical activity, there was no significant relationship between treatment group status and after -opening walking or physical activity. However, when controlling for an interaction between baseline walking physical activity and treatment group membership, we found that living within a half-mile of a transit station was associated with an increase in walking and physical activity for participants who previously had low walking and physical activity levels. The results were opposite for participants with previously high walking and physical activity levels. Future policy and research should consider the possibility that sedentary populations may be more responsive to new transit investments, and more targeted soft approaches in transit service would be needed to encourage people to make healthy travel choices.

Empirical analysis discovers that foreclosures negatively affect capital expenditure investment through the following channels: (1) individual homeowners reduce their capital expenditures when home prices fall and the likelihood of foreclosure increases; (2) lenders pursue a strategy of low investment in real estate owned (REO) inventories; (3) the reductions in capital expenditures generate a negative externality by creating a disincentive for other homeowners to spend on home improvements; and (4) a cluster of foreclosures further worsens the reduced investment situation. Purchasers of REO properties spend more on capital expenditures than those of non-REO properties in 1 year after sales.","[Li, Lingxiao] Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, 201 High St, Farmville, VA 23909 USA",Longwood University,"Li, LX (通讯作者)，Longwood Univ, Coll Business & Econ, 201 High St, Farmville, VA 23909 USA.",lil@longwood.edu,"Yang, Fei/JLM-3367-2023",,,,,,16,2,4,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

I advocate that changes in trade costs affect trade and production structures, which is likely to affect national savings and investment. Explicitly adding trade costs a la Markusen and Venables into Jin's framework, this augmented model predicts that trade cost reductions affect the current account through changes in the industrial structure. Empirical evidence confirms that the interaction of trade costs and capital intensity drives current account balances. I also provide evidence that the response of current accounts to changes in trade costs depends on the capital intensity of production and on the depth of regional agreements on trade and factor mobility. Aside from the direct effect generally emphasised in standard macro-level analysis, changes in production patterns could therefore be an additional channel of impact of regional integration on current accounts.","[Nedoncelle, Clement] Univ Lille, CNRS, LEM UMR 9221, Lille, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Nedoncelle, C (通讯作者)，Univ Lille, CNRS, LEM UMR 9221, Lille, France.",,"Nedoncelle, Clément/P-1021-2019","Nedoncelle, Clément/0000-0001-7828-710X",,,,,28,1,1,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2016,39.0,10.0,,,,,1653,1672,,10.1111/twec.12318,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DZ2LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385673000008,0

We find that new urbanism -type built environment characteristics, including high density, mixed land use, good connectivity, and easy access to public transport systems help reduce transport CO2 emissions. Such mitigating effect is achieved largely through the reduced vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and is enhanced slightly by the more efficient vehicles owned by individuals living in denser and more diverse neighborhoods, all else being equal.

The discussion is motivated by the change in government policy in the UK in April of 1947, when the minimum school leaving age was raised from 14 to 15a change that had a discontinuous impact on the probability of leaving school at age 14 for cohorts who turned 14 around the time of the policy change. We develop a Bayesian fuzzy RD framework that allows us to take advantage of this discontinuity to calculate the effect of an additional year of education on subsequent log earnings for the (latent) class of subjects that complied with the policy change. We illustrate this approach with a new dataset composed from the UK General Household Surveys.

The results indicate that the information have consistent and distinct impacts on travel mode choice by clusters. This consistency is embodied in the simultaneous and significant increase in travel times by green modes (walking, non-powered bicycle, or bus) and in the small but non-significant effects on reducing car use in the three clusters. The distinctness of the impacts is that information have a more effective influence on subjects with gain goal frames because their travel times by all three green modes greatly improved. Subjects with the hedonic goal frame are the least sensitive to information, with the only significant increase in travel times being by non-powered bicycle. This research also addressed the attitude-behavior gap, weather impacts, and goal-oriented prompts. The findings suggest that policy interventions should be designed to improve public transit features, especially the bicycle system, rather than only to constrain car use, and that tailored policies should be targeted to specific groups with different goal frames.

J,"Mouter, N; Chorus, C",,,,"Mouter, Niek; Chorus, Caspar",,,Value of time - A citizen perspective,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRAVEL-TIME; SAVINGS,"The dominant empirical approach to infer Value of Time is based on experiments in which respondents are typically asked to make hypothetical travel choices as if they were paying travel costs from their own budget, in exchange for personal travel time gains. However, many scholars have argued that such travel choice decisions of individuals in their role of consumer of mobility are likely to be a poor proxy of how they in their role of citizen believe government should spend tax money to generate travel time gains for large numbers of travelers. So far, this possible deviation between what we call 'consumer VoT' and 'citizen VoT' has not been studied empirically. In this paper, we fill this gap, by designing a Stated Choice experiment with eight different frames; some representing a typical consumer choice situation, others gradually approaching a citizen perspective. We find that individuals' willingness to pay from previously collected tax money for travel time gains created by a government policy, is significantly higher than their willingness to pay, from their after tax income, for time gains obtained by choosing a different route. This result implies that citizen VoT is higher than consumer VoT. This difference does not stem from a stronger willingness to spend previously collected tax money compared to spending one's own income, but from a difference in the value attached to travel gains: a travel time gain resulting from government action is valued more than the same travel time gain obtained by one's own route choices. This and a range of other empirical results are discussed in depth, in light of the conceptual differences between preferences of individuals in a role of consumer or citizen. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, we show that spot carbon allowances were originally expensive relative to futures, but since late 2008 the situation reversed and spot carbon allowances have been persistently cheap relative to futures prices. This dramatic shift coincides with the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008 and the ongoing European banking crisis of 2010-2013.","[Bredin, Don] Univ Coll Dublin, Finance, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Bredin, Don] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Banking & Finance Subject Area, Dublin 2, Ireland; [Parsons, John] MIT, MIT Sloan Sch Management, Finance, E62-684 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",University College Dublin; University College Dublin; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Bredin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Finance, Dublin 2, Ireland.;Bredin, D (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Banking & Finance Subject Area, Dublin 2, Ireland.",don.bredin@ucd.ie; jparsons@mit.edu,,"Bredin, Don/0000-0003-0018-4025",,,,,36,15,15,0,29,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2016,37.0,3.0,,,,,83,107,,10.5547/01956574.37.3.dbre,0.0,,,25,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DP8OL,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378757400004,0

The setting is China in the 1990's, the most expansive process of urban growth in history. Our empirical results suggest that these geographical factors explain nearly half of the variation in urbanization levels. However, controlling for long-run levels, we find a weakly negative relationship between agricultural land suitability and urban expansion from 1990-2000, which is consistent with the theoretical expectations that rising opportunity costs affect the development of fertile lands. We examine heterogeneity in the effects of geography using interactions with province fixed effects and, even more flexibly, with a localized regression technique (geographically weighted regression). Our results indicate that agricultural land suitability has opposing effects in different regions, for example leading to increased urban expansion in the Pearl River Delta and restricting urban expansion along the northern coast. These results should caution scholars against assuming homogeneous effects of physical geography across regions when doing empirical analysis of urban dynamics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The pairwise Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality tests suggest widely existing leading-lag relationships between housing markets; a unidirectional causal flow from the eastern-central area to western China can be tentatively confirmed. However, there is a lack of sufficient evidence supporting pairwise long-run cointegration and convergence, indicating a diverged interurban housing market in the Pan-PRD. In the short run, the spatial temporal diffusion model manifests the importance of the spillover effect from neighbouring cities in predicting one city's house price changes. Furthermore, the generalized impulse response functions (GIRFs) clearly depict the transmission pattern of shocks to one chosen city. The diffusion pattern is characterized by the fact that the shocks first spread to nearby cities with cities further away taking a longer time to respond. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This has not only hampered the resolution of issues like road congestion, but has also created new ones (e.g. strong social opposition to new train infrastructures). The absence of such strategies highlights the need for long-term transport policies with a wider vision of the issues, since land-based transport cannot be considered from just a technical perspective. The main objective of this article is to implement a participatory integrated approach to facilitate the understanding of land-based passenger transport governance issues on Tenerife, in the Canary Islands. Relevant policy issues and alternatives are identified by the stakeholders involved. The inclusion of stakeholders in the assessment process is crucial to frame transport governance issues appropriately and to define and assess plausible policy alternatives. This assessment process even included a final step of validation of the results by stakeholders to foster discussion among them about transport issues and policy alternatives.

As renewable electricity production is concentrated during a limited number of hours with favourable meteorological conditions and interconnection capacity between France and Germany is limited, increases in production of wind and solar PV in Germany lead to increasing price spreads between the two countries. Our estimates based on a sample of 24 hourly French and German day-ahead prices from November 2009 to June 2013 confirm that renewable electricity production in Germany has a strongly positive impact on price divergence. On the other hand, market coupling, the establishment of a combined order book on the basis of information of both markets, which was introduced in November 2010, can be shown to have mitigated the observed price divergence. Both results have policy relevant implications for welfare and the optimal provision of interconnection capacity.","[Keppler, Jan Horst; Le Pen, Yannick] Univ Paris 09, PSL, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Keppler, Jan Horst; Phan, Sebastien; Le Pen, Yannick] Chaire CEEM, Paris, France; [Phan, Sebastien] Energy Policy Inst, Chicago, IL USA",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine,"Phan, S (通讯作者)，Chaire CEEM, Paris, France.;Phan, S (通讯作者)，Energy Policy Inst, Chicago, IL USA.",jan-horst.keppler@dauphine.fr; sphan@uchicago.edu; yannick.le_pen@dauphine.fr,,,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF; EPEX Spot,Chaire European Electricity Markets (CEEM) of the Paris-Dauphine Foundation; RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX Spot,"The authors would like to thank Audrey Mahuet, Philippe Vassilopoulos and Aymen Salah Abou El-Enien (all with EPEX Spot), Dominique Finon (CNRS and CEEM) as well as three anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that have improved the final version of this paper.

However, previous research has focused on the time-to-build part of the gestation period and has provided little information on the earlier time-to-plan period during which key decisions are made about the project's scope and financing. We develop new estimates of time-to-plan lags for commercial construction projects in the United States, using a large project-level dataset that allows direct measurement of planning lags. We find that these time-to-plan lags are long, averaging about 16 months when we aggregate the projects without regard to size and about 26 months when we weight the projects by their construction cost. The full distribution of time-to-plan lags is very wide, and we relate this variation to the characteristics of the project and its location. In addition, we show that time-to-plan lags lengthened by 3 to 4 months, on average, over our sample period (1999 to 2010). Regulatory factors are associated with the variation in planning lags across locations, and we present anecdotal evidence that links at least some of the lengthening over time to heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Currently, organic consumption has increased almost everywhere and has extended even in countries that were initially producers and suppliers for western countries. Tunisia is one of the countries that have only recently shown an interest in organics. Our objective was therefore to identify organicorganic consumers in Tunisia, carrying out a cluster analysis on a sample of 370 consumers. Five different consumer types were identified. Among them, regular consumers (25%) and promising consumers (36%) revealed the greatest awareness of the benefits related to organic foods and are those who can contribute to expanding the organic market, although marketing innovations are necessary to make organic foods available at affordable prices especially to promising organic consumers.","[Callieris, Roberta] CIHEAM Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, Valenzano, BA, Italy; [Brahim, Sahar] Univ Bonn, Inst Organ Landbau, Bonn, Germany; [Roma, Rocco] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, Dep Agroenvironm Sci, Bari, Italy",CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI; University of Bonn; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Callieris, R (通讯作者)，CIHEAM Mediterranean Agron Inst Bari, Valenzano, BA, Italy.",callieris@iamb.it,"Roma, Rocco/AGE-1180-2022","Roma, Rocco/0000-0001-6329-7321",,,,,34,18,18,0,18,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2016,15.0,2.0,,,,,53,62,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DS1TQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380384000007,0

Cigarette consumption, restaurant alcohol consumption and at-home alcohol consumption fit well with the rational addiction model. Our results suggest that cigarettes and alcohol reinforce each other in consumption, but consumers increase restaurant alcohol consumption when cigarette prices increase. We find that smoking bans increase restaurant alcohol consumption, but decrease at-home alcohol consumption. After a smoking ban is imposed, nonsmokers are likely to stay longer at restaurants and consume more alcohol. On the other hand, when smokers are not allowed to smoke in restaurants, they are likely to compensate for it by increasing restaurant alcohol consumption. As smoking bans increase social drinking habits, a decrease in at-home alcohol consumption is observed. Our results suggest that smoking bans in restaurants or bars must be accompanied by decreased blood alcohol concentration limits and increased road controls so that negative externalities such as fatalities due to drunk driving can be avoided.","[Koksal, Aycan] Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA; [Wohlgenant, Michael K.] N Carolina State Univ, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA",University System of Ohio; Cleveland State University; North Carolina State University,"Koksal, A (通讯作者)，Cleveland State Univ, Dept Econ, Cleveland, OH 44115 USA.",aycankoksa@gmail.com,,,North Carolina Agricultural Research Service,North Carolina Agricultural Research Service,Financial support provided in part by the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service.,,22,6,6,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Qatar is a rich developing country where taxis are widely considered as a public transportation service due to the limited use of the existing bus service and the profoundly dominant use of private car by expats and Qatari locals. The main objective of this research is to identify the quality attributes of the current taxi service. A descriptive analysis relating the demographic, accessibility, and trip purposes to taxi users in general in Doha with overall service satisfaction was conducted. A Structural Equation Model was used to assess the taxi service attributes that influence the users' perceived satisfaction. Two models were developed: one was a relationship between the demographic and satisfaction of the users while the other was between the trip time and the satisfaction of the users. The first model supports the premise that income is the greatest attribute in the demographic followed by marital status, age, and occupation. On the other hand, the latter model demonstrated that waiting time is the most contributing variable among the times spent by taxi users followed by walking from work to a station, journey time, and walking from home to a station.

In two separate experiments, we find that subjects are more risk averse in the limelight. However, risky choices are similarly path dependent in the different treatments. Under both limelight and anonymous laboratory conditions, a simple prospect theory model with a path-dependent reference point provides a better explanation for subjects' behavior than a flexible specification of expected utility theory. In addition, our findings suggest that ambiguity aversion depends on being in the limelight, that passive experience has little effect on risk taking, and that reference points are determined by imperfectly updated expectations.","[Baltussen, Guido] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van den Assem, Martijn J.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Dolder, Dennie] Univ Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; University of Nottingham,"Baltussen, G (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,"van Dolder, Dennie/ABF-8086-2021; van Dolder, Dennie/GQI-2793-2022; van den Assem, Martijn/HNJ-3993-2023","van Dolder, Dennie/0000-0002-2498-8311; van Dolder, Dennie/0000-0002-2498-8311; van den Assem, Martijn/0000-0001-5166-1288",Erasmus University of Rotterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO); Tinbergen Institute; Economic and Social Research Council via the Network for Integrated Behavioral Sciences [ES/K002201/1]; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Erasmus University of Rotterdam; Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO)(Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO)); Tinbergen Institute; Economic and Social Research Council via the Network for Integrated Behavioral Sciences; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We are grateful to Han Bleichrodt, Chen Li, Peter Wakker, and the anonymous reviewers for their constructive and valuable comments.

But under an appropriate choice of a second topology on , the existence of a semicontinuous utility representation on the bitopological space can be ensured (see Remark 1 in the text). On the other hand, the traditional notion of weak utility representation as defined by Peleg (Econometrica 38:93-96, 1970) cannot be used to characterize the generalized optimal choice set, which requires binary relations that allow cycles. The main result in this paper states that for any generalized upper tc-semicontinuous, separable, pairwise spacious and consistent binary relation R defined on a bitopological space and any subset D of X, there exists a utility function which characterizes the generalized optimal choice set of R in D in terms of the maxima of this function.","[Andrikopoulos, Athanasios] Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Epirus, Greece",University of Ioannina,"Andrikopoulos, A (通讯作者)，Univ Ioannina, Dept Econ, Epirus, Greece.",aandriko@cc.uoi.gr,,"Andrikopoulos, Athanasios/0000-0003-2905-7564",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,APR,2016,80.0,4.0,,,,,611,621,,10.1007/s11238-015-9517-9,0.0,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DI1CE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373232800005,0

Strikingly, these documents not only involve disciplining jobseekers to seek work, but to present themselves as an ideal candidate for any job, to become a protean thespian who can act convincingly.

This article explores why they nonetheless continue to hold influence. Drawing on Mannheim, it argues that theories of post-industrial society were originally formulated as utopia - hopeful speculations about the future. When their core concepts are used to describe present conditions, however, they take on the role of ideology, in Mannheim's sense of this term. The ideology of post-industrial society represents a specific world view in relation to work, knowledge and education. It elevates and celebrates knowledge work' and renders invisible existing forms of industry and workers' knowledge necessary for practical work. When the present is viewed through the lens of these theories, practical work is cast as the work of yesterday and the people who do it as yesterday's people.","[Vogt, Kristoffer Chelsom] Univ Bergen, Dept Sociol, Rosenbergsgaten 39, N-5015 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Vogt, KC (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, Dept Sociol, Rosenbergsgaten 39, N-5015 Bergen, Norway.",kristoffer.vogt@sos.uib.no,,,,,,,59,16,21,0,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It draws on Robert Putnam's two-level game approach and Foreign Policy Analysis to develop a model of a three-level informal ratification game. This adds value to existing approaches by capturing the contested nature of government preferences and delineating the causal mechanisms through which domestic groups shape international negotiations. The model is used to explain the UK's pivotal role in the reform of bank capital requirements in the European Union (EU). It demonstrates that governments are able to take advantage of a narrowing domestic win-set' by marginalising the influence of industry and building political momentum for regulatory reform. In particular, the paper shows how UK negotiators were able to exploit the increased domestic costs of agreement and synergistic strategies between negotiations to successfully oppose the maximum harmonisation of capital rules across the EU.","[James, Scott] Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"James, S (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept Polit Econ, Polit Econ, London WC2R 2LS, England.",scott.james@kcl.ac.uk,,"James, Scott/0000-0002-4632-9288",ESRC [ES/K001019/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K001019/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,38,18,18,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In our Bayesian graphical VAR (BGVAR) model, the contemporaneous and temporal causal structures of the structural VAR model are represented by two different graphs. We also provide an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate jointly the two causal structures and the parameters of the reduced-form VAR model. The BGVAR approach is shown to be quite effective in dealing with model identification and selection in multivariate time series of moderate dimension, as those considered in the economic literature. In the macroeconomic application the BGVAR identifies the relevant structural relationships among 20 US economic variables, thus providing a useful tool for policy analysis. The financial application contributes to the recent econometric literature on financial interconnectedness. The BGVAR approach provides evidence of a strong unidirectional linkage from financial to non-financial super-sectors during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and a strong bidirectional linkage between the two sectors during the 2010-2013 European sovereign debt crisis.

We estimate consumers' willingness-to-pay and compensating variation (CV) for improvements in vehicle attributes, also taking taste differences in the population into account by applying a latent class model with 6 distinct consumer segments. Our results indicate that about 1/3 of the consumers are oriented towards at least one AFV option, with almost half of them being AFV-affine, showing a high probability of choosing AFVs despite their current shortcomings. Our results suggest that German car buyers' willingness-to-pay for improvements of the various vehicle attributes varies considerably across consumer groups and that the vehicle features have to meet some minimum requirements for considering AFVs. The CV values show that decision-makers in the administration and industry should focus on the most promising consumer group of 'AFV aficionados' and their needs. It also shows that some vehicle attribute improvements could increase the demand for AFVs cost-effectively, and that consumers would accept surcharges for some vehicle attributes at a level which could enable their private provision and economic operation (e.g. fast-charging infrastructure). Improvement of other attributes will need governmental subsidies to compensate for insufficient consumer valuation (e.g. battery capacity). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using nationally representative longitudinal data from the last six confidential master files (2000/2001-2010/2011) of the National Population Health Survey, we examine the association between obesity and employment participation and earnings among working-age adults in Canada. After controlling for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, lifestyle factors and time-invariant individual heterogeneity, our results show that obesity is not significantly associated with employment participation but is associated with reduced hourly wage rate and annual income among women by about 4% and 4.5%, respectively. The corresponding results for men show that obesity is associated with about 2% reduction in wage rate and income, but significant at 10% level. However, after controlling for the potential reverse causality bias using the lagged measure of obesity, the effect of obesity on wage rate and income became positive or statistically non-significant. Our findings suggest that obesity is not causally associated with negative labour market outcomes among working-age men in Canada. For working-age women, we find limited evidence of negative labour market outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Larose, Samantha L.; Kpelitse, Koffi A.; Campbell, M.

Three equilibrium solutions are studied.

I study the interactions between ambiguity preferences on one side and equilibrium properties on the other. I show how the equilibrium concepts differ, computing necessary and sufficient conditions for existence and equivalence. I also show how these solution concepts fare against two fundamental principles of Nash equilibrium in standard games: the principle of indifference and the reduction principle. Given both are central to the computation of Nash equilibrium in games with Expected Utility players, their failure indicates how relaxing the Expected Utility hypothesis may disrupt standard game theoretic results such as the characterization of equilibria in two-player games.","[Beauchene, Dorian] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econom Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics,"Beauchêne, D (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, Ctr Econom Sorbonne, 106-112 Bd Hop, F-75013 Paris, France.",dorianbeauchene@gmail.com,,,"Agence Nationale de la Recherche [ANR-10-LABX-93, ANR-12-FRAL-0008-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-FRAL-0008] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)",Agence Nationale de la Recherche(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"Many thanks to Pierre Fleckinger, Francoise Forges, Frederic Koessler, Eduardo Perez-Richet, Ludovic Renou, Jean-Marc Tallon, Vassili Vergopoulos, the participants of the Games and Ambiguity workshop at PSE in June 2013 and the anonymous referees for their numerous comments and advices.

In particular, it explores whether tourism is becoming part of the lifestyle of Italians or whether it is still a luxury good only for the privileged. A Heckman model was used on micro-data on Italian family expenditure over the period 1997-2007, and an income elasticity analysis for different personal and household characteristics was carried out. The results show that participation in the tourism market is strongly affected by the personal characteristics of individuals and that tourism consumption is an income-sensitive good. The analysis reveals that tourism is generally a luxury good. Income elasticity analysis shows both similarities as well as differences in Italian tourism consumption patterns at national and international levels. The authors find that consumption behaviour in tourism is affected not only by economic constraints but also by cultural and territorial factors.","[Bernini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Dept Stat Sci, Via Belle Arti 41, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Bernini, Cristina] Univ Bologna, Ctr Adv Studies Tourism, Via Anghera 22, I-47921 Rimini, Italy; [Cracolici, Maria Francesca] Dept Econ Business & Stat, Vle Sci Ed 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Bologna,"Cracolici, MF (通讯作者)，Dept Econ Business & Stat, Vle Sci Ed 13, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",mariafrancesca.cracolici@unipa.it,,,University of Palermo,University of Palermo,The authors wish to thank Miranda Cuffaro and an anonymous referee for their constructive comments.

They are less expensive to build and less demanding from the computational viewpoint with respect to schedule-based (SB) models, as they require neither explicit simulation of the timetable (on the supply side), nor segmentation of OD matrices by desired departure/arrival time (on the demand side). The objective of this paper is to assess to what extent the lack of modeling capabilities of FB models is acceptable, and, on the other hand, the cases in which such approximations are substantial and more detailed SB models are needed. This is a first attempt to shed light on the trade-off between (frequency-based) model inaccuracy and (scheduled-based) model development costs in the field of long-distance (e.g. High-speed Rail, HSR) service modeling. To this aim, we considered two modeling specifications estimated using mixed Revealed Preferences (RP) and Stated Preferences (SP) surveys and validated with respect to the same case study. Starting from an observed (baseline) scenario, we artificially altered the demand distributions (uniform vs. time-varying demand) and the supply configuration (i.e. train departure times), and analyzed the differences in modal split estimates and flows on individual trains, using the two different model specifications. It resulted that when the demand distribution is uniform within the period of analysis, such differences are significant only when departure times of trains are strongly unevenly spaced in time. In such cases, the difference in modal shares, using FB w.r.t. SB, is in the range of [0%, +5%] meaning that FB models tend to overestimate HSR modal shares. When the demand distribution is not uniform, the difference in modal shares, using FB w.r.t. SB, is in the range of [-10%, +10%] meaning that FB models can overestimate or underestimate HSR modal shares, depending on timetable settings with respect to travelers' desired departure times. The differences in on-board train flow estimates are more substantial in both cases of uniform and not uniform demand distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

After decades of existence, the evidence as to the extent to which preferential schemes have been genuinely effective in increasing exports is mixed. This paper evaluates the impact of the European Union's (EU) unilateral preferential regimes on the exports of developing countries using a bilateral gravity model at the product level. We use a unique dataset that allows us to determine the actual tariff rate paid by each export flow at the product level (combined nomenclature CN-10 digits) to the EU and the preferential regime of entry. This allows us to accurately specify the impact of each trade regime and to properly address the issue of utilisation and non-utilisation of trade preferences. The most important findings of the paper are that unilateral preferences have been effective in increasing exports to the EU both as a result of the direct effect of lower tariffs and positive preference margin, and because of secondary effects associated with the preference regimes; although the outcome of these secondary effects depends on the margin of trade considered.","[Cirera, Xavier] World Bank, Trade & Competitiveness, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Foliano, Francesca] Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Gasiorek, Michael] Univ Sussex, Dept Econ, Brighton BN1 9SL, E Sussex, England",The World Bank; University of Kent; University of Sussex,"Foliano, F (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",xcirera@worldbank.org; ff57@kent.ac.uk; M.Gasiorek@sussex.ac.uk,,"Foliano, Francesca/0000-0003-0145-3434",European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"We would like to thank the associate editor, one anonymous referee, Alan Winters, Barry Reilly and the participants at the CESIfo conference on The Estimation of Gravity Models of Bilateral Trade May 2014 for their helpful comments and suggestions.

However, little attention has been paid so far to measuring the contribution of longer coexistence time to living standards. For that purpose, we develop a measure of coexistence time-the joint life expectancy-which quantifies the average duration of existence for a group of persons. Then, using a lifecycle model with risky lifetime, we construct an equivalent consumption measure incorporating gains in single and joint life expectancies. An empirical application to France (1820-2010) shows that, assuming independent individual mortality risks, the rise in joint life expectancies contributed to improve standards of living significantly. We examine the robustness of that result to the introduction of dependent mortality risks using copulas, and we show that equivalent consumption patterns are robust to introducing risk dependence.","[Ponthiere, Gregory] Univ Paris East ERUDITE, 48 Blvd Jourdan,Bldg A,Off 202, F-75014 Paris, France; [Ponthiere, Gregory] Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan,Bldg A,Off 202, F-75014 Paris, France",Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Universite PSL; Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS); Paris School of Economics,"Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Univ Paris East ERUDITE, 48 Blvd Jourdan,Bldg A,Off 202, F-75014 Paris, France.;Ponthiere, G (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan,Bldg A,Off 202, F-75014 Paris, France.",gregory.ponthiere@ens.fr,,,ANR Equirisk (Equity in Risky Intertemporal Economic Environments) [ANR-12-INEG-0006-01],ANR Equirisk (Equity in Risky Intertemporal Economic Environments)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),G.

If a potential buyer cannot be assured of having constantly-available and compatible charging stations, they will not purchase an EV. To increase the sales of EVs through improved charger availability, this paper examines parking configurations, charger design, convenient EV only parking, free charging, etiquette in unplugging another's vehicle, and legislation. Data were derived from academic publications, trade market press, conversations, personal observations, and laws. The results show that chargers are often in a lot's corner and thus accessible only to one vehicle, EV owners leave their charged car in the space, drivers use EV spaces for parking, etiquette cards are not understood, and legislation makes it illegal to unplug another's EV. Improvements include less convenient charger spots, an octopus charger in the middle of the parking lot, modest charging fees to foster turnover, chargers that indicate an EV is charged, education and legislation about etiquette cards, and legislation that allows an individual to unplug another's charged EV. Improvements to charging should be implemented simultaneously to lessen range anxiety and realize the environmental benefits from reductions in gasoline consumption and mobile source air pollution.

Pigou's argument for wealth redistribution from a powerful objection. The objection is based on the unprovability of statements making interpersonal comparisons of utility. Galbraith's dependence effect theory allows him to present a version of the Pigovian argument that requires no such statements to be made. I argue that Galbraith's main piece of advocacy in The Affluent Society was for income redistribution, despite the fact that he claimed to be in favour of greater spending in the public sector rather than redistribution as such. I then show how my reading of the dependence effect theory helps to defend it against objections from Hayek and Rothbard. I end by discussing what improvements in economics a proper test of the theory would require and showing how my reading of it helps to reveal the ongoing importance of The Affluent Society to the understanding of political economy.","[Douglas, Alexander] Univ London, Heythrop Coll, Dept Philosophy, London WC1E 7HU, England",University of London; University of London Heythrop College,"Douglas, A (通讯作者)，Univ London, Heythrop Coll, Dept Philosophy, London WC1E 7HU, England.",a.douglas@heythrop.ac.uk,,,,,,,57,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

However, the nature, location and maturity of ORE have led to several legal and policy challenges which condition the success of these industries. Even though the ability to generate electricity from marine renewables is not in question, since technology is moving ahead of policy, its integration in wider energy networks might be problematic given the localised nature of the resources, and the high variability/low predictability of their output over multiple timescales. Limited practical experience with the deployment of these technologies coupled with the difficulty of studying the marine environment represent barriers to acquiring knowledge on their impacts, particularly wave and tidal energy. These data gaps are amplified by underdeveloped regulatory frameworks regarding marine planning and sitting processes, including Environmental Impact Assessment, not adapted to manage uncertainty, and often making it too difficult for potential developers to get consent and thus invest. As part of EU's Blue Growth Strategy, ORE's demand for exclusive rights over resources and a marine space creates potential conflicts by entering already congested oceans, traditionally regulated in a single-sector manner for different marine activities. Previously proposed solutions to these constraints have failed to acknowledge the combined importance of all types of environmental policy instruments: evolving legal frameworks, targets and commitments; practical differences in domestic implementation of regulation, market-based and suasive instruments; and fragmentation of institutional architectures associated with constantly evolving actor networks operating for ORE governance. Studying policy instrument mixes might demonstrate the changing roles of state and societal actors, and ultimately contribute for the debate surrounding the sustainability and governance transition to renewable energy.","[Guerra, Flavia] Univ Hull, Sch Law & Polit, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England",University of Hull,"Guerra, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Law & Polit, Kingston Upon Hull, N Humberside, England.",F.Guerra@2015.hull.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,0,0,0,10,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,529,540,,,,,,12,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400054,0

In recent years, a variety of activities undertaken by these organizations focuses on the idea of sustainable development and preservation of the cultural heritage and environmental protection. In the case of cruise tourism market, the natural environment of the seas and oceans and also coastal tourist destinations handling the cruise ships and passengers are subjects of the protection. In the cruise tourism sector, there are a great number of entities whose members are among the others: cruise ship-owners, tourist agents, the boards of seaports and local authorities of coastal destinations. Their objective is to develop the cruise tourism market, to promote marine voyages and tourist values of coastal destinations, but first of all to generate the largest economic revenues. However, the international law regulations regarding environmental protection of the sea and oceans and applicable standards of the CSR enforce on those entities to work out solutions for the sustainable development. The purpose of this work is to identify the entities working for the sustainable development of cruise tourism and to evaluate their commitment in this regard. The research is based on the analysis of scientific papers and reports and also source materials of leading organizations. In this study, a few methods of data collection were applied, i.e.. desk research. method, exploratory method and also a deductive reasoning.

The main goal of this article is to analyze the demographic situation in Poland in the context of the country's economic development. The article sets a taxonomic measure of development depicting the demographic situation as well as a measure of economic development for 66 sub-regions (NUTS-3) on the basis of selected diagnostic variables in the period 2004-2012. This allowed to assess the demographic situation in Poland in relation to the level of economic development of individual regions.

In the last years the whole consumption in the country is falling. This might be the reason why the Energy Regulatory Office suggests completely new conditions for the households connected with the electricity price. The current annual cost of the electricity are influenced mainly by the height of the annual consumption. But the new suggestion gives more importance to the circuit breaker.

The power spectrum, obtained from the time series as a Fourier transform of the autocovariance function, gives detailed information about the time structure of the process. The information content of the power spectrum is the same as the autocovariance, however these functions expose different aspects of the correlation structure of the time series. It has been shown that the spectral analysis may reveal hidden periodicities in the studied data. Thus for practical purposes the spectrum might be the more useful parameter than the autocovariance function itself. Since the key issue in VaR model evaluation is to check for time dependence in the residual VaR failure series, the backtesting procedure may be based on the power spectrum instead of the autocovariance function. The study investigated statistical properties of the spectral VaR tests. The test evaluation was based on the Monte Carlo experiments designed in such a way that they reflect the volatility clustering phenomenon. The study showed that spectral VaR tests outperform the commonly used Markov test in detecting incorrect risk models.","[Malecka, Marta] Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, Rewolucji 1905 R 41-43, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland",University of Lodz,"Malecka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lodz, Dept Stat Methods, Rewolucji 1905 R 41-43, PL-90214 Lodz, Poland.",marta.malecka@uni.lodz.pl,"Małecka, Marta/IQS-4345-2023",,,,,,17,0,0,0,1,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,102,109,,,,,,8,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000011,0

For doing so we use a stylized economic model that differentiates between real-time and flat-rate pricing and is loosely calibrated on German market data. Counter-intuitively, we find that distortions through induced negative prices do not reduce the net consumer surplus of the FiP relative to the CP. Rather, the FiP performs better under all assumptions considered. The reason is that increased use of renewables under the FiP, particularly in periods of negative prices, leads to a reduction of required renewable capacity and respective costs. This effect dominates larger deadweight losses of consumer surplus generated by the FiP compared to the CP. Furthermore, surplus gains experienced by consumers who switch from flat-rate to real-time pricing are markedly higher under the FiP, which might be interpreted as greater incentives to enable such switching. While our findings are primarily of theoretical nature and the full range of implications of negative prices needs to be carefully considered, we hope that our analysis makes policy-makers more considerate of their potential benefits.","[Pahle, Michael; Gambardella, Christian; Tietjen, Oliver] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany; [Schill, Wolf-Peter] German Inst Econ Res DIW Berlin, Mohrenstr 58, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Pahle, M (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, D-14473 Potsdam, Germany.",michael.pahle@pik-potsdam.de; wschill@diw.de,"Schill, Wolf-Peter/V-8221-2017; Schill, Wolf-Peter/P-8179-2019","Schill, Wolf-Peter/0000-0002-6981-7487; Schill, Wolf-Peter/0000-0002-6981-7487; Tietjen, Oliver/0000-0002-5164-1938",Stiftung Mercator; Agora Energiewende,Stiftung Mercator; Agora Energiewende,We thank the participants of the Berlin Conference on Energy and Electricity Economics 2015 and three anonymous referees for excellent comments.

Linguistic approximation is a tool to stress, modify or effectively convey meaning. As such it is an important yet neglected area of research in management science and decision support. During the last forty years a large number of different methods for linguistic approximation were proposed. In this paper we investigate in detail the linguistic approximation method proposed by Bonissone (1979). We focus on its performance under different fit measures in its second step - we consider various distance and similarity measures of fuzzy sets to choose the most appropriate linguistic approximation. We conduct a numerical study of the performance of this linguistic approximation method, present its results and discuss the impact of a particular choice of a fit measure.","[Talasek, Tomas; Stoklasa, Jan; Talasova, Jana] Palacky Univ, Krizkovskeho 8, Olomouc, Czech Republic; [Talasek, Tomas] Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta, Finland",Palacky University Olomouc; Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Talásek, T (通讯作者)，Palacky Univ, Krizkovskeho 8, Olomouc, Czech Republic.;Talásek, T (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Skinnarilankatu 34, Lappeenranta, Finland.",tomas.talasek@upol.cz; jan.stoklasa@upol.cz; jana.talasova@upol.cz,"Talášek, Tomáš/E-3464-2017; Talašová, Jana/N-9789-2017; Stoklasa, Jan/O-5858-2016","Talášek, Tomáš/0000-0001-8632-4599; Talašová, Jana/0000-0002-1903-170X;",,,,,11,3,3,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,845,850,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500145,0

The initial quota allocation is one of the key points in its design, which includes the initial quota allocation criterion and allocation method. In this paper, we analyze the regional macroeconomic impacts of emissions trading in China under different quota allocation criteria and allocation methods using a multiregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The results show that the Ability-to-Pay criterion is better than the other criteria, as it can lead to fewer macroeconomic costs and welfare losses; narrow the economic gap between the eastern, central and western regions; and guide investment into the western regions. Comparing free allocation and auction, it is determined that free allocation leads to lower macroeconomic costs, while auction is better at adjusting the industrial structure. This indicates that a hybrid allocation method is preferable.","[Wu, Jie; Xia, Yan] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Policy & Management, Ctr Energy & Environm Policy Res, Beijing 100190, Peoples R China; [Fan, Ying] Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Sciences; CAS Institutes of Science & Development; Beihang University,"Fan, Y (通讯作者)，Beihang Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100191, Peoples R China.",sus.anjie@hotmail.com; ying_fan@263.net; xiayan@casipm.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71210005, 71203213]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71210005 and No. 71203213) is acknowledged.

The OLS estimates suggest that a one standard deviation increase in father's or mother's BMI is associated with an increase of around 20% in child's Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score. These estimates decrease to around 14% when we control for family fixed effects. We examine the heterogeneity of this BMI intergenerational transmission process across family income, parental occupation and poverty status and also find this intergenerational correlation tends to be higher among children of higher BMI levels, though this tendency becomes weaker as children approach adulthood.

Yet, this paradox is not well known among researchers in economy. In this article, we present several real-world examples of Simpson's paradox in economic statistics, including gross domestic product (GDP) growth and per capita GDP growth aggregations across developing and developed countries. These manifestations of Simpson's paradox highlight some important issues in developing economies and have implications on social and economic policies. We also present Simpson's paradox for continuous variables, and its relationship with ecological correlation using empiric economic data. We show that failure to recognize Simpson's paradox and ecological correlation can cause inaccurate interpretations of economic data. Furthermore, even when one recognizes Simpson's paradox in the data, one may still make wrong interpretations, wrong policy decisions, or business decisions. We recommend causal analysis to discern the confounding variable(s) and to apply sound statistical modeling in the face of such a paradox.","Schlumberger, 1675 Broadway,Suite 900, Denver, CO 80202 USA",Schlumberger,"Ma, YZ (通讯作者)，Schlumberger, 1675 Broadway,Suite 900, Denver, CO 80202 USA.",yzeema3@yahoo.com,,,,,,,30,3,4,0,27,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The Philippine aviation industry had its safety status downgraded to Category 2 for six years by the International Civil Aviation Organization and the US Federal Aviation Administration. This downgrading of the status severely limited Philippine Airlines from expanding internationally, but its reinstatement provides huge opportunities for the incumbent. However, in the domestic and regional markets it faces a threat from rapidly encroaching low-cost carriers. The Philippines has the highest domestic low-cost carrier penetration rate in the world, while the incumbent has rebranded its low-cost subsidiary, AirPhil, to a full-service carrier, PAL Express, which has impacted its ability to compete in short-haul markets. Philippine Airlines' new routes to the Middle East and Europe have the potential to be profitable, but their success is hampered by the lack of domestic connectivity and no feeder traffic from partner airlines.","[O'Connell, John F.] Cranfield Univ, Sch Engn, Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House,Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England; [Vanoverbeke, Karel] Network Planning Dept, Doha, Qatar",Cranfield University,"O'Connell, JF (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Engn, Ctr Air Transport Management, Martell House,Univ Way, Cranfield MK43 0TR, Beds, England.",frankie.oconnell@cranfield.ac.uk; kvanoverbeke@qatarairways.com.qa,,,,,,,31,3,3,1,9,I P PUBLISHING LTD,LONDON,"258 BELSIZE RD, LONDON NW6 4BT, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In 2013, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government issued a consultation paper, seeking public comments on three toll-change proposals that would raise the CHT's tolls and lower the EHC's tolls. The WHC's tolls would remain unchanged due to its congested connecting roads. Using monthly crossing data available from the HKSAR's Transport Department for 2000-2012, this paper uses a Generalized Leontief demand system to document that the usage patterns of the three tunnels is price-responsive. Hence, we conclude that the proposed toll changes are likely to be effective in transportation demand management, by shifting a portion of the CHT's usage to the EHC and WHC, thereby relieving the CHT's congestion.

Focusing on international pharmacovigilance, it recounts the history of the World Health Organization programme for the international drug monitoring, to shed light and explain the concomitant rise of the International Conference on Harmonization and of its standards. It shows that the neoliberalization of a regime or installation of a regulatory standard-setting arrangement responsibilizing the industry is inseparable from the emergence of an altogether different way of regulating pharmaceuticals (including a different definition of the problem of pharmaceuticals safety, of the organizations in charge of this problem and of the kinds of expertise and information used to make decisions about it). This happens incrementally, through gradual changes and hybridization of the existing regime, much more than all-out replacement of the regime. The rise of a market-oriented regulatory arrangement can therefore not be reduced to the influence of a neoliberal scheme, but is on the contrary linked to the ways in which a tool gains legitimacy as a way of tackling a global issue.","[Demortain, David] INRA, UMR 1326, Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Innovat Soc, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France",Universite Gustave-Eiffel; INRAE,"Demortain, D (通讯作者)，INRA, UMR 1326, Lab Interdisciplinaire Sci Innovat Soc, F-77454 Marne La Vallee, France.",,"Demortain, David/AAA-4786-2022","Demortain, David/0000-0001-9544-7507",Institut Francilien Recherche Innovation Societe (IFRIS),Institut Francilien Recherche Innovation Societe (IFRIS),"I would like to thank Christian Bonah, Soraya Boudia, Jean-Paul Gaudilliere, Boris Hauray, Emmanuel Henry, Nils Kessel, Anne Rasmussen and David Vogel, with whom the present study was discussed at various stages of its development.

It puts forward the thesis that this ideal worker is best understood as an abstraction that achieves practical truth', that is, as a hypostasized practice or a real abstraction'. Hence, this management ideology exceeds strictly discursive dimensions. The analysis points to an enactment at the level of work practice prior to any explicit articulation of this ideology. Analysis attends to positioning on collective action, the identity work this positioning entailed and the truth' of nursing summoned therein, pointing to the ubiquity of the ideal worker in nursing along with its practical enactment.","[Granberg, Magnus] Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, Sociol, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden",Mid-Sweden University,"Granberg, M (通讯作者)，Mid Sweden Univ, Dept Social Sci, Holmgatan 10, S-85170 Sundsvall, Sweden.",magnus.granberg@miun.se,,,Swedish Research Council [344-2011-5104],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"This research received funding from the Swedish Research Council, reg. 344-2011-5104.",,32,10,10,0,13,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This study aims to evaluate the impact of a household head's telecommuting on household travel while controlling for the interdependence within a household and across travel purposes, by applying seemingly unrelated censored regression models to data from the 2006 Household Travel Survey in the Seoul Metropolitan Area. In terms of vehicle kilometers traveled, the analysis shows that telecommuters' non-commute and non-work trips as well as his/her household members' non-work trips are greater than those of non-telecommuters and their household members', whereas telecommuting partially reduces commuting trips. However, an analysis stratified by household type reveals that the difference for household members is significant only in households with less than one vehicle per employed member: in such households (with insufficient vehicles available), the vehicle otherwise used for mandatory travel, such as for the household head's commute, can be used for non-commute purposes or by other household members if the household head does not use it for commuting. This implies that, when vehicle travel budgets of a given household are limited, this compensatory travel mechanism can make optimum use of limited resources (i.e., vehicles), but offsets the travel-substituting effect of telecommuting. Accordingly, to more precisely estimate the impact of telecommuting-promotion policies and apply them as part of travel demand management strategies, their counteracting effects among household members should be considered.

Estimates based on register panel data of Swedish households covering the period 1992 to 2011 produce significant but relatively small net-of-tax rate elasticities. The results vary with family type, with the largest elasticities obtained for single males and the smallest for married/cohabitant females. Despite these seemingly small elasticities, evaluation of the effects of a reduced state tax using a microsimulation model shows that the effort effect matters. The largest effect is due to changes in number of working hours yet including the effort effect results in an almost self-financed reform. As a reference to the earlier literature, we also estimate taxable income elasticities. As expected, these are larger than for the hourly wage rates. However, both specifications produce significantly and positive income effects. One contribution is related to the definition of the instruments used to solve the well-known problem of endogeneity.","[Ericson, Peter] Empirica, S-11826 Stockholm, Sweden; [Flood, Lennart] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden; [Islam, Nizamul] CEPS INSTEAD, L-4364 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",University of Gothenburg,"Flood, L (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Sch Business Econ & Law, Vasagatan 1,POB 640, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",peter.ericson@empirica.se; Lennart.Flood@handels.gu.se; Nizamul.Islam@ceps.lu,,"Islam, Nizamul/0000-0002-1152-8623",Confederation of Swedish Enterprise; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond; Ragnar Soderbergs Stiftelse,Confederation of Swedish Enterprise; Riksbankens Jubileumsfond(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences); Ragnar Soderbergs Stiftelse,"Financial support from the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, Riksbankens Jubileumsfond and Ragnar Soderbergs Stiftelse is gratefully acknowledged.",,36,4,4,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Our empirical study on the Chinese domestic market suggests that Spring adopts a cream skimming strategy to enter high-priced routes, allowing the carrier to achieve both a very high load factor and considerable profitability. Spring's capacity and market share on individual routes are constrained to low levels, likely due to government regulation and/or a puppy dog strategy adopted by the carrier. As a result, Spring is able to achieve fast growth without triggering price wars. To incumbent full service carriers, high speed rail (HSR) services impose much more significant competitive pressure than low cost carriers. Similar to LCCs in developed markets, Spring prefers to serve markets with high traffic volumes out of its operational base in Shanghai. Overall, Spring's entry decision is not significantly affected by competition, either from full service airlines or HSR services.

Yet, while the behaviour of elected representatives during roll call votes has been widely analyzed, we know little about how parliamentarians act when their individual voting choices are not made public. This paper explores the relationship between voting procedures and the likelihood that Members of the European Parliament prioritize the interests of their EP party group versus the interests of their national party. Using an original survey, I find that MEPs are more likely to prioritize the interests of their national party over those of their EP party group when voting by show of hands or electronically, as opposed to by roll call. Moreover, this voting procedure effect is particularly salient among MEPs elected from 2004/07 accession countries.","[Trumm, Siim] Univ Sheffield, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Trumm, S (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Polit, Elmfield Bldg,Northumberland Rd, Sheffield S10 2TU, S Yorkshire, England.",s.trumm@sheffield.ac.uk,,"Trumm, Siim/0000-0002-2508-3346",,,,,44,8,10,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The class of discounted Shapley values contains the Shapley value and equal division solution as its extreme cases.

In Chile LAN is the dominant airline in domestic markets and the only one that has a frequent flyer program (FFP); it faces some competition from two small carriers. Using a unique dataset for Chile, collected by ourselves from airlines websites in 2011 and 2012, we estimate the impact of the dominant airline FFP. For this purpose, we compare for each route the fares between airlines and between weekday trios (that accumulate full miles and are mainly for business purposes) and weekend trips (that accumulate less than full miles and are mainly for leisure purposes). The results show that the differential premium LAN is able to charge for weekday trips due to the FFP is around 35%. Three particularities of the Chilean market help the econometric identification: there is only one hub for all airlines (the capital city of Santiago), there is no business class in domestic flights, and none of the airlines is a low-cost carrier.

We examine leverage effects in public real estate markets across eight countries with active public real estate markets. Cross-country public real estate markets provide an interesting testing ground given the significant use of leverage in real estate markets, the variation in REIT capital structures within and across countries, and the cross-country differences in liquidity, ownership, economic, institutional, and capital market structures. After carefully isolating leverage effects in firm-level returns, we find that leverage has a significant effect on returns both unconditionally and conditionally using standard asset pricing models.

In the data, firms' market shares drop precipitously at the border. We find that 40% to 50% of the gap can be attributed to national border costs.

However, there has been no research on the exact nature and impact of using various self-monitoring solutions (e.g. cycle computer, cadence monitor, smartphone' physical activity apps) amongst cyclists. Initially, an online survey was conducted with 227 adults who did or did not use self-monitoring solutions with their cycling. We found that the most important features for cyclists who use self-monitoring are: time it takes to travel, cycling speed, and distance covered. In contrast, cyclists who do not use self-monitoring perceived features related to location (e.g. directions with maps) as the most important ones. In a subsequent study we included self-monitoring solutions as a part of mixed-design, small-scale, longitudinal intervention aimed at changing transportation patterns. We found that self-monitoring is mainly suitable for performance oriented cyclists rather then recreational cyclists. We discuss the implications of those results for designing interventions to promote cycling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To overcome this challenge, we estimate a migration choice model to measure the willingness to pay for reduced segregation. The key idea underlying our empirical approach is that if segregation is undesirable, migrants should be willing to give up some earnings to avoid living in segregated cities. Using decennial census data from 1980 to 2000, we provide evidence that segregation is an urban disamenity. It is shown that both black and white migrants prefer to live in less segregated cities. For example, for a one percentage point reduction in the dissimilarity index, the estimated marginal willingness to pay of blacks is $436 (in 1999 dollars) in 2000. Among whites, this marginal willingness to pay is $301. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To modernize Moroccan agriculture, the Moroccan government has launched a ten-year programme: the Plan Maroc Vert (PMV), which encourages the creation of farmers' cooperatives or associations. The first PMV results indicate that farmers are reluctant to cooperate. The goal of this paper was to explore the ability of farmers to cooperate: what conditions are needed to develop cooperation? We mainly focused on organizational learning and conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with farmers, cooperative workers and development agents in and around Sebaa Ayoune, near Meknes. We investigated the obstacles to cooperation and the factors affecting the long-term sustainability of cooperatives, identifying eight types of cooperative learning.

This effect has been labeled the spillover effect. In this study, the existence of direct and spillover effects of road, railway, airport and seaport infrastructure projects is tested by estimating a production function. Together with this primary objective, two common concerns in the literature are addressed: the lack of theoretical foundations for spatial econometrics models and the likely endogenous relationship between transport infrastructure and economic development. The estimated production function takes the form of a Spatial Durbin Model and is estimated using panel data from the 47 peninsular Spanish provinces by alternatively applying a Maximum Likelihood estimator and Instrumental Variables/Generalized Method of Moments estimators. According to the estimates, road transport infrastructure positively affects the output of the region in which the infrastructure is located and its neighboring provinces, while the remaining modes of transportation projects cause no significant impacts on average.

This article challenges the virtuousness of such uniformity in the case of EU rule of law promotion in the neighbourhood and examines the parameters of the possible and the necessary. The findings reveal that variation in EU rule of law conceptions is inherent to the EU approach and inevitable due to the nature of the rule of law concept and the studied political context. Moreover, this variation in itself does not entail incoherence of EU rule of law promotion, as a shared understanding of the core meaning of the rule of law frames EU efforts across cases, and is even desirable for effective rule of law promotion, under law and development theory and practice.","[Burlyuk, Olga] Univ Ghent, CEUS, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Burlyuk, O (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Polit Sci, CEUS, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",olga.burlyuk@ugent.be,"Burlyuk, Olga/HRA-2914-2023; Burlyuk, Olga/H-6686-2019","Burlyuk, Olga/0000-0002-7477-1655; Burlyuk, Olga/0000-0002-7477-1655",,,,,50,10,10,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

However, their dense parameterization leads to unstable inference and inaccurate out-of-sample forecasts, particularly for models with many variables. A solution to this problem is to use informative priors in order to shrink the richly parameterized unrestricted model toward a parsimonious nave benchmark, and thus reduce estimation uncertainty. This paper studies the optimal choice of the informativeness of these priors, which we treat as additional parameters, in the spirit of hierarchical modeling. This approach, theoretically grounded and easy to implement, greatly reduces the number and importance of subjective choices in the setting of the prior. Moreover, it performs very well in terms of both out-of-sample forecastingas well as factor modelsand accuracy in the estimation of impulse response functions.","[Giannone, Domenico] Univ LUISS, Rome, Italy; [Giannone, Domenico; Lenza, Michele] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Giannone, Domenico] CEPR, London, England; [Lenza, Michele] European Cent Bank, New York, NY USA; [Primiceri, Giorgio E.] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Primiceri, Giorgio E.] CEPR, London, England; [Primiceri, Giorgio E.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Luiss Guido Carli University; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Central Bank; Northwestern University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Giannone, D (通讯作者)，Univ LUISS, Rome, Italy.",,,"Giannone, Domenico/0000-0003-3850-2586",Actions de Recherche Concertes [ARC-AUWB/2010-15/ULB-11]; Alfred P.

Latent variables can be estimated from the observed manifest variables and used in matching. This paper demonstrates the benefits of such an approach by comparing it with a method where the manifest variables are directly used in matching. Estimating the propensity score on the manifest variables introduces a measurement error that can be limited with estimating the propensity score on the estimated latent variable. We use Monte Carlo simulations to test how the proposed approach behaves under distinct circumstances found in practice, and then apply it to real data. Using the estimated latent variable in the propensity score matching limits the measurement error bias of the treatment effects' estimates and increases their precision.

Whereas price dynamics on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) market seem to fit classical GARCH modelling, time series dependences in the MATIF market cannot be fully described by short-term dependences alone. According to various criteria, the results suggest the presence of long memories for the European market. However, the low fractional order of ARFIMA-type or FiGARCH-type models can explain only some, but not all, of the observed nonlinearity. Nonlinearity could be influenced by the regime shift.

In both cases our approach is based on probability distributions over the set of coalition structures that may arise for any given set of players. First, we introduce a family of values, one for each collection of these latter probability distributions, defined as the Banzhaf value of a coalitional game obtained as the expectation taken according to the given probability distributions of the original partition function form game. For each value of the family we provide two characterization results within the set of all partition function form games. Both results rely on a property of neutrality with respect to the amalgamation of players. Second, we propose another family of values that differ from the previous ones in that the latter values take into account only the information about the most likely coalition structure that may arise according to the given probability distributions. Each value of the second family is also characterized in two results by means of a collusion neutrality property.

To this end, three models are estimated: a first model to explore the role of knowledge on modal choice, a second one to identify the determinants of the level of knowledge and a third model to identify the determinants of a cognitive mismatch between actual (real) knowledge and perceived knowledge. The first model (a negative binomial regression model) underlines the significant relation between knowledge of the concept LRT and modal choice. Given the lack of knowledge of the concept 'Light Rail Transit' revealed by the descriptive results, it is of crucial importance to raise the level of knowledge. Knowledge acquisition can be based on transit experiences and information provision. To explore how information campaigns should be constructed and which target groups should be approached, the factors influencing travelers' knowledge and the determinants of a cognitive mismatch are identified by a Multinomial Logit Model (MNL-model) and a binary logit model. The results show that various socio-economic variables as well as socio-psychological variables are significantly influencing actual knowledge and significantly influencing a cognitive mismatch. Among these variables, employment, gender, perception of ticket price of Public Transit (PT) and expectations with regard to seat availability in the LRT-vehicle are the most influential ones.

He suggested that when incomes are higher than material aspirations (formed in childhood), birth rates would rise. This paper uses microeconomic data to formulate a measure of an individual's relative income. The use of microeconomic data allows the researcher to control for both state fixed effects and cohort fixed effects, both have been absent in previous examinations of Easterlin's hypothesis. The results of the empirical analysis are consistent with Easterlin's assertion that relative income influenced fertility decisions, although the effect operates only through childhood income. When the estimated effects are contextualized, they explain 12% of the U.S. baby boom. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The lack of an acceptable gold-standard for measuring fatness has made it difficult to evaluate alternative measures of obesity. We use latent class analysis to characterise existing diagnostics. Using data on US adults we show that measures based on body mass index and bioelectrical impedance analysis misclassify large numbers of individuals. For example, 45% of obese White women are misclassified as non-obese using body mass index, while over 50% of non-obese White women are misclassified as being obese using bioelectrical impedance analysis. In contrast the misclassification rates are low when waist circumference is used to measure obesity. These results have important implications for our understanding of differences in obesity rates across time and groups, as well as posing challenges for the econometric analysis of obesity.

Usually litigant success is associated with arguments about judicial constraint or litigants' capacity. This article sheds light on domestic politics as an additional factor that can affect governments' success record in court. It is argued that governmental annulment actions are often part of a two-level game in which the value of the legal conflict for a national government can be independent of, or even negatively related to, legal success in court as governments may reap immediate benefits from communicating the initiation of annulment actions to voters. In addition, negative rulings can be used as normative levers in domestic reform processes.

We find that the group decisions, as compared to individual decisions, lead to a higher level of corruption, for bribers and for bribees, and in China as well as in Germany. Only German women are less corrupt in a group decision context than when deciding individually. Further differences between Germany and China with respect to the effect of the teams' gender composition were found. In Germany, groups that consist only of females are the most honest and the male groups are the most corrupt, whereas in China the groups with mixed gender combination have shown a higher inclination to make corrupt decisions than the groups that are homogenous with respect to gender.","[Li, Sha; Buehren, Christoph; Frank, Bjoern] Univ Kassel, IVWL, D-34127 Kassel, Germany; [Qin, Haiying] Nankai Univ, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China",Universitat Kassel; Nankai University,"Frank, B (通讯作者)，Univ Kassel, IVWL, Nora Platiel Str 4, D-34127 Kassel, Germany.",sha.li@gmx.de; c.buehren@uni-kassel.de; frank@uni-kassel.de; qinhaiying@nankai.edu.cn,"Bühren, Christoph/AAD-1611-2020","Bühren, Christoph/0000-0001-6155-3694",China Scholarship Council (CSC); DAAD,China Scholarship Council (CSC)(China Scholarship Council); DAAD(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)),"We are indebted to Theodore Eisenberg, Elina Khachatryan, Johann Graf Lambsdorff and two anonymous referees for helpful comments, and to the China Scholarship Council (CSC) and the DAAD for providing financial support.",,56,9,11,2,26,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

These methods have been rarely applied in the field of housing economics but have proven to offer relevant insights into the evolution of price distributions. The shift of rental prices from 2007 to 2012 is split into portions caused by changes in the distributions of the explanatory variables and by changes in their coefficients over time. Two main results stand out: firstly, quantile estimates illustrate the constraint of a mean regression as most coefficients differ substantially between quantiles; secondly, coefficients are the primary source of temporal difference in the distribution of rental prices. On the other hand, changing properties of flats being offered affect the increase in the rental price distribution relatively little. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that a balanced government budget gives a higher balanced growth rate and lower inflation than a situation with permanent public deficits. It also leads to higher welfare compared to a situation with permanent deficits when the government does not put a high weight on stabilizing debt. However, when governments run deficits with a high weight on stabilizing debt, comparative welfare effects depend on the initial conditions with respect to public debt. Further, for a given monetary policy a stricter debt policy yields higher growth, lower inflation and higher welfare. A rise in the nominal money supply can compensate the negative growth effects of a loose debt policy up to a certain point but only at the cost of higher inflation and lower welfare.","Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Greiner, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bielefeld, Dept Business Adm & Econ, POB 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",agreiner@wiwi.uni-bielefeld.de,,,,,,,20,1,1,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The model is used to investigate consequences of Union of European Football Associations' (UEFA) Financial Fair Play regulations (FFP) for the league, aimed to preclude benefactor injections.

Few infected trees were detected in the Souss and Gharb regions and no CTV infection was found in the remaining sites. A survey for CTV vectors in the Gharb and Loukkos regions showed that Aphis spiraecola and A. gossypii were the most abundant aphid species, accounting for 56 and 33% of the total aphid population, respectively, while no evidence for the presence of Toxoptera citricidus (Kirkaldy) was observed.

Others, such as the abscisic acid and jasmonic acid signals or the phenylpropanoid profiles followed similar trends in both species varying with the stress imposed. Finally, other responses as the increase in salicylic acid were specific to each genotype and stress situation. Moreover, following a metabolomics approach, it was shown that the altered compounds in response to each stress had a low degree of overlapping which accounts for the specificity of the plant response to different environmental restraints. Finally, under control conditions, different metabolites had higher levels in CM than CC which suggested that pre-existent defenses are important as a stress tolerance trait.","[Arbona, Vicent; De Ollas, Carlos J.; Argamasilla, Rosa; Lopez-Climent, Maria F.; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio] Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Ecofisiol & Biotecnol, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Arbona, V (通讯作者)，Univ Jaume 1, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Ecofisiol & Biotecnol, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",arbona@uji.es,"Arbona, Vicent/K-1748-2015; de ollas, carlos J/B-7461-2019; Gomez-Cadenas, Aurelio/K-6084-2012; Argamasilla, Rosa/ABG-7255-2022","Arbona, Vicent/0000-0003-2232-106X; de ollas, carlos J/0000-0001-8488-623X; Lopez Climent, Maria Fernanda/0000-0001-9307-0128; Argamasilla Martinez, Rosa/0000-0003-0759-3809",,,,,21,2,2,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1275,1281,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600162,0

By surveying the opinions of member organisations of the Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA), four companies (each within a particular revenue category) were selected by AIIA members as having the most innovation-friendly cultures. The paper explicates the cultural basis of effective innovation within these four companies by drawing on survey data; analyses of the presentations given at the awards ceremony by senior members of each of the winning companies; and follow-up interviews with the leaders of these companies. The results point to the vital role that leadership plays in the creation of an appropriate cultural platform for successful innovation; and indicate how the execution of the strategic intent to innovate depends on the appropriateness of the cultural assumptions held by a stakeholder community. In particular, the study shows that within companies that are recognised as having innovation-supporting cultures, innovation is assumed to be a human/social process that is enhanced by open and honest communication, strong interpersonal relationships, mission-pertinent learning, and permission to experiment and fail.","[Burdon, Steve; Dovey, Ken] Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Burdon, S (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Fac Engn & Informat Technol, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,,"Burdon, Stephen/0000-0003-0073-8593",,,,,28,0,0,0,3,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1061,1072,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200081,0

The purpose of this study was to find the most appropriate sites to implement a bioethanol industry from citrus waste. A spreadsheet has been created to calculate the bioethanol mass flow from oranges, tangerines, lemons, and limes and grapefruits flow waste. Total waste of the main citrus producers was estimated as the sum of the rejects when packing fresh fruits and the waste generated by processing industries. Total waste value (oranges, tangerines, lemons and, limes and grapefruits) was multiplied by the ratio between mass flow and citrus waste flow in order to calculate the bioethanol production in different countries.

Which are the instruments of Government and how should they use them to improve the 'sustainability' efforts of corporations? Which is the importance of managers' ability to manage cultures in the mission to pursue economic benefits caring about the expectations of their social context of reference? Would a firm act in the same way in two different contexts? Do definitely responsible behaviours help some firms in outperforming others? Attempting to answer all those questions, CSR literature has shown critical knowledge gap in the lack of production of a multilevel research that is capable of integrating institutional, organizational and individual levels of analysis in a unique synoptic review. The aim of this work is thus to give a multilevel overview of the key concepts regarding CSR, with the goal of understanding the underlying links that allow firms to act more or less responsibly in a given context of culture, regulations and competitive introducing a framework of analysis that can be useful for a broad audience of scholars and policy-makers that want to inspect on the CSR-financial performance link and the CSR management practices. The article, indeed, proposes a new framework that puts simultaneously at the centre of any analysis: 1) the role of managers and their discretion; 2) the cultural background of the context wherein their firm operates; 3) the role of Governments. This paper is structured as follows: I first briefly review the literature on the concept of CSR, focusing on the link between Corporate Social Performance and Corporate Financial Performance, underlining competing perspectives and the effects of CSR on the various categories of stakeholders. In the following part, I bring into focus the theme of environmental and social accounting, in order to analyse the reasons, the ways and the limits of voluntary disclosure's processes that corporations need to put in action in order to communicate to all the stakeholders their own 'sustainable' actions. In the last part, I concentrate on the role of Governments as institutes of control and providers of clear points of orientation in order to force companies to be more active with regard to voluntary sustainability activities. Summing up, I provide conclusions and implications through which I expect to contribute to the debate about the link between CSR and a firm's overall performance.","LUM Jean Monnet Univ, Dept Econ, BR-70010 Casamassima, BA, Brazil",,"Debellis, F (通讯作者)，LUM Jean Monnet Univ, Dept Econ, Km 18 Str Statale 100, BR-70010 Casamassima, BA, Brazil.",,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,9,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,339,348,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200026,0

There is an abundance of academic literature that studies, separately, brand revival strategy and the consumer engagement process with brands. However, to the authors' knowledge, there has been no specific research or prior framework connecting these two topics together. Our findings indicate that consumers targeted by a particular brand's revival strategy will engage with that brand through a differentiated process that is based on the presence or absence of their previous knowledge about the particular brand in question. Those who previously knew about a brand will be more focused on the emotional aspects of engagement, while those who had no previous knowledge about a brand will concentrate more on its cognitive aspects. The results of this study suggest that, in order to increase its chances of success, the management of a brand's revival should be based (1) on a better understanding of the above specific factors affecting the consumers' engagement process as it relates to a brand's revival, and (2) on an actionable retro-brand marketing re-launch campaign using conative factors to positively influence consumer behavior.","[Descubes, Irena; McNamara, Tom] ESC Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel, F-35000 Rennes, France",Universite de Rennes; ESC Rennes School of Business,"Descubes, I (通讯作者)，ESC Rennes Sch Business, 2 Rue Robert dArbrissel, F-35000 Rennes, France.",irena.descubes@esc-rennes.fr; tom.mcnamara@esc-rennes.fr,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,9,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,304,315,,,,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000030,0

In order to answer this question, a piece of research was carried out on the statistical methods. The focus is on the variant method as little research has been conducted on different combination between factor and crop. As a support to establish the optimal link between crops and chemicals indicators of marginalism such as marginal production, marginal cost and expenditure, elasticity, marginal income, marginal profit and rate of profit were studied. The indicators explain the farmer's choice starting from hypothesis in order to achieve maximum of profit and environment protection and crops. The greatest combination of crops and chemicals is given by the marginal utility. Analysis of correlation of wheat and nitrogen-based chemicals served as basis for research. Study within the allocation process shown that wheat production not increase proportional whith quantity of nitrogen. The contradiction consists in the influence of latest unit factor on production level. According to these a suplimentary quantity of production factor determine reducing production crop. Also, an aditional crop production is not posible. The analysis and interpretation were studied from this point of view. Furthermore, the phenomenon become negative for environment in term of pollution. It is necessary to outline that this research adress to big farms where are applied scientific management. Studies are esspecialy because of expenditures per suplimentary doses by chemicals which increase and are injustified. Much previous research on production factors has been based upon large-scale surveys, highlighting specific conceptual frameworks. However, such studies are limited in their ability to shed light on the value of cases studies. Starting from the above mentioned situation, the purpose of this research is to review recent study into the optimal chemicals allocation in order to bring out the value of case studies in factor allocation decision making and to put forward a feasible proposal for the use by farmers. The objectives of this research are to describe the variant method, identify the mathematical connection between wheat crop and nitrogen, find optimal sollution.","[Dobre, Iuliana; Bran, Mariana] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Agrofood & Environm Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dobre, I (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Agrofood & Environm Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,1003,1010,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400128,0

Therefore, we define and further analyze the concept of water security, highlighting its actual increased importance for sustained economic growth and poverty alleviation. While the global demand for food is rising, there are several actors that will critically limit food production: the increased urbanization, the rising prices on inputs, the pressure on water resources and the increased crops and livestock vulnerability to climate change. We may find a strong link between water security and food security, in the global resource nexus model. These issues are shown to be important also in Romania, in our times of climate change and of increased small-scale farmers' vulnerability. In agreement with the experts and considering the strategic relevance of these aspects, we aim to stress more on the importance of investment in water infrastructure in the rural areas of Romania, to achieve the water security required for a sustainable agri-food and rural development. Moreover, we highlight directions of integrated water management in view of a green economy. As a main recommendation is the need to implement programs and policies promoting water security, as well as water resource efficiency in the Romanian agriculture and rural development programs.

To analyse the structuration of mandarin germplasm and the potential interspecific introgressions, 208 accessions were genotyped by the KASPar method, with sixty-seven single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers mined in 27 nuclear genes and in clementine BAC-ends. These SNP markers were employed for the study of 208 genotypes comprised of 169 ` mandarin-like' genotypes and 39 genotypes belonging to ancestral taxa. Structure software was used to identify groups within the mandarin germplasm. Six mandarin groups were identified, some of them in agreement with the species defined by Tanaka. Many mandarins were located between these mandarin groups, indicating a high level of admixture between the identified parental groups. New insights in the organization of mandarin germplasm and its structure are presented in this work, which will be useful for better management of citrus germplasm collections.","[Garcia-Lor, Andres; Ancillo, Gema; Ollitrault, Patrick; Navarro, Luis] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain; [Luro, Francois] INRA, Genet & Ecophysiol Qualite Agrumes UR1103, San Giuliano, France; [Ollitrault, Patrick] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA); INRAE; Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD,"Ollitrault, P (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",patrick.ollitrault@cirad.fr; lnavarro@ivia.es,"Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Ancillo, Gema/ABF-8990-2020; Lor, Andres García/B-1246-2016","Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Lor, Andres García/0000-0002-5625-5470; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517",,,,,25,3,3,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,105,111,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600010,0

This paper examines the case of the construction sector, which is specific from many points of view. The importance of mesoeconomic approach in the case of the construction sector generally exhibits many idiosyncrasies within the context of EU countries, and is only weakly correlated with the overall business cycle. Low correlation between construction and the total output out of the EU countries can be explained by the existence of a large number of factors, which affect construction to a much larger extent than other sectors. Concerning the time dimension of the development in construction, the panel regression model showed that the most fitting conclusion is the contemporaneous interdependence between gross value added in construction and the total gross value added.","[Kaderbkova, Bozena] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; [Malecek, Petr] Minist Finance Czech Republ, Prague 11810 1, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Kaderábková, B (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",kaderabb@vse.cz; Petr.Malecek@mfcr.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,701,712,,,,,,12,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000067,0

The data selected for the analysis include total population (demographic data) and residential floor space per person. The research assumes that the analysis of the dynamics of changes in the residential floor space per person provides the best indicator of changes occurring in the urbanised area. On the other hand, the population supplements information concerning changes in the urbanised area. In practice, a given area might become depopulated, and an increase in residential floor space per person will be observed. The growth of residential floor space per person can be also accompanied by an increase in population.

The methods used currently to forecast Septoria infection are based mainly on the climate condition and the calendar measurements, primarily taking into consideration the disease cycles. These measurements, however, do not take into account the most important factor: the splattering of raindrops as a method of transporting spores onto higher parts of the plants. If this factor is ignored, the forecasting models are flawed and have little correlation with the real development of a disease epidemic. The method presented in this study uses an electric field to measure the range of dispersal and number of splatter particles. This is achieved by means of a measuring system that allows for accurate and reliable measurement of the dispersal range of splashed raindrops. These raindrops scatter the spores and transmit the infection to higher parts of the plants as well as to neighboring plants. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In the case of persistent soil pollution such as chlordecone in the French West Indies, horticultural crops can be so polluted as to exceed maximum residue limits. Generally, there is no remediation solution for these polluted soils. Interactions between organic matter and pesticides are known to help reduce the bioavailability of pesticides in soils. Sequestering pesticides in soils by adding compost could be an alternative way of reducing their diffusion into food chains. We added 5% organic matter to the soil upper layer in horticultural fields and pots. The soil to crop transfer for radish, lettuce and cucumber decreased from 33 to 75% according to the crop and the soil type. We demonstrated that sequestration depended on the soil type and the clay physical properties. In nitisols, chlordecone sequestration was mainly due to chemical interactions with the compost particles whereas in andosols, it was partly due to the physical impact of the added compost (allophane collapse). Increasing soil organic matter content reduces pesticide mobility in the soil and hence its bioavailability for plants. Adding organic amendments to soils is a promising way to reduce the risk of pesticide contamination of food and thus decrease human exposure to potentially harmful chemicals.","[Lesueur-Jannoyer, M.; Clostre, F.; Fernandes, P.] CIRAD, Montpellier, France; [Woignier, T.] IRD, Marseille, France",CIRAD; Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD),"Lesueur-Jannoyer, M (通讯作者)，CIRAD, Montpellier, France.",,,"Fernandes, Paula/0000-0001-7668-8700",,,,,19,0,0,0,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,189,195,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.28,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800028,0

Corresponding DIY-projects are typically motivated by fun and self-fulfilment and not primarily by external stimuli. Nevertheless many new companies have emerged as a result of the hacker culture based on new products. In fact this subculture stresses unique and innovative applications of technologies, and encourages invention and prototyping. However, there seems to be a lack of knowledge on the relationship between hacker culture, entrepreneurship, and business innovation. The purpose of the present study is to address this gap and to develop insights into the hacker culture and its intersections with entrepreneurship and business innovation. Design/methodology/approach - To explore the research question, a multiple case study approach is used, which is especially useful in exploring the complexities of the entrepreneurial process. Data from five hacker projects was collected through a combination of structured interviews and secondary data. For the study a qualitative content analysis is appropriate as a method for analyzing the in-depth interviews. Originality/value - Compared to entrepreneurs in general, hackers show very particular motivation. Driving force behind the projects seems to be the wish to create something new, which has not existed before, which provides better solutions or at least outperforms existing products. Furthermore hackers typically understand a start-up process as a sequence of creative learning, just like technical problem solving. Trial and error is seen as precondition for improvement and therefore error tolerance seems to be fundamental. Practical implications - Hackers, makers, tinkerers, engineers, artists, and other creative people who pursue own ideas with the intention to build their own business can unquestionably be categorized as entrepreneurs - even if they occasionally do not like terms such as businessman/businesswoman and rather prefer denominations such as bricoleurs or hackers. After all, it is not the question whether to be a hacker or to be an entrepreneur but instead the question is if to be a hacker and an entrepreneur. The study shows examples of so called 'maker entrepreneurs', which means persons or teams which feel related to the hacker community in terms of sharing ideas and sharing knowledge, but also feel the passion to generate new ideas, to solve problems in a new way, and to bring their ideas to the market.","Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Innovat & Creat Management, D-99425 Weimar, Germany",Bauhaus-Universitat Weimar,"Mauroner, O (通讯作者)，Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Innovat & Creat Management, Helmholtzstr 15, D-99425 Weimar, Germany.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,31,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,686,696,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200053,0

Vector control is considered a basic component of HLB management even in a high disease incidence scenario. Such control is mostly chemically oriented. However, overuse of insecticides would increase costs and be incompatible with biological control. Establishment of economic thresholds for psyllid control under different price scenarios would optimize returns on investment. A 3-year experiment is being conducted in a commercial orange block with high HLB incidence. Experimental design is RCB with 4 treatments and 4 replicates: (1) calendar applications, (2) insecticide applications according to a threshold of 0.2 psyllids/stem tap sample, (3) applications according to a 0.7 threshold and (4) no insecticide. Vector populations are monitored biweekly by tap sampling. Differences in vector abundance among treatments are being correlated to fruit yields. Consequences of each vector control strategy on beneficial arthropod fauna are also being evaluated, as well as potential negative impacts on biological control. After two years, a significant yield increase was observed with the calendar treatment, but so far, justification for the additional costs would require higher than actual juice prices scenarios. ACP management strategies based on nominal thresholds are so far more profitable. Negative impacts of calendar sprays on biological control of mites and leafminers have been observed.","[Monzo, Cesar; Stansly, Philip A.] Univ Florida, SWFREC IFAS, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Monzó, C (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, SWFREC IFAS, Dept Entomol & Nematol, Immokalee, FL 34142 USA.",cmonzo@ufl.edu,"Monzo, C./O-5248-2019","Monzo, C./0000-0003-3247-7412",,,,,8,15,15,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1137,1143,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600144,0

To this end, we researched for differences in the accumulation of proteins related to these processes between on-crop and off-crop 'Moncada' mandarin leaves. Samples were collected in November, were immediately stored frozen at -80 degrees C, and proteins were extracted in less than two weeks. From 2D DIGE gel of these extracts, 12 related spots were isolated: only 1 showed increased accumulation in the off-crop samples compared to on-crop samples, while the other 11 showed increased accumulation in the on-crop samples against off-crop samples. These spots were identified by MALDI-MS or LC-MS-MS. The only protein with increased expression in the off-crop samples was putative monocopper oxidase precursor, while the up-expressed proteins in on-crop leaves were catalase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, Fe-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and three proteins related to stress response. Thus according to these results, generally, in the off-crop samples, proteins with oxidoreductase activity are down-regulated, while in the on-crop samples the proteins related to stress response and to oxidoreductase activity are up-regulated. Therefore, the redox state is different for off-crop and for on-crop Citrus leaves.","[Munoz-Fambuena, Natalia; Mesejo, Carlos; Agusti, Manuel] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Agroforestal Mediterraneo IAM, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Tarraga, Susana] Univ Politecn Valencia, Inst Biol Mol & Celular Plantas IBMCP, E-46071 Valencia, Spain; [Iglesias, Domingo J.; Primo-Millo, Eduardo; Carmen Gonzalez-Mas, M.] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia, Spain",Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Universitat Politecnica de Valencia; CSIC-UPV - Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular de Plantas (IBMCP); Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"González-Mas, MC (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr IVIA, Ctr Citricultura & Prod Vegetal, Valencia, Spain.",gonzalez_mde@gva.es,"González-Mas, Maria Carmen/E-6230-2014; Iglesias, Domingo J./C-9000-2014; Primo-Millo, Eduardo/D-8584-2014; González-Mas, M.

The uses of packaging and ethylene (C2H4) absorber are regarded as well-known ways to solve that problem. However, accumulated CO2 in the package can promote the symptoms of internal browning on pear flesh also exacerbated by too low O-2 concentrations. To inhibit the symptoms in 'Silver Bell' pear for a long period, we utilized CO2 adsorbent, CO2 adsorbent plus C2H4 adsorbent, and without both adsorbents in a bag to investigate their effects on internal browning development for 7 months in cold-storage. We found both adsorbents successfully reduced CO2 and C2H4 levels even though the incidences were visually found at 3 months of storage. Most severe internal browning was observed on CO2 adsorbent-untreated pears under high CO2 levels (7-9 %) increasing since the beginning of storage. Therefore, there were no significant differences on the color and flesh firmness among the treatments, except controls, during cold-storage. Internal browning-affected pears showed harder flesh, greener and darker color compared with unaffected pears. Interestingly, control samples also suffered internal browning under low CO2 (similar to 0.1 %) and high O-2 (similar to 20.5 %) concentrations after 5 months in storage with medium damage levels. We conclude that the uses of CO2 and C2H4 adsorbents successfully lowered CO2 and C2H4 levels in the bags during cold storage, but the both failed to prevent an internal browning development because too long storage period eventually caused internal browning.

Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic methods have been used to forecast volatility with reasonable success due unreal assumptions about volatility underlying process. Recently, a supervised learning machine called support vector regression has been employed to forecast financial volatility. Nevertheless, the quality and stability of the model obtained through training process depend strongly on the selection of parameters. Typically, these are tuned by a grid search method ; however, this tuning procedure is prone to get trapped on local optima, requires a priori information, and it does not concurrently tune the kernels and its parameters. This paper presents a new method called for the financial volatility forecasting problem which selects simultaneously the proper kernel and its parameter values. is a hybrid genetic algorithm which uses several genetic operators to enhance the exploration of solutions space: it introduces a new genetic operator called Boltzmann selection, and the use of several random number generators. Experimental data correspond to two ASEAN and two latinoamerican market indexes. results are compared against method. It uses the mean absolute percentage error and directional accuracy functions for measuring quality results.

The customer satisfaction with the product or service plays a significant role in this method. The main target of companies is to achieve their long-term trust by creating products and supplying services that fulfil customer requirements and exceed their expectations. Thanks to this procedure companies are able to maximize their profit. However customers can also take an advantage of using the house of quality method for their utility maximization. In shopping decision making process customers try to choose the most suitable product. However, it is often extremely complicated for customers to select the product that optimally satisfy their needs because of a vast number of factors that have to be taken into account. The suggested method in this study allows customers to effectively identify the most important attributes of requested product. Using this method customers are able to select the product with such characteristics which maximize their utility. The suggested method based on the powerful quality function deployment tool and the customer marketing mix allows consumers to convert their vague requirements for specific measurable technical attributes of the product and so the new presented method has the great impact on consumer decision making process in the act of shopping.","[Schueller, David; Videcka, Zdenka; Chalupsky, Vladimir] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Schüller, D (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,131,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400017,0

In the Citrus Center and Vegetable Production (IVIA) another breeding program based on budwood irradiation is being conducted in search of new seedless cultivars. At this moment two clones obtained from irradiated budwood of the seedy 'Moncada' mandarin (Moncalina-6S17 and Manrad-2L09) are in process of being registered and exhibit excellent fruit quality. This study aimed at testing the postharvest behavior of these four new cultivars. After harvest the fruit were waxed and stored up to 30 days at 1, 5, or 9 degrees C in order to evaluate the sensibility to chilling injury and the changes in quality parameters that occur during the cold storage. 'Safor' mandarins did not show chilling injury symptoms during 30 days at any temperature studied. In contrast, 'Garbi' mandarins exhibited susceptibility to chilling injury after 15 days of storage at 1 and 5 degrees C; during this period this cultivar showed disorders related with peel dehydration when stored at 9 degrees C. 'Moncalina' and 'Manrad' did not show relevant symptoms related to cold-induced damage or dehydration at 1, 5 and 9 degrees C for 30 days of storage.

This paper explores this interplay and presents the findings of an extensive literature review and interviews conducted within the scope of a research project. The study found that as the demand of specialty tea has grown, the level of brand awareness has also grown congruently. Currently there are about forty specialty tea retailers operating in Australia, but new tea businesses continue to emerge and are implementing a number of marketing strategies to target younger customers in the 20-40 year old age bracket. Notably, in order of decreasing importance, the main marketing tools identified are word of mouth, social media platforms, events, and sales promotion.","[Veerapa, N. K.; Aryani, N. V.

Before being planted in the grove, three groups of trees came from a container nursery, transplanted in three different size bags (30-, 45-, or 60-cm-long and diameter) and allowed to grow for two years. The trees of the fourth group were two-year young standard container nursery trees grown in 10x10x35-cm plastic citripots. For each group, growth, leaf mineral concentration, fruit production and quality were determined and net income per acre was computed. The young nursery trees accumulated more potassium and less calcium in their leaves and had less soluble solids, acid, and juice in their fruit. During the first four years after planting, tree size and fruit production were the highest for the trees coming from the large size bags.

While various studies demonstrate profound effects of weather on travel behaviours, limited attention has been paid to subjective weather experiences and the psychological mechanisms that may (partially) underlie these effects. This paper integrates theoretical insights on outdoor thermal comfort, weather perceptions and emotional experiences in the context of travel behaviour. Drawing on unique panel travel diary data for 945 Greater Rotterdam respondents (The Netherlands), this paper aims to investigate how and to what extent weather conditions affect transport mode choices, outdoor thermal perceptions and emotional travel experiences. Our findings point out that observed dry, calm, sunny and warm but not too hot weather conditions stimulate cycling over other transport modes and - via mechanisms of thermal and mechanical comfort - lead to more pleasant emotions during travel. Overall, public transport users have less pleasant emotional experiences than users of other transport modes, while active mode users appear most weather sensitive. The theoretical contributions and empirical findings are discussed in the context of climate change and climate-sensitive urban planning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the most discussed accounts of this fallacy is currently the quantum-like explanation, which relies on models exploiting the mathematics of quantum mechanics. The aim of this paper is to investigate the empirical adequacy of major quantum-like models which represent beliefs with quantum states. We first argue that they can be tested in three different ways, in a question order effect configuration which is different from the traditional conjunction fallacy experiment.

Examining the flow of Italian university students at the provincial level in 2003-2012, we find that the air transport service affects university attractiveness for long-distance students living at least 300 km from their university. Specifically, accessibility increases with the proximity of universities to airports, when low-cost carriers serve university routes and more alternative airports exist at the origin. Further, our results suggest that, over the last decade, air transport service has facilitated mobility of long-distance students from southern areas to universities in the north of Italy, where students generally move to increase their future prospects.

They test the conclusions of Putnam, who saw associations as a force for positive development, and Olson, who concluded the opposite. The authors find that Putnam organizations have a negative effect on income, while Olson organizations have a positive effect by decreasing levels of income inequality. Drawing on the literature distinguishing between bridging versus bonding, the authors show that bridging capital has a positive effect on development by increasing per capita income, while bonding capital has a neutral effect on both per capita income and income inequality. Finally, religious variables are tested for their relationship with economic development. Overall, congregation density has a negative influence by increasing per capita income and income inequality, controlling for geographic type. Congregations with bridging characteristics have a mixed effect on development by decreasing income and decreasing inequality.","[Hoyman, Michele] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Polit Sci, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [McCall, Jamie] Field Econ Dev, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Paarlberg, Laurie] Texas A&M Univ, Publ Adm, College Stn, TX USA; [Brennan, John] Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Publ & Int Affairs, Wilmington, NC USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Brennan, J (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Wilmington, Dept Publ & Int Affairs, 601 S Coll Rd, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",brennanj@uncw.edu,,"Paarlberg, Laurie/0000-0003-2804-2459; McCall, Jamie/0000-0001-6984-5739",,,,,81,19,24,0,28,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Besides, unlike ALUA and GGAL shares, the threshold cointegration analysis reveals that, in the long-term, the BMA, EDN and APBR shares have a much faster reaction to negative deviations from long-term equilibrium than positive deviations. Furthermore, the error correction model discloses that, in the short-term, the adjustment speed of EDN-share is faster when the deviation from the long-run equilibrium is positive than when it is negative. Besides, it is found that the ALUA, BMA, GGAL and APBR shares have a much slower reaction to positive deviations from long-term equilibrium than negative deviations.

These informal rules increasingly guided the behaviours of care workers over time, resulting in the breach of formal strictures.

The analysis is implemented in a dynamic recursive framework capturing long-run capital accumulation and labor market equilibrium. A national level impact was simulated through direct impact drivers including land use conversion, output expansion, cost reduction, productivity increase, transport demand substitution and induced demand. The results suggest that rail investment in China over the past decade has been a positive stimulus to the economy, while the effect on CO2 emissions generation has been large. Overall, the economic impacts of rail investment are achieved primarily through induced demand and output expansion, whereas the contribution from a reduction of rail transportation costs and rail productivity increases were modest. In addition, negligible negative impacts were found from land use for rail development and the substitution effect among other modes. Emissions reduction from substitution of rail for other modes was small and offset by output expansion due to lowered rail transport costs and induced demand. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

By highlighting a number of important similarities between Mach's and Hayek's theories of the psychical/phenomenal and physical world/order, the paper aims to show that key aspects of Hayek's theory of mind can be traced to Mach's theoretical foundations.

This research note's contribution to understanding foreign-exchange earnings from tourism lies in the evidence it provides that the logistics growth curve can help in the estimation of expected average consumption per tourist in the longer term.","[Lee, Yun-Huan; Chang, William S.] Ming Chuan Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Chang, WS (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, 250,Sect 4,N Rd Zhong Shan, Taipei 111, Taiwan.",shulienchang@yahoo.com,"張, 書濂/GRX-6678-2022",,,,,,20,1,1,1,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Despite studies providing the essential building blocks and frameworks for cost overrun mitigation and containment, the problem still remains a pervasive issue for Governments worldwide. The interdependency that exists between 'causes' that lead to cost overruns materialising have largely been ignored when considering the likelihood and impact of their occurrence. The vast majority of the cost overrun literature has tended to adopt a deterministic approach in examining the occurrence of the phenomenon; in this paper a shift towards the adoption of pluralistic probabilistic approach to cost overrun causation is proposed. The establishment of probabilistic theory incorporates the ability to consider the interdependencies of causes so to provide Governments with a holistic understanding of the uncertainties and risks that may derail the delivery and increase the cost of transportation infrastructure projects. This will further assist in the design of effective mitigation and containment strategies that will ensure future transportation infrastructure projects meet their expected costs as well as the need of taxpayers.

Crowding issues are defined in terms of utility gains or losses through a stated-preference choice experiment, making it possible to quantify crowding disturbances in monetary terms. The proposed method is applied to the case of Antwerp, Belgium, specifically focusing on the effect of use density on local inhabitants. The case study serves to reveal quantitatively the theorized quadratic effects of crowding on the space utility of residents. Potential utility effects of different crowding levels are discussed and compared to actual use levels. The methodology provides new opportunities for threshold optimization in crowding-sensitive urban areas, taking into account a community-based norm development.","[Neuts, Bart] Auckland Univ Technol, Auckland, New Zealand",Auckland University of Technology,"Neuts, B (通讯作者)，Auckland Univ Technol, Sch Hospitality & Tourism, Private Bag 92006, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.",bneuts@aut.ac.nz,"Neuts, Bart/E-4668-2017","Neuts, Bart/0000-0002-6518-650X",,,,,77,6,7,1,15,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

In addition to the classic tools assessed, another factor considered is age: Younger players may get selected over older players of equal ability because of anticipated development. Additionally, Little League rules in effect until 2006 operated on an August 1-July 31 year meaning that, in their youth, players born on August 1 were the eldest in their cohort. We define a relative age to be how old a player was (in days) when the youngest player in their cohort was born. For example, a player born on July 31 would have a relative age of 1 day, whereas a player born on August 1 would have a relative age of 365 days. We examine the performance of high school (HS) players selected in the June Draft from 1987 to 2011. We find that more relatively old players are selected in the Draft. Conversely, both age and relative age have a significant negative relationship with the odds of reaching the major leagues. Given that a draftee reaches the majors, however, there is no difference based on age or relative age, as measured by games played, wins above replacement, and on-base plus slugging percentage. Had the draft market operated efficiently, neither relative age nor age on draft day would have captured additional variation in performance after controlling for draft position and other factors. We conclude that teams have undervalued both young and relatively young HS players.","[Sims, Justin] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Addona, Vittorio] Macalester Coll, Math Stat & Comp Sci, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA",Macalester College; Macalester College,"Addona, V (通讯作者)，Macalester Coll, Math Stat & Comp Sci, 1600 Grand Ave, St Paul, MN 55105 USA.",addona@macalester.edu,"Addona, Vittorio/T-2114-2019",,,,,,24,7,10,0,11,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

Numerous models and rates were investigated yielding variable statistical accuracies. Most appropriate statistical models/rates were summarized and highlighted for each type of land use, and parking generation models with acceptable statistical significance were recommended, otherwise, parking generation rates were recommended. Simple linear regression, natural logarithmic linear regression, and power were the forms of the recommended models for the studied land uses.

Scholars, however, have overlooked another mechanism through which states seek to facilitate trade: international harmonization of private law. Underlying legal harmonization is the assumption that cross-national variation of commercial law impedes trade; by contrast, similarity of laws across countries encourages trade by reducing uncertainty and transaction costs. I argue that the harmonization of private law acts as a substitute for the public-law channel of stimulating trade: countries with limited PTA partnerships make up for this deficiency by joining initiatives for private-law harmonization. This argument is tested by analyzing the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods-one of the primary instruments of legal harmonization. Indeed, countries that are party to shallow PTAs or have few PTA partners are more likely to ratify this private-law convention. Overall, this article urges scholars of trade and international law to broaden their research agenda to include private law.","[Efrat, Asif] Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel; [Efrat, Asif] Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC, Inst Policy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel",Reichman University; Reichman University,"Efrat, A (通讯作者)，Lauder Sch Govt Diplomacy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel.;Efrat, A (通讯作者)，Interdisciplinary Ctr IDC, Inst Policy & Strategy, Herzliyya, Israel.",asif@idc.ac.il,,,,,,,105,2,2,1,21,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

The standard explanation for why the United States' government signed those BITs is that it was motivated by a desire to promote the development of international investment law and to protect American capital invested abroad. An alternative explanation, however, is that the United States has largely used BITs as a foreign policy tool to improve relationships with strategically important countries in the developing world. This project uses qualitative and quantitative evidence to assess whether the United States was motivated to sign BITs based on investment considerations or political considerations. The qualitative evidence suggests that US executive branch officials viewed BITs as a potential way to cement and strengthen relationships with politically important countries. The quantitative evidence suggests that proxies for investment considerations - like trade and FDI flows - are weak predictors of US BIT formation, but that political considerations - like military aid and whether a country was formerly a communist state - are consistently statistically significant predictors. Taken together, the evidence supports the argument that political considerations are better predictors of the BITs the United States signed than investment considerations.","[Chilton, Adam S.] Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Chilton, AS (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Sch Law, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,54,14,19,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

They also introduce contradictory soft' and hard' Human Resource Management (HRM) reforms. Workers face multiple demands to be more flexible and exhibit commitment to fit' with customer needs.

The article argues that political feasibility is fundamental for gaining support and eventually fostering the development of widely acceptable, stable and effective consumption-based accounting systems. Specifically, the article first briefly investigates the potential of consumption-based carbon inventories. It then frames and scrutinizes political feasibility according to the normative and positive perspectives relevant to understanding the actual possibility of shifting from the current production-to consumption-based accounting. Finally the article, in light of the evidence provided by the analysis carried out, takes a prescriptive turn and indicates how politically feasible governance systems for consumption-based accounting may be forged and successfully put into practice.","[Grasso, Marco] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sociol & Ric Sociale, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca,"Grasso, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dipartimento Sociol & Ric Sociale, Via Bicocca Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",marco.grasso@unimib.it,"Grasso, Marco/ABT-9659-2022","Grasso, Marco/0000-0002-6869-5959",,,,,88,18,20,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

A simulation study indicates that the copula-based double-hurdle models with flexible margins perform well even when the selected copula has been misspecified. An empirical application shows that copula-based double-hurdle models with flexible margins may outperform the conventionally used classical double-hurdle model based on a bivariate normality assumption.","[Schwiebert, Joerg] Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Schwiebert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",schwiebert@leuphana.de,,,,,,,21,1,1,1,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

If citizens are unwilling to reveal certain policy preferences to others, surveys may fail to characterize population preferences accurately. The innovation of this paper is to use unique data that allow one to measure biases in surveyed preferences for a broad range of public policies. I combine data on 184 referenda held in Switzerland between 1987 and 2007 with postballot surveys that ask how the citizens voted for each proposal. The difference between stated preferences in the survey and revealed preferences at the ballot box provides a direct measure of survey bias. I find that these biases vary by policy area, with the largest occurring in policies on immigration, international integration, and votes involving liberal or conservative attitudes. Also, citizens show a tendency to respond in accordance with the majority.","[Funk, Patricia] Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland; [Funk, Patricia] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain",Universita della Svizzera Italiana; Pompeu Fabra University,"Funk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Svizzera Italiana, Lugano, Switzerland.;Funk, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Funk, Patricia/E-7138-2013","Funk, Patricia/0000-0002-0263-7879",Barcelona GSE Research Network; Swiss National Science Foundation [130648],Barcelona GSE Research Network; Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"I thank the editor and one very helpful anonymous referee for excellent comments.

These drivers are the natural-gas price, system loads, nuclear capacities available, hydro conditions, and renewable generation. We find that profits are reduced by increases in generation from nuclear plants and wind farms, and are increased by increases in the natural-gas price and loads. Solar generation has a statistically insignificant effect, although this will likely change as solar energy increases its generation share in California's electricity market. Our findings support California's adopted resource adequacy program under which the state's load-serving entities may sign long-term bilateral contracts with generation developers to provide sufficient revenues to enable construction of new natural-gas-fired generation plants.","[Woo, Chi-Keung; Ho, Tony; Leung, Eric] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Horowitz, Ira] Univ Florida, Warrington Coll Business Adm, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Zarnikau, Jay] Frontier Associates LLC, 1515 S Capital Texas Highway,Suite 110, Austin, TX 78746 USA; [Zarnikau, Jay] Univ Texas Austin, LBJ Sch Publ Affairs, Austin, TX 78713 USA; [Zarnikau, Jay] Univ Texas Austin, Dept Stat, Austin, TX 78713 USA; [Moore, Jack; Schneiderman, Brendan] Energy & Environm Econ Inc, 101 Montgomery St,Suite 1600, San Francisco, CA 94104 USA",Hong Kong Baptist University; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Woo, CK (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",chiwoo@hkbu.edu.hk,"Zarnikau, Jay/J-1824-2019","Zarnikau, Jay/0000-0003-1976-4951; WOO, Chi Keung/0000-0001-8114-3350",,,,,110,18,18,0,10,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2016,37.0,3.0,,,,,29,57,,10.5547/01956574.37.3.cwoo,0.0,,,29,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DP8OL,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378757400002,0

We argue that institutional adaptations to the rise of emerging and the decline of established powers are different from what power transition theories (PTTs) would lead us to believe. Institutional adaptations are not impossible, as pessimist PTT variants hold; and they are rarely easy to attain, let alone perfect, as optimist PTT variants imply. To bridge the gap between these versions of PTT, we propose an institutionalist power shift theory (IPST) which combines insights on the conditions and mechanisms of institutional change from functionalist, historical and distributive variants of rational institutionalism. IPST claims that institutional adaptations will succeed or fail depending on whether or not emerging powers are able to undermine the international institution and to make credible threats to this effect. To demonstrate IPST's plausibility we analyze: (1) how India and Brazil gained the agreement of established powers to their membership in the WTO core negotiation group (BQuad<^>), which had previously been dominated by developed countries; and (2) how China reached agreement with established powers on (more) even-handed surveillance of IMF members' financial stability, which, up to then, had focused on developing countries and exchange rate issues.","[Zangl, Bernhard; Heussner, Frederick; Kruck, Andreas; Lanzendoerfer, Xenia] Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Zangl, B (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Geschwister Scholl Inst Polit Sci, Oettingenstr 67, D-80538 Munich, Germany.",bernhard.zangl@gsi.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,119,53,57,1,37,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

When MBEs do receive bank financing, they get smaller loans than Whites. Two aspects of these findings are troublesome. First, urban MBEs are heavily concentrated geographically in minority communities, raising the issue of whether difficulties accessing financing reflect firm location, minority ownership, or both. Second, applicable studies rest on weak theoretical foundations. The authors' findings suggest that banks engage in discriminatory practices limiting credit availability to MBEs. Controlling for risk factors, however, firm location in a minority or inner-city neighborhood has no apparent impact on loan availability or size. Owner race/ethnicity, in contrast, is important. Subtle processes discourage MBEs from seeking bank loans. Owner race and wealth both powerfully shape loan access: high wealth opens doors, minority ownership closes them.","[Bates, Timothy] Wayne State Univ, 42 W Warren Ave, Detroit, MI 48202 USA; [Robb, Alicia] Ewing Marion Kauffman Fdn, Kansas City, MO USA",Wayne State University,"Bates, T (通讯作者)，Wayne State Univ, 42 W Warren Ave, Detroit, MI 48202 USA.",tbates7893@gmail.com,"Bates, Timothy C/C-9637-2010",,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research reported in this study was generously supported by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.",,33,36,46,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

Actual data on male height are compared with the average consumption of 28 protein sources (FAOSTAT, 1993-2009) and seven socioeconomic indicators (according to the World Bank, the CIA World Factbook and the United Nations). This comparison identified three fundamental types of diets based on rice, wheat and milk, respectively. The consumption of rice dominates in tropical Asia, where it is accompanied by very low total protein and energy intake, and one of the shortest statures in the world (similar to 162-168 cm). Wheat prevails in Muslim countries in North Africa and the Near East, which is where we also observe the highest plant protein consumption in the world and moderately tall statures that do not exceed 174 cm. In taller nations, the intake of protein and energy no longer fundamentally rises, but the consumption of plant proteins markedly decreases at the expense of animal proteins, especially those from dairy. Their highest consumption rates can be found in Northern and Central Europe, with the global peak of male height in the Netherlands (184 cm). In general, when only the complete data from 72 countries were considered, the consumption of protein from the five most correlated foods (r = 0.85) and the human development index (r = 0.84) are most strongly associated with tall statures. A notable finding is the low consumption of the most correlated proteins in Muslim oil superpowers and highly developed countries of East Asia, which could explain their lagging behind Europe in terms of physical stature.

Using detailed individual labor contracts of Major League Baseball players, the empirical estimations find that, given that players are more risk-averse than clubs, contract length exhibits a positive relationship with the level of productive uncertainty. This implies that the risk-sharing hypothesis dominates the competing hypothesis of efficient production in individual labor contracts. Moreover, contract length is positively related to specific investment, highlighting that the prediction of the transaction cost theory also holds on individual labor contracts.","[Lin, Hsuan-Yu] Taiwan Inst Econ Res, Taipei, Taiwan; [Yang, Chih-Hai] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan",National Central University,"Yang, CH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, 300 Jhongda Rd, Taoyuan 320, Taiwan.",jazz010582@gmail.com; chyang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw,,,,,,,37,3,3,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Different from conventional exponential distribution, we discover the mobility distance with taxi follows power-law distribution. Further, we proposed a model which may explain the mechanism for the power-law distribution: mobility distance is constrained by time and fare. Specifically, the relationship between fare and mobility distance follows piecewise function, and responds to individual sensitivity; the relationship between time and mobility distance follows significant logarithmic relationship. These two factors, especially the logarithmic relationship between time and mobility distance, may contribute to a power-law distribution instead of an exponential one. Finally, with a simulation model, we verify the significant power-law distribution of human mobility behavioral distance with a single vehicle, by supplementing factors of waiting time and fare.

We argue that the ceteris paribus clause, which assumes that the maximum likelihood estimator of beta remains constant as the correlation (rho) between the regressors increases, invoked under the traditional account of near-multicollinearity is rather misleading. We derive the parameters of the logistic regression model and show that they are functions of rho, indicating that the ceteris paribus clause is unattainable. Monte Carlo simulations confirm these findings and further show that: coefficient estimates and related statistics fluctuate in a non-symmetric, non-monotonic way as vertical bar rho vertical bar -> 1; that the impact of near-multicollinearity is centered on the estimates of beta; and that the impact on substantive inferences does not necessarily follow what the traditional account implies.","[Bergtold, Jason] Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, 342 Waters Hall Ag Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Atems, Bebonchu] Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Econ & Financial Studies, 8 Clarkson Ave, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",Kansas State University; Clarkson University,"Bergtold, J (通讯作者)，Kansas State Univ, Agr Econ, 342 Waters Hall Ag Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA.",bergtold@ksu.edu,"Bergtold, Jason/AAA-1041-2022",,,,,,19,1,1,0,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

Here we examine the role of precolonial political centralization on contemporary development outcomes with detailed subnational data from Uganda. We use a variety of data sets and obtain two striking results. First, we find that precolonial centralization is highly correlated with modern-day development outcomes such as GDP, asset ownership, and poverty at the subcounty, district, and individual level; additional results using an instrumental variable approach confirm this finding. Second, we find that public goods such as immunization coverage and primary school enrollment, as well as perceptions of local government quality, are not correlated with precolonial centralization. These findings are thus consistent with a correlation between precolonial centralization and private rather than public goods, thereby suggesting the persistence of poverty and wealth from the precolonial period to the present.","[Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra] Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England; [Green, Elliott] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bandyopadhyay, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, London WC1E 7HU, England.",,,,,,,,70,24,27,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0013-0079,1539-2988,,ECON DEV CULT CHANGE,Econ.

Around 40% of the buildings in Tokyo Prefecture were completely burnt or destroyed. In this paper, we investigate whether this temporary shock had a persistent impact on the spatial distribution of industries in Tokyo, using ward- and county-level panel data for industrial workers. It was found that while the earthquake caused mean shifts in the shares and numbers of workers, these mean shifts disappeared by the early 1930s. On the other hand, the earthquake caused shifts in the trends in the share and number of workers. The combined effects of these mean shifts and trend shifts were persistent for both the shares and the numbers of workers. The earthquake caused especially serious damage to the old industrial clusters in the southeast of Tokyo, and provided an opportunity for newly developing industrial clusters in non-damaged areas to take over the market. Further, the people and the local governments in non-damaged areas made an effort to take advantage of this opportunity to attract factories. Arguably, these forces made the impact of the earthquake on the spatial distribution of industry persistent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The case of housing construction quality in China,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Construction quality; Housing price premium; Financial sustainability; China,ECONOMIC RETURNS; MARKET,"Construction quality is a major problem in China's housing market. We investigate whether the housing market could provide incentives to encourage developers to promote construction quality beyond the compulsory, minimum standards by testing the financial viability of efforts made in this field by developers. This study takes place in the city of Beijing, where the Great Wall Award, granted by the local construction bureau, is used as an indicator of excellent performance in construction quality. Our analysis shows that, from 2005 to 2010, the transaction price in the housing resale market of a unit that received the award can be up to 7.0% higher than a similar unit that did not receive the award. This difference is due to both the higher possible rent and a lower capitalization rate. However, we find no meaningful price premium at the presale stage, while developers with a record of winning the award cannot use such reputation to obtain price premiums in later projects either. These findings indicate a mismatch between the costs and benefits that residential developers face when deciding to enhance the quality of their construction. This mismatch partially explains the current housing construction quality problems in China, and may also discourage future improvements in this field. More efforts from the government are required to correct such market failures. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The main results of the paper suggest that increases in the multimarket contacts among banks are positively related to individual bank stability, but negatively related to bank market power. The results further indicate that greater capitalization has positive impact on the bank stability. However, market concentration has positive and negative impact on bank stability and bank power, respectively. The cost inefficiency is negatively related to the Lerner index, suggesting that inefficient banks generate lower market power compared with efficient ones. The results also show that there is a nonlinear relationship between market power and multimarket contacts.

Additionally, the East-West gap and its trend are separately analyzed for men and women as well as for four birth cohorts. The results indicate that reported life satisfaction is on average significantly lower in East than in West German federal states and that part of the raw East-West gap is due to differences in household income and unemployment status. The conditional East-West gap decreased in the first years after the German reunification and remained quite stable and sizeable since the mid-nineties. The results further indicate that gender differences are small. But the East-West gap is significantly smaller and shows a trend towards convergence for younger birth cohorts.","[Petrunyk, Inna; Pfeifer, Christian] Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany",Leuphana University Luneburg,"Pfeifer, C (通讯作者)，Univ Luneburg, Inst Econ, Scharnhorststr 1, D-21335 Luneburg, Germany.",petrunyk@leuphana.de; pfeifer@leuphana.de,,"Petrunyk, Inna/0000-0002-9234-9319",,,,,22,12,12,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Drawing on the insights of historical institutionalism, we show that the German government's control over the process is constrained by the increased sunk costs of European monetary integration and the unintended negative spillovers from its management of the eurozone crisis. While the German government attempted to promote the domestic societal interests underpinning its creditor preferences by deflecting the burden of macroeconomic and institutional adjustment onto the debtor countries, negative feedback loops linked to the pursuit of these preferences induced it to accept a less orthodox and increasingly accommodative central bank to make the EMU sustainable.","[Steinberg, Federico] Univ Auton Madrid, Madrid, Spain; [Steinberg, Federico] Royal Elcano Inst, Madrid, Spain; [Vermeiren, Mattias] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Vermeiren, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ghent Inst Int Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Mattias.Vermeiren@UGent.be,,"STEINBERG WECHSLER, FEDERICO/0000-0002-8318-5527",Flemish Research Foundation (FWO),Flemish Research Foundation (FWO)(FWO),"The authors would like to thank Michelle Chang, Miguel Otero-Iglesias, Hubert Zimmermann, the JCMS editorial team and the three anonymous reviewers for their many suggestions and helpful comments.

The current extent of international student mobility and its potential future development make it an appropriate topic for analysis in terms of its local and regional economic impacts, first and foremost at the academic and political levels. A methodology to facilitate the estimation of both the direct effects on the education sector and the possible 'externalities' on the tourism industry will enable economic evaluation of financial efforts to attract international students. Without considering the potential increase of other visitors, the results indicate that international students have less economic impact than that associated with inbound tourism and, in the case of exchange students (as a constituent group of international students), the economic contribution could even be negative for a local economy.","[Pereira Lopez, Xesus; Fernandez Fernandez, Melchor] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Dev Studies Galicia IDEGA, Ave Burgo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain; [Pereira Lopez, Xesus] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Ave Burgo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain; [Fernandez Fernandez, Melchor] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Fdn Econ Anal, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain; [Carrascal Incera, Andre] Univ Santiago de Compostela, Inst Dev Studies Galicia IDEGA, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain",Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela; Universidade de Santiago de Compostela,"López, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Inst Dev Studies Galicia IDEGA, Ave Burgo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain.;López, XP (通讯作者)，Univ Santiago de Compostela, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Ave Burgo S-N, Santiago De Compostela 15782, A Coruna, Spain.",xesus.pereira@usc.es; melchor.fernandez@usc.es; andre.carrascal@rai.usc.es,"Carrascal Incera, Andre/AAT-8682-2020; Fernandez, Melchor/L-5708-2014","Carrascal Incera, Andre/0000-0001-9762-1636; Fernandez, Melchor/0000-0002-6255-2033; Pereira Lopez, Xesus/0000-0001-9709-7483",,,,,47,20,20,5,41,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A question that naturally arises here is whether a value of awareness (VOA), analogous to value of information (VOI), can be attributed to changes in awareness. In this paper, such a value is defined. It is shown that the sum VOA VOI is constant and, except for scale effects, independent of the choice set. It follows that the larger is VOA, the smaller is VOI. This point is illustrated for a simple two-state case, then proved for general classes of compact convex choice sets, and for alternative interpretations of the concept of unawareness.","[Quiggin, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Quiggin, J (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",j.quiggin@uq.edu.au,"Quiggin, John/C-1621-2013","Quiggin, John/0000-0003-0398-8280",,,,,24,13,16,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2016,80.0,2.0,,,,,167,185,,10.1007/s11238-015-9496-x,0.0,,,19,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DC1ZQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369017400001,0

A seller who wants to continue to market the property can leave it on the market, relist the property immediately, or take it off the market for a period of time before relisting it. Research has shown that properties with longer time-on-market may carry a stigma and sell for less. In an attempt to mitigate the negative perception of a house that other buyers appear to have passed by, a seller can have the agent relist the property so it appears as a new listing. If a seller decides to relist the property, the owner also has to decide how long to wait before relisting. We use a hedonic approach to investigate the choices sellers have when deciding whether to relist their property and the impact those decisions have on the property's selling price. We find that relisting a property results in a higher selling price and that to maximize price, the seller should relist the property with the same agent within 30 days.","[Smith, Patrick S.; Gibler, Karen M.] Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Zahirovic-Herbert, Velma] Univ Georgia, Dept Housing & Consumer Econ, 213 Dawson Hall, Athens, GA 30602 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; University of Georgia,"Smith, PS (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Dept Real Estate, POB 3991, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",psmith44@gsu.edu; kgibler@gsu.edu; vherbert@uga.edu,,"zahirovic-herbert, velma/0000-0003-3552-3912",,,,,39,1,2,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The author compares these trends with the Western conservative tradition, making distinct parallels between the two strands of conservative thought. The author also explores the attitude of Russian conservatism toward the post-modern world. This is intrinsically linked to the discussion of Russia's attempts to develop a political and ideational alternative to the West, introduce a distinct model for the architecture of international relations, and find Russia's position in the global world.","[Chebankova, Elena] Lincoln Univ, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, England",University of Lincoln,"Chebankova, E (通讯作者)，Lincoln Univ, Sch Social & Polit Sci, Lincoln, England.",echebankova@lincoln.ac.uk,,,,,,,104,20,20,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

We believe that these perceptions are one of the sociocultural determinants of birth rates. Our research showed that there are clear country differences both in the students' reproductive intentions and their ideas about parenthood. Austrian respondents were characterised by the lowest reproductive intentions - they wanted the least number of children and they planned to become mothers later than their counterparts in other countries. Austrian students had the most depressing ideas about parenthood. Young women from Kazakhstan had the highest reproductive intentions and planned to become parents at the earliest age.

The evidence suggests that IO experts embedded a bland reformism opposed to both strong and 'light touch' regulation at the core of the emerging regulatory regime. Technocrats reinforced each other's expertise, excluded some potential competitors (legal scholars), coopted others (select Fed and elite academic economists), and deployed measurement, mandate, and status strategies to assert issue control. In the field of shadow banking regulation, academic economists' influence came from their credibility as arbitrageurs between several professional fields rather than their intellectual output. The findings have important implications for how we study the relationship between IO technocrats and experts from other professional fields.","[Ban, Cornel; Freitas, Sarah] Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Sch Global Studies, Polit Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Seabrooke, Leonard] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Copenhagen, Denmark",Boston University; Copenhagen Business School,"Ban, C (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Frederick S Pardee Sch Global Studies, Polit Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,"Seabrooke, Leonard/F-7091-2013; Ban, Cornel/P-4757-2019","Seabrooke, Leonard/0000-0001-5581-3293;","Boston University's Center for Law, Policy and Finance; European Commission [649456]; H2020 Societal Challenges Programme [649456] Funding Source: H2020 Societal Challenges Programme","Boston University's Center for Law, Policy and Finance; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); H2020 Societal Challenges Programme(Horizon 2020European Union (EU)H2020 Societal Challenges Programme)","Boston University's Center for Law, Policy and Finance; European Commission Research Director General, Horizon 2020 Framework Program, 2015-2018 - 'European Legitimacy in Governing through Hard Times - ENLIGHTEN [grant number 649456].",,104,59,59,2,30,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

It makes an important methodological contribution by utilizing a hedonic regression approach to estimate household-specific capital gains instead of relying on house-price indices and other proxy measures that have been widely used in earlier literature. The results suggest that household consumption expenditures are increasing in the level of accrued capital gains on housing, and that the sustainability of these gains is important for the magnitude of this relationship. When the level of accrued capital gains is persistent over time, total household consumption increases by approximately 5.4 cents for every dollar of permanent capital gains and non-durable consumption increases by approximately 3.9 cents. Estimates of marginal propensity to consume for households in different age categories and other subgroups are also presented. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Production Sharing contracts come in a variety of styles. There are two parties to the contract, a foreign oil company and a government representative which can be a head of state, a ministry or a national oil company The latter is the more common case. On the side of the foreign contractor we frequently find joint ventures or consortia rather than an individual firm but they all are considered to be one party to the contract so they must agree on the details of their cooperation because, in the end they as partnership assume all costs and risks associated with the exploration and production of oil and gas. In the event that a commercial discovery is made, the international oil company is entitled to a share of the production in order to recover all costs as well as to have a return on the investment. One of the main objectives of the Contract is to attract multinational companies in the sector of oil and gas that are interested and willing to risk capital and utilize technological expertise to develop the reserves in the Country. Namely, most of hydrocarbons reserves are located in developing countries without technical skills (seismic surveys, drilling wells, production techniques) nor financial means (low access to capital markets) to efficiently exploit natural resources. Hence, governments often delegate the exploration and production activities to international extractive companies. Under the Concession regime the international oil company is the owner of the petroleum extracted from the soil. For the Production sharing Contract, on the other hand, the country is the owner of the oil. In this way, the contributions to the state are no longer through taxes and royalties, but the extracted oil is passed on to the state directly. Part of the petroleum is then given to the international oil company as a compensation for its activities and the risks involved with the exploration. Although the oil belongs to the State, the companies take the risks. However, the State can also take risks by allowing part of its profit to be used to develop the area. In the paper special emphasis is given to the following questions: Parties and Instruments of Contracts, Ownership of Production, Ownership of Installation, Responsibilities of International oil companies and the Government.","[Brnabic, Ratko] Fac Law, Split, Croatia",,"Brnabic, R (通讯作者)，Fac Law, Split, Croatia.",rbrnabic@pravst.hr,"Brnabić, Ratko/H-2819-2017",,,,,,14,0,0,1,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,151,160,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400015,0

We focus on the fundamental setting of bilateral trade, which in its simplest form involves a seller with a single item to price, a buyer whose value for the item is drawn from a common prior distribution over n different possible values, and a take-it-or-leave-it-offer protocol. A mediator with access to the buyer's type may partially reveal such information to the seller in order to further some objective such as the social welfare or the seller's revenue. We study how a limit on the number of bits of communication affects this setting in two respects: (1) How much does this constraint reduce the optimal welfare or revenue? (2) What effect does constraining communication have on the computational complexity of the mediator's optimization problem? In the setting of maximizing welfare under bilateral trade, we exhibit positive answers for both questions (1) and (2). Whereas the optimal unconstrained scheme may involve n signals (and thus log (n) bits of communication), we show that O (log (n) log 1 1/is an element of) signals suffice for a 1 - is an element of approximation to the optimal welfare, and this bound is tight. This largely justifies the design of algorithms for signaling subject to drastic limits on communication. As our main result, we exhibit an efficient algorithm for computing a M-1/M . (1-1/e)- approximation to the welfare-maximizing scheme with at most M signals. This result hinges on an intricate submodularity argument which relies on the optimality of a greedy algorithm for solving a certain linear program. For the revenue objective, the surprising logarithmic bound on the number of signals does not carry over: we show that Omega(n) signals are needed for a constant factor approximation to the revenue of a fully informed seller. From a computational perspective, however, the problem gets easier: we show that a simple dynamic program computes the signaling scheme with M signals maximizing the seller's revenue. Observing that the signaling problem in bilateral trade is a special case of the fundamental Bayesian Persuasion model of Kamenica and Gentzkow, we also examine the question of communication-constrained signaling more generally. Specifically, in this model there is a sender (the mediator), a receiver (the seller) looking to take an action (setting the price), and a state of nature (the buyer's type) drawn from a common prior. The state of nature encodes both the receiver's utility and the sender's objective as a function of the receiver's action. Our results for bilateral trade with the revenue objective imply that limiting communication to M signals can scale the sender's utility by a factor of O (M/n) in general, where n denotes the number of states of nature. We also show that our positive algorithmic results for bilateral trade do not extend to communication-constrained signaling in the Bayesian Persuasion model. Specifically, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the optimal sender's utility to within any constant factor in the presence of communication constraints.","[Dughmi, Shaddin; Kempe, David; Qiang, Ruixin] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",University of Southern California,"Dughmi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",shaddin@usc.edu; dkempe@usc.edu; rqiang@usc.edu,,,,,,,28,11,15,0,4,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,663,680,,10.1145/2940716.2940781,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300058,0

Based on a unique set of data on apprenticeships between 1710 and 1772, we show that both the number of apprentices and their share in the cohort of the fifteen year-olds increased in response to inventions. The strongest response was in the highly skilled mechanical trades. These results suggest that technological change in this period was skill biased due to the expansion of the machinery sector they induced.

Our observation model takes a form common in assortment planning applications: each arriving customer is offered an assortment consisting of a subset of all possible offerings; we observe only the assortment and the customer's single choice. In this paper we propose a mixture choice model with a natural underlying low-dimensional structure, and show how to estimate its parameters. In our model, the preferences of each customer or segment follow a separate parametric choice model, but the underlying structure of these parameters over all the models has low dimension. We show that a nuclear-norm regularized maximum likelihood estimator can learn the preferences of all customers using a number of observations much smaller than the number of item-customer combinations. This result shows the potential for structural assumptions to speed up learning and improve revenues in assortment planning and customization. We provide a specialized factored gradient descent algorithm and study the success of the approach empirically.","[Kallus, Nathan; Udell, Madeleine] Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Kallus, Nathan] Cornell Tech, New York, NY 10011 USA",Cornell University,"Kallus, N (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Sch Operat Res & Informat Engn, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.;Kallus, N (通讯作者)，Cornell Tech, New York, NY 10011 USA.",kallus@cornell.edu; mru8@cornell.edu,,"Udell, Madeleine/0000-0002-3985-915X",,,,,36,7,11,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,821,837,,10.1145/2940716.2940794,0.0,,,17,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300081,0

The case study demonstrates one part of director assistant selection. The selection process in this case is divided in three parts. As the first step, unsuitable candidates not satisfying necessary conditions are eliminated. As the second step, candidates are completing performance test. As the third step, three best candidates are interviewed by personnel manager and director. The case study focuses on the second part - the task completing as a performance test.

In this context, we use a general nonparametric multivariate regression framework to cope with several problems arising with linear regression approximation. To this end, we firstly reduce the dimensionality of the large-scale portfolio by performing a principal component analysis on the stock returns. Then, within k-fund separation model, we use different methodologies to approximate the portfolio returns. Finally, through an empirical analysis, we show the impact of regression estimation on the ex-post sample paths of several portfolio strategies. The proposed empirical analysis confirms that it is better using nonparametric regression rather than the classical parametric regression.","[Kouaissah, Noureddine] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Kouaissah, Noureddine] VSB TU Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic",University of Bergamo; Technical University of Ostrava,"Kouaissah, N (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.;Kouaissah, N (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Ostrava, Czech Republic.",noureddine.kouaissah@unibg.it,"Kouaissah, Noureddine/IQV-1203-2023; Kouaissah, Noureddine/AAZ-1766-2021; Kouaissah, Noureddine/AFV-4864-2022","Kouaissah, Noureddine/0000-0002-8404-7863;",,,,,23,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,447,452,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500077,0

It is argued that the principal reason for Naval'nyi's success lies in his populist re-ordering of Putin's eclectic principles of people, patriotism and the rule of law. By simplifying the political space between 'us and them' under his anti-corruption activism Naval'nyi has managed to challenge the regime in its own terms. At the same time this straightforward style separates him from Russia's other political figures who have been unable to provide compelling ideas for larger oppositional mobilisation. In this respect, regarding Russia's weak political institutions, eclectic usage of political ideas and personalistic political culture, Naval'nyi appears to be a natural alternative.","[Lassila, Jussi] Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Lassila, J (通讯作者)，Univ Helsinki, Aleksanteri Inst, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",,,"Lassila, Jussi/0000-0001-5966-2947",Academy of Finland [284664]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [284664] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),Work on this essay was supported by the Academy of Finland (grant no. 284664).,,53,19,19,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,,2016,68.0,1.0,,,SI,,118,137,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1120276,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DL1UZ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375419400007,0

Not only was the eurozone economic crisis undermining both policy effectiveness and public support for the EU, but it was also seriously challenging the EU's image in global politics. The eurozone crisis, the Nobel Prize and the search for a ' new narrative for Europe ' demonstrate that the processes of European integration are always narrated as sense-making activities-stories people tell to make sense of their reality. This article argues in favour of a narrative approach to European integration through the construction and application of an analytical framework drawing on different theoretical perspectives. This framework is then applied to six European integration narratives to demonstrate the value of a narrative approach. The article concludes that narrative analysis provides a means of understanding both EU institutional and non-institutional narratives of European integration.","[Manners, Ian] Univ Copenhagen, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Murray, Philomena] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",University of Copenhagen; University of Melbourne,"Manners, I (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",ima@ifs.ku.dk,"Manners, Ian/AAF-7466-2021","Manners, Ian/0000-0002-1897-4896",,,,,57,72,72,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Unemployment in Slovakia has significant economic, social and political dimensions, as well as many socio-economic, regional, generational, ethnic and other specifics. Adverse effects of the crisis have affected mainly the category of disadvantaged persons, as well as some of the lagging regions of Slovakia. Unemployment in Slovakia is one of the most serious economic and social problems, which prevents the full realization of the growth potential of the economy, with regard to its structural nature. Slovakia is among the countries which are struggling with high long-term unemployment rate (over 12 months). During the whole period since in the Slovakia is real long-term unemployment known (end of 1992), its structure and causes have not been fundamentally changed. But it changed its scope and the duration of unemployment has increased as well as at the national level, and in individual regions. Serious and long-lasting economic and social problems are regional differences in unemployment. Unevenness in the distribution of the unemployment in different regions is linked not only to the historical development of the Slovak economy, but also with its modern, highly differentiated development, and despite economic recovery these differences remain significant. Nowadays, young people in the age group 15-24 years are the most vulnerable group in the labour market. The youth unemployment rate is generally higher than the overall unemployment rate. Creating inequalities in access to the labour market is largely due to lack of abilities, skills and work experience in own field of study that are currently unfolding barriers in access to the labour market. The aim of this paper is to assess developments in the labour market with an emphasis on unemployment and its structural characteristics, identify persistent problems and risk factors for the employment growth.","[Rievajova, Eva; Klimko, Roman] Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia",University of Economics Bratislava,"Rievajova, E (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Bratislava, Fac Natl Econ, Dolnozemska 1, Bratislava 85235, Slovakia.",eva.rievajova@euba.sk; roman.klimko@euba.sk,"Klimko, Roman/AAR-3082-2020",,,,,,9,1,1,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,498,507,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400051,0

For the Russian round, we surveyed young women from five Russian universities. Our research revealed the following. Firstly, reproductive intentions among female university students are quite low. Secondly, we identified objective determinants of the women's reproductive intentions. These include where the young woman lived before starting university and the size of her parental family. Thirdly, we discovered subjective determinants of reproductive intentions: the girls' perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of parenthood, and the significance of children in one's life. Through our research we concluded that reproductive intentions are significantly influenced by subjective factors, namely ideas about family and parenthood. In turn, they are shaped by social norms and stereotypes, and the young women's experiences growing up. As such, studying family practices and parenting culture to identify types and scope for transformation towards a strengthening of reproductive intentions looks promising. Moreover, potentially damaging demographic trends can be mitigated through changing social norms and stereotypes.","[Shubat, Oksana; Bagirova, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Shubat, O (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",o.m.shubat@urfu.ru; a.p.bagirova@urfu.ru,"Bagirova, Anna/M-7440-2013; Shubat, Oksana/M-7443-2013","Bagirova, Anna/0000-0001-5653-4093; Shubat, Oksana/0000-0002-0929-8144",,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1637,1646,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100162,0

An exact measurement is a very questionable and difficult task. The main goal of this paper is to compare applications of DEMATEL and WINGS method used for the CSR performance measurement, identify possible relations among selected CSR activities from a managerial point of view according to results of those methods and determine key factors of successful CSR strategy for banking organizations. Both methods belong to multiple-attribute decision-making methods (MADM methods) that are based on a usage of pairwise comparisons. Results show that the economic field is the most important factor, while safety, ethical codes, ecological innovations, management and certifications, and employee welfare belong to the key CSR criteria.","[Stankova, Stepanka] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Stanková, S (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121 1, Czech Republic.",stepanka.stankova@vsb.cz,"Staňková, Štěpánka/I-9361-2018","Staňková, Štěpánka/0000-0002-1214-025X",,,,,14,0,0,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1713,1722,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100170,0

It then argues that Nazi Germany's racial war radicalised national tensions in Vojvodina. Nazi defeat resulted in the brutal expulsion of Vojvodina's Germans, making Serbs for the first time a majority. Consequently, the region's claim to autonomous status after the war clashed with the national-territorial principle applied to federalism by the victorious Communist Party of Yugoslavia, causing frequent friction and instability.","[Unkovski-Korica, Vladimir] Univ Glasgow, Legacies Communism Cent & Eastern European Studie, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 8-9 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Unkovski-Korica, V (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Legacies Communism Cent & Eastern European Studie, Sch Social & Polit Sci, 8-9 Lilybank Gardens, Glasgow G12 8RZ, Lanark, Scotland.",vladimir.unkovski-korica@glasgow.ac.uk,,"Unkovski-Korica, Vladimir/0000-0002-4582-9651","Centre of Advanced Studies at the National Research University-Higher School of Economics, Moscow; School of History at the National Research University-Higher School of Economics, Moscow","Centre of Advanced Studies at the National Research University-Higher School of Economics, Moscow; School of History at the National Research University-Higher School of Economics, Moscow","For help on the way, thank you to Jovo Bakic, Zivan Berisavljevic, Sara Bernard, Milivoj Beslin, Cathie Carmichael, Dejan Djokic, Franziska Exeler, Mary Heimann, Vladimir Ilic, and to Alexander Kamenskii, Sinisa Korica, Judit Molnar, Jana Osterkamp, Dragan Plavsic, Anita Prazmowska and David Smith.

Therefore, not only has the dual mission as conventional microfinance (financial and social intermediation), Islamic microfinance also has a spiritual mission (spiritual intermediation) as a manifestation of Islamic principles which is based and a real differentiator compared to MFIs. This study is the first empirical study to explore and establish the concept of spiritual intermediation of Islamic microfinance (IMFI) towards the concept of triple mission of MFI (i.e. financial, social and spiritual intermediation). The study used a qualitative approach with qualitative interviews and focus group discussions to 32 administrators, managers and field staff of 12 Baitul Maal wattamwil (BMT) in the city of Jambi and Kendari. The result shows that there is a spiritual intermediary conducted by BMT in the form of spiritual practice, spiritual education and spiritual training. Spiritual practice is done in two forms of activities, 1) the daily behavior of the individual/staff in accordance with Islamic principles as exemplary forms and then into the corporate culture, and 2) the behavior of the organization in accordance with Islamic principles (Sharia compliance). Spiritual education and spiritual training have been programmed by BMT, although spiritual education is still done on a limited scale, incidental, and adapted to the conditions and needs of BMT. Spiritual training, however, has not been done at all. This is due to the lack funding, expertise and network. Therefore, a planned effort and synergy needs to be done by IMFI and all stakeholders, especially the Syariah economic community (MES) to strengthen this spiritual mission, so that the mission as a whole held together with financial and social mission.

Based on established theories and extensive researches on existing literatures, it can be deduced that: firstly, entrepreneurial motivation can influence risk decision making. Entrepreneurs who are necessity-driven are more inclined to avoid risk while those who are driven by growth and challenge are more inclined to seek risk. Secondly, risk perception can act as a mediator between entrepreneurial motivations and the risk decision making process. Finally, entrepreneurial self-efficacy has a potential moderator effect between entrepreneurial motivations and risk perception as well as between entrepreneurial motivations and risk decision making. The analysis presented by the paper provides a fresh and meaningful look into the risk decision making process and they could be a sound source for further empirical studies.","[Yang, Junping; Wu, Kuangjian] Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang Sci-Tech University,"Yang, JP (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Sci Tech Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",jpyangjlu@163.com; wkj412@126.com,"XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023",,,,,,32,1,2,3,12,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-273-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,75.0,,,,,,1,5,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391653700001,0

The step distances of the last two steps of the most elite athletes in the world were large-small, while these of the Chinese elite male long jumpers were small-large, which resulted in a loss of horizontal speed; the takeoff sector angle of the Chinese elite male long jumpers was bigger than that of the most elite athletes in the world, which led to a loss of vacating height.

A certain analogy to the issues dealt with in insurance is noticeable. The probability structure of a multistate model is determined in a similar way as in the case of insurance. This approach allows us to determine the expected value and variance of treatment costs calculated with regards to the probability distribution estimated on the basis of treatment process history analysis. The multistate model presented in the paper allows us to analyze cost taking into account their structure.

Giving absolute priority to the worst-off imposes a sort of tyranny on the rest of the population, but giving less than absolute priority imposes a reverse form of tyranny where the worst-off may be sacrificed for the sake of small benefits to many well-off individuals. We formally show that this intriguing dilemma is more severe than previously recognised, and we examine how people negotiate such conflicts with a questionnaire-experimental study.

We show that higher government spending leads to real exchange rate appreciation and to a fall in net exports, jointly with lower primary budgetary surpluses, in line with the twin deficits hypothesis. Our results are consistent both with the home-bias hypothesis of public expenditure and with public investment contributing to generating relative productivity gains in the traded goods sector. Contrary to what is observed in the Euro Area, the real effective exchange rate depreciates in the USA in response to higher government spending. Such different behaviour is attributed to two factors, namely the leading role of the US dollar as a safe haven currency and the countercyclical behaviour of discretionary government spending in the USA.","[de Castro, Francisco] Banco Espana, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [de Castro, Francisco] Commiss European Communities, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium; [Garrote, Daniel] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"de Castro, F (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Rue Loi 200, B-1049 Brussels, Belgium.",fcastro@bde.es; Daniel_Garrote@hks15.harvard.edu,"de castro, francisco/JHU-5465-2023","de Castro, Francisco/0000-0002-8190-1796",,,,,46,7,9,0,12,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Based on three surveys conducted in 2009, 2011 and 2013, this paper examines changes in the perception of tourism's impact and the supportive attitude of the local residents. Suggestions are made for improving the development of tourism in Bama.","[Liu, Yaping] Guangxi Univ, Coll Business, Dept Tourism Management, 100 Coll Rd, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China; [Nie, Linlin] Shaanxi Inst Int Trade & Commerce, Xian, Shannxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fuqiang; Nie, Zhulan] Guangxi Univ, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China",Guangxi University; Guangxi University,"Liu, YP (通讯作者)，Guangxi Univ, Coll Business, Dept Tourism Management, 100 Coll Rd, Nanning 530004, Guangxi, Peoples R China.",553663686@qq.com; nielin-lin@outlook.com; 1057285682@qq.com; 296408621@qq.com,,"Nie, Linlin/0000-0002-7913-7450",National Natural Science Foundation of China [41061048],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We thank all the investigators who participated in the survey administration: Cuiqiao Wang, Hailin Liu, Yinchang Li, Xianli Shi, Bei Liao, Ziling Liao, Yanqiu Wu, Lina Shang.

Other studies have contributed to our understanding of apparently non-rational behaviour by examining how choices may reflect reference-dependent preferences. This paper examines how reference-dependent preferences and attitudes together may explain individual choices. In a modelling framework based on a hybrid choice model allowing for both concepts, we investigate how attitudes and reference-dependent preferences interact and how they affect willingness-to-pay measures and demand elasticities. Using a data set with stated choices among alternative-fuel vehicles, we see that allowing for reference-dependent preferences improves our ability to explain the stated choices in the data and that the attitude (appreciation of car features) explains part of the preference heterogeneity across individuals. The results indicate that individuals have reference-dependent preferences that could be explained by loss aversion and that these are indeed related to an individual's attitude towards car features. The models are validated using a large hold-out sample. This shows that the inclusion of attitudes improves the models' ability to explain behaviour in the hold-out sample. While neither reference-dependent preferences nor the attitude affect the average willingness-to-pay measures in our sample, their effect on choice behaviour has implications for policy recommendations as segments with varying attitudes and reference values will act differently when affected by policy instruments related to the demand for alternative-fuel vehicles, e.g. subsidies.

We provide applications that demonstrate the flexibility of PG-AS under these different circumstances and justify applying it in practice. We also combine discrete structural breaks within the stochastic volatility model framework. For instance, we model changing time series characteristics of monthly postwar US core inflation rate using a structural break autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model with stochastic volatility.

Survey data indicate that women from both types of universities in both countries sympathize with retraditionalization, or a return to traditional values, family life, and religion, which entails, in part, women being moved out of the work force. Thus far, there is no statistical evidence of this phenomenon in the literature. Sympathy for retraditionalization is unfolding in the context of ongoing economic uncertainty that has plagued Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan since the Soviet Union's collapse, and its manifestations produce political responses. I argue that Kyrgyz and Tajik elites push a particular gender norm implying female secularization to counter expressions of retraditionalization among young women. In conclusion, I highlight counterintuitive findings of the survey regarding Islam's role in Central Asian society and discuss collective versus individual acts of resistance to female secularization policies in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.","Univ Vermont, Dept Polit Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA",University of Vermont,"Commercio, ME (通讯作者)，Univ Vermont, Dept Polit Sci, Burlington, VT 05405 USA.",michele.commercio@uvm.edu,,,IREX (International Research and Exchange Board); APSA (American Political Science Association); NCEEER (National Council for Eurasian and East European Research),IREX (International Research and Exchange Board); APSA (American Political Science Association); NCEEER (National Council for Eurasian and East European Research),"This work was supported by IREX (International Research and Exchange Board), Short-Term Travel Grant, Summer 2008; APSA (American Political Science Association), Small Research Grant, Summer 2008; NCEEER (National Council for Eurasian and East European Research), Travel Grant, Summer 2005 (research conducted summer 2007).

However, it fell victim to social constructivism, from which it derived an exclusionary ontology perpetuating the dualism between norms and interests. To conceive those notions as two faces of the same coin, one needs a thicker ontology. This is what Bourdieu provides for in anchoring norms and interests in social fields. Interest is simultaneously what ties actors to particular games (generic interest) and what makes them make particular moves in these games (specific interest). To illustrate how Bourdieu's sociology shapes a better understanding of normative power Europe, I explore the transmission of EU's integrated border management in Central Asia. In this case, EU power elites delegate the business of wielding this normative power of Europe to a Vienna-based international street corner society.","[Martin-Maze, Mederic] Kings Coll London, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of London; King's College London,"Martin-Mazé, M (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept War Studies, London WC2R 2LS, England.",mederic.martin-maze@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,11,12,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this paper we observe the long-run impact of a short-term punishment institution (i.e., a crackdown) on bribery behavior in a lab setting. We conduct lab experiments in two countries with cultures that differ in corruption norms, and which experience very different levels of bribery: the US and Pakistan. Bribery is implemented in the laboratory as a repeated three-player sequential game, consisting of a firm, a government official and a citizen. The design contains three phases: pre-crackdown, crackdown, and post-crackdown. Results show that post-crackdown behavior is not significantly different from pre-crackdown behavior in either country. We conclude that short-term crackdowns may impact behavior in the short run, depending on the strength of the existing corruption norms in the country. More importantly, in our setting crackdowns are completely ineffective in the long run, as corrupt behavior rebounds to pre-crackdown levels.","[Banuri, Sheheryar] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, MC 3 356, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Eckel, Catherine] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, TAMU 4228, College Stn, TX 77845 USA",The World Bank; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Banuri, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp, MC 3 356, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",sbanuri@gmail.com,"Eckel, Catherine/AAF-2268-2020","Eckel, Catherine/0000-0003-1583-5214; Banuri, Sheheryar/0000-0002-8021-0299",National Science Foundation [NSF SES-0921884],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We are indebted to Klaus Abbink, Rachel Croson, Reuben Kline, Sherry Xin Li, Angela de Oliveira, Elizabeth Pickett, Wendy Mak, Eric McLester, Quoc Tran, participants of the Economic Science Association meetings in Tucson, AZ, and participants of the workshop on conflict experiments in Rennes, FR.

We propose that Experimental Economics methods can deliver data that uses real consequences and where the context can be varied by the researcher. The approach relies on the controlled manipulation of contexts, similar to what is done in the Stated Choice approach, but builds in actual consequences, similar to the Revealed Preference approach. This paper investigates some of the trade-offs between the cost of conducting Experimental Economics studies and the behavioral responses elicited. In particular, we compare responses to traditional lottery choice tasks to the route choice tasks in simulated driving environments. We also compare students (a low cost convenient participant pool) to field participants recruited from the driving population.

Depressed gas prices in recent years have made pure natural gas operations less profitable. The result is that liquids components in gas production have become increasingly important in ensuring the profitability of shale gas operations. In this paper we investigate whether the shale gas expansion, which has led to an increase in associated LPG production, has also affected the historically strong relationship between LPG and oil prices. Revealing the strength and stability of the LPG/oil relationship is relevant when it comes to the future profitability and development of the U.S. natural gas sector. Our results suggest that the LPG/oil relationship has weakened in recent years with a move towards cheaper liquids relative to oil. This is consistent with developments in the natural gas sector with increased liquids production. A consequence is that U.S. natural gas operations cannot automatically rely on high liquids prices to ensure profitability.","[Oglend, Atle; Osmundsen, Petter] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway; [Lindbaeck, Morten E.] Fondsfinans ASA, Oslo, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger,"Osmundsen, P (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, Stavanger, Norway.",atle.oglend@uis.no; mel@fondsfinans.no; petter.osmundsen@uis.no,,,Norwegian Research Council (Petrosam 2),Norwegian Research Council (Petrosam 2),"We are grateful to James L.

Their general conclusion is that commuting and health are negatively related. The validity of their findings, however, is questionable, given their lack of good identification strategies to correctly account for omitted variables. In this paper, we analyze this relationship using a large and unique nationally representative sample of Brazilian individuals, coupled with the use of propensity score matching techniques, and the application of an exhaustive set of standard falsification tests and sensitivity analysis that may prevent one from claiming a causal link between the two variables. Our results indicate that individuals with more than one hour of commuting appear to have statistically higher probability, ranging from 1.9 to 4.6 percentage points, of reporting bad health status when compared to a person whose commuting time is less than one hour.

Anticipating the controversy the agreement has sparked, EU trade policy-makers in the European Commission have put considerable effort into discursively framing the agreement on their terms. Drawing on computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of the agreement's likely impact, the central claim has been that the TTIP promises to deliver much-needed growth and jobs' without stretching the public purse at a time of austerity. Our main argument in this article, drawing on the insights of the economic sociologist Jens Beckert, is that these CGE models - and the figures they have produced - represent an important exercise in managing of fictional expectations'. The models make overly optimistic predictions about the ability of the EU and the USA to eliminate regulatory barriers to trade - which are unlikely to be realised in the face of considerable political opposition - and also downplay the potential deregulatory impact of an agreement. Rather than act as a reliable guide to future outcomes, we thus show that these models serve the pro-liberalisation agenda of the European Commission and other advocates of the TTIP.","[De Ville, Ferdi] Univ Ghent, Ctr European Union Studies, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Siles-Bruegge, Gabriel] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",Ghent University; University of Manchester,"De Ville, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Ctr European Union Studies, Univ Str 8, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",ferdi.deville@ugent.be; gabriel.siles-brugge@manchester.ac.uk,,"Siles-Brugge, Gabriel/0009-0004-6340-3218; De Ville, Ferdi/0000-0003-4415-758X",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC),UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Gabriel Siles-Brugge would also like to acknowledge the financial support of the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) in undertaking some of the theoretical work underpinning this article.,,62,21,23,0,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This article investigates whether what might be labelled soft power with a hard edge' instead amounts to a consistent policy strategy for the EU. The central argument is that the EU has turned a weakness into strength, and developed a set of tools that sharpen the way soft power is exercised in the energy sector. The article explores how soft power affects companies that come and play' on the EU market: the rules of the Single European Market (SEM) and how they affect external firms. It also assesses the long reach of the SEM: both the gravitational pull' the SEM exerts in the near aboard', and the EU's push' to facilitate the development of midstream infrastructure and upstream investment. The conclusion is that the EU regulatory state is emerging as an international energy actor in its own right. It limits the ways states like Russia can use state firms in the geopolitical game; and it exports its model into the near abroad, thus stabilizing energy supply and transit routes.","[Goldthau, Andreas] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Goldthau, Andreas; Sitter, Nick] Cent European Univ, Dept Publ Policy, Budapest, Hungary; [Sitter, Nick] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Dept Accounting Auditing & Law, Oslo, Norway",Harvard University; Central European University; BI Norwegian Business School,"Goldthau, A (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Belfer Ctr Sci & Int Affairs, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Sitter, Nick/HMP-5841-2023","Goldthau, Andreas C./0000-0001-9814-6152","EU FP7 largescale integrated research project GR:EEN Global Re-ordering: Evolution through European Networks, European Commission [266809]","EU FP7 largescale integrated research project GR:EEN Global Re-ordering: Evolution through European Networks, European Commission","The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the EU FP7 largescale integrated research project GR:EEN Global Re-ordering: Evolution through European Networks, European Commission [Project Number: 266809].

We examine the case of the emerging responsibility to protect norm (R2P) and argue that the EU's implementation has been more limited and slower than one would expect from the NPE procedural ethics of living by example'. We examine the potential reasons for this failure to live by example': the role of persuasion by norm entrepreneurs; the role of inducements and costs; the goodness of fit between R2P and existing EU norms; and the clarity of the norm. We find that the lack of goodness of fit and clarity of the norm are important factors, but argue that low levels of bureaucratic receptivity were the greatest obstacle.","[De Franco, Chiara] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark; [Meyer, Christoph O.] Kings Coll London, London WC2B 6LE, England; [Smith, Karen E.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Southern Denmark; University of London; King's College London; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Meyer, CO (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Dept European & Int Studies, Virginia Woolf Bldg,Kingsway 22, London WC2B 6LE, England.",christoph.meyer@kcl.ac.uk,"Meyer, Christoph/GRJ-4365-2022; De Franco, Chiara/ABE-8731-2020; Meyer, Christoph/AAG-5306-2020","Meyer, Christoph/0000-0001-5649-4124; De Franco, Chiara/0000-0001-9308-3148; Smith, Karen/0000-0002-2651-7193",Budapest Centre for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities; European Research Council (FORESIGHT) [202022]; European Research Council (ERC) [202022] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Budapest Centre for the International Prevention of Genocide and Mass Atrocities; European Research Council (FORESIGHT)(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The authors were members of the Task Force on EU Prevention of Mass Atrocities (2012-13), which published a report with recommendations (Task Force 2013).

We theorize that delegation and pooling are empirically as well as conceptually different. Delegation is an effort to deal with the transaction costs of cooperation which are greater in larger, broader, and correspondingly more complex organizations. Pooling reflects the tension between protecting or surrendering the national veto. This paper theorizes that delegation and pooling are constrained by two basic design features: a) the scope of an IO's policy portfolio and b) the scale of its membership. We test these hypotheses with a new cross-sectional dataset that provides detailed and reliable information on IO decision making. Our major finding is that the design of international organizations is framed by stark and intelligible choices, but in surprising ways. Large membership organizations tend to have both more delegation and more pooling. The broader the policy scope of an IO, the more willing are its members to delegate, but the less willing they are to pool authority.","[Hooghe, Liesbet; Marks, Gary] Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Hooghe, Liesbet; Marks, Gary] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Marks, G (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",marks@unc.edu,,,European Research Council [249543]; European Research Council (ERC) [249543] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This project is financed by the European Research Council Advanced Grant #249543 Causes and Consequences of Multilevel Governance.

This forecast prevents a tourism-based economy from maintaining positive growth rates in the long run. However, infrastructures, transportation networks, accommodation facilities and the variety of attractions can be broadened to increase the tourism carrying capacity. In this paper, innovation is the motor of carrying capacity growth. The model follows the tradition of R&D-based endogenous growth models and allows the long-run sustainability of economic growth in a tourism-specialized economy. Along a balanced growth path, the income from tourism grows at the same rate as the innovation, and the carrying capacity will grow as the rate of innovation surpasses the foreign economic growth rate. The long-term growth of the economy depends on the real exchange rate.","[Albaladejo, Isabel P.; Pilar Martinez-Garcia, Maria] Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos Econ & Empresa, Murcia 30100, Spain",University of Murcia,"Pilar Martínez-García, M (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Metodos Cuantitativos Econ & Empresa, Campus Espinardo, Murcia 30100, Spain.",pilarmg@um.es,"Albaladejo, Isabel P./F-2388-2016; Martínez-García, María Pilar/K-7693-2014","Albaladejo, Isabel P./0000-0001-7441-7392; Martínez-García, María Pilar/0000-0003-2845-9799","MEC [ECO2010-19830, ECO2013-45698, ECO2008-01551/ECON, ECO2011-24352]; FEDER; COST Action [IS1104]",MEC; FEDER(European Union (EU)Spanish Government); COST Action(European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)),"The authors acknowledge the support of MEC under projects ECO2010-19830 and ECO2013-45698 (first author) and ECO2008-01551/ECON and ECO2011-24352 (second author).

Economic theory suggests that industry clusters, defined as geographically concentrated groups of firms and supporting institutions in related industries, enhance industry productivity and regional prosperity, relative to nonclustered industries. This concept, although widely used, has been insufficiently evaluated. In particular, questions remain about the extent to which cluster strategies are associated with beneficial outcomes for employees in clustered industries. Using a population-wide panel of individual-level quarterly wage and industry data covering the period 2003-2010 for the state of Washington, this research measures the association of industry cluster membership with the employment status, wage levels, and wage growth rates of individual employees in counties in the state.

The empirical analysis utilizes a large and unique data set of distressed commercial mortgages. The data set is constructed based on the recent financial crisis and includes portfolio and securitized loans. The main hypotheses address the marginal impact of portfolio versus securitized loans on the likelihood of resolution, resolution outcome, time to resolution and capital recovery rates. Conditional on a loan becoming troubled, we find that distressed commercial real estate loans held in a portfolio are more likely to be resolved and experience higher foreclosure rates compared to those that are securitized. Furthermore, portfolio loans experience shorter time to resolution and higher capital recovery rates when resolution is relatively swift. Our study is intended to contribute to the growing literature on distressed asset resolution and to provide new perspectives on how different lending options impact the financial resolution and workout process in a distressed commercial mortgage market.","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Xu, Pisun (Tracy)] Univ Denver, Reiman Sch Finance, Daniels Coll Business, Denver, CO 80208 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; University of Denver,"Downs, DH (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",dhdowns@vcu.edu; pxu@du.edu,,,Kornblau Institute at VCU,Kornblau Institute at VCU,"We thank Brent Ambrose, Xudong An, David T.

It identifies a positive association between access to these routes and the total minutes of any form of cycling, and the number of days that cycling takes place primarily for recreational purposes. The broader physical activity of individuals also has a positive association with cycling. Walking appears most likely to be complementary to non-recreational cycling, whilst participation in sport with all forms of cycling, but not with longer duration utilitarian trips. The research also indicates that access to NCN routes has the potential to increase such cycling further, with the exception of longer utilitarian trips, as does a more physically active lifestyle, particularly walking. The main policy implications of the research are to recognise that cycling is intrinsically linked to other physical activity, notably, walking, but that the NCN routes measured in this study primarily support longer duration recreational activity, which is also affected by sporting activity. This suggests that one avenue for achieving the health benefits of cycling may be through promoting NCN routes to harness a more generally active lifestyle and particularly in leisure, whilst sustainability may be further promoted through being linked more to other active travel such as walking. There is a therefore a need to exploit the potential of such NCN route provision as part of this promotion. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, gender differences regarding work interference with the family and family interference with work are examined on a strain-based and time-based level. The multivariate results reveal a differentiated but surprisingly non gendered picture of the effect of self-employment and job flexibility regarding work-family conflict. Due to greater flexibility, self-employed people perceive a slightly lower time-based work-to-family conflict while their strain-based work-to-family conflict is higher than among employees. Regarding family-to-work conflict, self-employment leads to a higher level of time-based conflict, possibly because of higher expectations regarding availability. Thus, self-employment can be seen as a demand or a resource depending on the type of conflict. This study therefore contributes to a more refined understanding of the role of flexibility and self-employment in the light of literature on demands and resources.","[Koenig, Stefanie] Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, Mannheim, Germany; [Koenig, Stefanie] Univ Mannheim, Fac Social Sci, D-668131 Mannheim, Germany; [Cesinger, Beate] Groupe Sup Co Montpellier Business Sch, Entrepreneurship, Montpellier, France",University of Mannheim,"König, S (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Mannheim Ctr European Social Res MZES, A5,6, D-668131 Mannheim, Germany.",stefanie.koenig@mzes.uni-mannheim.de,,"Cesinger, Beate/0000-0001-5168-8966",German Federal Ministry of Education and Research; European Social Fund,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF)); European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),Funding for the research project 'Dual-careers through self-employment?' was provided by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and the European Social Fund.,,79,39,43,4,97,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

For example, is the male household head more likely to start using the bicycle if the female household head also uses the bicycle (and vice versa)? While this is a straightforward question, it has, to the best of the author's knowledge, not been explored in previous research. Using data from 958 couples from the German Mobility panel, the bidirectional effects between the travel patterns of male and female household heads are explored. To this end, the relatively new method of latent class transition analysis is used. The results show that, over time, travel pattern membership of the male household head influences travel pattern membership of the female household head and vice versa. Given that the effects are controlled for a range of individual and shared household characteristics, these results suggest that social norms at the household level play an important role. The paper concludes with an outlook on how the developed framework can be extended in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results suggest that a significant lead-lag relationship exists between the lagged returns of big REITs and the current returns of small REITs. This relationship has slightly decreased along with policy and environment changes that occurred in the U.S. REIT market during the study period from 1986 to 2012, while still remaining significant in the most recent REIT market. The process of information diffusion is becoming unstable in recent years and the reverse lead-lag effect from small REITs to big REITs is observed especially when REIT market liquidity and return volatility are high. The lead-lag effect among REITs is driven largely by slow adjustment to negative information, which is magnified by a lack of information supply, especially as demand for such information increases. Finally, information flow from REITs with more media coverage to those with less media coverage becomes even more sluggish than the information flow from big REITs to small REITs.","Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, Singapore 117566, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Mori, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Sch Design & Environm, Dept Real Estate, 4 Architecture Dr, Singapore 117566, Singapore.",rstmm@nus.edu.sg,"Mori, Masaki/GOK-0275-2022; Mori, Masaki/J-9362-2013","Mori, Masaki/0000-0003-3269-0715; Mori, Masaki/0000-0003-3269-0715",,,,,40,8,10,2,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The debate on reform is dominated by a liberal narrative that employs an understanding of energy subsidies as political rent, based on public choice theory. Here, it is argued that this approach takes too static and limited a view of rent, and that engagement with theories of the state in the development process suggests a more dynamic view. The degree of centralisation of political power is also argued to be a key factor in the use and reform of subsidy. This application of the framework is then illustrated in the case of Indonesia. Finally, implications for reform strategies are drawn out.","Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England",University of Exeter,"Lockwood, M (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Energy Policy Grp, Peter Lanyon House,Treliever Rd, Penryn TR10 9EZ, Cornwall, England.",m.lockwood@exeter.ac.uk,,"Lockwood, Matthew/0000-0003-2380-3300",EPSRC [EP/K001582/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K001582/1] Funding Source: researchfish,EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),,,92,56,58,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Fringe benefits offered to employees are a means to implement those measures. This paper explores the most common commuting-related fringe benefits currently provided by employers in the Netherlands, namely telework, flextime and allowance types like public transport passes, bicycle contribution, company cars and general financial compensation. By using the Dutch National Time Use Survey (TBO) 2005/2006, interrelationships among fringe benefits and correlations between company, employee, and (home and work) location characteristics and those employee benefits could be investigated. Logistic regressions and Tobit models are used for several estimations indicating the provision and the use of fringe benefits. The results show that relationships among fringe benefits exist, mainly between telework and flextime, but also between those flexible work arrangements and some types of commuting allowance. Furthermore, numerous job, person and geographical variables affect the probability of receiving and using the fringe benefits. For example, in the non-profit and the public sector sustainable commuting benefits are more often provided, the use of fringe benefits is strongly influenced by household composition and several allowance types show a significant correlation with the number of cars in the household. Moreover, firm location, in particular firm density, is highly related to mobility management measures taken by firms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

One promising mechanism under consideration is the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). This study analyzes and benchmarks the economic implications of two alternative ETS mechanisms, namely, an open ETS compared to a Maritime only ETS (METS). The analytical solutions and model calibration results allow us to quantify the impacts of alternative ETS schemes on the container shipping sector and the dry bulk shipping sector. It is found that an ETS, whether open or maritime only, will decrease shipping speed, carrier outputs and fuel consumption for both the container and dry bulk sectors, even in the presence of a wind-fall profit to shipping companies. Under an open ETS, the dry bulk sector will suffer from a higher proportional reduction in output than the container sector, and will thus sell more emission permits or purchase fewer permits. Under an METS, container carriers will buy emission permits from the dry bulk side. In addition, under an METS the degree of competition within one sector will have spill-over effects on the other sector. Specifically, when the sector that sells (buys) permits is more collusive (competitive), the equilibrium permit price will rise. This study provides a framework for identifying the moderating effects of market structure and competition between firms on emission reduction schemes, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the differential impacts of ETS schemes on individual sectors within an industry when considering alternative policies.

The dataset is taken from the Households' Expenditures Survey (2008) and the Annual Statistical Yearbook (2008) of Iran. I have conducted the parameters estimation and hypothesis testing using switching regression technique to catch the presence of the widespread non-participation of spouses across Iranian households. Reduced forms of labor supply are estimated considering the endogeneity of wage rates. The findings show that the unitary model of resource allocation and the collective model of decision process under Iranian civil procedure rules are strongly rejected, but the Pareto efficiency in the family resource allocation and validity of the specified model are confirmed. Furthermore, the coherency condition of labor supply reduced forms is satisfied. The structural labor supplies are derived from the reduced forms, and they indicate that leisure is a normal good for spouses. They also show the cross elasticity of a wife's labor supply with respect to her husband's wage is negative. The calculated marginal effect of non-labor income on the wife's share is 0.76. The gender ratio and the divorce rate are both significant determinants of the sharing rule and the estimated coefficients of these variables are consistent with theoretical considerations.","Sharif Univ Technol, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran",Sharif University of Technology,"Haddad, GK (通讯作者)，Sharif Univ Technol, Grad Sch Management & Econ, Tehran, Iran.",g.k.haddad@sharif.edu,"K.Haddad, GholamReza/J-6809-2019; K.

When contracts between two agents within a firm are too costly to be written, the share of multinational firms may be higher or lower compared with a world without contractual frictions. The direction of change depends on the technologically required relative contribution of headquarter services in the joint production process. For example, in industries that use more inputs from the management unit as compared to inputs from a component supplier, the share of firms engaging in foreign direct investment is higher than under complete contracts. This effect may be so strong that the share of multinational firms increases in trade freeness.","[Seidel, Tobias] Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany; [Seidel, Tobias] CESifo, Munich, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen; Ifo Institut,"Seidel, T (通讯作者)，Univ Duisburg Essen, Mercator Sch Management, Duisburg, Germany.",,,,,,,,22,1,1,0,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUN,2015,38.0,6.0,,,,,899,912,,10.1111/twec.12256,0.0,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CL1AV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356675500001,0

Engaging with emergent theories of shadow banking, I inquire into its structural role in contemporary capitalism. My main premise here is that the crisis of 2007-9 is distinct in financial history because it did not centre on any organised market. Rather, it was crisis of the overcrowded financial channels bridging the present and the future, which have become congested because of the massive concentration of financial values generated, yet not sustained, through the shadow banking network. My analysis suggests that shadow banking has determined the nature of financial crisis of 2007-9 and continues to play a necessary role in financial capitalism based on futurity. Drawing on scholarship in financial Keynesianism, contemporary legal studies and early evolutionary political economy, I argue that shadow banking is best seen as the organic institutional infrastructure of financialised capitalism based on debt and geared towards futurity, a concept originally developed by John Commons.","City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, London EC1 0HB, England",City University London,"Nesvetailova, A (通讯作者)，City Univ London, Dept Int Polit, Room D601,Northampton Sq, London EC1 0HB, England.",a.nesvetailova@city.ac.uk,,,,,,,77,32,34,2,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

These are the theory of government, the definition of interest, and the interaction between public opinion and the formation of citizenship.","Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Triangle UMR 5206, F-69342 Lyon, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite Gustave-Eiffel; Institut National de Recherche sur les Transports et leur Securite (INRETS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Paris-VIII; Universite Paul-Valery,"Pénigaud, T (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Triangle UMR 5206, 15 Parvis Rene Descartes,BP 7000, F-69342 Lyon, France.",theophile.penigaud@ens-lyon.fr,"Théophile, Pénigaud/AAA-5313-2020","Penigaud de Mourgues, Theophile/0000-0002-1760-8608",,,,,38,3,3,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

From a democratic point of view, national MB representatives' accountability may constitute a possible additional source of legitimacy for these technocratic bodies. From the perspective of European integration, their relationship with national institutions tells us about the status of EUAs and the extent to which their MBs constitute an intergovernmental control tool in the hands of the Member States. Contrary to their formal design, the collected data suggest that MBs have a rather supranational, technocratic character. With regard to their contribution to EUAs' democratic accountability, although the general level of accountability is high, the findings are more diverse. However, rather than reflecting control intentions by the Member States, different levels of accountability can best be explained by functional and institutional rather than strategic factors.","[Buess, Michael] Univ Lucerne, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland",University of Lucerne,"Buess, M (通讯作者)，Univ Lucerne, Dept Polit Sci, Frohburgstr 3,POB 4466, CH-6002 Luzern, Switzerland.",michael.buess@unilu.ch,,,National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR); Swiss National Science Foundation,National Centre for Competence in Research (NCCR)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"A previous version of this article has been presented at the NCCR Workshop in Grindelwald in June 2013 and at the ECPR General Conference in Bordeaux in September 2013.

This method will not identify all forms of discrimination, but will determine whether women were paid wages commensurate with their productivity. There was no significant difference between the wage ratio and the productivity ratio in the nineteenth century, but in 1900 there is evidence of gender discrimination among white-collar workers. In 2002 the female-to-male productivity ratio was higher than in the nineteenth century, and the wage ratio was also higher, but the wage ratio was significantly lower than the productivity ratio, at least for workers older than thirty-five. The movement from the spot labor markets of the nineteenth century to the internal labor markets has allowed for the emergence of gender wage discrimination.","Wabash Coll, Dept Econ, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA",,"Burnette, J (通讯作者)，Wabash Coll, Dept Econ, Crawfordsville, IN 47933 USA.",burnettj@wabash.edu,,,McLain-McTurnan-Arnold Fellowship from Wabash College,McLain-McTurnan-Arnold Fellowship from Wabash College,"I am grateful for all the help I received from many sources, including Jeremy Atack, Frank Howland, Peter Mikek, and participants in seminars at UC Davis, IUPUI, Columbia University, and the Chicago Fed.

However, there have been relatively few efforts to identify the conditions that prompt individuals to consider the EU when deciding to participate or when casting a ballot. This article theorizes that individuals from decentralized political systems are more keenly aware of the distribution of functional responsibilities within the EU and are thus more likely to vote on EU-relevant concerns in EP elections. The results from analyses of survey data from the 2009 European Election Study, together with contextual measures of decentralization, suggest that individuals from decentralized systems are more likely to participate in EP elections and that vote-switchers are more likely to be motivated by evaluations of the EU's performance.","[Clark, Nicholas] Susquehanna Univ, Selinsgrove, PA 17870 USA",Susquehanna University,"Clark, N (通讯作者)，Susquehanna Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Steele Hall,514 Univ Ave, Selinsgrove, PA 17870 USA.",clarkn@susqu.edu,"Clark, Nicholas/GQB-4848-2022",,,,,,43,3,3,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Their recent popularity has occurred within the context of pessimism over aid's impact and optimism over the effect of changes in donor behaviour. Rankings of donor allocative performance aim to change donor behaviour, either through direct pressure on governments or indirectly through public engagement. The indices themselves rely on descriptive measures, and typically claim methodological superiority over positive alternatives due to their simplicity. However, there are two problems. First, measures do not seem robust to simple variations in methodology. Second, correlation amongst competing indices is low, leading to a host of contradictory judgements. This offers neither clear technical guidance nor consistent political pressure. The advantages and disadvantages of the approach are discussed, building upon the more general critique of aggregate indices. I suggest a graphical solution that embraces the advantages of the descriptive approach (including ease of public communication) while avoiding some of its major weaknesses (which typically stem from aggregation).","Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of East Anglia,"Clist, P (通讯作者)，Univ E Anglia, Sch Int Dev, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England.",,,"Clist, Paul/0000-0001-9338-9446",Economic and Social Research Council [PTA-026-27-2842]; ESRC [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I021353/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am pleased to acknowledge the support of the Economic and Social Research Council (grant number PTA-026-27-2842).

The safety management process undertaken by most states in the United States is referred to as Highway Safety Improvement Program and consists of three standardized steps: (i) identification of critical crash locations, (ii) development of countermeasures, and (iii) resource allocation among identified crash locations. Often these three steps are undertaken independently, with limited detail of each step at the state planning agencies. The literature review underlines the importance of the third step, and the lack of sophisticated tools available to state planning agencies for leveraging information obtained from the first two steps. Further, non-strategic approaches and unavailability of methods for evaluating policies may lead to sub-optimal funding allocation. This paper overcomes these limitations and proposes multiple optimal resource allocation strategies for improvements at urban intersections that maximize safety benefits, under budget and policy constraints. Proposed policy measures based on benefits maximization (economic competitiveness), equitable allocation (equity), and relaxation of mutually exclusiveness (multiple alternatives at one location) produce significantly different alternative and fund allocation. The proposed models are applied to selected intersections in four counties of southeast Michigan. Results reinforce the applicability of the strategies/policies and tools developed in this paper for safety project funding allocation on critical urban intersections. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

At the time, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) had supervisory power over BHCs, and under the Bank Holding Company Act was authorized to monitor and examine the subsidiaries of BHCs under certain circumstances. However, this authority did not clearly extend to routine examinations of nonbank subsidiaries of BHCs. This changed between 2007 and 2009 due to FRB policy on consumer compliance supervision for nonbank subsidiaries of BHCs. Our empirical analysis tests for the impact of the new policy on the quantity and quality of loan originations by mortgage banking subsidiaries of BHCs. We use a difference-in-differences estimator with the control group being other types of lenders. We show that loan production moved from mortgage banking subsidiaries to their affiliated depository institutions after the policy change. The quality of loans originated by mortgage banking subsidiaries of BHCs increased after the policy change: The denial rates for mortgage applications increased, loan-to-income ratios decreased, and the proportion of owner occupied houses increased in mortgage banking subsidiaries more than they did in other types of lenders.","[Downs, David H.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Richmond, VA 23284 USA; [Shi, Lan] Off Comptroller Currency, Enterprise Risk Anal Div, Washington, DC 20219 USA",Virginia Commonwealth University; United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,"Downs, DH (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, Kornblau Inst, Snead Hall,301 West Main St, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",dhdowns@vcu.edu; lan.shi@occ.treas.gov,,,Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University,Kornblau Institute at Virginia Commonwealth University,"We gratefully acknowledge the comments and suggestions of Joseph Nichols (our discussant), and other participants at the 2013 AREUEA National Conference in Washington, D.C.

A new role for street networks by modelling their configurational accessibility?,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Built environment; Land use; Street network; Configurational accessibility; Walkability; Pedestrian mobility,URBAN FORM; LAND-USE; TRAVEL; CONNECTIVITY; MOVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN,"The hypothesis of this paper is that some features of the built environment, particularly those concerned with the accessibility of the street network, could be associated with the proportion of pedestrians on all trips (modal split) found in different parts of a city. Quantitative analysis (bi-variate correlation and a multiple regression model) was used to establish the association between variables. The study area covered a substantial part of the metropolitan area in Madrid, Spain. Results showed a consistent influence of five particular indexes in the multi-variate model. Not surprisingly for this kind of research, four of them described density and mix of land uses. But perhaps more interestingly, the first one was a measure of the accessibility of the public space network, a less prominent variable in literature to date. This variable is called herein configurational accessibility, calculated using Space Syntax, an urban morphology theory. The relevance of configurational accessibility is probably related to its surprising ability to synthesize global and perceived properties of street networks at the same time. The findings introduce the idea that the configuration of the urban grid can influence the proportion of pedestrians (as a part of total trips in any transport mode) who choose to walk on single-journey trips. The discussion links with the current debate about walkability indexes and the need of empirical support for the chosen variables and also with transport planning. Because the relevance of the street network's role is not so easy to grasp, inputs from configurational theory and the pedestrian potential underlying this fact are also discussed at the end of the paper.

Housing's double meaning as home and asset further complicated the overall ideological mission of denaturalising bourgeois private property, and provided a basis for the continuing relevance of pre-communist legal ideologies and consciousness of property rights during this period.

Governments, business leaders and other elite agents are frantically searching for a new, more stable mode of accumulation. Arguably the most promising is what we call 'Accumulation by Conservation' (AbC): a mode of accumulation that takes the negative environmental contradictions of contemporary capitalism as its departure for a newfound 'sustainable' model of accumulation for the future. Under slogans such as payments for environmental services, the Green Economy, and The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, public, private and non-governmental sectors seek ways to turn the non-material use of nature into capital that can simultaneously 'save' the environment and establish long-term modes of capital accumulation. In the paper, we conceptualise and interrogate the grand claim of AbC and argue that it should be seen as a denial of the negative environmental impacts of 'business as usual' capitalism. We evaluate AbC's attempt to compel nature to pay for itself and conclude by speculating whether this dynamic signals the impending end of the current global cycle of accumulation altogether.","[Buscher, Bram] Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands; [Fletcher, Robert] Univ Peace, Dept Environm & Dev, Ciudad Colon, Costa Rica",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Büscher, B (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Inst Social Studies, Kortenaerkade 12, NL-2518 AX The Hague, Netherlands.",buscher@iss.nl; rfletcher@upeace.org,,,,,,,93,154,174,4,91,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Focusing on college graduates, we construct two direct measures of job matching based on how well an individual's job corresponds to their college education. Consistent with matching-based theories of urban agglomeration, we find evidence that larger and thicker local labor markets increase both the likelihood and quality of a job match for college graduates. We then assess the extent to which better job matching of college-educated workers increases individual-level wages and thereby contributes to the urban wage premium. We find that college graduates with better job matches do indeed earn higher wages on average, though the contribution of such job matching to aggregate urban productivity appears to be relatively modest.

Therefore it is important to understand the relationships between YLR and the factors which contribute to drivers' decision of YLR. This requires collecting a large amount of YLR cases. However, existing data collection method, which mainly relies on video cameras, has difficulties to collect a large amount of YLR data. In this research, we propose a method to study drivers' YLR behaviors using high-resolution event-based data from signal control systems. We used 8 months' high-resolution data collected by two stop-bar detectors at a signalized intersection located in Minnesota and identified over 30,000 YLR cases. To identify the possible reasons for drivers' decision of YLR, this research further categorized the YLR cases into four types: in should-go zone, in should-stop zone, in dilemma zone, and in optional zone according to the driver's location when signal turns to yellow. Statistical analysis indicates that the mean values of approaching speed and acceleration rate are significantly different for different types of YLR. We also show that there were about 10% of YLR drivers who cannot run through intersection before traffic light turns to red. Furthermore, based on a strong correlation between hourly traffic volume and number of YLR events, this research developed a regression model that can be used to predict the number of YLR events based on hourly flow rate. This research also showed that snowing weather conditions cause more YLR events. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The article explores these two directions. Assuming that voters have dichotomous preferences, it first characterizes approval voting in terms of its collective preference properties and then shows that these properties become incompatible if the collective preference is also taken to be dichotomous. As approval voting and majority voting happen to share the same collective preference function on the dichotomous domain, the positive result also bears on majority voting, and is seen to extend May's and Inada's early findings on this rule. The negative result is a novel and perhaps surprising version of Arrow's impossibility theorem, because the axiomatic inconsistency here stems from the collective preference range, not the individual preference domain.","[Maniquet, Francois] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium; [Maniquet, Francois] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Mongin, Philippe] CNRS, Paris, France; [Mongin, Philippe] HEC Paris, Paris, France",Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Warwick; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC) Paris,"Maniquet, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Louvain, Belgium.",francois.maniquet@uclouvain.be; mongin@greg-hec.com,,"Maniquet, Francois/0000-0003-1955-7995",,,,,19,16,17,0,9,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2015,44.0,3.0,,,,,519,532,,10.1007/s00355-014-0847-2,0.0,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CF0DY,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352214200004,0

We estimate decision models to explore three explanations for skew seeking choices: risk-loving (convex utility), optimism (concave probability weighting) and likelihood insensitivity (inverse s-shape probability weighting). We find no role for love for risk as neither students nor executives have convex utility. Both optimism and likelihood insensitivity play a part in skew seeking choices. Likelihood insensitivity is larger for students than for executives.

I apply the Kalman filter to a state-space representation of the second-order solution based on the 'pruning' scheme of Kim et al. (J Econ Dyn Control 32:3397-3414, 2008). By contrast to particle filters, no stochastic simulations are needed for the deterministic filter here; the present method is thus much faster; in terms of estimation accuracy for latent states it is competitive with the standard particle filter. Use of the pruning scheme distinguishes the filter here from the deterministic Quadratic Kalman filter presented by Ivashchenko (Comput Econ, 43:71-82, 2014). The filter here performs well even in models with big shocks and high curvature.","[Kollmann, Robert] Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Kollmann, Robert] CEPR, London, England; [Kollmann, Robert] Univ Paris Est, Creteil, France; [Kollmann, Robert] Australian Natl Univ, CAMA, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Kollmann, Robert] Fed Reserve Bank Dallas, Globalizat & Monetary Policy Inst, Dallas, TX USA",Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Universite Paris-Est-Creteil-Val-de-Marne (UPEC); Australian National University; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Dallas,"Kollmann, R (通讯作者)，Univ Libre Bruxelles, ECARES, 50 Av Franklin Roosevelt,CP 114, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.",robert_kollmann@yahoo.com,,,National Bank of Belgium; 'Action de recherche concertee' [ARC-AUWB/2010-15/ULB-11],National Bank of Belgium; 'Action de recherche concertee',"I am very grateful to three anonymous referees for detailed and constructive comments.

Despite their entry into paid employment, women still carry out more domestic work than men, limiting their ability to act on an equal footing within the workplace. This qualitative research adds to the ongoing debate concerning the reasons for the persistence of the gendered nature of domestic work, by comparing working women who earn more, those who earn around the same and those who earn less than their male partners, as well as examining women's absolute incomes. On average, men whose partners earn more than they do carry out more housework than other men, although women in these partnerships still do more. However, these women actively contest their male partner's lack of input, simultaneously doing' and undoing' gender. The article also identifies class differences in the sharing' of domestic work.","[Lyonette, Clare] Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Lyonette, C (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Inst Employment Res, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",C.Lyonette@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,118,142,2,56,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This paper expands the research in this field. First, the determinants of environmental and non-environmental innovations are analysed separately. Common factors are found to have different impacts on innovations of a different nature. Second, the role of varying innovation practices in hotel performance is studied. Non-environmental innovations and only some particular environmental innovations are found to have a positive impact on hotel performance, and to contribute to an understanding of their relative performance, even when controlling for quality or human capital variables. These results highlight the convenience of discriminating among innovation measures to guide hotel policies more efficiently. They also suggest that the environmental regulator may be required to intervene for those innovative measures that do not translate into hotels' self-interest, from a performance point of view.","[Tugores, Maria] Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Crta Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain; [Garcia, Dolores] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Dept Econ, GRIT, Reus 43204, Spain",Universitat de les Illes Balears; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Tugores, M (通讯作者)，Univ Illes Balears, Dept Econ Aplicada, Crta Valldemossa Km 7,5, Palma De Mallorca 07122, Spain.",mtugores@uib.es,"Tugores, Maria/L-2792-2017","Tugores, Maria/0000-0001-7542-4420","Ministry of Economy, Finance and Innovation of the Balearic Islands [PROGECIB-14B]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2010-18158]; Catalan Government's Research Group [2009-SGR-907]","Ministry of Economy, Finance and Innovation of the Balearic Islands; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Catalan Government's Research Group","Maria Tugores acknowledges financial support provided by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Innovation of the Balearic Islands through project PROGECIB-14B.

However, it is not known if the imperfectly reversible effects of jet fuel price are a result of asymmetries in the supply side, i.e., asymmetries in cost pass through from fuel prices to air fare, or of demand side behavioral asymmetries whereby people value gains and losses differently. This paper uses US time series data and decomposes air fare and fuel price into three component series to develop an econometric model of air transport demand that is capable of capturing the potential imperfectly reversible relationships and test for the presence or absence of reversibility. We find that air transport demand shows asymmetry with respect to air fare, indicating potential imperfect reversibility in consumer behavior. We also find evidence of asymmetry and hysteresis in cost passthrough from jet fuel prices to air fare, showing rapid increases in airfare when fuel prices increases but a slower response in the opposite direction.

This essay examines a category of largely under-studied youth social engagement in Russia: patriotic clubs for children, teenagers and young adults. These clubs do not come close to the stereotypes promoted by the state patriotic education programmes. There is a major gap between the activists' patriotic narratives and practices, and those expected by the Kremlin. The first part of the paper investigates the notion of 'patriotic club' as a broad umbrella that covers multiple activities and practices. Then it explores their meanings and three of their main functions, as a professional tool on the job market, a source of cultural capital, and a way to develop a depoliticised social engagement.","George Washington Univ, Inst European Russian & Eurasian Studies, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Laruelle, M (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Inst European Russian & Eurasian Studies, 1957 E St NW,Suite 412, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",laruelle@gwu.edu,"Laruelle, Marlene/AAN-1443-2020","Laruelle, Marlene/0000-0001-8289-2695",,,,,22,25,27,3,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 2,2015,67.0,1.0,,,SI,,8,27,,10.1080/09668136.2014.986965,0.0,,,20,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AZ9HU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348525400002,0

A survey was initiated in 2010, visiting 50 orchards in different regions of the country. In each orchard, symptoms were characterized and samples were collected from the affected organs. Isolations from symptomatic tissues were made on general and selective media and then the fungal isolates were transferred to PDA and V8-juice agar for morphological identification. Molecular identification was carried out on representative isolates by amplifying and sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Mycosphaerella citri, the causal agent of citrus greasy spot, was isolated from necrotic pustules on the leaves of trees showing chlorosis, and premature defoliation, which were observed in 75% of the surveyed orchards. This disease was found to be the prevalent fungal disease of citrus in Panama. Colletotrichum acutatum was consistently isolated from petals and from fruits that dropped prematurely from lime and sweet orange orchards and pathogenicity tests identified the isolates as the causal agent of Key lime anthracnose disease.

In the context of global crisis that has seriously affected cultural organizations, especially in Europe, the contemporary art market shows countertrend results. The art market, measured by auction results, has realized and is still realizing good and increasing performance, in terms of general sales and revenues. In particular, contemporary art represents a big business for auction operators, becoming one of the most profitable sectors in the art market. Despite this positive trend, contemporary art galleries are facing a difficult situation. With the exception of a handful of big galleries, many galleries generate only small profits and often they are compelled to close down their business. This apparently contradictory situation is strictly connected to the current business model of contemporary art galleries and underlines the need to rethink them in accordance with innovative ways of creation of social and economic value and fulfilment of a durable financial sustainability. Design/methodology/approach - The methodological approach combines the analysis of the literature with an empirical case study analysis. The goal is to explore the possibility of application of a successful business model in the field of contemporary art galleries. Consistently with this methodological approach, our paper is divided into three parts. In the first part we analyze the contemporary art market and the concept of business model in general, focusing on the current prevailing framework and the analysis of the literature on these subjects. In the second part we analyze a case of one of the most important Italian galleries: Galleria Continua. The in-depth examination of this case study leads to some evidence on the application of business strategy and management tools in the art galleries. More specifically the analysis of the business model of this art gallery is useful to identify a set of best practices. In the third and final part, in the light of what we have developed in the previous parts, we suggest some elements that could form the basis for innovation in the business model for contemporary art galleries. Originality/value - This paper aims at describing the present business model of contemporary art galleries and at proposing a new, sustainable one. In this sense, we think that this paper presents characteristics of originality. Moreover, another aspect of originality lies in the study of the role of an important reality of the cultural and creative sector, the contemporary art galleries. Especially in the Italian national context, the studies on contemporary art galleries are often considered secondary to those on traditional cultural organizations (like museums, theatres or heritage sites). Practical implications - The outcomes of the application are linked to the proposal of practical remarks for the evolution and development of business models for contemporary art galleries, as a new tool of creation of economic and social value in the cultural and creative sectors.","[Badia, Francesco; Lo Morello, Valentina Schiano] Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",University of Ferrara,"Badia, F (通讯作者)，Univ Ferrara, Dept Econ & Management, Via Voltapaletto 11, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy.",,"Badia, Francesco/ABD-6954-2020","Badia, Francesco/0000-0002-3484-5293",,,,,22,2,2,3,32,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1567,1581,,,,,,15,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200121,0

These settlements differ from other villages and living there provided better conditions for the inhabitants. In the agricultural settlements there were administrative buildings, residential buildings for seasonal workers, public and industrial buildings, but also area for sports and, according to plans, green infrastructure. On bigger settlements lived more than 50 families. After losing initial reasons of founding they started to disappear and decline in population. Lately few isolated, non-governmental groups expressed their intention to keep the memories referred to life in these settlements, wherein uniqueness of spatial and organizational way of life gets the cultural meaning. The settlements were underestimated until one of these building complexes has been inscribed on the list of Cultural Heritage. The aim of this research paper is to compare macro level as national level of producing and materialization of collective memories and micro level as local level on which narratives of collective memories appear. Overlapping of these levels gives an overview of possibilities and direction of development of symbols referring to Baranya's planned agricultural settlements.

A survey of representative US and Canadian consumers with questions including demographic, purchasing behavior, and attitude questions revealed varying perceptions of local, organic, eco-friendly, and sustainable terms based on gender. Respondents were shown a list of potential positive and negative characteristics that could be associated with the terms and then asked to choose any and all characteristics they associated with the specific term. For local and organic, which are governmentally regulated, a large percentage of consumers have incorrect perceptions. Notably, women tend to have incorrect perceptions about local while men are more likely to be wrong about organic. Women also tend to associate beneficial characteristics, which may or may not be true, with local and organic at a higher rate than males. With respect to eco-friendly and sustainable labels, which are not currently regulated, women are again more likely to associate beneficial characteristics with the terms at a higher rate than men. Taking these findings into account, policy makers wishing to change public perception need to develop strategies that are heterogeneous in nature. Implications for producers and retailers also suggest that producers and retailers should understand the makeup of their clientele and offer messages that target each segment accordingly.","[Campbell, B.

Since each region in China has different quality of institutions and growth rates, we look into provincial and city data for this investigation. The variables formal and informal institutions are added into the conventional cross-section growth equation. The quality of the formal (informal) institution is taken from an opinion survey on the effectiveness of city governance conducted by the World Bank in 2006 (can be measured by the share of township-and-village enterprise in each province during 1978-2002 or by the trust index from surveys). We conclude that it is the informal institution that drives the rapid growth in China.

This article answers this question by analysing the effect of the Dutch financial crisis of the 1920s on 142 banks, of which 33 failed. We find that choices of balance sheet composition and product market strategy made in the lead-up to the crisis had a significant impact on banks' subsequent chances of experiencing distress. We document that high-risk banks those operating highly-leveraged portfolios and attracting large quantities of deposits were more likely to fail. Branching and international activities also increased banks' default probabilities. We measure the effects of board interlocks, which have been characterized in the extant literature as contributing to the Dutch crisis. We find that boards mattered: failing banks had smaller boards, shared directors with smaller and very profitable banks and had a lower concentration of interlocking directorates in non-financial firms.

We see this as an opportunity to instantiate a new discourse on bottom-up governance, where the role played by the circulation and management of knowledge is at the same time crucial and displaying unexpected dynamics. Starting from the evidence that places, namely urban places, are more and more showing up as innovation drivers (Hou, 2010), the paper first describes the social streets phenomenon as an example of place-based innovation, then analyses three Italian cases, and finally discusses the relevance of spatial proximity for knowledge sharing and behavioural alignment, thus contributing to the theoretical and pragmatic debate on Urban Living Labs and related innovation processes. Design/methodology/approach - Social streets are informal associations of residents, living in the same street or in close urban proximities (blocks or neighbourhoods), aimed at establishing links, sharing needs, exchanging abilities or knowledge, and collaborating on shared projects, so as to reciprocally benefit from a deeper social interaction and collaboration. This paper explores social streets as innovative examples of place-based innovation. We first investigate the nature of social streets' innovation, in order to discover the role space has in it. Three specific cases are analysed in detail that differ to one another in having various origins, governance/organizational models and also spatial scales. These three dimensions are used as relevant to describe place-based innovation. Originality/value - The analysis conducted in this paper contributes to the theoretical discussion on Living Labs in general (Folstad, 2008; Stahlbrost, 2008; Svensson et al., 2010) and Urban Living Labs in particular (Concilio and Molinari, 2014; Concilio et al. 2013), by adding to the analysis of the specific role of urban space in user driven, open innovation environments, where users are no longer passive consumers of services but rather protagonists of real innovation, thanks to their being place dwellers,  owners and shapers. The proposed paper focuses on place-based innovation through the analysis of the social street phenomenon. In discussing alternative governance models of the related socio-digital environments, it suggests deepening the operational perspective of emerging, alternative models of urban government and management.","[Concilio, Grazia; Molinari, Francesco] Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Concilio, G (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept Architecture & Urban Studies, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 26, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",,,"MOLINARI, FRANCESCO/0000-0001-9141-3975",,,,,22,1,1,1,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2192,2203,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200172,0

This study aims at identifying: 1) the most significant issues addressed by researchers in the field of OI, giving specific reference to Intangible Assets; 2) the main results obtained so far in the field; 3) development and future directions of the research in this area. Design/methodology/approach - We have adopted a methodology that can be split into three separate phases: first, we have retrieved a large set of relevant publications by means of a keyword-based search from a scholar database. Second, we have identified a number of topics dealt within the selected literature. Third, we have created a hierarchical structure by grouping related topics into macro themes using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Originality/value - OI has become one of the most well-known concepts in Innovation Management studies. As a consequence, a great number of papers have been published in the last few years and several literature reviews have arranged this growing body of literature systematically. Also, a number of authors have underlined the importance of Intangible Assets for the success of OI strategies and the effectiveness of OI processes. This paper represents a first attempt to systematize the existing research on Intangible Assets in OI processes. The paper provides a clearer view of these issues and represents the first step in filling the research gap highlighted above. Practical implications - This paper has a number of implications not only for researchers, but also for practitioners. By means of this systematic literature review, it is possible to understand how firms effectively and efficiently participate in OI processes and how they can leverage their intangible assets to innovate and generate value. This paper tries to provide a more deep insight into the topic of intangible assets in OI by supporting firm managers and researchers in innovation management.","[Corvello, Vincenzo; Scarmozzino, Emanuela] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [De Mauro, Andrea] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Enterprise Engn, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Grimaldi, Michele] Univ Cassino, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy; [Grimaldi, Michele] Southern Lazio, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy",University of Calabria; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Cassino,"Grimaldi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino, Dept Civil & Mech Engn, Via G Di Biasio 43, I-03043 Cassino, FR, Italy.",,"Corvello, Vincenzo/AAI-2177-2021; De Mauro, Andrea/IQW-2016-2023; corvello, vincenzo/HLX-5143-2023","De Mauro, Andrea/0000-0001-9050-5018;",,,,,13,2,2,0,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,452,463,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200035,0

First, it aims at providing a reconstruction of Francesco Saverio Nitti's theory of the functioning of the labour market and economic development. It will be shown that Nitti's view is based on the conviction that the increase in production ultimately depends on State intervention, in the form of labour market regulation above all, while the increase in public debt has counterproductive effects. He predicts a wage-led growth regime which operates 'on the supply side', conceiving the functioning of a capitalist economy as intrinsically dynamic, and taking into account both purely economic arguments and sociological and psychological effects. Second, a reconstruction will be made of the links existing between Nitti's theories and his policy prescriptions. It will be shown that these ideas were at the basis of Italian economic policy at the beginning of the 20th century, with particular reference to public intervention aimed at contrasting the increasing inter-regional divergences between Southern and Northern Italy, labour market regulation and the management of public finance.","[Davanzati, Guglielmo Forges] Univ Salento, Dept Social Sci, Lecce, Italy; [Patalano, Rosario] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Law, Naples, Italy",University of Salento; University of Naples Federico II,"Davanzati, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Social Sci, Lecce, Italy.",guglielmo.forges@unisalento.it; rpatalan@unina.it,,,,,,,86,3,3,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Historically, inarching trees on susceptible rootstocks with others resistant conferred tree resistance against root and trunk diseases. Experiments were established in 2005 and 2007 to compare 'Valencia' trees propagated on (1) Rangpur lime, (2) Swingle citrumelo, or (3) inarched using these two rootstocks. Inarched trees had the same height as those on Rangpur lime alone and both types were taller than trees on Swingle citrumelo alone in the 5th year of the orchard. Trees grafted on Swingle tended to yield less fruit than those grafted on Rangpur lime in the first 2 to 4 crops, while inarched trees tended to yield intermediate to larger crops. Fruit quality of inarched trees tended to be intermediate or similar to that of the best quality inducing rootstock. Swingle rootstock totally protected inarched trees from foot rot in the first 7 years of the orchard while trees on Rangpur alone had 1.5% to 2% disease incidence. Therefore, inarching can be used to take advantage of the complementary qualities of known rootstocks regarding disease resistance, tree height, productivity, and fruit quality.","[De Lima, Jose E.

Threeregulated deficit irrigation (RDI) treatments were tested on 5-year old 'Nules' clementine trees (Citrus reticulata) grafted on Citrus macrophylla. Water supply was done daily according to tree phenological stage and local experience which was then compared to crop water needs calculated based on base evapotranspiration (ETo). From 1 Oct. 2011 to 30 Jan. 2012, all trees received the same amount of water (129 mm). The trial started on 1 Feb. 2012 just prior to bud break with a supply of 0.9 to 1.8 mm/day, depending on treatment. The dosage increased with increasing ambiance temperature to reach supply duration of 2h 40 min during hot summer days (supplying 2.7, 3.5 and 2.1 mm/day respectively for T0, T1 and T2). Total water supply was 627 mm for T0 (= 84% ETc), 752 mm for T1 (= 106% ETc), 512 mm for treatment T2 (= 68% ETc), applied during the trial period corresponding to 2011-12 cropping season. Results indicated that the local irrigation strategy did not match up with crop water needs. During the crop cycle studied here temperatures were very high reaching 48 degrees C and relative humidity as low as 10%, particularly during fruit set and fruit growth. Stressed trees had more flowers, reduced vegetative growth, lower fruit set, lower final fruit size and yield.

A knowledge test of village government presidents and a survey about the interaction between village presidents and higher-level officials reveal that female village government presidents have much lower knowledge of the village government system than do their male counterparts and have significantly less contact with higher-level government officials. Although male and female presidents provide similar amounts of some public goods, we find strong evidence that village governments led by a woman built fewer schools and roads-two public goods that require relatively more contact and coordination with higher-level officials.

However, the added value given by this sector is still low, particularly for processed products, most of the products exported by this sector are raw materials. Agroindustry sector in Indonesia is generally dominated by Small Medium Industries (SMIs) that still have to face various limitations in order to give value added of the product both of manufacturing side and management aspect. Tendency of market globalization and trade liberalization has opened the business opportunities for entrepreneurs in agro industry sector to do many international activities, among others is through exports. Demand of the global era requires entrepreneurs who are willing to face risks, innovative, proactive and compete aggressively to be able to seek new opportunities and increase competition advantages. Innovation is needed to provide value added to agroindustry products through value creation, so that raw material exports could be reduced. Entrepreneurs can utilize open source that involves external parties by utilizing network resources. The paper proposes conceptual model which can be used to conduct empirical study in the development of agro industry sector. The modeling is developed on the basis of empirical study and concepts related to entrepreneurial orientation, network resource and open innovation/co-innovation that can be used to increase the performance of SMIs.

Solidarity conditions require that when some parameters of the economy change, the agents whose parameters are kept fixed either all weakly lose or they all weakly win. Population-monotonicity (Thomson, Math Oper Res 8:319-326, 1983a; Thomson, J Econ Theory 31:211-226, 1983b) applies to the arrival and departure of agents, while replacement-domination (Moulin, Q J Econ 102:769-783, 1987) applies to changes in preferences. We show that either solidarity property is compatible with voter-sovereignty and strategy-proofness if and only if the attribute space is quasi-median (Nehring, Social aggregation without veto, Mimeo, 2004), and with Pareto-efficiency if and only if the attribute space is a tree.

Scion Improvement: The Florida citrus industry is 90% processing sweet oranges. A major goal has been to develop new cultivars for Not From Concentrate (NFC) juice production with emphasis on increasing juice quality and expanding seasonal availability. Improved clones from seedling introductions, budwood irradiation and somaclonal variation will be discussed. The fresh fruit industry in Florida is dominated by grapefruit and seedy mandarins. Primary objectives for fresh fruit improvement include expanding seasonal availability, development of canker tolerant and low furanocoumarin grapefruit, and development of seedless, easy-peel mandarins. The focus of our program has been on parent development, and seedless triploid production via interploid crosses; strategies and successes will be discussed. Rootstock Improvement: Initial focus was on improving soil adaptation, tree-size control to facilitate harvesting and cold-protection, and disease resistance, especially to blight, CTV-induced quick decline and Phytophthora. Breeding objectives have since been expanded to include tolerance of the Diaprepes/Phytophthora complex and Huanglongbing HLB, and development of rootstocks that facilitate advanced citrus production systems (ACPS). Progress from conventional breeding (both 2x and 4x) and somatic hybridization will be discussed. Genetic Engineering: Due to the HLB and canker epidemics, focus has been on disease resistance gene discovery, transformation, and evaluation of transgenic plants; progress will be discussed.","[Grosser, Jude W.; Gmitter, Frederick G., Jr.; Dutt, Manjul; Calovic, Milica; Ling, Paul; Castle, Bill] Univ Florida, IFAS, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Grosser, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, IFAS, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",jgrosser@ufl.edu,,,,,,,11,7,7,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,405,413,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.50,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600050,0

Nowadays the control of C. capitata in Valencia is based on the integration of area-wide Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) program with pest monitoring, mass trapping and chemical applications. The biological control of C. capitata is under study, for this reason in 2009 the larval parasitoid D. longicaudata was imported from Mexico. A release study is presented here to determine its contribution to medfly control. Different densities of D. longicaudata adults were released once each season in a citrus plot to determine its dispersion on the plot and the parasitism rate exerted in infested sentinel apples.

This study was focused on cytometric analysis of cellular growth of P. fluorescens S7A strain, previously isolated from oil polluted soil, in order to assess bacterial response to different n-hexadecane and, respectively, standard oil concentration using two fluorescent tracers. In the same time, we measured the cell growth by spectrophotometric analysis and colorimetric method. Cytometry analysis, using propidium iodide and acridine orange helped us detect the increasing metabolic activity and cell density of the bacterial strain cultivated in MSM with various concentrations of n-hexadecane and standard-oil (1%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 15%, v/v) over 36 days. The resulted plots showed that the maximum cellular growth was on 1% n-hexadecane and 6% standard oil, underlined by the highest metabolic activity registered. Cytometry analysis indicated that cell viability and membrane integrity was not damaged by several hydrocarbons' concentrations. Furthermore, our strain tolerated high concentration of pollutant, like 15% n-hexadecane and standard-oil. Spectrophotometric analysis and colorimetric assay using DCPIP (2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol) confirmed cytometry results. All the applied methods showed that the bacterial cells needed a 4 days period of time in order to activate the transcriptional regulation of metabolic operons involved in the biodegradation of the pollutant chemical. Our results suggest the opportunity of using flow cytometry for metabolic activity research of pure strains isolated from polluted environments for xenobiotic pathways. (C) 2015 The Authors.

As expected, men are much more likely to accept the end-of-game gamble than are women, but men and women appear to weigh performance variables differently when relying on subjective probabilities. At best men base their risky decisions on general aspects of their previous good play (not all of which is relevant at the time the decision is made) and at worst fail to condition their risky decisions on any of the relevant information available to them. In sharp contrast, women appear to consider all of the information available to them, including previous poor play as well as their most recent confident good play, which, by design, is likely the most relevant information to consider.","[Kelley, Matthew R.] Lake Forest Coll, Dept Psychol, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA; [Lemke, Robert J.] Lake Forest Coll, Dept Econ, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA",,"Lemke, RJ (通讯作者)，Lake Forest Coll, Dept Econ, 555 N Sheridan Rd, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA.",lemke@lakeforest.edu,,"Kelley, Matthew/0000-0003-2893-8706",,,,,29,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2015,78.0,1.0,,,,,153,170,,10.1007/s11238-013-9389-9,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348123800009,0

Lately, the companies encountered numerous changes but one of the most important was the one that concerned customers' needs. In the midst of world economic crisis which, besides affecting the companies, did not bypass the buyers, mostly express buyers' requirements for products, namely services of high quality, with relatively low price. Companies, trying to attract the buyers, make their best to reduce the expenses where the purpose is to provide the price acceptable to the buyers. Very often, as the possible solution for reduction and control of expenses, comes the outsourcing as the possible solution. In this paper we are writing about outsourcing that explains company's efforts and resources on strategic activities, where the other activities are singled out and let to external specialized partners all with the purpose of focusing on primary activities, as well as to reduction of expenses and increase of the quality. Intensive changes did not bypass the Croatia either. For that reason the research was done in 2014 to establish if outsourcing is possible answer to ever growing demands for reduction and control of expenses. Conducted research has showed that the companies operating within the Republic of Croatia implemented, at the most, outsourcing for the purpose of reduction of operating expenses and they stated reduction of expenses as their primary reason for engagement of external partners. Managers in Croatian companies find outsourcing as the solution for managing expenses, where the solution of research shows that outsourcing reduces the operating expenses from 5 to 10 %. Outsourcing can be considered as good strategy for managing expenses, but, as almost every solution, gives positive and negative impacts. But outsourcing also contains, within negative effects, the question of quality.","[Lutilsky, Ivana Drazic; Dragija, Martina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Lutilsky, ID (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Trg JF Kennedyja 6, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",idrazic@efzg.hr; mdragija@efzg.hr; krnicanita@gmail.com,"Dragija Kostic, Martina/H-9443-2018; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/I-2428-2018","Dragija Kostic, Martina/0000-0003-0131-0345; Drazic Lutilsky, Ivana/0000-0003-3562-9864",,,,,15,1,1,0,4,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,281,293,,,,,,13,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100028,0

A weighted average value of each part of this cost has been calculated after a classification of the inquired farms. This classification is based on the technical orientation, the size and finally the localization of the farm. The weighing factor depends on the relative importance of each group at the regional level and was determined through the national statistical data. Major differences appear between farms specialized in milk or beef meat production. With more than 750 (sic)/ha, dairy farms need more mechanization than 'beef meat' farms which only spend 440 (sic)/ha in average in 2013. The use of external mechanization, mainly through contractor's works, is quite important and represents between 30 and 34% of the total mechanization expenses. We notice that dairy farms with higher gross margin require also higher mechanization costs. In situation of low milk price, the limit where higher mechanization costs are not compensated by higher gross margin is almost achieved. For 'meat beef' farms higher mechanization costs are not compensated by higher gross margin. The management of these two kinds of production must be clearly different. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper uses unique evidence on the universe of institutional investors from the leading case of Chile to study to what extent mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies hold and bid for long-term instruments and which factors affect their choices. Using monthly asset-level portfolios we show that, despite the expectations, mutual and pension funds invest mostly in short-term assets relative to insurance companies. The significant difference across maturity structures is not driven by the supply side of debt or tactical behavior. Instead, it seems to be explained by manager incentives (related to short-run monitoring and the liability structure) that, combined with risk factors, tilt portfolios toward short-term instruments, even when long-term investing has averaged higher returns. Thus, expanding large institutional investors does not necessarily imply more developed long-term markets.","[Raddatz, Claudio] Cent Bank Chile, Financial Policy Div, Santiago, Chile; [Schmukler, Sergio L.] World Bank, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Central Bank of Chile; The World Bank,"Schmukler, SL (通讯作者)，World Bank, Res Dept, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",lopazo@abif.cl; craddatz@bcentral.cl; sschmukler@worldbank.org,"Raddatz, Claudio/AAM-2056-2020","Raddatz, Claudio/0000-0003-3192-9034",World Bank through its Development Economics Department and Knowledge for Change Program (KCP),World Bank through its Development Economics Department and Knowledge for Change Program (KCP),"The authors are grateful to Nicolas Alvarez Hernandez, Solange Berstein, Matias Braun, Pablo Castaneda, Andrew Foster (the editor), Augusto de la Torre, Randall Dodd, Eduardo Fajnzylber, Jun Qian, Luis Serven, Raimundo Soto, three anonymous referees, and participants at presentations held at Boston College (Boston), Columbia University (New York), Cornell University (New York), the Financial Intermediation Research Society (FIRS) Annual Conference (Florence, Italy), the IMF (Washington, DC), the LACEA Annual Meeting (Buenos Aires, Argentina), the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) Workshop (Delhi, India), the Superintendency of Pensions (Santiago, Chile), Universidad Adolfo Ibanez (Santiago, Chile), the Universidad de Buenos Aires-Universidad de San Andres-Universidad de La Plata Workshop (Buenos Aires, Argentina), Universidad de Chile (Santiago, Chile), and the World Bank (Washington, DC) for their very useful comments.

Some factors for this hegemony are the adequate ecological conditions, which allows for cultivation without irrigation, and huge land availability. Threats, however, exist especially at the core of national production, in the State of Sao Paulo. The most important, bacterial and virus diseases, appear with increasingly incidence and destructive power. The Northeast Region, the second national producing region, apparently presents the best conditions for the citrus industry expansion. Among potential areas, the Sao Francisco Valley appears as one the best options due to the semiarid climate, governmental support and tradition in the irrigated fruit production and export. The region, with 360,000 ha potentially irrigable, is located between 8 and 9 degrees S and 40 and 42 degrees W and altitude of 300 m a.s.l.

The paper presents also some results of investigation on using nozzles with different physical wear. The results of laboratory test showed that damaged nozzles produced flow rate higher than the allowed limits of nozzles inspection regulations. Also, the decision to use damaged nozzles with lower pressure to compensate the increase of flow rate, results in bigger drop sizes comparing with the new nozzles, which may affect in turn the biological efficacy and put risk of pesticide non target contamination.

Methodology - In our model, agents form links based on their network features, i.e. their belonging to one of the network's circles of influence and their previous alliance history, and then exchange knowledge with their partners, thus modifying their positions in a metric knowledge space. Furthermore, we validate the model against real data using a two-step approach. Through the Thomson Reuters SDC alliance dataset, we estimate the model parameters related to the link formation, thus reproducing the topology of the resulting R&D network. Subsequently, using the NBER data on firm patents, we estimate the parameters related to the knowledge exchange process, thus evaluating the rate at which firms exchange knowledge and the duration of the R&D alliances themselves. Originality - The underlying knowledge space that we consider in our real example is defined by IPC patent classes, allowing for a precise quantification of every firm's knowledge position. Our novel data-driven approach allows us to unveil the complex interdependencies between the firms' network embeddedness and their technological positions. Through the validation of our model, we find that real R&D alliances have a duration of around two years, and that the subsequent knowledge exchange occurs at a very low rate. Most of the alliances, indeed, have no consequence on the partners' knowledge positions: this suggests that a firm's position - evaluated through its patents is rather a determinant than a consequence of its R&D alliances. Finally, we propose an indicator of collaboration performance for the whole network. We find that the real R&D network does not maximize such an indicator. Practical implications - Our study shows that there exist configurations that can be both realistic and optimized with respect to the collaboration performance. Effective policies to obtain an optimized collaboration network - as suggested by our model - would incentivize shorter R&D alliances and higher knowledge exchange rates, for instance including rewards for quick co-patenting by allied firms.","[Tomasello, Mario V.; Tessone, Claudio J.; Schweitzer, Frank] ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland; [Tessone, Claudio J.] Univ Zurich, Dept Business Adm, URPP Social Networks, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; University of Zurich,"Tomasello, MV (通讯作者)，ETH, Dept Management Technol & Econ, Chair Syst Design, Weinbergstr 56-58, CH-8092 Zurich, Switzerland.",,"Schweitzer, Frank/B-2127-2012",,,,,,24,2,2,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,260,276,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200021,0

Gradually the people gathered and life in this area began again. The dream was achieved. Eastern Croatia more and more looks like a forgotten and neglected area, because there is no production (and we know that not so long ago there was), there is no organized and developed tourism, so there is no traffic. But, there are fewer people and jobs, increasing the outflow of young people to developed countries. Cities and villages remain neglected, and schools half-empty, because of the white plague. There was an idea in development plans of building entrepreneurial zones in cities and larger municipalities in order to attract investors and create modern facilities for processing of raw materials and other necessary activities, and give people jobs. To make it all come to life, the idea was to give Osijek and Eastern Croatia back the name crossroad and prosperity. This means, to rebuild its road and railway infrastructure by construction of Vc Corridor and improve river and air transport, and in this way connect the region with the rest of Europe. Another important component is the creation of a stimulating development program with the legal framework and guidelines that guarantee long-term security of invested capital, long-term stability in terms of taxes, contributions and all other levies. This paper will provide analysis of the situation with existing enterprise zones with special reference to the Osijek-Baranja County.

The HLB management techniques implemented consisted principally of Nippa palm (Nypa fruticans) or Banana (Musa spp.) windbreaks on all sides of the orchards, planting of guavas (Psidium guajava) one to two months prior to planting disease-free King mandarin trees, and insecticide applications. Insecticide applications were scheduled as follows: 1) soil-drenching with neonicotinoid around King mandarin trees 10 days before planting and every two months for one year thereafter; and 2) leaf-spraying every month from the second year on. In seven of the eleven orchards included in the project, 0.3 to 2.6% of King mandarin trees were infected by HLB in the first year and 3.0 to 21.9% in the second year. However, the infection rate in the first year reached at 21.1 to 39.3% in four orchards where the insecticide was not correctly applied. The results indicate that the appropriate use of neonicotinoid curtailed the infection of King mandarin trees by HLB.

BITs plausibly increase access to international capital in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI), but at the cost of substantially curtailing a government's policy autonomy. Nearly 3000 BITs have been entered into, suggesting that many countries have found this trade-off acceptable. But governments' enthusiasm for signing and ratifying BITs has varied considerably across countries and across time. Why are BITs more popular in some places and times than others? We argue that capital scarcity is an important driver of BIT signings: The trade-off inherent in BITs becomes more attractive to governments as the need to secure access to international capital increases. More specifically, we argue that the coincidence of high US interest rates and net external financial liabilities heightens governments' incentives to secure access to foreign capital, and therefore results in BIT signings. Empirical evidence is consistent with our theory.","[Betz, Timm] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2010 Allen Bldg,4348 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Kerner, Andrew] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, 5700 Haven Hall,505 South State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Betz, T (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 2010 Allen Bldg,4348 TAMU, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",timm.betz@tamu.edu,"Betz, Timm/I-1696-2019","Betz, Timm/0000-0001-5632-2832",,,,,58,11,13,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Through this time rates of licencing, and car ownership, and vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) rose across age groups. This had a range of environmental and social equity implications, and ignited a priority for investment in road infrastructure. The system of automobility was cemented by lock-in through the assemblage of infrastructure, technologies, policies and behaviours supporting, and frequently requiring, car based mobility. Yet recent evidence has shown that generation Y (18-35 year olds) are practicing mobility in different ways to earlier generations. Stabilising and declining rates of VKT, licencing and vehicle ownership have been identified in a range of industrialised countries. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this paper draws from theories of social practice and the theory of planned behaviour, as two traditions to examine what people 'do', focusing on the social and the individual respectively. It examines the motivations to learn to drive (LTD), and the preference for driving in New Zealand, a highly car dependent country, empirically drawing from 51 qualitative interviews. A series of meta-themes are presented and used to explain intended and actual behaviour relating to driving practices. The empirical research finds a diversity of highly nuanced interpretations of LTD, some of which reflect individual characteristics, whilst other interpretations are best understood grounded in a wider societal reading of contemporary trends and meanings. Frequently, justification for learning to drive goes beyond the competency and capacity to drive independently. Implications for policy and planning are detailed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The answer is critical for determining how autonomous vehicles may shape motor vehicle safety and public health, and for developing sound policies to govern their deployment. One proposed way to assess safety is to test drive autonomous vehicles in real traffic, observe their performance, and make statistical comparisons to human driver performance. This approach is logical, but it is practical? In this paper, we calculate the number of miles of driving that would be needed to provide clear statistical evidence of autonomous vehicle safety. Given that current traffic fatalities and injuries are rare events compared to vehicle miles traveled, we show that fully autonomous vehicles would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries. Under even aggressive testing assumptions, existing fleets would take tens and sometimes hundreds of years to drive these miles an impossible proposition if the aim is to demonstrate their performance prior to releasing them on the roads for consumer use. These findings demonstrate that developers of this technology and third-party testers cannot simply drive their way to safety. Instead, they will need to develop innovative methods of demonstrating safety and reliability. And yet, the possibility remains that it will not be possible to establish with certainty the safety of autonomous vehicles. Uncertainty will remain. Therefore, it is imperative that autonomous vehicle regulations are adaptive designed from the outset to evolve with the technology so that society can better harness the benefits and manage the risks of these rapidly evolving and potentially transformative technologies.

This paper attempts to analyze the economic impacts of four transportation modes using input-output (I-0) analysis, with specific application to Korea. To this end, we apply the 1-0 models to the Korean 1-0 tables generated by the Bank of Korea, paying particular attention to the four transportation sectors in Korea (rail, road, water, and air transportations), considering them as exogenous, and then determining their impacts. Specifically, the production-inducing effects, supply shortage effects, sectoral price effects, forward linkage effects, and backward linkage effects of the four transportation modes are quantitatively derived over the period 2000-2010. For example, the production-inducing effect of a KRW 1.0 production or investment in transportation is larger in the petroleum and transportation equipment sectors than in other sectors. Furthermore, the rail and road transportation sectors have greater supply shortage effects than the other transportation sectors. Finally, the potential uses of the results of this analysis are presented from the perspective of policy instruments, and policy implications are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, several models are developed based on structural equation modeling (SEM) using twenty-four SQ variables. To calibrate those models, a data set of 2008 paratransit users of Dhaka City are utilized, who were interviewed with a structured questionnaire to know their experience, level of satisfaction and opinion about the existing service as well as their expectations. SEM reveals the observed and latent SQ variables and their relationship with the overall SQ of paratransit. Among the different models developed, the best one is selected using statistical parameters and resemblance with real life expectations. Out of twenty-four SQ variables, 'Punctuality and Reliability' and 'Service Features' are respectively found to be the observed and latent variables having the greatest influence on the paratransit SQ. Moreover, the effect of heterogeneity among users on the performance of the best model is investigated. All the study findings support the data collected from the paratransit users. The research outcomes can be utilized by the city transportation officials of developing countries to improve the overall paratransit performance to attract new users as well as retain the current ones.

This approach does not allow for individual heterogeneity. In this article, the authors apply a latent class model to estimate the impact of tourism activities on housing prices in Italy. In particular, they allow for three different unobservable classes or regimes, permitting the impact of tourism on house prices to differ across classes. In other words, they allow for unobservable heterogeneity. The empirical results do support the existence of three classes of house price regressions. Using two different indices of tourism activity, for certain cities (about 21-48% of the sample), increases in tourism activity increase housing prices and for other cities (8-17%) increases in tourism activity decreases housing prices. For approximately half of the sample, increases in tourism activity have no impact on housing prices.","[Biagi, Bianca; Brandano, Maria Giovanna; Caudill, Steven B.] Univ Sassari, I-07100 Sassari, Italy; [Biagi, Bianca; Brandano, Maria Giovanna; Caudill, Steven B.] CRENoS, Cagliari, Italy; [Caudill, Steven B.] Florida Atlantic Univ, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA",University of Sassari; State University System of Florida; Florida Atlantic University,"Caudill, SB (通讯作者)，Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Econ, Barry Kaye Hall 137,777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA.",scaudill@fau.edu,,"Biagi, Bianca/0000-0002-8913-1239; Brandano, Maria Giovanna/0000-0001-9301-4505",Fondazione Banco di Sardegna [2013.1432],Fondazione Banco di Sardegna(Fondazione Banco di Sardegna),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by Fondazione Banco di Sardegna, Grant Number 2013.1432.

Specific Chinese national scenic areas are divided into several zones, with conclusions provided about the impact of economic fluctuations on their tourism efficiency. The results are as follows. The tourism efficiency of Chinese national scenic areas overall is not high; most have not yet reached data envelopment analysis (DEA) optimization; and the quasiperiodicity of scenic areas' tourism efficiency mainly fluctuates between 2.42 and 9.67 years. Owing to the effects of extraneous factors, the significance of pure technical efficiency declined, which illustrates that economic development could promote technological progress, but technological progress is not a sufficient and necessary condition of economic development; studies of different periods show that a downward economic fluctuation will also facilitate technological improvement and promotion, which is the embodiment of the inverse periodicity of technological progress.","[Cao, Fangdong; Huang, Zhenfang; Jin, Cheng; Xu, Min] Nanjing Normal Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing Normal University,"Huang, ZF (通讯作者)，Nanjing Normal Univ, Sch Geog Sci, Dept Tourism, 1 Wenyuan Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",huangzhenfang@njnu.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [41401144, 41271149, 41430635]; Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Education of China [14YJC790003]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [14KJB170007]; Research project of philosophy and social science in Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China [2014SJB109]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Research project of philosophy and social science in Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 41401144, No. 41271149 and No. 41430635), the Youth Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences, Ministry of Education of China (No. 14YJC790003), Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (No. 14KJB170007), Research project of philosophy and social science in Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China (No. 2014SJB109) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions.",,42,18,18,4,57,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) often are thought to be threats to IGOs. But international bureaucracies regularly seek cooperation with NGOs that can help in cross-national layering': the creation of formal or informal international institutions that overlay domestic institutions, seeking to replace or subsume them over time. This article develops a 4Cs taxonomy' in which shared/unshared resource bases and shared/unshared values translate into cooperative, co-optative, competitive, or conflictual relations between NGOs and international bureaucracies. It then examines the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) over a 70-year period, showing how different mixes of resources and values help to explain why FAO bureaucrats have cycled through different relationships with NGOs. This exemplifies themes of the New Interdependence Approach: (1) the forces of globalization and interdependence create openings for transnational alliances among non-state actors; (2) continued globalization takes place not in a state of anarchy, but in an environment of overlapping responsibilities or principles; and (3) institutions go beyond being rules of the game' and can be drivers of power shifts in domestic and international affairs.","[Johnson, Tana] Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Johnson, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,,86,28,32,1,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

National governments have become only one set of actors in among a heterogeneous group of participants in global governance, agents who collaborate across type to produce more informal and less legalized governance outcomes. Complex governance and the NIA approach appear to have both functional limits (more apparent in issue-areas new to the global agenda) and spatial limits (gradually extending beyond the industrialized countries to the developing world).

However, energy intensity has been declining, on average, by about 1.4 percent since 1980. In this paper, we use the Fisher Ideal Index to determine the contribution of changes in the composition of economic activities and efficiency to a decline in energy intensity in Canada at national, provincial, and industry levels. We also apply panel data estimation methods to further investigate the factors driving energy intensity, efficiency and activity indexes for the period 1981-2008. We test for endogeneity as well as cross-section dependency in the provincial data and control for factors such as climate, policy, and energy endowment. The national and provincial decomposition results suggest that most of the reduction in energy intensity has occurred mainly due to improvements in energy efficiency rather than shifts in economic activities. Within the industry, while energy intensity has declined significantly in manufacturing, it has remained stable in transportation, utilities, and construction, and increased significantly in oil extraction and mining industries. The provincial panel regression results indicate that energy intensity is higher in provinces with higher average incomes, faster population growth, colder climate, and a higher capital-labour ratio, and lower in provinces with higher energy prices and higher investment. The industry panel regression results show that investment has contributed to energy efficiency in utilities and mining and to a shift away from energy-intensive activities in manufacturing and transportation industries. Technological advances have been most effective in increasing energy efficiency in construction and utilities and in decreasing energy-intensive activities in manufacturing industries. The results indicate that although efficiency contributes to a reduction in energy intensity in Canada, increasing activity in energy-intensive industries, such as oil and mining, partially offsets the efficiency gains in other industries.","[Moshiri, Saeed] Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada; [Duah, Nana] Univ Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada",University of Saskatchewan; University of Saskatchewan,"Moshiri, S (通讯作者)，Univ Saskatchewan, STM Coll, Saskatoon, SK S7N 0W0, Canada.",moshiri.s@mail.usask.ca; nkd535@mail.usask.ca,,,,,,,22,22,23,2,26,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2016,37.0,4.0,,,,,315,342,,10.5547/01956574.37.4.smos,0.0,,,28,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ5OZ,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385912700014,0

There is the positive view whereby FDI positively affects growth, the negative view where FDI negatively affects growth, and the dependent view where FDI may or may not have an effect on growth at all, but is conditional upon whether certain economic and social conditions are met in the receiving country. In other words, to date, dozens of variables and modeling methods have been used to determine the effect FDI has on economic growth, and all with different results. Essentially, parsimony and ease of interpretation have been replaced with confusion. The central theses of the most important arguments focus on the broad dissemination of FDI, an economy's absorptive capacity, and how injections tend to depend upon cyclical components. We use existing theory to justify a simpler model using a single determinant that encompasses these characteristics. By interacting past growth with current FDI, policymakers can more easily draw inference from the estimated marginal effect. We prove this by applying the model to pooled, high income, emerging, and developing economy samples in order to gain a clearer picture of exactly to what extent, FDI affects economic growth. And since policy not only takes growth into consideration, but economic stability as well, we also apply our model to volatility. While the results differ across income groups and growth rates, the inference drawn from them is unambiguous.","[Edwards, Jeffrey A.; Romero, Alfredo A.] North Carolina A&T State Univ, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA; [Madjd-Sadjadi, Zagros] Winston Salem State Univ, Winston Salem, NC USA",University of North Carolina; North Carolina A&T State University; Winston-Salem State University,"Edwards, JA (通讯作者)，North Carolina A&T State Univ, Greensboro, NC 27401 USA.",jaedwar2@ncat.edu,,,,,,,63,6,8,0,38,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

I then use the cross-sectional approach to estimate the loadings of privately owned commercial real estate on the Fama and French (1993) factors, the Pastor and Stambaugh (2003) liquidity factor, and two bond market factors, using a sample of 14,115 properties in the 1977-2012 period. I find statistically significant loadings, of which the signs seem consistent across property types, but the magnitude varies. Using the time series approach on the same data, I find insignificant loadings on virtually all factors. To investigate the sources of the weak results from the time series approach, I conduct a Monte Carlo simulation in which both approaches are correctly specified and indices can be estimated perfectly. Simulation results suggest that the cross-sectional approach provides more accurate estimates under reasonable market conditions.","[Peng, Liang] Penn State Univ, Dept Risk Management, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Peng, L (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, Dept Risk Management, Smeal Coll Business, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",liang.peng@psu.edu,,,Real Estate Research Institute,Real Estate Research Institute,"I thank the Real Estate Research Institute for a research grant, and NCREIF for providing the commercial real estate data.

In the past two decades, many debates have been going on among policy makers regarding the impact of using mobile phone devices while driving. This political debate is partially motivated by the lack of clear empirical evidence on the relationship between cell phone use, bans and driving performance. Our results show that states that enacted primary cell phone bans experienced a significant reduction in the number of fatalities. Primary texting bans also affected fatalities, but this effect was significantly smaller than that estimated for handheld cell phone bans. This is an important and contradicting result, given most of the legislative activity in 2012 focused on text messaging behind the wheel, considered the most dangerous of the distracted driving activities. Additionally, we looked at how heterogeneous were these effects among states that enacted such bans. We observed that all states benefited from the ban in terms of fatality reduction; however, some were highly affected (such as CA and DC) and some affected in small scale (such as UT and WA).","[Rocco, Leandro] Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA; [Rocco, Leandro] Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil; [Sampaio, Breno] Univ Fed Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign; Universidade Federal do Ceara; Universidade Federal de Pernambuco,"Rocco, L (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801 USA.;Rocco, L (通讯作者)，Univ Fed Ceara, Fortaleza, Ceara, Brazil.",lrocco@ufc.br; brenorsampaio@gmail.com,,"Sampaio, Breno/0000-0001-9740-9192",,,,,27,10,14,0,42,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Consequently, researchers have become more interested in studying the motivations for travel of seniors. A number of questions may be raised or have been addressed in the recent past: What are the main factors explaining the travelling choices of seniors? Are their travel motivations different from the ones of the general population, which have been widely studied in the past? Are geographical differences in terms of motivations comparable between different age groups? Why is senior tourism a topic of particular interest with regard to Asia? In order to answer such questions, in this article, we provide a review of the literature on the travel motivations of seniors. On the basis of 29 articles published between 1988 and 2015 on the topic, we present a qualitative and meta-analytic assessment of past findings, by investigating the dimensions of travel motivations most frequently identified in past seniors surveys. Finally, we discuss a research agenda for further analysis of senior travel motivations and for the integration of this branch of travel research within the wider framework of senior tourism analysis and management.","[Patuelli, Roberto] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Patuelli, Roberto; Nijkamp, Peter] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Nijkamp, Peter] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, PL-61712 Poznan, Poland",University of Bologna; Tinbergen Institute; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Patuelli, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Via Zamboni 33, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",roberto.patuelli@unibo.it,"Patuelli, Roberto/C-6271-2008","Patuelli, Roberto/0000-0003-1908-4307; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; kourtit, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X",,,,,61,41,45,8,43,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Enabled by the renter discrimination policy, this study further controls for the difference in unobserved neighborhood traits using the rental differentials between paired observations.

The analysis is based on the identification of house price diffusion effects through a global vector autoregressive (GVAR) model estimated using quarterly data for six major Asian cities (Hong Kong, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei and Bangkok) from 1991Q1 to 2011Q2. The empirical results indicate that the open economies heavily relying on international trade such as Singapore, Japan (Tokyo), Taiwan (Taipei) and Thailand (Bangkok) show positive correlations between the economy's openness and house prices, which is consistent with the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis. Interestingly, some region-specific conditions also appear to play important roles as determinants of house price movements, which may be driven by restrictive housing policies and demand-supply imbalances such as Singapore and Bangkok. These results are reasonably robust across several model specifications. The findings bear significant implications for formulation of investment strategy and public policies.","[Nanda, Anupam] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England; [Yeh, Jia-Huey] Univ Reading, Reading, Berks, England",University of Reading; University of Reading,"Nanda, A (通讯作者)，Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Reading, Berks, England.",,"Nanda, Anupam/L-4226-2019","Nanda, Anupam/0000-0002-3036-5890",,,,,55,2,2,0,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2016,39.0,7.0,,,,,1005,1024,,10.1111/twec.12288,0.0,,,20,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DR5OU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379953100005,0

First, it fails to explain the preference formation of the most important actor the German government. The banking sector was divided between public and private banks, and there is no clear-cut pattern about whose interests the German government promoted. Second, material bargaining power cannot account for German concessions despite favourable power asymmetries. This article seeks to demonstrate how an ideational frame can convincingly fill these gaps. Ordoliberal ideas were constitutive for German preferences. The manipulative use of ideas as strategic resources by the German government's opponents explains why it made significant concessions. Germany's government publicly acknowledged that breaking the 'vicious circle' between banks and sovereigns was the main objective of the banking union. This became a rhetorical trap used by a coalition of Southern European member states to force the German government to make concessions.","[Schafer, David] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Schäfer, D (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Int Relat, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",d.schafer@lse.ac.uk,,,,,,,64,69,71,2,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

For this, the contingent valuation method is used, proposing a scenario of guided tours suitable to attempt to evaluate physically dispersed urban heritage which is also difficult to define as a tourism product, given its diversity. A double-bounded dichotomous choice format is employed to formulate the valuation question, and willingness to pay (WTP) is estimated using parametric techniques. The study is complemented by segmentation analysis for the main reasons why tourists visit the city of Valdivia, applying the contingency tables method. The results suggest that there is no statistically significant difference in the WTP for the three historical and cultural routes offered and show a higher WTP for foreign tourists compared with domestic tourists as well as for those with higher incomes. Moreover, segmentation analysis shows that the level of education and origin of the tourists interviewed are significant variables in characterizing the reason for their visit.","[Baez-Montenegro, Andrea] Univ Austral Chile, Valdivia, Chile; [Bedate Centeno, Ana; Sanz Lara, Jose Angel; Herrero Prieto, Luis Cesar] Univ Valladolid, E-47002 Valladolid, Spain",Universidad Austral de Chile; Universidad de Valladolid,"Lara, JAS (通讯作者)，Univ Valladolid, Dept Econ Financiera & Contabilidad, Plaza Campus Univ 1, E-47011 Valladolid, Spain.",angel@emp.uva.es,"Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/K-9465-2014; Sanz Lara, Jose Angel/L-1260-2014; Baez Montenegro, Andrea/G-6768-2019","Herrero-Prieto, Luis César/0000-0002-2915-5706; Sanz Lara, Jose Angel/0000-0001-7243-8325; Baez Montenegro, Andrea/0000-0001-5562-4089",Fondecyt [11070138]; Direccion Investigacion Universidad Austral de Chile,Fondecyt(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)CONICYT FONDECYT); Direccion Investigacion Universidad Austral de Chile,"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was funded by Fondecyt Project No 11070138 and Direccion Investigacion Universidad Austral de Chile.",,31,4,5,0,26,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The mediators between perceived green value and green loyalty and a moderator of general attitude toward protecting the natural environment are also discussed. The aim of this research was to understand how to establish green loyalty via the other dimensions based on the sustainable modified technology acceptance model (modified TAM), the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and a moderator. The findings reveal that perceived pleasure to use and subjective norms have the strongest power to influence loyalty for both users and non-users. The implications of this finding are that fun in people's lives has a strong influence on sustainable continuous use of public bikes, and that subjective norms are more effective for non-users. In addition, environmental attitude has stronger moderating effects for non-users than for users on perceived green usefulness, perceived pleasure and subjective norms.

We also discuss the indicators found in the literature for these two performance attributes. Since various authors treat vulnerability as an aspect of reliability instead of a specific attribute, we carried out an application to a complex road network representative of the city of Rio de Janeiro to check the suitability of this approach. The results show that the vulnerability indicators are more strongly affected by the characteristics of alternative routes while the reliability metrics are more sensitive to the congestion level. The conclusion is that reliability and vulnerability should be treated distinctly for evaluating the performance of road network links. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the cases of Sverdlovsk's Gorod Bez Narkotikov (City Without Drugs) and Krasnodar's Cossack groups, it develops the argument and demonstrates specific ways in which an anti-immigrant frame is taken up by local movements.

This article aims at testing the New Economic Geography hypothesis on the role of market access in explaining these regional differentials. We first quantify the market potentials of the Italian regions. We then use these estimates to study the causal link between GDP per capita and market potential. The main result of this article is that only domestic market potential, which represents the home market, shows a traditional North-South divide. When international markets are introduced, the South does not appear to lag behind. Regression analysis confirms that market potential is a strong determinant of GDP per capita only in its domestic formulation. This suggests that the home market in this period mattered far more for growth than the international markets, casting new light on one of the classical explanations to the North-South divide.","[Missiaia, Anna] Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Missiaia, A (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Dept Econ Hist, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",anna.missiaia@ekh.lu.se,,"Missiaia, Anna/0000-0002-4872-1865",,,,,57,17,18,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The proposed modeling framework judiciously manages the trade-off between ability to accurately capture congestion phenomena resulting from the pedestrians' collective behavior and scalability to model large facilities. We present a novel modeling framework that integrates a dynamic simulation assignment logic with a hybrid (two-layer or bi-resolution) representation of the facility. The top layer consists of a network representation of the facility, which enables modeling the pedestrians' route planning decisions while performing their activities. The bottom layer consists of a high resolution Cellular Automata (CA) system for all open spaces, which enables modeling the pedestrians' local maneuvers and movement decisions at a high level of detail. The model is applied to simulate the crowd dynamics in the ground floor of Al-Haram Al-Sharif Mosque in the City of Mecca, Saudi Arabia during the pilgrimage season. The analysis illustrates the model's capability in accurately representing the observed congestion phenomena in the facility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we combine data on effective and desired migration to identify the net pool of foreign talents (NPFT) of selected high-income countries. So far, the EU-15 has poorly benefited from its NPFT while the US has mobilised a large portion of it. Second, we use a micro-founded model to simulate the effects of skill-selective liberalisation shocks. In our benchmark model, a worldwide liberalisation induces larger long-run income gains for the EU-15 (+8.8 per cent) than for the US (+5.9 per cent). However, less attractive EU countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Luxembourg and the Netherlands benefit less than the US. In addition, liberalising high-skilled migration decreases income per worker by 2.5 per cent in developing countries. Overall, it increases efficiency (+6.2 per cent in the worldwide average level of income per capita) and inequality (+1.2 percentage points in the Theil inequality index). Much greater effects can be obtained if total factor productivity varies with human capital.","[Docquier, Frederic; Machado, Joel] Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium; [Docquier, Frederic] Natl Fund Sci Res FNRS, Brussels, Belgium",Universite Catholique Louvain,"Docquier, F (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, IRES, Louvain, Belgium.",,,"Docquier, Frederic/0000-0003-3581-6141; Machado, Joel/0000-0001-9832-8044",ARC convention on 'Geographical Mobility of Factors' [09/14-019]; Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); programme 'Investissements d'Avenir' of the French Government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],ARC convention on 'Geographical Mobility of Factors'; Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International (FERDI); programme 'Investissements d'Avenir' of the French Government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank two anonymous referees for their instructive remarks and suggestions.

Using two large datasets spanning the 1991-2010 period, we examine the existence of inequalities in maternal and paternal education and reported child body weight measures, as well as their evolution across childhood. Our empirical specification is flexible and allows this evolution to be non-monotonic. Significant inequalities are observed for both parents' education - maternal (respectively paternal) high education is associated with a 7.20 (resp. 7.10) percentage points decrease in the probability that the child is reported to be overweight or obese, on average for children of all ages. The gradient with respect to parents' education follows an inverted U-shape across childhood, meaning that the association between parental education and child body weight widens from birth to age 8, and narrows afterward. Specifically, maternal high education is correlated with a 5.30 percentage points decrease in the probability that the child is reported to be overweight or obese at age 2, but a 9.62 percentage points decrease at age 8, and a 1.25 percentage point decrease at age 17. The figures for paternal high education are respectively 5.87, 9.11, and 4.52. This pattern seems robust, since it is found in the two datasets, when alternative variables for parental education and reported child body weight are employed, and when controls for potential confounding factors are included. The findings for the trajectory of the income gradient corroborate those of the education gradient. The results may be explained by an equalization in actual body weight across socioeconomic groups during youth, or by changes in reporting styles of height and weight. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The cash settlement and classified pricing scheme distinguish milk futures from those of other commodities. We construct two variables, days to maturity and price deviates, to capture the distinctive features. While the number of days to maturity indicates the length of time before cash settlement in the maturity month, price deviates reflects traders' aggregate responses to weekly announced information on milk prices. A structural price volatility-trading volume model is specified and estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The results confirm that (1) the closer to cash settlement, the lower milk price volatility, which is different from the typical Samuelson effect for other commodity futures, and (2) both price variability and trading volume increase with traders' responses to market information and therefore are positively associated.","[Du, Xiaodong; Dong, Fengxia] Univ Wisconsin, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Du, XD (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Agr & Appl Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",xdu23@wisc.edu,,,,,,,24,7,8,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The quality of each firm's product for the average consumer, the key state variable, is modeled as stochastically increasing in innovation, the dynamic control, which is proxied by patent applications. Equilibrium innovation is a function of market structure, the vector of quality levels of all active firms, and the cost of R&D. Our main findings are as follows: (a) optimal innovation has an inverted-U shape in own quality; (b) holding own quality constant, innovation is declining in average rival quality but increasing in quality dispersion; and (c) following entry, each incumbent's innovation declines, but aggregate innovation increases in most market structures.

A recent empirical study by Guo et al.

(http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0843, 2011) develop a theoretical structural firm asset value model for a firm default process that embeds the distinction of these two default times. In this paper, we assume the market participants cannot observe the firm asset value directly and we develop reduced-form models for characterizing the economic and recorded default times. We derive the probability distributions of these two default times. Numerical experiments with empirical data are given to demonstrate the proposed models. Our approach helps researchers to gain a new perspective for economic and recorded defaults and is more feasible in general practice compared with current method. Our results can also contribute to the understanding of the impacts of various parameters on the economic and recorded default times.","[Gu, Jia-Wen; Ching, Wai-Ki] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math, Adv Modeling & Appl Comp Lab, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Gu, Jia-Wen] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Math Sci, Univ Pk 5, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Jiang, Bo] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Zheng, Harry] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Math, Huxley Bldg, London SW7 2AZ, England",University of Hong Kong; University of Copenhagen; University of Chicago; Imperial College London,"Ching, WK (通讯作者)，Univ Hong Kong, Dept Math, Adv Modeling & Appl Comp Lab, Pokfulam Rd, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",jwgu.hku@gmail.com; sheilajiangbo@gmail.com; wching@hku.hk; h.zheng@imperial.ac.uk,"Ching, Wai Ki/D-3062-2009",,Research Grants Council of Hong Kong [17301214]; HKU CERG Grants; Hung Hing Ying Physical Research Grant,Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); HKU CERG Grants; Hung Hing Ying Physical Research Grant,The authors would like to thank the referees and the editor for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Local governments forge informal and formal network ties with a variety of organizations, the most prominent of which are private, private/public development, community/residential, and public. Extant research has examined networks but not the processes of network partner choice and their networking. This research begins to fill these lacunas by empirically examining various explanations for economic development networks and their influence on each of these four types of networking. The findings reveal that the factors shaping network ties in each organization type are different. Except for community/residential organization network ties, local governments' networking is significantly related to the development incentives that they offer. Network ties with public organizations are related to government structures. Network ties with community/residential organizations are distinguished by their relationships with financial conditions and citizens' opposition to development. The factors influencing network activities for economic development with organizational types are shaped by the predisposition of each organizational network; thus, the factors promoting local economic development activities and the factors stimulating network activities for local economic development are different.","[Ha, Hyunsang] Kookmin Univ, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul 136702, South Korea; [Lee, In Won] Univ Seoul, Dept Publ Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Feiock, Richard C.] Florida State Univ, Askew Sch Publ Adm & Policy, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA",Kookmin University; University of Seoul; State University System of Florida; Florida State University,"Ha, H (通讯作者)，Kookmin Univ, Bukak Kwan 1427 Ho,77 Jeongneung Ro, Seoul 136702, South Korea.",hsha@kookmin.ac.kr,,"Feiock, Richard/0000-0001-5215-0391",,,,,86,9,13,2,44,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

These are, however, set against studies that continue to report evidence of overt racism in organizations. This article argues that it may be premature and potentially counterproductive to celebrate the demise of overt discrimination in that such binary classification (old-fashioned' and modern') may discourage efforts to investigate the full gamut of experiences of BME groups. The article contends that additional insights will be gained by concurrently studying not only the victims and the perpetrators of discrimination but also the organizational context in which discrimination occurs. Through the theoretical lens of gatekeeping, the article presents evidence of shopfloor discrimination against BME groups that is neither fully overt nor entirely covert.","[Harris, Lloyd C.] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Mkt, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England; [Ogbonna, Emmanuel] Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Management & Org, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales",University of Birmingham; Cardiff University,"Ogbonna, E (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Cardiff Business Sch, Colum Dr, Cardiff CF10 3EU, S Glam, Wales.",ogbonna@cardiff.ac.uk,,"Harris, Lloyd/0000-0002-9919-5762",,,,,42,12,13,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

From a methodological point of view, a common point in their analysis is their anti-teleological view regarding economics as a discipline. Also, in the Schumpeterian system, technology is the cornerstone of economic evolution and appears as the making of new combinations. In the Veblenian theoretical framework, the bearer of change is to be found, inter alia, in technology, just like in Schumpeter's works, although not without differences. They also share the opinion that technology revolutionises capitalism and has serious implications for its future as a system. Furthermore, regarding individualism, in his work Schumpeter stresses the importance of the social milieu on individual action, a fact which bears strong resemblance to the Veblenian notion of evolution as depersonalized evolution'. In this sense, Schumpeter is very close to Veblen, although Schumpeter's approach could be classified in what is called institutionalist individualism, whereas Veblen could be classified as holist. Undoubtedly, the role of institutions is of great importance in both Schumpeter and Veblen. nstitutions in the Schumpeterian schema play a central role closely related to the future of capitalism. Institutional and non-institutional factors enter into complex forms of interaction just like in Veblen's approach. There, institutions are part of the social milieu and their underlying framework, much wider than mere economic and social. Of course, the theoretical analyses of Schumpeter and Veblen are not devoid of differences springing mainly from their methodological approach such as the role of the individual in the capitalist process which is probably the most significant difference regarding the importance attributed to it in Schumpeter's early works. Also, the way technical change appears constitutes another difference. However, his views are quite close to Veblen's. After all, Schumpeter began to write in a social, political, theoretical and ideological environment at a time when evolutionary ideas dominated social thought.","[Papageorgiou, Theofanis; Michaelides, Panayotis G.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytechneiou 9,Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Michaelides, PG (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Sch Appl Math & Phys, Lab Theoret & Appl Econ, Heroon Polytechneiou 9,Zografou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece.",pmichael@central.ntua.gr,,"Papageorgiou, Theofanis/0000-0002-8893-7628",,,,,85,13,15,3,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

To evaluate the impact of be part of a bank group we use Policy Evaluation tools, performing an impact evaluation with the controlled by a group considered as the treatment variable and checking for relevant banking ratios. To deal with self-selection bias (heterogeneity in treatment propensity related to variables), we use the PS Matching estimating the average treatment effects with the Ichino-Becker propensity scores. The research novelty resides in the combined application of DEA and Policy Evaluation tools for the specific field. Results show that when comparing SBs belonging to a banks group with stand-alone SBs, although a positive but not significant ATT, we find no relevant differences between the SBs part of group and the stand-alone.

An important question is how much the equilibria degrade in the face of strategic behavior, i.e. what is the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of the market viewed as a mechanism? Often, PoA bounds are modest constants such as 4/3 or 2. Nonetheless, in practice a guarantee that no more than 25% or 50% of the economic value is lost may be unappealing. This paper asks whether significantly better bounds are possible under plausible assumptions. In particular, we look at how these worst case guarantees improve in the following large settings. - Large Walrasian auctions: These are auctions with many copies of each item and many agents. We show that the PoA tends to 1 as the market size increases, under suitable conditions, mainly that there is some uncertainty about the numbers of copies of each good and demands obey the gross substitutes condition. We also note that some such assumption is unavoidable. - Large Fisher markets: Fisher markets are a class of economies that has received considerable attention in the computer science literature. A large market is one in which at equilibrium, each buyer makes only a small fraction of the total purchases; the smaller the fraction, the larger the market. Here the main condition is that demands are based on homogeneous monotone utility functions that satisfy the gross substitutes condition. Again, the PoA tends to 1 as the market size increases. Furthermore, in each setting, we quantify the tradeoff between market size and the PoA.","[Cole, Richard; Tao, Yixin] NYU, Courant Inst, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA",New York University,"Cole, R (通讯作者)，NYU, Courant Inst, Dept Comp Sci, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,"cole, richard/HKO-3844-2023",,"Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1527568, 1217989] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,30,7,10,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,791,808,,10.1145/2940716.2940720,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300074,0

Such an approach is substantiated by the degree to which the poverty-related phenomena are measurable, or whether they can be measured at all. In contribution to the implementation of the IMM concept, the objective is to elaborate on the way in which development is currently expressed, and in particular the way in which poverty is being defined and measured up until today. In order to make this topic tangible, the recent changes and evolution of the parameters which are underlying this definition are referred to e.g. the Human Development Index (HDI), the International Poverty Line (IPL), the Purchasing Power Parity Exchange Rate (PPP), or the Multidimensional Poverty Index (OPHI), among others. In addition, an analogy is presented to the anthropological characteristic of the LEAD approach, i.e. the LEAD School of Ethnoscience. Even though the mentioned parameters are widely used and standardised to a large extent, they are all indicator instruments which, even by their respective promoters, are considered to have their shortcomings. They need to be considered in relationship to the purpose they have of expressing the transition of one state of (well-)being to the next. Although most attention is usually paid to the limitations of their discriminating ability, the eligibility of a number of these parameters is consequently presented. The literature has ample descriptions of inventive proxy variables, workarounds and substitutes. There is, however, no specifically targeted criticism because of such approach. This paper seeks to contribute to the understanding and consensus on the applicability of some parameters, or their alternatives.","[de Bekker, J. C.

To tackle the high dimensionality of the model, we construct a few lagged variables that efficiently summarize the position of a bank pair in the network. We propose a simple and computationally easy kernel-based local maximum likelihood estimator of the time-varying parameters of the model and establish its asymptotic properties. We then apply the model to the time series of daily overnight money market network in the UK 2003-2012.

We propose its doubly regularized version, which combines a regularization of the covariance matrix with replacing the means of multivariate data by their regularized counterparts. We formulate explicit expressions for some versions of the regularization of the means, which can be interpreted as a denoising (i.e. robust version) of standard means. Further, we propose a robust cosine similarity measure, which is based on implicit weighting of individual observations. We derive properties of the newly proposed robust cosine similarity, which includes a proof of the high robustness in terms of the breakdown point.","[Kalina, Jan; Pestova, Barbora] Inst Comp Sci CAS, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Computer Science of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Kalina, J (通讯作者)，Inst Comp Sci CAS, Vodarenskou Vezi 2, Prague 18207 8, Czech Republic.",kalina@cs.cas.cz; pestova@cs.cas.cz,"Pestova, Barbora/H-8831-2017; Kalina, Jan/E-4287-2012","Kalina, Jan/0000-0002-8491-0364",,,,,15,0,0,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,365,370,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500063,0

The literature accepts that they are equal forms of employment. However, it is often said that a mandate contract or service contract regulated by art. 750 of the Polish Civil Code is used to circumvent labor law. The purpose of a mandate contract is to make changes in the legal sphere of the mandatory as a result of actions taken by the mandatary. The relative rule from art. 735 PCC says that the party performing the mandate should be paid remuneration, but parties can agree or, if it results from circumstances, such a contract may be gratuitous. Dogmatic and legal text analysis has been used to discuss the presented issues. This paper establishes in which situations such a legal relationship requires effort and time, and for which the parties do not provide remuneration; the objectives that justify the conclusion of such contracts and their legal implications; and their significance in economic and civil turnover. The conclusion of the gratuitous mandate contract is usually justified by the relationship between parties (e.g. affinity, friendship) and a small workload. The gratuitous character does not affect the scope of duties and responsibilities of the mandatary, although it may affect the assessment required from the debtor's diligence in the performance of the obligation.","[Lewandowska, Ewa] Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Law & Adm, Dept Civil Law, Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Lewandowska, E (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, Fac Law & Adm, Dept Civil Law, Olsztyn, Poland.",ewa1bieniek@gmail.com,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,0,BELIANUM-VYDAVATESTVO UNIV MATEJA BELA V BANSKEJ BYSTRICI,BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO 51, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 974 00, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-557-1089-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,9,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BM2DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000460873800004,0

To overcome this conflict situation, at least within one individual organization, means to understand what is primary and what is secondary in an organizational culture. To be working for company means to obtain the organizational culture which includes living myths, underpinned by real archetypes and by emotional appeal, which is significant and filled with sense. Confidence is an essential process in constructing and accepting organizational culture, resulting in social responsibility. Psychological manipulations can induce confidence phenomenon artificially. But artificial myths are negative, express the personalities' destructive characteristics. 'True' mythology stimulates collective unconsciousness, strengthens autonomy of organization, which is linked to 'mutuality' inside and outside organization, resulting in feeling of social responsibility.

The results show that TFP and TE were negatively affected by the financial crisis in years 2008-2009. However, there is a difference between those two. While the changes in TE were negative until 2009, the Delta TFP was between years 2007-2008 positive. Overall efficiency (under constant returns to scale) of farms was on average at 81.58% level. Pure technical efficiency (under variable returns to scale) amounted on average to 91.46%.

According to modern concepts economic nationalism is not illiberal or protectionist, because some economic nationalists were liberals and free-traders. The existing definitions of economic nationalism are based on the explicit or implicit assumption of the existence of a nation-state. An important feature of the early history of the Bulgarian economic nationalism is that it was stateless, because until Bulgaria's liberation in 1878 the Bulgarians did not have a nation-state. Therefore economic nationalism is defined as a collectivist approach to the economy based on the deliberate encouragement of one's own nation.","[Penchev, Pencho D.] Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Polit Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria",University of National & World Economics - Bulgaria,"Penchev, PD (通讯作者)，Univ Natl & World Econ, Dept Polit Econ, Sofia, Bulgaria.",pencho_penchev@gyuvetch.bg,"Penchev, Pencho/Q-4377-2016","Penchev, Pencho/0000-0001-7542-1625",,,,,53,3,3,0,4,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

There are seven plants in operation to produce ethanol using cassava as a raw material. These factories are located in the Northeastern part of Thailand (Khon Kaen and Ubon Ratchatani provinces). The ethanol plant in Khon Kaen province was chosen for study because of the size of cassava cultivated area and cassava productions. The key data used to determine the active cassava cultivating area surrounding the ethanol plants was the average distance of cassava transportation truck from Khon Kaen ethanol plant. The methodology for this study consisted of collecting data from both primary and secondary data sources, plotting cassava cultivated area data on GIS (Geographic Information System) color bar map, posting the active area outline and calculating the cassava cultivated area together with cassava production within the active area outline. The result showed that the ethanol plants in Ubon Ratchatani province has the highest percentage of cassava cultivated area and cassava production within active area condition, compared to the others ethanol plant location. In conclusion, the cassava cultivated area and cassava production in Ubon Ratchatani province was suitable for being utilized for use as raw material for producing ethanol because the active cassava cultivation had been in the 550-1,100 square kilometer area. The percentage of cassava cultivated area and cassava production is the lowest in Khon Kaen.

Applying a Markov Switching Vector Error Correction Model (MS-VECM), the study has ability to capture cointegrations and sudden shifts in transition probabilities of used financial data series. The level of market integration is presented by the parameters of the long-run equilibrium and the speed of adjustment estimated by a MS-VECM. Furthermore, modeling the shift of presented stock market indices has been encouraged by the fact that the change in regime should be considered as a random, not predictable event. Consequently, a MS-VECM provides a good characterization of domestic stock market opposite to a linear VECM which do not include any regime switches. Finally, findings towards integration of domestic stock market to neighboring and major world stock markets suggest that local investors can not avoid any influence from the outside of a national market even if some markets are still not fully opened to potential international investors.","[Radovanov, Boris; Marcikic, Aleksandra; Vunjak, Nenad] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia",University of Novi Sad,"Radovanov, B (通讯作者)，Univ Novi Sad, Fac Econ Subotica, Segedinski Put 9-11, Subotica, Serbia.",radovanovb@ef.uns.ac.rs; amarcikic@ef.uns.ac.rs; vunjakn@ef.uns.ac.rs,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1546,1555,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100153,0

We first define the MAXIMIZING MULTIPLE RESERVES (MMR) problem in single-parameter matroid environments, where the input is m valuation profiles v(1),...,v(m), indexed by the same n bidders, and the goal is to compute the vector r of (non-anonymous) reserve prices that maximizes the total revenue obtained on these profiles by the VCG mechanism with reserves r. We prove that the problem is APX-hard, even in the special case of single-item environments, and give a polynomial-time-approximation algorithm for it in arbitrary matroid environments. We then consider the online no-regret learning problem, and show how to exploit the special structure of the MMR problem to translate our offline approximation algorithm into an online learning algorithm that achieves asympototically time-averaged revenue at least 2times that of the best fixed reserve prices in hindsight. On the negative side, we show that, quite generally, computational hardness for the offline optimization problem translates to computational hardness for obtaining vanishing time-averaged regret. Thus our hardness result for the MMR problem implies that computationally efficient online learning requires approximation, even in the special case of single-item auction environments.","[Roughgarden, Tim] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 474 Gates Bldg,353 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Wang, Joshua R.] Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 460 Gates Bldg,353 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University; Stanford University,"Roughgarden, T (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Comp Sci, 474 Gates Bldg,353 Serra Mall, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",tim@cs.stanford.edu; joshua.wang@cs.stanford.edu,,,,,,,26,26,27,0,0,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,601,616,,,,,,16,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300050,0

This research used literature study to analyze how OVOP concept might help Bandung to be more sustainable economically, in the terms of creative industry sector. Bandung municipality needs to make priority in order to achieve sustainability in the development of creative industry in the city. OVOP strategy can be implemented to make some areas to be more concentrated to produce certain products. The focus strategy in OVOP leads to unique product and service production that can be sold in the market, thus a unique value-added product will give a competitive advantage for the area.

This paper is focused on backtesting and optimisation of trading strategy in futures market that are based on volatility estimation using nonlinear conditional volatility models. In fact, one of the most challenging practical problems of recent years was to understand and model a behavior of volatility of financial markets. In order to illustrate an application of this approach, we consider daily returns of American e-mini market future index in the period from September 2013 to December 2014. Backtesting of trading strategy was provided by management of normalized risk and amount of contracts per trade assuming unvarying other parameters of trading strategy. When optimizing initial trading strategy using conditional volatility models a profitability has increased significantly while maintaining reasonable values of other characteristics compared to its initial values.","[Sed'a, Petr] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Jimber del Rio, Juan Antonio] Univ Cordoba, Fac Law & Business & Econ Sci, Dept Stat Econometr Operat Res & Appl Econ, Puerta Nueva S-N, E-14071 Cordoba, Spain",Technical University of Ostrava; Universidad de Cordoba,"Sed'a, P (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Math Methods Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",petr.seda@vsb.cz; jjimber@uco.es,"Jimber-Del Río, Juan Antonio/Q-4343-2019; Seďa, Petr/X-1866-2018","Jimber-Del Río, Juan Antonio/0000-0001-6886-7434; Seďa, Petr/0000-0002-2205-6377",,,,,10,0,0,0,0,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1617,1626,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100160,0

The aim of this paper is modelling of the development of share of inbound tourism on GDP using exponential smoothing and Box-Jenkins methodology. It has been shown that long-term strategy of the Slovak government is achieved slowly. Barrier to the tourism industry development is particularly low readiness of human resources (low level of qualification, low level of language skills, lack of motivation of these employees and the lack of modern managerial quality improvement tools in tourism). Available education programs are often professionally and practically inconvenient, or provided to a small target group. Therefore, it is necessary to create professionally oriented education programs, which take into account the needs and specificities of tourism.

People of Tunagan have different time periods for selling their harvest produce, therefore earning cash at different times. But to go to the formal bank, they have to spend a lot time and money for walking and the ojeg ride. To solve this problem, people of Tunagan have a mobile bank system that approach people directly to their residence to collect cash called bank kuriling. This system does not only allow people to save but also to borrow money.","[Wiyanti, Dede Tresna] Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Sumedang, Indonesia",Universitas Padjadjaran,"Wiyanti, DT (通讯作者)，Padjadjaran State Univ, Fac Social & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Sumedang, Indonesia.",dedetresna06@yahoo.co.id,,,,,,,4,1,1,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-6252-264-0,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2016,18.0,,,,,,131,135,,,,,,5,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390913100020,0

At this stage, rural students face a lot of psychological problems. Studies have shown that there are four main reasons leading to so many psychological problems of freshman from rural area: the big economic and cultural gap between urban and rural, the lower cultural level and less developed educational concept of the rural parents, the lack of psychological health education in basic education and the poor psychological quality of students. To solve these problems, we need to concentrateon above four aspects and take some effective measures. The society should implement its economic strategy to narrow the gap between rural and urban. Also, the system of mental health educationshould cover the whole society. Parents need to know more mental health education knowledge to understand and communicate with their children. Schoolsshould improve mental health education and increase the intensity of the funding for poor students from a rural area.

The paper showed that strategy-proof (SP), Pareto-efficient and individually rational social choice functions do not exist in two-good, two-agent exchange economies. This result has been extended in several ways, for instance, to arbitrary numbers of agents and goods and to restricted domains. In this paper, we extend the result to economies with production. We consider a two-good economy with a single public good that can be produced from a private good according to a convex cost function. Agents have initial endowments of the private good. We show that SP, Pareto-efficient, individually-rational and continuous social choice functions do not exist in this environment. Pareto-efficiency, individual rationality and continuity axioms apply only to a small domain of preferences parametrized by a real number.","[Goswami, Mridu Prabal] Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Econ, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel; [Sen, Arunava; Yadav, Sonal] Indian Stat Inst, New Delhi 110016, India",Ben Gurion University; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Delhi,"Yadav, S (通讯作者)，Indian Stat Inst, New Delhi 110016, India.",sonal.crk@gmail.com,"yadav, sonal/AAS-5962-2020","yadav, sonal/0000-0002-0608-567X; Yadav, Sonal/0000-0002-2461-8345","Council for Higher Education, Israel","Council for Higher Education, Israel","We wish to thank Anirban Bose, Siddharth Chatterjee, Debasis Mishra, Swaprava Nath, Shigehiro Serizawa and John Weymark for useful discussions.

Candidates care about policy and also have an opportunity to engage in rent-seeking when in office. When candidates' preferences are polarized they choose non-converging policies if elected. This creates policy costs from not securing re-election, decreasing equilibrium rent-seeking, and, for appropriate parameters, increasing voter welfare. I show that increasing polarization among voters increases the range of parameters for which polarization in candidate preferences is socially optimal if only if utility functions are not too concave. Moreover, with multiple dimensions of policy disagreement, it is optimal to have greater polarization of candidate preferences in dimensions in which voters are more polarized if and only if utility functions are not too concave. I discuss the implications of these results for electoral competition in the United States.","[Van Weelden, Richard] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Van Weelden, R (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",rvanweelden@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,17,4,5,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2015,45.0,4.0,,,,,653,686,,10.1007/s00355-015-0874-7,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CX5AA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365711200001,0

However, the use of modern contraceptive methods, and especially the use of condoms, increased considerably, while the use of traditional contraceptive methods decreased. Higher exposure to messages about family planning in the media was correlated with the use of modern contraceptive methods.

Using a FAVAR model that identifies shocks from different regions of the world, we find that demand from emerging economies (most notably from Asian countries) is more than twice as important as demand from developed countries in accounting for the fluctuations in the real oil price and in oil production. Furthermore, geographical regions respond differently to adverse oil market shocks that drive up oil prices, with Europe and North America being more negatively affected than countries in Asia and South America.

This article questions that interpretation, using a wage regression approach with eighty-five to ninety-six years of data on wages, inflation, unemployment, productivity, and other variables in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, focusing on the post-1950 period. It is shown that wages in fact increased faster than productivity in Sweden in the 1950s and 1960s and in Denmark and Norway in the 1960s. On the other hand, especially Denmark and Sweden saw wage restraint in the 1980s and 1990s. Overall the results of the article support a power-oriented interpretation of wage bargaining rather than the conventional postwar wage restraint story. In explaining the differences between the countries, the article discusses economic structure, postWorld War II situation, and trade union ideology.","[Bengtsson, Erik] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Econ Hist Unit, Box 720, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Bengtsson, E (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Econ Hist Unit, Box 720, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",erikbengtzzon@gmail.com,,"Bengtsson, Erik/0000-0003-1523-0565",Riksbankens Jubileumsfond grant [P09-0500:I-E],Riksbankens Jubileumsfond grant(Swedish Foundation for Humanities & Social Sciences),"This article has been presented in Gothenburg, Cologne, Lund, Uppsala, and Washington, DC.

Using the most recent methodologies on a Mincerian equation, we assess how much of the differential depends on differences in endowments and how much on differences in the remuneration of such skills. For the first time, we look at the contribution of specific covariates at different quantiles of the wage distribution and decompose the variance into an explained and an unexplained component. We find that the pay gap is often decreasing over the distribution and that it is mostly determined by higher endowments in the upper tail of the wage distribution and by higher returns of such endowments at the low tail, with considerable heterogeneity across countries. We further find that the wage distribution in the public sector is more compressed than in the private sector in some countries. This is the result, for all countries, of more dispersed distributions of endowments in the public sector and of returns in the private sector.","[Depalo, Domenico] Bank Italy, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Giordano, Raffaela] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Papapetrou, Evangelia] Bank Greece, Athens 10250, Greece; [Papapetrou, Evangelia] Univ Athens, Athens 10250, Greece",European Central Bank; Bank of Italy; The World Bank; European Central Bank; Bank of Greece; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens,"Depalo, D (通讯作者)，Bank Italy, Via Nazl 91, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",domenico.depalo@bancaditalia.it; rgiordano@worldbank.org; epapapetrou@bankofgreece.gr,"Papapetrou, Evangelia/AAL-6616-2021","Papapetrou, Evangelia/0000-0002-0001-3341; Depalo, Domenico/0000-0001-7395-1286",,,,,48,31,33,0,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

First, using a gravity model of trade, it estimates the effects of deep and shallow free trade agreements for the EaP (Eastern Partnership) states with Russia and the EU respectively. Second, by relating the outcomes of the first estimation to the quality of institutions, proxied with the level of democracy and the level of corruption in the selected countries, the paper estimates the effect on exports of changes in the quality of institutions. The main results show that the EaP countries gain significantly from free trade agreements with the EU but little if anything from free trade agreements with Russia, and that improvements in the quality of institutions in EaP countries have played an important role in fostering exports.","[Gylfason, Thorvaldur] Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Gylfason, Thorvaldur] CESifo, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Castellon, Germany; [Wijkman, Per Magnus] Univ Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Iceland; Ifo Institut; University of Gottingen; University of Gothenburg,"Martínez-Zarzoso, I (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.",imartin@uni-goettingen.de,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Project 'Production Networks and Economic Integration' - Fundacion Caja Castellon-Bancaja,Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Project 'Production Networks and Economic Integration' - Fundacion Caja Castellon-Bancaja,"This paper was presented at the 16th Annual Swedish Network for European Studies in Economics and Business (SNEE) European Integration Conference in Molle, Sweden, 20-23 May 2014.

Through controlled experiments, we examine sequential choice architectures that enable the choice set to remain large while potentially reducing the effect of choice overload. A specific tournament-style architecture achieves this goal. An alternate architecture in which subjects compare each subset of options to the most preferred option encountered thus far fails to improve performance due to the status quo bias.

Many events perceptibly affect the transport supply along these networks, especially natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and earthquakes. Contrary to more common disruptions of traffic from accidents, or maintenance closures, natural disasters are capable of destroying large numbers of roads and usually cover vast areas. When evaluating network damage no single measure alone is able to describe the full extent of network destruction. In this study, we investigated six highly damaging natural disasters, which occurred in the Czech Republic between 1997 and 2010. They were all induced by extreme rainfall or by rapid snowmelt and resulted in floods and landslides. Their impacts are evaluated with respect to the damage to road networks and decreased serviceability. For mutual comparison of the impacts and their analysis we used several criteria, described in the paper, related to economic impacts, physical harm to individuals and infrastructures, and the effects on connectivity and serviceability. We also introduced a new measure based on the network efficiency index which takes into account the importance of nodes based on their population. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of one such event in July 1997 that significantly affected the road network of the Zlin region. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Their results break with certain stereotypical assumptions, such as that charter passengers are low-income, that they use the services of travel agencies to a greater degree, or that they show a clear bias for travel for vacation purposes. Their profile is of infrequent flyers with a longer waiting time before boarding, although this does not mean that they make more purchases at the airport. Furthermore, they look to travel to more remote destinations, with no intermediate stopovers, which are not usually served by the low-cost carriers, as a result of which they have a greater presence at hub airports.","[Castillo-Manzano, Jose I.; Lopez-Valpuesta, Lourdes] Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Seville 41018, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Castillo-Manzano, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Appl Econ & Management Res Grp, Avda Ramon & Cajal 1, Seville 41018, Spain.",jignacio@us.es,"Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/G-2322-2015; Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./F-8859-2015","Lopez Valpuesta, Lourdes Soledad/0000-0003-1808-1032; Castillo-Manzano, Jose I./0000-0003-4154-1500",AENA; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-36973],AENA; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to Professor Stephen Wanhill for their helpful comments.

I then compare and evaluate the similarities and differences in Russian and Chinese soft power strategy. The similarities between the two states indicate their joint status as authoritarian regimes with a Marxist-Leninist heritage. The differences can be attributed to their vastly disparate economic circumstances, but also to historical, social, and political factors that influence soft power policies.","[Wilson, Jeanne L.] Wheaton Coll, Russian Studies, Norton, MA 02766 USA; [Wilson, Jeanne L.] Wheaton Coll, Polit Sci, Dept Polit Sci, Norton, MA 02766 USA; [Wilson, Jeanne L.] Harvard Univ, Davis Ctr Russian & Eurasian Studies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Wilson, JL (通讯作者)，Wheaton Coll, Russian Studies, Norton, MA 02766 USA.",wilson_jeanne@wheatoncollege.edu,,,,,,,56,20,21,2,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,SEP 14,2015,67.0,8.0,,,,,1171,1202,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1078108,0.0,,,32,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,CU9MT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363869300001,0

Non-normal errors will not pose a problem in usual cointegration tests even when they are ignored. However, we show that they can become useful sources to improve the power of the tests when we use the residual augmented least squares (RALS) procedure to make use of nonlinear moment conditions driven by non-normal errors. The suggested testing procedure is easy to implement and it does not require any non-linear estimation techniques. We can exploit the information on the non-normal error distribution that is already available but ignored in the usual cointegration tests. Our simulation results show significant power gains over existing cointegration tests in the presence of non-normal errors.","[Lee, Hyejin; Lee, Junsoo] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA; [Im, Kyungso] Fed Deposit Insurance Corp, Washington, DC USA",University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa; Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),"Lee, H (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",hlee57@cba.ua.edu,,,,,,,15,18,20,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We can represent this by the formula (w (sic) x) >= (y (sic) z), where (>=) is a difference preorder: an incomplete preorder on the space of all possible personal state changes. A social state change is a bundle of personal state changes. A social difference preorder (SDP) is an incomplete preorder on the space of social state changes, which satisfies Pareto and Anonymity axioms.

Particularly in Hermoupolis of Syros, a major commercial and shipping center of the same period, wooden shipbuilding experienced unprecedented rates of growth, helping it to become one of the major shipbuilding centers of the Mediterranean. The article examines whether this activity can be characterized as the first industry of Modern Greece before the introduction of the factory system. The analysis includes an overview of the level of industrialization during the period 1830-70, the conditions of the establishment and growth of wooden shipbuilding in Hermoupolis, its occurrence at a national and international level, its contribution to the local and national economy, and last but not least, the specific aspects that may perhaps be seen as factors in the industrialization of a craft-based activity.","Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mediterranean Studies, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece",,"de Lis, A (通讯作者)，Fdn Res & Technol, Inst Mediterranean Studies, Rethimnon, Crete, Greece.",apostolosdelis@ims.forth.gr,,,"European Regional Development Fund of the European Union under the O.P.

In this paper, we investigate the impact of government guarantees on toll charge, road quality and road capacity by taking perspective of the private investor. The main results are: (1) Minimum traffic guarantee increases toll charge while decreasing road quality. Under a low guarantee level, minimum traffic guarantee has no impact on road capacity. However, it improves road capacity when a high guarantee level is performed. (2) Under minimum revenue guarantee, if the guarantee level is sufficiently high, the optimal toll charge will be sufficiently large, but road quality and road capacity will approach zero. (3) Price compensation guarantee decreases toll charge and increases both road quality and road capacity. This paper further investigates the impact of government guarantees when the contract is auctioned. We find that auction reduces the impact of government guarantees on toll charge while failing to affect the impact of government guarantees on road quality and capacity. Some policy implications are also derived from our model results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Regardless of locations' characteristics, we find that exporting in a given country, and to a smaller extent importing from it, significantly increases the probability of investing in that particular country the following year. This preliminary exporting phase appears more important for firsttime investors. Moreover, location choices not only depend on the investor's own international experience, but also on the international experience of other affiliated firms: firms tend to invest in countries where the group already exports or owns a local affiliate. These last findings suggest the existence of coordinated strategies and/or information sharing between affiliated firms.","Univ Paris 09, LEDa, IRD, DIAL UMR 225, Paris, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Institut de Recherche pour le Developpement (IRD); Laboratoire dEconomie de Dauphine LEDa,"Gazaniol, A (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 09, LEDa, IRD, DIAL UMR 225, Paris, France.",,,,Pramex International (group Banque Populaire - Caisse d'Epargne),Pramex International (group Banque Populaire - Caisse d'Epargne),"I would like to thank Frederic Peltrault, Jean-Marc Siroen, Lionel Fontagne, Davide Castellani, Flora Bellone, Herve Boulhol, El Mouhoub Mouhoud and two anonymous referees for very useful comments and remarks.

When information is auctioned, markets are first inefficient, so agents raise their bids to buy the highest information levels, before they learn to bid amounts that they can cover with their trading profits.

The primary aim of the study was to estimate as specifically as possible the level of future safety associated with several geometrical configurations of the LAX North Airfield. This paper describes the study, and how it combined information from human-in-the-loop simulations at NASA with historical data from LAX and other US airports about runway incursions and collisions. The analysis indicated that, even under its existing physical layout, LAX North would experience very low risk of runway collisions at traffic levels projected for 2020. That risk could be reduced by about half if the North Airfield runways were reconfigured, and some reconfigurations would also add appreciably to the operational efficiency of the airport. But because the baseline level of risk is so low, the Study concluded that it would be difficult to construct a compelling case on safety grounds alone for reconfiguring the North Airfield.

Large transportation systems generally have a poor record in systematically integrating innovation in their development, construction and operation. Our research setting is Crossrail, a major new railway traversing London, where the creation and implementation of an innovation strategy formalized and systemized its approach to innovation. Based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with project leaders and participant observation, the paper critically analyses the formulation, implementation and performance of Crossrail's innovation strategy. Crossrail's management explicitly uses an 'open innovation' strategy that incentivizes partners, contractors, and clients to innovate in the project. Its strategy guides decisions and priorities on innovation and the types and levels of innovation that best match project aims.

Eleven datasets from different shared cycleway sections with different cycleway widths were collected in Hangzhou, China for estimation and evaluation purposes. The results indicate that, with around 70% share of E-bikes, the mean estimated capacity is 2348 bicycle/h/m. The effects on the capacity of the proportions of E-bikes, gender of cyclists, age of cyclists, and cyclists carrying things were also analyzed. The results implied that the estimated capacity is independent of a cyclist's gender and age, but increases with the proportion of E-bikes. According to this study, the mean BEU for the E-bike is 0.66, and the converted capacities of pure regular bicycles and pure E-bikes are 1800 and 2727 bicycle/h/m, respectively. These findings can be used to propose practical countermeasures to improve the capacity of heterogeneous bicycle traffic flow on shared cycleway. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

An internet-based travel behaviour survey was conducted with more than 2000 respondents in London and Glasgow. Of these respondents, 740 reported information on over 1000 long distance trips affected by extreme weather and natural events over the previous three years. Results show respondents are generally cautious towards travelling during extreme weather events. For a slight majority in the case of air and public transport, and a greater one in the case of car, travellers did not considerably alter their travel plan following the disruption. This was explained not only by less disruptive weather conditions (with heavy snow and volcanic ash being the most disruptive) and impact, but also by the relative importance of their trips. Differences between transport modes were not substantial. Business trips sometimes appeared to give travellers more flexibility, some other times not. Origin and destination did have an impact on reaction, as well as the presence of children whilst travelling. Mixed results were obtained about socio-economic and attitudinal variables. Age in particular did not appear to have a significant effect. Whilst most respondents did acknowledge no external influence in their decision, results showed an important contribution of transport organisation staff, as well as home and mobile internet technology. A limited but still considerable number of respondents indicated their closest friends/relatives as the main influence of their decisions. The results will help planners deploy strategies to mitigate the negative effects of weather related disruptions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the enormous influence of the oil revenue on Nigeria's economy, the study separates the effects of oil on the fiscal balance and the current account balance. In line with existing literature, the causal link between the fiscal balance and current account takes into consideration the contemporaneous effects on the current account balance brought about by exchange-rate fluctuations, the growth in GDP, and the growth in money supply. The models are estimated using time-series data from 1970 to 2012, using the Johansen estimation techniques. The results from the estimation results reveal the existence of a positive and stable relationship between government budget surplus and the current account balance in the overall economy. In the non-oil segment, on the other hand, there is evidence of a twin-deficit, a fact which has been blurred by proceeds from the oil revenue. The unequivocal conclusion is that the country remains over-reliant on the revenue generated by oil; also, the proceeds from oil have not yet trickled down to the rest of the economy.","Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa",University of South Africa,"Akanbi, OA (通讯作者)，Univ S Africa, Dept Econ, POB 392, ZA-0003 Pretoria, South Africa.",akanboa@unisa.ac.za,"akanbi, olusegun ayodele o.a/I-3763-2013",,,,,,36,3,3,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Evidence from building investments,REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Residential investment; School performance; House prices,REHABILITATION; CAPITALIZATION,"For most households in the U.S. the public school to which they send their children is tied to the geographic location of their home. Economic theory predicts that households take into account the quality of the public school when making residential decisions. A large body of literature has documented that school quality alters the demand for housing in a neighborhood as measured by the capitalization of school quality into house prices. Demand for schools may also affect the quality of the housing stock by creating incentives for property owners to better maintain their buildings and units. Exploration of this potential relationship has been absent from the discussion on how schools influence communities. I attempt to fill this gap through investigating the relationship between school quality and capital investments in the housing stock. To investigate whether a relationship exists between schools and property owner capital investment activity, (rely on detailed building level investment data in New York City as well as measures of school performance. I explore whether consistent measures of school performance are associated with higher levels of investment activity. To identify whether this relationship is causal, that good schools can spur investment activity, I incorporate a boundary discontinuity identification strategy. Further, I test whether households respond to changes in school performance, exploring whether improvements in test scores over a five-year period are associated with higher levels of residential investments. Finally, I control for differences in populations across attendance zone boundaries through incorporating information on the composition of students at each school. My results suggest a significant relationship between performance in math and English Language Arts and property owner capital investment behavior. In my preferred specification, I estimate that a one standard deviation improvement in test scores is associated with a 2.5 percent increase in dollars invested in a building. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In the literature of European integration such reform is commonly considered to be the result of a bias towards liberalization in the treaties, thereby giving the European Commission and the European Court of Justice wide-ranging leverage to enforce such reform. However, such approaches have been criticized for being de-politicized - for failing to understand the conflicts inherent in controversial policies. It is therefore of interest to explore the scope conditions of this constitutional bias assumption in areas where liberalization policy is disputed. This article analyzes the EU decision-making processes across the postal, public transport and port service sectors, highlighting three key conditions, in addition to the treaties' legal foundation. These are: the organization of public services; mobilization by large interests, such as trade unions; and how willing the European Commission is to give in to concessional demands.","[Leiren, Merethe Dotterud] Univ Agder, Kristiansand, Norway",University of Agder,"Leiren, MD (通讯作者)，Norwegian Ctr Transport Res, Inst Transport Econ, Gaustadalleen 21, N-0349 Oslo, Norway.",mdl@toi.no,,,,,,,41,3,3,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

His approach leaves unquestioned the relationship between identity, interests and these practices. This article reorients these discussions towards the literature on security, identity and foreign policy. It argues that security practices are performative, that they play an active role in constructing the selves' they claim to protect and the others' deemed threatening or as targets for intervention.

This is wrong in the case of simultaneity, and causal conclusions can be misleading. Nevertheless, the empirical relevance of this problem still needs to be determined. Therefore, the magnitude and stability of possible errors are analysed in a simulation study. It is shown that economic misinterpretations of tests of Granger causality can occur with probability one for realistic parameter values. Thus, policy conclusions from Granger causality tests can be wrong with probability one if simultaneity occurs. Furthermore, the power of the test can be rather low even with a sample size of T = 50.","[Wilde, Joachim] Univ Osnabruck, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany",University Osnabruck,"Wilde, J (通讯作者)，Univ Osnabruck, Dept Econ, Rolandstr 8, D-49069 Osnabruck, Germany.",joachim.wilde@uni-osnabrueck.de,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

For the first decade after the end of communist rule, managers were drawn mainly from the second level of management of the state-owned enterprises of communist times. As a group they had been selected and formed in late communism.

On the other hand they had to adapt to their new environment drawing on the skills and mentality they had developed under the old regime.

Three types of methodology are applied to establish the tourism performance of the destinations. The study covers 27 large and small countries in the EU, but excludes Malta. In addition, two representative indicators of output are used: destination attractiveness and annual data on bed-nights and nights spent. Therefore, the paper uses data envelopment analysis (DEA), super-efficiency DEA and the non-radial Nerlove-Luenberger super-efficiency DEA model to narrow down the partition between efficiency and inefficiency scores in large and small countries in terms of development.","[Abad, Arnaud; Kongmanwatana, Papangkorn] Univ Perpignan, IAE, CAEPEM, F-66860 Perpignan, France",Universite Perpignan Via Domitia,"Abad, A (通讯作者)，Univ Perpignan, IAE, CAEPEM, Via Domitia,52 Ave Paul Alduy, F-66860 Perpignan, France.",arnaud.abad@univ-perp.fr; papangkorn.kongmanwatana@univ-perp.fr,"Abad, Arnaud/AAA-4195-2021","Abad, Arnaud/0000-0002-7202-6088",,,,,84,6,6,0,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

However, transportation of large amounts of sludge from wastewater treatment facilities to a biorefinery is expensive. The objective of this paper is to identify the proper transportation mode to use as a function of the volume shipped and transportation distances. Currently, sludge is mainly shipped by truck and pipeline. We estimated that the fixed and variable cost components of pipeline transportation for a volume such as 480 m(3)/day and a distance of 100 miles are $0.116/m(3) and $0.089/m(3)/mile, respectively. We estimated the biomass (sludge) transportation cost per gallon of biodiesel, and observed the changes in these costs as a function of distance traveled and volume shipped. The outcomes of this study have the potential to help biofuel plants make better biomass transportation decisions, and consequently reduce the price of biodiesel significantly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Reductions in travel times are usually a key benefit. However, if a project also reduces the variability of travel time, travellers, freight operators and shippers will enjoy additional benefits, the 'reliability benefits'. Until now, these benefits are usually not included in the cost-benefit analysis. To include reliability of travel or transport time in the cost-benefit analysis of infrastructure projects not only monetary values of reliability, but also reliability forecasting models are needed. As a result of an extensive feasibility study carried out for the German Federal Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development this paper aims to provide a literature overview and outcomes of an expert panel on how best to calculate and monetise reliability benefits, synthesised into recommendations for implementing travel time reliability into existing transport models in the short, medium, and long term.

The idea is to consider movements in market shares as much more than mere elements of the market structure. In fact, these movements reflect conduct that arises from that market. If shares are mean-reverting, then firm actions have only a temporary effect on shares. On the other hand, if shares are evolving, as signaled by the presence of unit roots, then any gain in shares with respect to the competitors is long term. To illustrate the potential of unit-roots tests, the paper considers an application to the Italian retail banking industry.","Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Giannetti, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",caterina.giannetti@unibo.it,,"GIANNETTI, CATERINA/0000-0003-2962-3087",,,,,43,1,1,0,4,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

For much of 2011, the euro was a key reserve currency, oblivious to the chaos ravaging European economies. Now, however, the gravity of the crisis is finally dragging down the euro. As the Euro zone debt crisis enters its third uncertain year, the question about whether the euro can survive rises. This paper argues that the euro can survive given policymakers still have in hand various tools. These tools include creating exit rules, implementing new stabilisation rules and instruments, adopting new fiscal policy, introducing conditional Eurobonds, using inflation differentials and providing more independence to the European Central Bank.","Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Haidar, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",,,"Haidar, Jamal/0000-0002-9975-9441",,,,,9,1,1,0,20,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2015,38.0,3.0,,,,,553,567,,10.1111/twec.12230,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CD6DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351179700006,0

This article analyzes new survey data - a novel panel study of 1,729 students from 28 universities in six countries - and finds the opposite: participation in an Erasmus exchange is significantly and positively related to changes in both identification as European and identification with Europe. Furthermore, the data underscore the significance of cross-border interaction and cognitive mobilization for explaining identity change: transnational contact during the exchange is positively related to change in both dimensions of European identity, and increased knowledge of Europe and attention to European news over the course of the exchange is associated with enhanced identification with Europe.","[Mitchell, Kristine] Dickinson Coll, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA",Dickinson College,"Mitchell, K (通讯作者)，Dickinson Coll, Dept Polit Sci & Int Studies, POB 1773, Carlisle, PA 17013 USA.",mitchelk@dickinson.edu,,,,,,,40,53,59,4,66,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

An alternative conception of money, based on the chartalist approach, is more useful for grasping the fundamental weaknesses in European monetary union (EMU). Overall, the argument is that EMU will remain a fragile edifice as long as the eurozone does not create a centralized and legitimate political authority capable of taxing eurozone citizens at the European level.

These nonparametric methods use functional principal components to describe these densities over time. This method is applied to a novel administrative firm-level database from Statistics Canada to investigate the evolution of the 1985 and 1989 cohorts of new entrants. We find that firm leverage (debt-to-asset ratio) distributions have persistent deviations from the initial distributions. Bootstrap test statistics suggest that the distributions are different across all time periods. Firm size and labour productivity have transitory deviations and some of the distributions are the same across all time periods. Univariate finite mixture and stochastic dominance tests are used to conduct pairwise comparisons as robustness measures. We find that these static pairwise comparisons confirm the dynamic evolution of these densities. This method illustrates the efficacy of functional principal components to analyse firm distributions.,"[Huynh, Kim P.] Bank Canada, Currency Dept, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada; [Jacho-Chavez, David T.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Petrunia, Robert J.] Lakehead Univ, Dept Econ, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Voia, Marcel C.] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON K1S 5B6, Canada",Bank of Canada; Emory University; Lakehead University; Carleton University,"Jacho-Chávez, DT (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Econ, 1602 Fishburne Dr,Rich Bldg,3rd Floor, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",kim@huynh.tv; djachocha@emory.edu; rpetruni@lakeheadu.ca; mvoia@connect.carleton.ca,"Huynh, Kim P/G-3257-2010; Voia, Marcel-Cristian/ABF-7355-2022","Huynh, Kim/0000-0003-2015-0244; Voia, Marcel/0000-0002-9895-5299; Jacho-Chavez, David/0000-0003-3511-422X",,,,,27,7,7,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

However, little is known about how these issues are intertwined. Here, we assess the causal relationship between food security during early childhood and relatively long-run measures of child health. Identifying this causal relationship is complicated due to endogenous selection and misclassification errors. To overcome these difficulties, we utilize a nonparametric bounds approach along with data from the ECLS-K and ECLS-B. In the absence of misclassification, the analysis suggests a positive (unconditional) association, albeit statistically insignificant, between food insecurity and future child obesity. However, in the absence of strong assumptions concerning the selection and misclassification processes, we are unable to rule out the possibility of no long-run causal relationship between food security and child obesity.","[Millimet, Daniel L.] So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA; [Roy, Manan] LLC, IMPAQ Int, Columbia, MD USA",Southern Methodist University; American Institutes for Research,"Millimet, D (通讯作者)，So Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Box 0496, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",millimet@smu.edu; mroy@impaqint.com,"Millimet, Daniel/ABF-3719-2020","Millimet, Daniel/0000-0001-5178-5993",,,,,69,8,8,0,23,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

In contrast to the cost function approach, the IDF does not require input prices which are usually unavailable or measured imprecisely. In addition, we can account for equity and physical capital in the IDF. These variables are either excluded from the analysis (especially in a cost function approach) or treated as quasi-fixed inputs, because their prices are not readily available. In our application, we use data for bank holding companies and large commercial banks in the U.S. from 2000 to 2010. We find that although some of these institutions enjoy increasing returns to scale, scale economies are economically small. Thus, concerns about potential cost increases arising from breaking up large banking organizations seem exaggerated, especially from the scale economies point of view.","[Restrepo-Tobon, Diego] EAFIT Univ, Medellin, Colombia; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Binghamton Univ, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",Universidad EAFIT; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Restrepo-Tobón, D (通讯作者)，EAFIT Univ, Carrera 49 7 50, Medellin, Colombia.",drestr16@eafit.edu.co; kkar@binghamton.edu,,"RESTREPO-TOBON, DIEGO/0000-0002-9054-3847",,,,,27,7,10,0,5,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Most notably, the publication of The Stalin Puzzle has helped bring attention to the persistence of positive accounts and admiration, along with ambivalent and contested images, of the former dictator of the Soviet Union. Using survey data and multivariate statistical methods, we test five broad hypotheses - socialization, structural, ideological, nationalist, and gender - to ascertain what factors might shape people's attitudes toward Stalin in Georgia. Our analysis reveals that elderly, poor men from rural areas have the most positive associations of Stalin, whereas young, wealthier women from cities, those who are open to privatization, and perceive Russia as Georgia's biggest threat judge Stalin negatively. Counterintuitively, non-Georgian minorities show higher esteem for Stalin than Georgians. We envision that the effects of cohort replacement, economic development, and urbanization will decrease positive perceptions of Stalin in years to come.","[Gugushvili, Alexi] Univ Bremen, BIGSSS, D-28334 Bremen, Germany; [Gugushvili, Alexi] Ctr Social Sci, Tbilisi, Georgia; [Kabachnik, Peter] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, New York, NY USA",University of Bremen; City University of New York (CUNY) System; College of Staten Island (CUNY),"Gugushvili, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, BIGSSS, Wiener Str,Celsiusstr, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",agugushvili@bigsss.uni-bremen.de,,"Kabachnik, Peter/0000-0003-1690-172X; Gugushvili, Alexi/0000-0002-3933-9111",,,,,103,14,14,1,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Ranking of alternatives for several criteria is a multi-criteria evaluation problem. Ranking of countries in terms of several sustainable development indicators is a multi-criteria evaluation problem. In this paper, an integrated approach composed of Entropy and TOPSIS methods is used. Entropy method is an objective way for determination of criteria weights. TOPSIS method is one of the useful multi-criteria decision making techniques that is very simple and easy to implement, so that it is used when the user prefers a simpler weighting approach. The basic principle of TOPSIS method is that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal solution. The positive ideal solution is a solution that maximizes the benefit criteria and minimizes the cost criteria, whereas the negative ideal solution maximizes the cost criteria and minimizes the benefit criteria. The integrated approach is applied to 28 European Union countries and Turkey with 19 sustainable development indicators. According to selected sustainable development indicators, Sweden is the most sustainable country among EU countries.

In 2010, the government approved the currently valid Strategic Framework for Sustainable Development in the Czech Republic, which serves as the basis for drawing up strategic materials (sectoral policies and action plans), and for strategic decision making within state and regional public administration. The sustainable development of society is unthinkable without sustainable transport that significantly affects all three pillars. The concept of sustainable transport in the Czech Republic is embedded in the Transport Policy of the Czech Republic for 2014 2020 with the Prospect of 2050 based on the transport strategy of the European Commission (Transport 2050). The aim is to create a competitive transport system that will improve mobility and remove major barriers in key areas (fuel consumption, employment). The strategy pursues far-reaching transformation of the transport system supporting independence from oil, modern infrastructure and multimodal mobility through appropriate management and information systems. It focuses on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions reduction. The European Union transport policy heads towards significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this paper is to analyse the long-term development of CO2 emissions in transport as a whole and in individual transport modes. The development is assessed mainly with regard to the transport policy objectives of the Czech Republic in individual observation periods and with regard to developments within the European Union.

In credit cooperative field, the presence of a gender diversity can qualify among the mutual aims and social sector should pursue. With reference to cooperative banks, the work aims to verify whether board gender diversity increases the creation of value for stakeholders, in terms of stakeholders global value added (shareholders, employees, customers, regulators, community and external environment). Design/methodology/approach - We propose an econometric approach based on OLS regression model; the econometric model adopted to test our research hypothesis take into account three dependent variables in order to measure the amount and the distribution of value created by each cooperative bank, like Global Value Added Index, HHI Index and GINI Index. Regarding the regressors in order to express the bank governance profile, the choice of variables is based on the results of the studies relating to bank governance-performance. Our model takes also into account other macro-economic control regressors. The model is tested on a sample of Italian cooperative banks. Originality/value - Previous studies on board gender diversity in cooperative banks are particularly limited as a result of limited information and opacity of this field. The existing studies are limited to analyses of the effects on performance of the separation between ownership and control or of the corporate and governance structures, neglecting the dynamics of gender diversity; recently, some authors have investigated the relationship between the composition of loan portfolios and the structure and membership of the boards of cooperative banks in Spain, without however considering the board gender diversity. Our work allows you to expand the knowledge on the issue of governance of cooperative banks. Our study proposes some indicators to assess the social and mutual performance of cooperative banks; it puts in evidence if board gender diversity may improve the amount and also the equity distribution of the value creation process to stakeholders' cooperative banks. Practical implications - The outcomes of the paper may indicate possible best practices with respect to bank governance in bad economic times. So the gender diversity in board cooperative bank may contribute to support better business performance and, specifically, the bank's ability to create and distribute finance customers characterized by a lower credit risk. Based on these results, some managerial implications are proposed.","[Boscia, Vittorio; Marchetti, Pietro; Stefanelli, Valeria] Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, I-73100 Lecce, LE, Italy",University of Salento,"Stefanelli, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Econ Sci, Via Monteroni,Complesso Ecotekne, I-73100 Lecce, LE, Italy.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,15,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,900,912,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200068,0

On the basis of econometric analysis there was estimated the probability of training and its return depending on the characteristics of the worker (gender, age, level of education, work experience), characteristics of the organization (ownership, size, type of economic activity) and characteristics of the training program (compliance of the program with the existing profession of the employee, sources of funding). Based on the analysis of econometric models, the authors conclude that the coverage of workers' education is uneven, and the return on internal training is significantly differentiated by types of economic activity. Low returns on education allow authors to suggest that the decisions about personnel training are based on the requirements of the Russian legislation, but not the needs of the personnel competence development in order to meet the organization's objectives.","[Burtseva, Olga; Stuken, Tatiana; Lapina, Tatiana] Omsk State Univ, Pr Mira 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia",Dostoevsky Omsk State University,"Burtseva, O (通讯作者)，Omsk State Univ, Pr Mira 55-A, Omsk 644077, Russia.",olishb@yandex.ru; stuken@mail.ru; lapinaomgu@gmail.com,"Korzhova, Olga/G-2441-2017; Stuken, Tatiana/H-6777-2016; Lapina, Tatyana A./G-6635-2013",,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,260,269,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000025,0

The larval activity causes damages to flowers and new shoots. In addition, the young larvae can penetrate the small fruits. The growers may spray several times per year prevalently with organophosphate insecticides. Starting from 2006 a new IPM approach was evaluated: we carried out experimental trials of different chemical compounds and tested the possibility of timing the insecticide applications by means of monitoring the male flights with pheromone traps. In the years 2007, 2010 and 2011, the efficacy of fosmet (organophosphate), flufenoxuron (Insect Growth Regulator) and Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki, was evaluated on young lemon trees. The results, previously published, suggested that OPs could be substituted, or at least alternated, with IGRs and Bt for the control of CFM. Starting from 2006, pheromone (Z-7 tetradecenale) traps were placed for six years in two lemon nurseries, and the infestation level on flowers, young fruits and new shoots was recorded. The first plot (nursery located in Messina province) was subjected to an intensive spray program; the second plot (nursery located in Catania province) was submitted to a very low impact spray program. Only the data obtained in the Catania nursery produced a positive linear correlation between male captures and infestation percentage. Depending to economic target pursued, growers can themselves establish a maximum level of captures as an alert threshold.","[Conti, Filadelfo; Fisicaro, Roberta] Osservatorio Malattie Piante, Serv Fitosanitario Reg, Assessorato Agr Sviluppo Rurale & Pesca Mediterra, Reg Siciliana, Acireale, Italy",,"Conti, F (通讯作者)，Osservatorio Malattie Piante, Serv Fitosanitario Reg, Assessorato Agr Sviluppo Rurale & Pesca Mediterra, Reg Siciliana, Acireale, Italy.",fconti@regione.sicilia.it,,,,,,,11,0,0,2,7,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1165,1171,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600148,0

Water services providers offer the defence that they are operating as efficiently as they can, given their specific circumstances, and that further increases in efficiency to reduce levels of leakage would require increased tariffs that are always politically unpopular. As a result, one of the main challenges for water supply managers is the definition of a sustainable plan to reduce water losses caused by leakage. The objective of this research is to support the decision makers in selecting a set of engineering solutions (e.g., leak detection and repairs and rehabilitation projects) to reduce leakage, namely a leakage plan or program, that takes into account the conflicting objectives of the actors involved, as well as the uncertainties characterizing these contexts. Design/methodology/approach - To accomplish with the research objective, an original approach is developed to determine a sustainable plan of leakage reduction. Starting from the concept of sustainability and its dimensions, it is able to combine different types of engineering solutions to reduce leakage (rehabilitation plan, pressure control, etc.), the conflicting objectives of the actors involved (water company and community), as well as the uncertainty-related factors that characterize these contexts (meteorological events, demand variability, etc.). Originality/value - This paper focuses on water supply system leakage, a high-profile topic worldwide due to the increasing international trend towards sustainability, economic efficiency and environmental protection. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it fills the existing gap in the literature on leakage management through the development of an innovative approach. It overcomes the limitation of the existing studies, by i) combining different types of engineering solutions to reduce leakage and not analysing just one type of intervention (e.g., rehabilitation versus pressure control activity), ii) considering the conflicting objectives of the actors involved (water company and community) and iii) including the uncertainty-related factors that characterize these contexts. Second, this paper develops an approach that will support the decision makers (practitioners) in selecting a sustainable plan of leakage reduction. Practical implications - The outcomes of the analysis is intended to provide some managerial implications that can be useful for water company managers that face with water resource management planning.","[Costantino, Nicola; Pellegrino, Roberta] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Mathemat & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy; [Giustolisi, Orazio] Politecn Bari, Dipartimento Sci Ingn Civile & Architettura, I-70125 Bari, Italy; [Mazzolani, Gianfredi] Acquedotto Pugliese, Controllo Sistemi Idrici & Sviluppo, Direz Pianificaz & Controllo, I-70121 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari; Politecnico di Bari,"Pellegrino, R (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Mathemat & Management, Viale Japigia 182, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",,"Giustolisi, Orazio/AAL-8671-2021; Pellegrino, Roberta/AFL-4164-2022; Costantino, Nicola/Q-4525-2018","Pellegrino, Roberta/0000-0002-1098-4547;",,,,,28,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2263,2273,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200178,0

One of the most known resistance gene to leaf rust is Lr34, involved in adult plant resistance (APR) or slow rusting type. In order to obtain cultivars with good levels of protection several resistant gene complexes need to be combined. Another gene that confers resistance to a wide range of races of Puccinia triticina, is Lr37, originated from Triticum ventricosum, 2NS chromosome. Our study was focused on detection of the Lr34 and Lr37 genes in 50 wheat breeding lines using molecular markers. The molecular assay showed the presence of Lr34 resistance allele in 62% (homozygous genotypes) while the Lr37 resistance allele was detected in 40% of the total genotypes analysed.

In this paper, we focus on provisions for technical regulations and analyze whether the North-South harmonization of technical barriers affects international trade. Using a gravity equation, we test whether, as a result of the deep integration associated with standards provisions included in the EIA, the Southern partners' trade expands with the North, but at the expense of their trade with non-bloc Southern partners. Empirical results provide strong support for this conjecture. Moreover, harmonization on the basis of regional standards negatively impacts the exports of developing countries to the North.

Given the growing prevalence of chronic disease (e.g. cancer), secondary prevention (screenings of risky population) has the potential for achieving significant savings in the health care system. Nowadays, many national health care systems are focusing on disease preventing activities. Pap test is proven to be the most cost-effective method of early detection of cervical cancer. Unfortunately, with the model of opportunistic screening a large percentage of women rarely undergo the Pap test, which points to a need for an organized screening program. One of the goals of such programs is to detect a larger population of women with pathological cell changes. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the justification for the implementation of organized screening for cervical cancer by examining the relationship between the number of Pap tests and number of pathological Pap test results as a share in abnormal Pap test results. The estimation is carried out within vector autoregressive (VAR) model and Granger causality testing. Standard Granger causality analysis was helpful in establishing the direction of causal links between the variables of interest, while the signs of these relationships are examined by using impulse response function. Findings suggest that there is a unidirectional causality that runs from number of conducted Pap smears to the share of pathological in abnormal Pap results. Also, results indicate that Pap smears cause a positive response in the share of pathological in abnormal Pap results. This indicates that as the number of conducted Pap smears increases (which can only be done as part of organized screening programs) there will be more cases of an early detection of disease, which could result in healthier population and decrease in health care costs, resulting in less insolvency problems for individuals as well as for the public health care.","[Dukic, Nikolina; Zikovic, Ivana Tomas] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia; [Jankovic, Suzana] Univ Rijeka, Sch Med, Publ Hlth Teaching Inst Primorsko Goranska Cty, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Dukic, N (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, I Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ndukic@efri.hr; itomas@efri.hr; pomocnik@zzjzpgz.hr,"Tomas Žiković, Ivana/AAJ-8542-2020; Dukic Samarzija, Nikolina/S-4727-2018","Tomas Žiković, Ivana/0000-0002-9156-3479; Dukic Samarzija, Nikolina/0000-0002-5158-5809",,,,,24,1,1,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,294,304,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100029,0

We analyze the joint use of environmental liability law and R&D subsidies to internalize the double externality. Two alternative liability rules are considered: strict liability and negligence. In a complete information scenario, the social optimum in terms of emission levels and technical progress may be induced by combining either liability rule with an appropriate R&D subsidy. However, when the policy maker has incomplete information with respect to a firm's productivity of R&D investments and non-discriminatorily sets a uniform liability rule and a uniform subsidy, only the so-called double negligence rule that imposes both an emission and a technology standard can induce the social optimum (if any one). The double negligence rule dominates strict liability with respect to the goal of minimizing social costs under modest conditions, also in cases in which none of the liability rules is capable of inducing first-best behavior among firms. Somewhat counterintuitively, a non-discriminatory double negligence rule can even dominate a (simple as well as double) negligence rule with type-specific norms and compliance-contingent type-specific subsidies.","[Endres, Alfred; Rundshagen, Bianca] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, D-58084 Hagen, Germany; [Endres, Alfred] Univ Witten Herdecke, Witten, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] Univ Bonn, Ctr Adv Studies Law & Econ, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Witten Herdecke University; University of Bonn,"Endres, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 11, D-58084 Hagen, Germany.",alfred.endres@fernuni-hagen.de,"Friehe, Tim/ABF-4676-2020","Friehe, Tim/0000-0002-9390-3537",,,,,30,6,6,2,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2015,44.0,1.0,,,,,151,178,,10.1007/s00355-014-0826-7,0.0,,,28,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ5SA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348278800009,0

For both pathogens, the experiments were performed in water suspensions at a final concentration of 105 CFU/ml. Tap water was used as a control. The results showed that fungal spores and bacterial cells were affected by flow rate and current density applied. The higher the water flow rate the greater the inactivation of the two microorganisms which were completely suppressed at high recirculation flow (300-600 L/h/cell). Pseudomonas spp. cells were inactivated at the highest current density applied (8-12A) after 6 min of electrolysis, whereas for P. digitatum the complete inactivation was observed at the same current densities after 12 min.

Powerful traditions in British political culture certainly inclined the UK to be an awkward partner' in Europe. Yet traditions are material from which politics is constructed, not fixed frameworks for destiny. This article argues that a careful historical reconstruction of the development and consolidation of today's British Euroscepticism - with its stronghold on the political right - passes substantially through the distinctive personal influence of Margaret Thatcher. The Iron Lady's individual action and legacy, magnified by a series of contingencies, generated the core dynamics that soured Britain's ties to Europe so bitterly. Had Thatcher not personally inspired this course, the traditions of British national identity and British Conservatism in particular could very plausibly have evolved in less anti-European directions.

The questionnaire was validated with Exploratory Factor Analysis with the factorization method and maximum likelihood method Rotation is using the Varimax. Bartlett's Sphericity Test and Kaiser Meyer Olkin's (KMO) Measure were performed. Structural equation model with EQS was chosen to test the reliability of planned behavior models and model values.

Originality/value - PBT, Ajzen (1985) defines intention in terms of trying to engage in a particular behavior in relation to the current behavior. Is that when trying to modify a behavior is experiencing another intention. (PBT), (Schifter and Ajzen, 1985) contains several variables that influence behavioral intention, and these are: attitude, subjective norm and perceived control. Practical implications - In Mexico there are no studies that have applied PBT, so that the results can be very valuable for the development of business strategies. Being able to identify factors that influence the final decision making, provides a tool for reducing both costs and effort and makes accurate decisions. A good application of the PBT favors business competitiveness.","[Gonzalez-Uribe, Elsa Georgina; Sanchez-Gutierrez, Jose; Mejia-Trejo, Juan] Univ Guadalajara, Mkt & Int Business Dept, Zapopan 45100, Jalisco, Mexico",Universidad de Guadalajara,"Gonzalez-Uribe, EG (通讯作者)，Univ Guadalajara, Mkt & Int Business Dept, Perifer Norte 799-G 306, Zapopan 45100, Jalisco, Mexico.",,"MEJIA TREJO, JUAN/HNP-8104-2023; SANCHEZ-GUTIERREZ, JOSE/P-8490-2015","SANCHEZ-GUTIERREZ, JOSE/0000-0002-0120-7201",,,,,48,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1689,1704,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200129,0

Larger firms are usually more established in their markets, diversified and less likely to fail. Therefore, it has been argued that size can be seen as an inverse measure of bankruptcy risk. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between firm size and the capital structure of Croatian small and medium-sized enterprises. Most of previous studies have shown a positive relationship between firm size and leverage. But, several empirical studies found negative relationship between firm size and leverage. This study has been conducted on a sample of 500 Croatian SMEs for the period between 2005 and 2010. The data used for the empirical analysis were taken from companies annual reports. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is applied in order to examine the relationship between firm size and leverage measures. The results of this research indicate negative relationship between firm size and leverage. But, firm size differently affect short-term and long-term leverage. The relationship between firm size and short-term leverage is negative but not statistically significant in all observed years. The relationship between firm size and long-term leverage is positive in all observed years but is not statistically significant, except one year. These results suggests that larger Croatian SME's are mostly more profitable and use more retained earnings to finance their business. This finding is consistent with the packing order theory which predicts a negative relationship between firm size and the leverage.","[Harc, Martina] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, Zagreb, Croatia",Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts,"Harc, M (通讯作者)，Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Inst Sci Res & Artist Work Osijek, Zagreb, Croatia.",harcm@hazu.hr,,,,,,,20,4,4,0,5,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,315,324,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100031,0

However, its bud mutation, 'Nishiuchi Konatsu' (NK), is self-compatible, although the majority of seeds are aborted in mature fruits. In our previous studies, we revealed that NK produces a proportion of unreduced 2n pollen grains, resulting in unusual seed development. In this study, we therefore focused on seed and embryo development after pollination of HY, NK, and 'Hassaku' (HS), which is compatible with both HY and NK, with NK pollen. Seeds from HY x NK and NK x NK fruits were significantly smaller than those from HS-pollinated fruits (i.e. HY x HS and NK x HS) at 10-12 weeks after pollination, suggesting that the seed abortion phenotype was expressed during this time period. Moreover, embryos that formed from NK self-pollination were shown to have aborted at 10 weeks after pollination, whereas control embryos reached the globular or heart-shaped stage. HS x NK resulted in both normal and aborted seeds present in the fruit. Development of some embryos was found to cease at 12 weeks after pollination. At 14 weeks after pollination, normal and aborted seeds were easily distinguishable. Preliminary attempts of embryo rescue were also conducted in order to recover triploid seedlings. Aborting embryos obtained from HY x NK and NK x NK were placed on MT media supplemented with 500 mg/L malt extract, 50 g/L sucrose, and 5 mM GA(3). As a result, several triploid plantlets were confirmed by flow cytometry after embryo recovery from both crosses, although the success rate was not high.","[Honsho, Chitose; Tsuruta, Kyoko; Ryuto, Kentaro; Sakata, Aisa; Tetsumura, Takuya] Miyazaki Univ, Fac Agr, Miyazaki 88921, Japan; [Kuroki, Shirou; Nishiwaki, Aya] Miyazaki Univ, Fac Agr, Field Sci Ctr, Miyazaki 88921, Japan",University of Miyazaki; University of Miyazaki,"Honsho, C (通讯作者)，Miyazaki Univ, Fac Agr, Miyazaki 88921, Japan.",chitose@cc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp,"Honsho, Chitose/ABF-8116-2021","Honsho, Chitose/0000-0002-8959-5519",,,,,5,6,7,0,1,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,181,186,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600018,0

The study strives to provide a holistic framework for better understanding the emergence and nature of knowledge-based entrepreneurship. In the industrial age the owners of tangibles assets such as land, physical and financial capital are the entrepreneurs. In the knowledge age, knowledge is the major input for value creation in organisations, and the owners of this intangible asset, referred to as knowledge workers are understood as potential entrepreneurs alike. Knowledge is a widespread asset that dilutes the potential of entrepreneurship at different levels. This is allowed and reinforced by the prevalence of easier and more accessible information and communication technologies. Design/methodology/approach - A three-level approach is elicited in order to gain a better understanding of the prevalence of knowledge-based entrepreneurship in our contemporary economies: a macro, a meso and a micro level of analysis. The macro level relates to the current knowledge-based paradigm that defines the general framework where activities unfold. A particular focus is given to the role played by technology in fostering knowledge-based entrepreneurship. The meso level investigates how organisations fit into this framework and how they influence it in turn. The theme of organisational knowledge-intensity is explored. The micro level is concerned with understanding the nature and actions of knowledge-based entrepreneurship and addresses specifically knowledge workers. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the existing body on knowledge workers and their entrepreneurial nature. It provides a holistic framework suggesting that knowledge-based entrepreneurship should be understood holistically. This contribution also emphasise that any knowledge worker is a potential entrepreneur in knowledge economies. He or she is not exclusively involved in creating a firm or leading one but he or she can also be involved in generating new activities within large corporations. Ubiquitous technologies provide infinite possibilities for learning, strengthening one's knowledge base and innovating. Finally, the uncertainties and constant changes characterising our economies require constant adaptation through creativity and risk taking. Practical implications - The holistic perspective explored in the study provides a framework where the most important features of knowledge-based entrepreneurship are introduced. It offers then a base for reflection and action for managers concerned with increasing firm's competitiveness while relying on intangible assets.","[Khadir-Poggi, Yasmina; Keating, Mary] Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Coll Green, Dublin, Ireland",Trinity College Dublin,"Khadir-Poggi, Y (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll Dublin, Sch Business, Coll Green, D2, Dublin, Ireland.",,"Khadir, Yasmina/ITU-4124-2023","Khadir, Yasmina/0000-0002-8892-1431",,,,,60,0,0,0,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,697,708,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200054,0

This paper investigates the determinants of the use of currencies in trade invoicing and evaluates the potential of the renminbi for the denomination of cross-border transactions in the Asia-Pacific region. In particular, we develop a simple model and establish the evidence showing that there is a convex relationship between the invoicing share of a currency and the economic size of its issuing country because of a coalescing effect and thick market externalities. We use the ratio of the foreign exchange (FX) turnover share of a currency to the global GDP share of its issuing country as a proxy for the size of thick market externalities, which we argue reflects capital account openness, financial development and exchange rate stability of the country. This ratio is very small for the renminbi compared with the ratios for established international currencies. Our quantitative analysis suggests that the renminbi can be a major invoicing currency in the region only if China sufficiently opens up its capital account and liberalises its financial sector. We also draw a parallel between the renminbi and the euro and forecast the invoicing share of the renminbi in the Asia-Pacific region if the renminbi market attained the same degree of thickness as the euro.","[Lai, Edwin L-C] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yu, Xiangrong] Hong Kong Monetary Author, Hong Kong Inst Monetary Res, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA),"Lai, ELC (通讯作者)，Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",,"Lai, Edwin L.-C./ABB-8714-2020","Lai, Edwin/0000-0002-1188-4855",,,,,26,15,16,2,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2015,38.0,1.0,,,SI,,193,229,,10.1111/twec.12211,0.0,,,37,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AZ9BS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348506900010,0

In contrast to some previous studies, we examine the degree of integration in the US with a data set which runs into 2012 and thus captures the latest period of bubble and bust, and employing a recently developed set of tools which yield estimates which are 1) time-varying, and 2) account for differences not just in correlation but also in amplitude between different housing markets. Our results indicate that contrary to some previous findings, overall integration in the US was falling, not rising over the early years of the bubble (2001-05). This lends some credence to the lots of local bubbles conjecture of Greenspan that the early stages of the bubble reflected froth in some individual markets, rather than a large underlying national bubble. However, the late stages of the bubble exhibit a very sharp rise in integration, so the later bubble and subsequent bust likely reflected national (or global) factors. Finally we find substantial variation across regions in terms of how integrated they tend to be. This comports with previous findings on the low level of integration of regional income in the US, and the ability of home values to maintain substantial segmentation makes the use of housing in monetary policy problematic.","Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS 67260 USA",Wichita State University,"Miles, W (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, 1845 Fairmount, Wichita, KS 67260 USA.",william.miles@wichita.edu,,"Miles, William/0000-0002-7788-3011",,,,,18,22,21,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Appropriately, social science research is reflecting this increasing concern with gender and the field of gender research is dynamic and constantly evolving. Therefore, it is beneficial to step back at times and observe the main themes and patterns that are emerging. Design/methodology/approach - To gather data for our study 629 articles were examined on gender taken from two key journals (Gender, Work and Organisation and Gender in Management) to outline leading issues and themes in recent research between 2005 and 2014. Originality/value - This article contributes to the literature in several ways. First, it provides a focused analysis of gender research published in these last ten years, allowing researchers to gain a better understanding of the direction of the contemporary women in work and management research. Second, it highlights the emergence of women presence in firm's corporate governance as a major area of research. Third, it draws attention to key emerging research themes in the literature. Fourth, it notes a growing focus on applied research and signs of a narrowing of the gap between gender research and practice. Practical implications - The major implication is to advance knowledge and practice in the area of gender in management and leadership by focusing upon empirical research, theoretical developments, practice and current issues. The research addresses broad-ranging social issues, not limited to political and legislative decisions, social and educational policy and economic factors, in its consideration of gender in management and leadership. Finally our analysis highlights the emergence of women presence in firm's corporate governance as a major area of research.","[Paoloni, Paola] Niccolo Cusano Univ, Dept UNISU, Rome, Italy; [Demartini, Paola] Univ Roma Tre, Dept Management & Law, Rome, Italy; [Dumay, John] Macquarie Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia",Niccolo Cusano Online University; Roma Tre University; Macquarie University,"Paoloni, P (通讯作者)，Niccolo Cusano Univ, Dept UNISU, Via Don Gnocchi 3, Rome, Italy.",,"Dumay, John/A-2262-2014","Dumay, John/0000-0001-6896-850X",,,,,9,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,875,888,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200066,0

Theoretically, a research of young volunteer's motivation explains the essence of people's associations and collective actions. In practice, it provides opportunities for rationalization of volunteering management as an organizational resource (eg NGOs or social institutions). Theoretical review identified three global trends in volunteering connected with the motivation of volunteers: a) individualization of volunteering (change of actors), b) pragmatism and rationalization of volunteer activities, c) changes in the institutional context. The ratio of egoism and altruism in the volunteers' actions is a key issue of volunteering research. The article presents survey results of young volunteers (18-30 years old) in Sverdlovsk Region (N-600, 2014). Data analysis allowed to identify and describe three types of volunteers: 'altruists', 'egoists' and 'volunteers with mixed motives'. This type has been described using discriminant analysis. We assume that motivation of young Russian volunteers includes both altruistic and egoistic causes, and their actions are piecemeal. According to our findings, the features of young Russian volunteers correspond to the global trend. We showed that the specifics of volunteer activity, its inclusion in NPO sector is the source of changing volunteers and their motivation.","[Pevnaya, Maria; Kuzminchuk, Anna] Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Pevnaya, M (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Mira St 19, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",m.v.pevnaya@urfu.ru; a.a.kuzminchuk@urfu.ru,"Pevnaya, Maria/AAA-6886-2019; Pevnaya, Maria/E-4080-2014; Drozdova, Anna A/L-4435-2016","Pevnaya, Maria/0000-0003-3591-1181; Drozdova, Anna A/0000-0002-1599-8446",,,,,15,1,1,0,7,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1281,1290,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000122,0

The empirical research was aimed to analyze the importance of CSR for hotel companies in Croatia as a toll towards a more responsible tourism. Considering the numerous direct and indirect impacts of hotels on their natural and social environment, the implementation of CSR brings many challenges for them. CSR could be a catalyst for numerous innovative changes in the businesses operations, it can contribute to increased motivation, satisfaction and loyalty of employees, as well as improved relations with different internal and external stakeholders. The empirical research which was conduced on a representative sample of Croatian hotels has shown that hotel managers are aware of the impacts of CSR on the long-term competitiveness, the local community and the environment. However, in their business practice many activities related to CSR still have not been applied sufficiently. Those who implement some aspects of CSR are more committed to obtain environmental than social sustainability. This result was expected due to obtaining certain levels of environmental sustainability is easier and more tangible than obtaining social sustainability that requires changing or improving relations toward different internal and external stakeholders. As expected, the commitment to CSR is not dependent on the size of the hotel, but it depends on the awareness and knowledge of the hotel's owners and managers about the potential tangible and intangible benefits that can derive from the implementation of CSR for the company, their employees, the social community and the environment.","[Rakitovac, Kristina Afric] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Rakitovac, KA (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula, Croatia.",,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,10,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,155,162,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400020,0

The ranking of the models depends on the data set, the risk function and even changes over time. We find that a simple average of all asset allocation models can outperform each individual model.

Many studies reported the effects of postharvest application of ethylene on internal quality properties of the edible part of the citrus fruit. Nevertheless, information about the effect of degreening and quarantine treatments on their nutritional and aroma volatile compositions is scarce. In the present study, the effect of degreening with and without ethylene application followed by cold quarantine treatment on vitamin C, hesperidin, narirutin, didymin, sinensetin, nobiletin, tangeretin contents as well as antioxidant activity of 'Navelina' oranges and 'Clemenules' and 'Oronules' mandarins was investigated. The levels of ethanol, acetaldehyde, ethyl butanoate, hexanal, alpha-pinene, myrcene, ethyl hexanoate, octanal, limonene, linalool, nonanal and decanal compounds were also determined. These postharvest conditions did not induce dramatic changes of nutritional and aroma quality of fruit. On the other hand, the response to degreening process and the posterior quarantine treatment depended on the cultivar. Although some changes were observed in individual flavonoids compounds of 'Clemenules' mandarins and 'Navelina' oranges, degreening with and without ethylene exposure followed by cold quarantine storage had no impact on their nutritional and aroma compounds. Nevertheless, 'Oronules' mandarins showed the highest response to ethylene exposure and quarantine treatment with an increase in the level of flavonoids components as well as the level of some volatile compounds.","[Sdiri, Sawsen; Navarro, Pilar; Salvador, Alejandra] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Tecnol Postcosecha, Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Salvador, A (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Tecnol Postcosecha, Valencia, Spain.",salvador_ale@gva.es,"Chias, Pilar/F-9435-2016",,,,,,17,1,1,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1647,1653,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600211,0

The productive population will have to ensure sufficient resources for pensioners and the changes in age structure will cause disbalance between productive population earnings and post-productive population consumption. Both employment and pension policies and consequent services should be adapted to these demographic changes. More active participation of older workers is needed to keep the pension system and economic development in a balance, not only in the Czech Republic. Nowadays, the economic activity rate of people close to retirement is relatively low. The policy of preparation for population aging should focus on the support of employers' strategies towards older employees and the possibilities of the increase of their employment.

We estimate a directional technology distance function using parametric techniques to analyze the production technology and technical efficiency of a set of Spanish Port Authorities observed over the period 1993-2012. Technical inefficiency is conceived as the ability of ports to simultaneously expand a given output and contract variable inputs while maintaining quasi-fixed inputs and other outputs constant. Thus, for containerized cargo we address the following question: Given the amount of quasi-fixed inputs used by the firm and given the volume of the other outputs (liquids, solids, non-containerized cargo and passenger traffic), could ports increase their containerized merchandise while simultaneously reducing their variable inputs? Similar questions are asked for solid bulk and non-containerized general cargo. Our results show evidence of technical inefficiency among the ports in our sample. In particular, if the ports operated efficiently, we find that containerized cargo could be expanded by an average of over 6.4%, with an equivalent reduction in variable inputs. Solid bulk cargo and general non-containerized cargo could be increased by 4.1% and 6.1% respectively, with corresponding reductions in variable inputs. An implication of our results is that there is ample scope for specialization on the part of ports with no increase in infrastructure costs. Given that large investments in infrastructure have been made in Spanish port over the last decade, this opens the possibility of moving towards a management model based on taking advantage of existing capacity rather than new investments.

The model consist of worker capacity assessment and worker performance evaluation sub-models. The model measures the relationship between Total Mood Disturbance (TMD), heart rate of worker and workplace parameters using Kansei Engineering approach. However, the rapid measurement of TMD is difficult and full of bias since using the paper-based questionnaire of Profile of Mood States (POMS). Therefore, a rapid measurement method was developed using Artificial Neural Network to support the application of daily evaluation model. The inputs of the model were heart rate, workplace temperature, relative humidity, light intensity and noise level, which were measured before and after working. The output was TMD score. The training and inspection data for ANN was collected from workers of food production system as Tempe, Bakpia, Fish Chips and Crackers industries in Yogyakarta Special Region. ANN model were tested successfully predicted TMD score using back-propagation supervised learning method. The trained ANN model generated satisfied root mean square error value. ANN model is possible to substitute conventional data acquisition of POMS. The daily evaluation model is applicable to assist industrial management for providing the appropriate worker assignment for shift schedulling and environmental set point for the workplace comfortability.

More specifically, we look at the series of events participation and account for the fact that firms can often co-participate at the event with their competitors. Moreover, event co-participation with the same competitors can take place at several events. We, thus, focus on embeddedness in the structure of co-participation networks as a factor of innovative performance. Design/methodology/approach - The study relies on archival data collected from several sources (i.e. Web of Science's CPCI, Derwent Innovation Index, LexisNexis, Amadeus, SDC Platinum). The sample is represented by 470 SMEs operating in electronic industry during the period from 1991 to 2012. We calculated structural properties of each firm position in co-participation networks over time. Multiple models were tested using negative binominal regression. Originality/value - We propose an alternative view to look at the link between the events participation and innovative performance. This view suggest that events are places where firms get valuable knowledge, get signals about their competitors and their progress in patent races and also compete for limited resource of legitimacy. This represents a contribution to the recent discussions about the role and effects of events as temporary clusters on firm level innovation outcomes. Practical implications - Although a lot of money is spent every year on events little is still known on how to get maximum value from them in order to facilitate innovation on individual, regional and ecosystem levels and what are the most effective strategies for event participation. This study aims to help to answer some of these questions.","[Vlasov, Stanislav; Andreeva, Tatiana] St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, St Petersburg 199004, Russia; [Bahlmann, Marc] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ & Business Adm, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Saint Petersburg State University; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Vlasov, S (通讯作者)，St Petersburg State Univ, Grad Sch Management, Volkhovskiy Per 3, St Petersburg 199004, Russia.",,"Andreeva, Tatiana/F-4906-2015","Andreeva, Tatiana/0000-0002-4045-7254",,,,,22,0,0,0,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,863,874,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200065,0

However, the network of household services companies is insufficiently developed in rural areas, especially in highly peripheral towns and villages, which presents a serious setback in the development of the household services industry. An important role in the functioning and development of the services sector locally is to be played by municipal administrations since faster progress in the local services sector will act as a catalyst for local development capable of triggering a chain of stable intrinsic changes in the economy of a municipality.

According to our empirical study, there are large dynamics in TV viewership demand for sports events and the marginal effects of factors on viewership changes significantly as innings progress. The estimation results can be summarized as (1) the UOH was shown to be significant not only statistically but also economically; (2) although ex ante variables were more effective in earlier innings and ex post variables were more effective in later innings, we found that ex ante expectations of outcome uncertainty remain significantly influential in later innings; and (3) after the matchup, the ex ante game quality is the second most significant factor among the examined effects on ratings.","[Chung, Jigyu; Kang, Joon-Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Young Hoon; Kang, Joon-Ho] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Kinesiol, Seoul, South Korea; [Lee, Young Hoon] Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Sinsoo Dong 1, Seoul 121742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU); Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Sinsoo Dong 1, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446",National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5A2A01013738],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),"The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A5A2A01013738).",,32,22,23,1,8,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",1527-0025,1552-7794,,J SPORT ECON,J.

The school trip information of 1737 two-parent families with a student is extracted from Travel Behavior Inventory data collected by the Metropolitan Council between the Fall 2010 and Spring 2012. The model has four distinct characteristics including: (1) considering the student explicitly in the model, (2) allowing for bargaining or negotiation within households, (3) quantifying the intra-household interaction among family members, and (4) determining the decision weight function for household members. This framework also covers a household with three members, namely, a father, a mother, and a student, and unlike other studies it is not limited to dual-worker families. To test the hypotheses we build two models, each with and without the group-decision approach. The models are separately built for different age groups, namely students 6-12 and 12-18 years old. This study considers a wide range of variables such as work status of parents, age and gender of students, mode of travel, and distance to school. The findings of this study demonstrate that the elasticities of the two modeling approaches differ not only in the value, but in the sign in some cases. In 63% of the cases the unitary household model underestimates the results. More precisely, the elasticities of the unitary household model are as much as 2 times more than that of the group-decision model in 20% of cases. This is a direct consequence of model misspecification that misleads both long- and short-term policies where the intra-household bargaining and interaction is overlooked in travel behavior models.

Yet the large literature on the mental health problems of returning soldiers relies primarily on self-reported measures that may suffer from non-response bias, usually refers to older conflicts, and focuses mainly on specific diagnoses such as PTSD. Another challenge is that the differences between soldiers and non-soldiers are not necessarily causal, instead possibly reflecting an underlying propensity towards active military service. Using the objective measures of hospitalizations and the purchase of mental health medication, this paper is the first to investigate the effect of recent military deployments on a broader measure of mental health, for a full population of Danish soldiers and a comparison group of eligible men. We exploit a panel of Danish health administrative records and use propensity score matching process, using unique observables such as ability tests. Matching is helpful in both reducing the selection bias from observables and determining pre-and post-deployment period for the comparison group. Then, we estimate the effect of deployment in a difference-in-differences setting, controlling for time trends and other omitted variables affecting both groups. Overall, we find a significant and long-lasting adverse effect of military deployment on soldiers' mental health, regardless of the comparison groups and underlying assumptions.

With this in mind, all of them have designed actions to increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. A favorite for the companies is eco-driving because it can improve the fleet performance without a great investment. However, although these programs have achieved promising results in the majority of the experiences, the figures are not so encouraging in the long term. In many cases this decrease is produced by fuzzy reward programs or the total lack of them. Nevertheless, any coherent reward program, in order to be effective, must be associated with a complete and fair evaluation process which takes into account all the different aspects and complexities related with driving. In this paper, we propose a formal characterization of an efficient driving evaluation process which starts with a review of many different driving recommendation systems. These recommendations are used as seeds to build a set of formal competences that any eco driver must have, as well as the learning outcomes associated with each competence. A set of patterns of driving behaviors are defined, that allow confirming any of the learning outcomes. The definition also comprises a set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each learning outcome. These KPIs allow measuring the progress associated with each competence. Finally, we also propose some relevant differences that must be taken into account for the goals associated with each KPI, depending on the domain of application: type and road geometry, vehicle type (automatic or manual, passengers, cargo or not, public or private), amount of traffic, weather. Some examples of this driver characterization have been included to demonstrate the process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using national Swedish socioeconomic register data 1991-2010 for 2485 individuals born 1972-1978 with onset of T1DM in 1977-1993, we find that T1DM in childhood has a negative effect on labor market outcomes later in life. Part of the T1DM effect is channeled through occupational field which may be related to both choice and opportunities. Although the magnitude of the effect is only directly generalizable to illnesses with similar attributes as T1DM, the results suggest that causality in the often observed correlation between health and socioeconomic status, at least partly, is explained by an effect running from health to earnings. This has implications for research and policy on strategies to reduce socioeconomic-related health inequality. Our findings also shed light on productivity losses, measured by employment status and earnings due to childhood onset T1DM, which have implications for both the individual and society.

We find that those who participated were more knowledgeable about and more likely to vote in the upcoming European Parliament election.

Specifically, we model nonperforming loans as an undesirable output in the bank's production process. Since the stochastic DTDF describing banking technology is likely to suffer from the endogeneity of inputs, we propose addressing this problem by considering a system consisting of the DTDF and the first-order conditions from the bank's cost minimization problem. The first-order conditions also allow us to identify the cost-optimal' directional vector for the banking DTDF, thus eliminating the uncertainty associated with an ad hoc choice of the direction. We apply our cost system approach to the data on large US commercial banks for the 2001-2010 period, which we estimate via Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods subject to theoretical regularity conditions. We document dramatic distortions in banks' efficiency, productivity growth and scale elasticity estimates when the endogeneity of inputs is assumed away and/or the DTDF is fitted in an arbitrary direction.

However, how much each state needs to save in its RDF has become an increasingly important yet unresolved policy question. To address this issue, this paper develops some potential target RDF levels for each U.S. state, based on both the estimated short-term revenue component associated with business cycles and the extent of states' preferences for stable tax rates and expenditure. The analysis shows that, in the last 25 years, at least 21 states never saved enough in their RDFs to offset revenue shortfalls from trend for each downturn period.

Selective enrollment rose by 20% following implementation of the mandates, reflecting substitution away from noncompetitive schools.

The authors analyse the model using game theory. They derive the profit-maximizing prices as a function of the differentiation between the hotel rooms and the relative proportion of each type of hotel room. They also measure the occupancy rate of each type of room and the total profit made by the hotel in response to the optimal prices.

This finding seems to challenge expectations fostered by comparative sociological research that job quality and care services are inferior in Australia compared to Sweden. Informed by comparative institutionalist theory and care research, the structures and dynamics of the care systems in the two countries are analysed, along with findings from the NORDCARE survey of home care workers conducted in Sweden in 2005 (n=166) and Australia in 2010 (n=318). Differences in the work and working conditions in the two countries are explained by the dynamic interaction of national institutional and highly gendered sector-level effects.","[Meagher, Gabrielle] Macquarie Univ, Sociol, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia; [Meagher, Gabrielle] Stockholm Univ, Dept Social Work, Stockholm, Sweden; [Szebehely, Marta] Stockholm Univ, Social Work, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mears, Jane] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",Macquarie University; Stockholm University; Stockholm University; Western Sydney University,"Meagher, G (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Sociol, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",gabrielle.meagher@mq.edu.au,,"Meagher, Gabrielle/0000-0003-2513-5828; Mears, Jane/0000-0002-3923-9727","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare [2003-0462, 2013-2296]; New South Wales Department of Disability Ageing and Home Care","Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)); New South Wales Department of Disability Ageing and Home Care","The research reported in this article was supported by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (grant nos. 2003-0462 and 2013-2296) and by the New South Wales Department of Disability Ageing and Home Care (2009).",,51,38,39,0,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Results show that respondents across the 27 European Union Member States (EU27) prefer some Closed Circuit Television Cameras (CCTV) surveillance across in all countries, except Sweden where the most advanced type of CCTV with face recognition capabilities is preferred. Most respondents prefer that CCTV data is stored for future use rather than just being used for real-time monitoring, with the exception of respondents in Greece. However, an intermediate period of storage (15 days) is preferred over a shorter or longer duration (45 days). Respondents across the EU27 are averse to police force outside their home country having access to CCTV data. Respondents prefer the presence of unarmed security personnel over absence of security personnel. The majority of respondents are averse to any kind of security checks. However, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and the UK there is a preference for randomly selected people to go through a metal detector or full body scanner. Further this study shows that preferences also vary by age and gender. Overall, analysis of the data illustrates the complexity of the privacy over security debate as it pertains to transportation infrastructures. In particular, the increased use of transportation user data for various reasons (efficiency, safety and security) can pose complex social and ethical challenges to users, especially around perceptions of consent, accountability and transparency.

Our panel data covers connection traffic from 1997 to 2013 for Heathrow and 1997 to 2011 for Frankfurt. The single-spill results support strongly that the connection spills from Heathrow's capacity limitations do strengthen competing hub airports of major alliance groups and to a lesser degree one Gulf hub. The double-spill model for Heathrow and Frankfurt shows nearly asymmetric overall spill characteristics between the two airports. Our results underline the influence of airline network strategies on congestion spills as European airline networks are shaped by alliances and umbrella mergers. Thus, the airline network perspective in airport capacity expansion decisions needs to play a greater role, as indicated by our asymmetric results for overall spill effects between Heathrow and Frankfurt airports.

The association between these two phenomena has proven elusive in the early empirical literature on the subject. Indeed, the consensus among labour economists seems to be that trade has not been the main cause of such increase in the skill-premium. This view has been challenged by Feenstra and Hanson (1999, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 114, 3, 907) who find that offshoring sizably affects the skill-premium. I revisit this debate using individual workers' data from the March Current Population Survey combined with industry-level trade data. This strategy improves upon the work of Feenstra and Hanson who do not control for the demographic characteristics of the labour force. In my results, offshoring can explain between 9 and 30 per cent of the increase in the college wage premium, relative to high-school workers. In addition, I find that offshoring can explain 21 per cent of the increase in the relative employment of skilled labour. These results suggest that offshoring may play an important role in the increase in the relative demand of skilled workers.","[Tempesti, Tommaso] Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Econ, Lowell, MA 01852 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Lowell,"Tempesti, T (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts Lowell, Dept Econ, Lowell, MA 01852 USA.",,,,,,,,40,3,6,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2016,39.0,10.0,,,,,1628,1652,,10.1111/twec.12298,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DZ2LJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385673000007,0

Home and foreign institutions influence both inflows and outflows, thus determining the net flows of college graduate migrants. Therefore, institutions can affect human capital through migration flows. Our empirical strategy is based on a random utility model from which we derive the net balance of migrants and an exclusion restriction to control for the selection of migrants. We test the predictions of the model using comprehensive matrices of migration by education level and a synthetic indicator of governance quality. We account for endogeneity concerns by means of an instrumental strategy and we disentangle the effect of the quality of domestic and foreign institutions on both inflows and outflows.

Net wealth may correlate with worker's characteristics that also determine the exit out of a job. It is therefore important to include a rich set of observed characteristics in an empirical model for retirement in order to measure the (marginal) effect of wealth on the job exit rate. But even with a rich set of regressors, the question remains whether there are time-invariant unobservable worker's characteristics that affect both net wealth and the job exit rate. We specify a simultaneous equations model for job exit transitions with multiple destinations, net wealth, and the initial labour market state. The job exit rates and the net wealth equation contain random effects. We allow for correlation between the random effects of job exit and net wealth, and the initial labour market state. As instruments for wealth, we use survey information that measures 'shocks', like shocks to the household's financial situation during the previous year. Results show an upward bias in the effect of net liquid wealth on retirement, but a small bias and a positive causal effect if net total wealth (including housing equity and mortgage debt) is used. Both measures of wealth show a significant positive effect on retirement. For an average individual with age 58, an increase in net liquid wealth by 64,000 euros, or in net total wealth by 110,000 euros, raises the exit rate into retirement by 1 % point.","[Bloemen, Hans G.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.] Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Bloemen, Hans G.] IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Bloemen, Hans G.] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Tilburg University,"Bloemen, HG (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Bloemen, HG (通讯作者)，Tinbergen Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.;Bloemen, HG (通讯作者)，IZA Bonn, Bonn, Germany.;Bloemen, HG (通讯作者)，Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands.",h.g.bloemen@vu.nl,,"Bloemen, Hans Gerald/0000-0003-4728-8980",,,,,20,1,1,0,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We investigate the heterogeneity cif the agglomeration effect and sorting with respect to education. The magnitude of static and dynamic agglomeration effects on wages in Norway is estimated for different educational categories. Using rich administrative data for the period 2003-2010 with experience data back to 1993, we find that college-educated workers have higher return to labor market experience accumulated in cities. The city wage premium of less educated workers is increasing in job tenure, while the college educated gain more from shifting jobs between firms. We address sorting by comparing distributions of worker fixed effects by level of education. The distribution of unobserved abilities is similar in cities and the rest of the country for workers with only primary and secondary education, while the distribution for workers with college education is shifted to the right in cities. Sorting with respect to unobserved abilities matters for college-educated workers, even when taking dynamic learning effects into account. Distinguishing between young and old workers, we find that differences in unobserved abilities are more important early in a worker's career. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the short-run impacts of rapid employment growth on travel time to work. We exploit exogenous variation in employment levels resulting from movements of military troops during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) in order to identify the effect of employment growth on travel time using difference-in-difference-in-differences and instrumental variable methods. Our results show that for each additional 10 workers added per square kilometer, travel time increases by 0.171 to 0.244 min per one-way commute trip per commuter in the short run, which equates to $0.07 to $0.20 in travel time cost per commuter per day. Our estimates imply that the annualized short-run congestion costs of the 2005 BRAC were $79 to $761 million per year (in constant 2005 dollars) for military commuters and $3.15 to $6.3 billion per year (in constant 2005 dollars) for civilian commuters in BRAC-affected areas.

We extract our measures of artist talent and fame from a set of observable artist-specific variables by means of a factor analysis and estimate the elasticities of income with respect to talent and fame. Consistent with Rosen's and Adler's hypotheses, our results suggest a convex relationship between income and talent and a linear relationship between income and fame. Using SUR models to evaluate the effects of artist talent and fame on the average trade prices and number of sales, we find that the number of artwork sales is the main 'channel' through which talent and fame influence income. Copula models provide additional insights on the nature of the conditional dependence relationship between average prices and number of sales. Poolability tests suggest a single model of artist income applies to all artists in our dataset whether their works are generally traded in auction houses or galleries, so it is not necessary to specify different models. Finally, quantile regressions reveal that artists in low-income quantiles are not superstars, Rosen's hypothesis holds only above the median income, and fame plays no role for low-income quantiles.","[Candela, Guido; Castellani, Massimiliano] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Bologna, Italy; [Castellani, Massimiliano; Pattitoni, Pierpaolo] RCEA, Rimini, Italy; [Pattitoni, Pierpaolo] Univ Bologna, Dept Management, Bologna, Italy; [Di Lascio, F.

The NEPS study has been set up to build a profound empirical basis for the description and analysis of educational processes and competence development across the life span. Its large-scale database consists of longitudinal information from more than 60,000 target respondents - distributed over six different starting cohorts ranging from new-borns to adults - and from relevant context persons such as parents or teachers. The complex multicohort sequence design schedules annual or even semiannual survey waves including a broad spectrum of competence assessments. All data are thoroughly prepared, documented, and disseminated free of charge in the form of regularly expanded Scientific Use Files. In addition to some background information about NEPS in general, this paper primarily focuses on issues of data collection, data structure, data availability, and the requirements for different types of data access. The number of more than 1,000 data users involved in over 700 research projects so far serves to highlight the potential of NEPS as a unique research data infrastructure for educational research and beyond.","[Fuss, Daniel] LIfBi Leibniz Inst Educ Trajectories, Res Data Ctr FDZ, Wilhelmspl 3, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany; [von Maurice, Jutta; Rossbach, Hans-Guenther] LIfBi Leibniz Inst Educ Trajectories, Wilhelmspl 3, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Bildungsverlaufe (Lifbi); Leibniz Institut fur Bildungsverlaufe (Lifbi),"Fuss, D (通讯作者)，LIfBi Leibniz Inst Educ Trajectories, Res Data Ctr FDZ, Wilhelmspl 3, D-96047 Bamberg, Germany.",daniel.fuss@lifbi.de,,,,,,,2,4,4,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Economic historians have estimated historical inflation expectations for a variety of purposes, including studies of the Fisher effect, the debt deflation hypothesis, central bank credibility, and expectations formation. I survey the statistical, narrative, and market-based approaches that have been used to estimate inflation expectations in historical eras, including the classical gold standard era, the hyperinflations of the 1920s, and the Great Depression, highlighting key methodological considerations and identifying areas that warrant further research. A meta-analysis of inflation expectations at the onset of the Great Depression reveals that the deflation of the early 1930s was mostly unanticipated, supporting the debt deflation hypothesis, and shows how these results are sensitive to estimation methodology.

Investigation using birth spacing with prior births and height difference within twins suggests that the increase in the birth of twins is partly due to parents reporting regularly spaced children as twins to avoid the policy violation punishment.

This study starts addressing this gap by providing empirical evidence about the nature and the magnitude of the value of accessibility as reflected by residential rents in Rajshahi City, Bangladesh. Results of our SARAR spatial hedonic model estimated on 526 observations from a random sample collected via in-person interviews indicate that the rent of a multi-unit dwelling decreases by 0.0239% for every 1% increase in network access distance to the nearest major road. Moreover, proximity (within 400 m) to a primary school and to a healthcare facility commands rent premiums of respectively 93.55 BDT ($1.40) and 109.45 BDT ($1.64). Surprisingly, whether access roads are paved or not does not statistically impact rents, probably because of the dominance of walking, rickshaws use, and biking, combined with the rarity of personal cars. Likewise, proximity to bus stops and to train stations is not reflected in rents of multi-family dwellings, likely because buses and trains in Rajshahi City only provide regional and national service. Differences in estimates of our spatial models between maximum likelihood (ML) and generalized spatial two-stage-least-squares illustrate the danger of relying on ML in the presence of heteroskedasticity. These results should be useful for planning transportation infrastructure funding measures in least developed country cities like Rajshahi City. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

NPE has shaped Africa-EU relations considerably, especially since the founding of the AU ( African Union). Yet while the EU aspires to be a post-imperial, normative power, this postcolonial critique suggests NPE is a neo-Kantian, Eurocentric discourse that reinvigorates an outdated European moral paternalism. The article explores the role of NPE in Africa-EU relations through a Foucauldian conceptualization of knowledge in EU foreign policy, and insists particularly on how pan-African regionalization and NPE led to unwarranted optimism about deploying European norms in Africa. To the contrary, a decolonial perspective reveals that AU-EU inter-regional structural and organizational convergence enchains only frail normative convergence, which will diminish as the pan-African project unfolds further.","[Staeger, Ueli] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland",,"Staeger, U (通讯作者)，Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Geneva, Switzerland.",ueli.staeger@graduateinstitute.ch,,,,,,,62,36,41,2,36,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Based on Obstfeld and Rogoff, I develop a four-region model of the world economy consisting of the Eurozone-core, Eurozone-periphery, United States and Asia. In contrast to most of the existing literature, this model structure enables studying the impact of global current account adjustment on the rebalancing process in the Eurozone. In addition, the model allows for movements of factors of production between tradable and non-tradable sectors. The results point to the important impact of sectoral reallocation and increases in Asian demand on the size of the internal devaluation as well as on the implied length of the adjustment period.","[Zwick, Christoph] Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria",University of Graz,"Zwick, C (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Dept Econ, Graz, Austria.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2016,39.0,7.0,,,,,1025,1045,,10.1111/twec.12309,0.0,,,21,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DR5OU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379953100006,0

Bayesian model selection procedures suggest that the two inflation measures had distinct structural changes in different parameters as well as at different dates. CPI inflation experienced a dramatic drop in persistence around the early 1980s, but GDP deflator inflation remains persistent throughout the postwar sample period. The residual variance for both inflation measures switched from a low volatility regime to a high volatility regime in the early 1970s, but returned to another low volatility regime at different dates: the early 1980s for GDP deflator inflation and the early 1990s for CPI inflation. The residual variance for CPI inflation has increased again since the early 2000s, while GDP deflator inflation has remained less volatile. I do not find evidence of a structural shift in the unconditional mean of either measure of inflation. When reviewing the recent literature, considerable controversy exists over the structural break in inflation persistence around the early 1980s but this appears to be dependent on the measures of inflation, as highlighted by the empirical findings in this paper.","[Eo, Yunjong] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Eo, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",yunjong.eo@sydney.edu.au,"Eo, Yunjong/J-4319-2012","Eo, Yunjong/0000-0002-9172-2265",,,,,34,9,9,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1081-1826,1558-3708,,STUD NONLINEAR DYN E,Stud.

We find that although the effect on volatility of negative return shocks is higher than for positive ones, the latter are more persistent and relatively quickly dominate negative ones.","[Lonnbark, Carl] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Lönnbark, C (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Dept Econ, S-90187 Umea, Sweden.",carl.lonnbark@econ.umu.se,,,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation,The financial support from the Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.,,29,1,2,0,10,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The results indicate that higher persistence and slower convergence of price levels are evident during the low-inflation period, which corresponds to the inflation-targeting (IT) regime. During the low-inflation IT regime, inflation convergence across regions appears to occur more quickly and may be responsible for the slower pace of convergence in price levels. Overall, IT in Turkey, which was successful in lowering and maintaining inflation at acceptable levels, also appears to be associated with faster convergence in inflation rates at the expense of slower convergence in price levels.","[Yazgan, M.

However, in the case of Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), investment grade REITs tend to include a covenant package that outlines limits on leverage and requires maintaining certain fixed charges and interest coverage ratios. This unique debt financing structure of REITs offers a natural environment to examine the importance and the need of debt covenants in the investment grade bond market. Our research aims to answer the following questions: 1. How common are debt covenants in the investment grade REIT bond market? 2. Are debt covenants binding in this market? 3. Do debt covenants affect the cost of debt? Our findings indicate that, in the REIT market, debt covenants are indeed common practice among investment grade REITs and, surprisingly, we find higher use of covenants by investment grade REITs compared to non-investment grade REITs. We show that debt covenants are seldom binding in this market, as investment grade REITs choose covenant provisions based on accounting ratios for which they seem to have enough slack. Finally, the cost of debt is lower when these investment grade REIT bonds are issued with covenants.","[Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore; [Devos, Erik] Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA; [Rahman, Shofiqur] New Mexico State Univ, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Tsang, Desmond] McGill Univ, 1001 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montreal, PQ H3A 1G5, Canada",National University of Singapore; University of Texas System; University of Texas El Paso; New Mexico State University; McGill University,"Devos, E (通讯作者)，Univ Texas El Paso, El Paso, TX 79968 USA.",ydeng@nus.edu.sg; hdevos@utep.edu; shofi@nmsu.edu; desmond.tsang@mcgill.ca,"Tsang, Desmond/O-6079-2017; Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010; devos, erik/Q-9341-2019","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171;",,,,,31,4,5,3,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Our analysis points out that under union-wide policies, regions which suffer relatively more from shocks will benefit from policy interventions at the expense of others. Using the new-Keynesian framework we propose a new area-wide welfare-theoretic loss function which is heterogeneity-consistent, i.e. it guarantees the same outcomes as if a policy maker was targeting each of the regions individually. We study the dynamics of the theoretically-induced losses resulting from the area-wide policies using the example of the euro zone in the years 1999-2013 and compare it with the level of money market integration. Our study suggests that more intense financial integration was associated with smaller long-run average losses from heterogeneity-inconsistent aggregate policies. We find no similar effects for short-run dynamics.","[Wolski, Marcin] European Investment Bank, 98-100 Blvd Konrad Adenauer, L-2950 Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Wolski, M (通讯作者)，European Investment Bank, 98-100 Blvd Konrad Adenauer, L-2950 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",m.wolski@eib.org,,,,,,,45,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In this article, we estimate the impact of middle school transition on the body mass index (BMI) of public schoolchildren in Arkansas, United States. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that middle school transition in grade 6 led to a moderate decrease of 0.04 standard deviations in BMI z-scores for all students. Analysis by subsample indicated that this result was driven by boys (0.06-0.07 standard deviations) and especially by non-minority boys (0.09 standard deviations). We speculate that the changing levels of physical activities associated with middle school transition provide the most reasonable explanation for this result. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because of short daily driving distances, high mileage, and intermediate waiting time, fossil-fuelled taxi vehicles are ideal candidates for being replaced by battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Moreover, taxi BEVs would increase visibility of electric mobility and therefore encourage others to purchase an electric vehicle. Prior to replacing conventional taxis with BEVs, a suitable charging infrastructure has to be established. This infrastructure consists of a sufficiently dense network of charging stations taking into account the lower driving ranges of BEVs. In this case study we propose a decision support system for placing charging stations in order to satisfy the charging demand of electric taxi vehicles. Operational taxi data from about 800 vehicles is used to identify and estimate the charging demand for electric taxis based on frequent origins and destinations of trips. Next, a variant of the maximal covering location problem is formulated and solved to satisfy as much charging demand as possible with a limited number of charging stations. Already existing fast charging locations are considered in the optimization problem. In this work, we focus on finding regions in which charging stations should be placed rather than exact locations. The exact location within an area is identified in a post-optimization phase (e.g., by authorities), where environmental conditions are considered, e.g., the capacity of the power network, availability of space, and legal issues. Our approach is implemented in the city of Vienna, Austria, in the course of an applied research project that has been conducted in 2014.

In a nutshell, the manager of a firm must balance the retention of earnings (so as to ward off bankruptcy and earn interest) and the distribution of dividends (so as to please the shareholders). A dynamic-programming approach is used, where the state variables are the current levels of cash reserves and of the stochastic short-rate, as well as time. This results in a family of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequalities whose solutions must be approximated numerically.

In a direct democracy, individuals have the opportunity to vote over the alternatives in every choice problem the population faces. In a representative democracy, the population commits to a candidate ex ante who will then make choices on its behalf. While direct democracy is normatively appealing, representative democracy is the far more common institution because of its practical advantages. The key question, then, is whether representative democracy succeeds in implementing the choices that the group would make under direct democracy. We find that, in general, it does not. We model a population as a distribution of voters with strict preferences over a finite set of alternatives and a candidate as a strict ordering of those alternatives that serves as a binding, contingent plan of action. We focus on the case where the direct democracy choices of the population are consistent with a strict ordering of the alternatives. We show that even in this case, where the normative recommendation of direct democracy is clearest, representative democracy may not elect the candidate with this ordering.","[Coffman, Katherine Baldiga] Ohio State Univ, 1945 N High St,Arps Hall 427, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Coffman, KB (通讯作者)，Ohio State Univ, 1945 N High St,Arps Hall 427, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",coffman.201@osu.edu,,,,,,,33,3,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,MAR,2016,46.0,3.0,,,,,477,494,,10.1007/s00355-015-0922-3,0.0,,,18,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020900001,0

In order to develop this topic, the present research is developed through the analysis of a dataset collected from residents of 22 neighborhoods with variety of land use features. Using household survey on daily activities, this study investigates home-based work and non-work (HBW and HBN) trips. Structural equation models are utilized to examine the relationships between land use attributes and travel behavior while taking into account socio-economic characteristics as the residential self-selection. Results from models indicate that individuals residing in areas with high residential and job density, and shorter distance to sub-centers are more interested in using transit and non-motorized modes. Moreover, residents of neighborhoods with mixed land uses tend to travel less by car and more by transit and non-motorized modes to non-work destinations. Nevertheless, the influences of design measurements such as street density and internal connectivity are mixed in our models. Although higher internal connectivity leads to more transit and non-motorized trips in HBW model, the impacts of design measurements on individuals travel behavior in HBN model are significantly in contrast with research hypothesis. Our study also shows the importance of individuals' self-selection impacts on travel behaviors; individuals with special socio-demographic attributes live in the neighborhoods with regard to their transportation patterns. The findings of this paper reveal that the effects of built environment attributes on travel behavior in origins of trips do not exactly correspond with the expected predictions, when it comes in practice in a various study context. This study displays the necessity of regarding local conditions of urban areas and the inherent differences between travel destinations in integrating land use and transportation planning.

Laboratory experiments are conducted to examine how agents relocate in response to both community provision and membership composition, as well as how the growth and stability of communities are dictated by moving costs and crowding. When the public good is congestible, such that returns are lower for larger populations, I find communities are characterized by instability, cyclical fluctuations in local provision, and a dynamic in which low demanders continually chase high demanders through locations. When congestion is eliminated, subjects with different returns do sometimes co-exist. Yet chronic, inefficient movement persists, suggesting that instability is driven by intrinsic preferences for community composition, as well as by sensitivity to congestion.","[Robbett, Andrea] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Robbett, A (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",arobbett@middlebury.edu,,,Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science; Middlebury College,Caltech Laboratory for Experimental Economics and Political Science; Middlebury College,"I wish to thank Charles Plott, Leeat Yariv, Peter Matthews, Rod Kiewiet, John Ledyard, and Jean-Laurent Rosenthal, as well as two anonymous referees and the editor for their helpful comments, Meghan McKeown for lab assistance, and the Caltech Social Science Experimental Laboratory and the Harvard Decision Science Laboratory for their hospitality.

Even more important is the monitoring of the levels of service quality over time, which can be very useful to determine if the goals established by the transport planners are being met or exceeded. The status and evolution of transit service quality can be monitored through periodic and regular updating of the opinions expressed by the passengers about the service during the well-known Customer Satisfaction Surveys, allowing the effect of policies to be evaluated and specific interventions to be introduced. In this work, just the issue of monitoring service quality based on users' opinions is approached, and the index numbers usually applied in the economic and industrial field are proposed for this purpose. Index numbers permit to study the fluctuations or variations of a variable or more variables over time, providing a powerful measurement for making comparisons and predictions of the analyzed concept. The index numbers were calculated on the basis of data collected from Customer Satisfaction Surveys addressed to the passengers of the metropolitan public service of Granada (Spain). The analyzed time period has been established from 2007 to 2013. Interesting results derive from the calculation of the index numbers. Since both perceptions and importance rates are considered in this methodology, the results can inform, not only on the satisfaction tendencies but also on the trend on customers' priorities, which is actually the expected quality. Therefore, policies could more efficiently be designed to adjust the service to the users' real needs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The findings suggest that the differences among countries are related to different labour market structures: adult education has a clearer beneficial impact on accessing and remaining in non-precarious employment in more flexible employment systems than in more rigid insider-outsider economies, where labour trajectories are strongly determined by what happens during the first years after school.","[de Vilhena, Daniela Vono] Populat Europe Secretariat, Max Planck Inst Demog Research, Dresden, Germany; [Kosyakova, Yuliya; McMullin, Patricia] European Univ Inst, Dept Polit & Social Sci, Fiesole, Italy; [Kilpi-Jakonen, Elina] Univ Turku, Dept Social Res, SF-20500 Turku, Finland",Max Planck Society; European University Institute; University of Turku,"de Vilhena, DV (通讯作者)，Populat Europe Secretariat, Markgrafenstr 37, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",vono@demogr.mpg.de,"Kosyakova, Yuliya/J-6873-2019","Kosyakova, Yuliya/0000-0002-9621-1755; McMullin, Patricia/0000-0001-6055-3510; Kilpi-Jakonen, Elina/0000-0003-0526-0170","European Research Council (ERC) [SH2, 269568]; European Research Council (ERC) [269568] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This research was funded by an Advanced Grant of the European Research Council (ERC) granted to Hans-Peter Blossfeld (ERC-2010-AdG, SH2, Project-ID 269568).",,46,14,15,3,22,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To analyze price and rent premiums for green buildings, several studies have used propensity scores to ensure samples that contains eco-labeled and un-labeled buildings reflect a randomized assignment of the treatment. Underpinning the argument for the use of propensity scores is the notion that green buildings contain similar attributes to non-green buildings. However, if the green labels were ignored, would premium buildings be otherwise statistically similar to premium buildings in the market?

The results indicate a clear growth in economic inequality in the two centuries prior to the industrial revolution and the onset of sustained economic growth per capita. The results presented lend support to the classical explanation of inequality as the consequence of a changing functional distribution of income favoring capital over labor over the course of the early modern period.

These score and text review are written by people who bought certain products or services (especially hotel industry) and want to evaluate their purchases. Most of the works that try to evaluate customers' sentiment from these evaluations deal with textual analysis of the reviews. In this work, we will consider this review as a collection of sentences, each with its own orientation and with sentiment score. Certain score aggregation method is needed to combine sentence-level scores into an overall review rating. On the basis of the analysis of existing methods, we propose a new method that aggregate score on the base of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. In the proposed method, we first determine the polarity of reviews with the use of machine learning and then consider a sentence scores as evidence for an overall assessment review. Results from online data files show the usefulness of our method in comparison with existing methods.","[Beranek, Ladislav] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Informat, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Beranek, L (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Informat, Studentska 13, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",beranek@ef.jcu.cz,"Beranek, Ladislav/D-6273-2016","Beranek, Ladislav/0000-0001-5004-0164",,,,,23,1,1,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,43,48,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500008,0

In the following paper this assumption will be relaxed by considering procedure specific factors (its derogations and changes) while fitting statistical distributions to legal merger duration data. In the statistical area of survival analysis this can be achieved with the use of accelerated failure time model in which explanatory variables have a direct impact on the scale parameter of the considered distribution (via exponential link function).

However, because electricity markets remain integrated at a shallow level (with different pricing regulations), many gains from deeper integration (adoption of marginal cost pricing everywhere) are yet to be realized. This paper assesses the benefits of deep integration between a hydro jurisdiction and a thermal one. It also underscores the inefficiency of trade when pricing rules differ. Our detailed hourly model, calibrated with real data from the provinces of Ontario and Quebec, Canada, estimates price, consumption, emissions and welfare changes associated with fully integrating electricity markets, under transmission constraints. A negative abatement cost of $37/tonne of CO2, was found (for more than 1 million tonnes), clearly illustrating the untapped potential of wealth creation in carbon reduction initiatives. Furthermore, given the inefficiency of shallow integration between markets, we found that removing interconnections between markets offers a relatively affordable CO2-reduction opportunity, at $21.5/tonne.","[de Villemeur, Etienne Billette] Univ Lille, LEM, CNRS, UMR 9221, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Pineau, Pierre-Olivier] HEC Montreal, Chair Energy Sect Management, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Universite de Lille; Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal,"Pineau, PO (通讯作者)，HEC Montreal, Chair Energy Sect Management, 3000 Cote St Catherine Rd, Montreal, PQ H3T 2A7, Canada.",Etienne.de-Villemeur@univ-lille1.fr; pierre-olivier.pineau@hec.ca,"de VILLEMEUR, Etienne BILLETTE/AAE-1545-2020","de VILLEMEUR, Etienne BILLETTE/0000-0002-8821-0947",HEC Montreal Chair in Energy Sector Management,HEC Montreal Chair in Energy Sector Management,We thank the three anonymous referees for their constructive comments.

Here the policymaking process surrounding the turn to the East is examined. The focus is on the economic dimension - the economic development of the Russian Far East and engagement with the Asia-Pacific region - rather than geostrategic and security issues. Policymaking is evaluated in terms of general approach and process, with the implications of the evaluation for Russian policymaking more generally then being explored. Turn to the East policymaking exhibits a strong commitment to strategic planning that is characteristic of Putin, and which in this case struggles not only with process issues but also with contradictions within the strategy and the challenging realities of the region. Regarding process, a far more institutionalized policy process than the currently dominant personalist view would lead us to expect is found, with relevant bureaucratic and non-state actors well represented in an elaborate and relatively formal process. However a considerable weakening of sign-off procedures is noted, which has lead to policy inconsistency and indeed policy irresponsibility among participants. The author attributes the weakening of sign-off procedures to Putin's frustration with the gridlock tendencies of strict sign-off regimes, rather than a desire to create a personalist regime of hands-on management. This suggests that improvement of the Russian policy process requires structural and procedural change, rather than simply leadership change.","[Fortescue, Stephen] Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Fortescue, Stephen] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr European Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; Australian National University,"Fortescue, S (通讯作者)，Univ New South Wales, Sch Social Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.;Fortescue, S (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Ctr European Studies, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",s.fortescue@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,73,31,33,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

The first panel data models were built for microeconomic applying large number of cross-section units and short time series. With random sampling being an essential prerequisite for microeconomic panel data, the observations are independent. In macroeconomic data, we face a problem with non-random sampling and thus the possibility of dependent variables. This problem can be solved with the factor and spatial models. In this paper, we focus on the factor models and answer to the question how energy supply influences GDP in the long term period. To test stationarity, co-integration and Granger causality of GDP, energy supply and capital formation, we follow methodologies by Pesaran and Ederhardt. It was found out that energy and capital have positive long-term effect on GDP and vice versa the GDP and capital have positive long-term effect on energy consumption.","[Fryd, Lukas] Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fryd, L (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Dept Econometr, Winston Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067, Czech Republic.",xfryl00@vse.cz,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,0,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,225,230,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500039,0

Opposite to EOQ models, the generalized models assume both demand rate and holding cost rate to be time-dependent along inventory cycle being normalized to unit length. The demand rate takes polynomial form, which is specified by particular interpolation conditions. Having particular model, we concern with feasible domain detection of interpolation parameters, which are used for construction of inventory level taking polynomial form of specified algebraic degree. Assuming instantaneous replenishment at the beginning of inventory cycle exclusively, the necessary condition of inventory level feasibility is expressed by condition that inventory level is non-increasing on inventory cycle globally. For various generalized inventory models, we investigate the feasibility domains of their interpolation parameters numerically using Mathematica. The results and some code snippets are presented and discussed in detail.","[Hofman, Jiri; Lukas, Ladislav] Univ West Bohemia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Fac Econ, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Hofman, J (通讯作者)，Univ West Bohemia, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Fac Econ, Husova 11, Plzen 30614, Czech Republic.",hofman@kem.zcu.cz; lukasl@kem.zcu.cz,"Lukas, Ladislav/B-5818-2016",,,,,,8,0,0,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,271,276,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500047,0

In this paper, the author will question whether the problem of impartiality of arbitrators can be resolved by purely prescribing the duty of arbitrators to be impartial. Taking into account that impartiality is a subjective concept, a kind of the mental state of an arbitrator towards the parties and the dispute, in most of the cases it will be extremely difficult to establish a personal bias, particularly when it is not possible to determine one arbitrator's link with the parties, their lawyers, other arbitrators or with the subject matter of the dispute. On the other hand, being a party to the proceeding the outcome of which may be shaped according to one party's preferences rather than according to the law results with innumerable negative repercussions that may easily undermine all arguments in favor of arbitration over resorting to a court in the traditional sense. The existence of numerous international and domestic principles on impartiality of arbitrators is important, however not sufficient for coming close to reaching the ideal. The mere fact that the parties appoint their own arbitrators, often those for whom parties believe that they will deeply understand the nature of the party's specific position will often, from the point of view of interested public, lead to conclusion that the parties' appointed arbitrators are partisan. That is why, if we take for granted that the quality of one arbitration is directly linked to the quality of arbitrators themselves, we may assert that professionalism and ethical obligations of arbitrators to maintain their integrity and fairness of the process present the most effective means of securing the quality of one arbitration.","[Jelinic, Zvonimir] JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Jelinic, Z (通讯作者)，JJ Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia.",zjelinic@pravos.hr,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,108,116,,,,,,9,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400011,0

Crossbred Boer goat aged approximately 8 months old and weighed approximately 25 kg were used in the study. Sixteen skin sheets prepared by cutting raw skin into a size of 21x29.7 cm(2) were divided into 2 treatments, 8 sheets each. The first group was tanned using coffee pomace formula and the second group was tanned using Gros Michel banana bunch formula. The raw skin weights of the first group and second group before tanning were 198.25 +/- 8.66 g and 197.72 +/- 7.64 g, respectively. Tanned fur skin were then compared for physical characteristics, including skin color, total hair density, percentage of coarse hair, percentage of fine hair, and skin thickness, both before and after tanning process and between the tanning formulas. The results showed that the color of goat skin before tanning with Gros Michel banana bunch and coffee pomace formula was not significantly different (P > 0.05). While after tanning with coffee pomace, the skin was darker than those tanned with Gros Michel banana bunch, although hair color of both groups were not altered (P > 0.05). The thickness of the tanned skin using Gros Michel banana bunch and coffee pomace formula was not significantly different (P > 0.05). Fine hair density and coarse hair density of both groups before soaking in Gros Michel banana bunch and coffee pomace formula were not significantly different (P > 0.05). However, after tanning with both formula, it was found that density of fine and coarse hairs of both groups were less than initial hairs (P < 0.05). In conclusion, coffee pomace and Gros Michel banana bunch can be used as agent in tanning process to conserve the goat hair.

The number of children under 14 together with age of the persons in household are factors contributing to an increase of specialization, while income of reference person in the household as well as the number of hours spend by unpaid work of all members of the household decrease the specialization within the household.","[Vallusova, Anna; Povazanova, Mariana; Nedelova, Gabriela] UMB, Ekon Fak, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Matej Bel University,"Vallusová, A (通讯作者)，UMB, Ekon Fak, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",anna.vallusova@umb.sk; mariana.povazanova@umb.sk; gabriela.nedelova@umb.sk,"Považanová, Mariana/HTQ-3172-2023","Považanová, Mariana/0000-0003-1327-904X",,,,,13,1,1,0,4,BELIANUM-VYDAVATESTVO UNIV MATEJA BELA V BANSKEJ BYSTRICI,BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO 51, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 974 00, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-557-1089-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10,Economics; Industrial Relations & Labor; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BM2DC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000460873800014,0

A new estimator is defined that uses cross-sectional dependence for efficiency while being robust to the misspecification of the form of the cross-sectional dependence. We show that using cross-sectional dependence for estimation is important to obtain an estimator that is more efficient than existing estimators. This new estimator also uses nuisance parameters parsimoniously so that it exhibits good small- and large-sample properties even when the number of time periods is large. As an empirical application, we estimate the effect of attending private school on student achievement using a value-added model.

Consequently, a large part of today's export is not fully or originally produced in the exporting country but includes certain share of imported intermediates. Research emphasises the fact that trading countries can face an important concern regarding the part of exports created in the country and their position in global value chains (GVCs). Beside participation in GVCs, the significant importance lies in the amount of the value which is created in export-related industries, since it actually affects domestic employment (job creation) and growth (Banga, 2014). Focusing on EU, share of domestic value added in exports (DVA) is in almost all industries in EU countries from Central and Eastern Europe (NMS-10) lower compared to core EU countries (EU-15). The paper looks at main drivers of the differences in DVA between this two groups of countries and it focuses on determinants of DVA. To decompose each country's exports into domestic and foreign content I use the methodology provided by Koopman et al. (2010) and industry-level data from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). I show that there are many cases where the determinants have different effects on domestic content of export (exposure to foreign investment, capital endowment, intermediates from China etc.). Among the most evident are intangible capital investments in high knowledge intensive sectors, especially investments in economic competencies, suggesting that specific level of investments in intangible capital is required in order to even integrate in GVC.","[Vrh, Natasa] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Vrh, N (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",natasa.vrh@ef.uni-lj.si,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,704,713,,,,,,10,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400073,0

Following the revision of the Swiss railways act in 1996, regional public authorities were given the choice between two different contractual regimes to procure public passenger transport services. We directly compare the impact of competitive tendering and performance-based negotiation by applying a stochastic frontier analysis to the complete dataset of bus lines (n = 630) operated by the main Swiss company (Swiss Post) at the same time (in 2009) throughout the country. The overall results show that the differences in the levels of cost efficiency between the two contractual regimes are not significant. Our findings are in line with recent evidence of cost convergence between competitive tendering and performance-based negotiation, and suggest that the practice of using both contractual regimes is challenging for the operators in terms of competitive pressure. The threat of competitive tendering may have a disciplining effect on negotiation since it prevents bus companies from bargaining inadequate rents and inducing asymmetric information advantages.

The role of consumers and their perception of new food-related regulations should be the main focus for policy makers in order to adapt and respond with the new policy instruments to consumer concerns. This paper aims at analyzing which type of potential label information is of interest to Albanian consumers in food products. We investigate consumer preference for different attributes of food products such as COOL (Made in Albania), pesticide-free, chemical-free, Organic production and Organic Certified Product, using an ordered five-point Likert Scale method. Ordinal regression is applied to investigate socio-economic effects on responses: Results show that consumers link domestic products with more safe products.

Relatively few articles have addressed policy measures designed to increase the adoption of EVs by incentives to influence car buyers' voluntary behavior. This article examines the effects of such policy measures. Two of these attributes are monetary measures, two others are traffic regulations, and the other three are related to investments in charging infrastructure. Consumer preferences were assessed using a choice-based conjoint analysis on an individual basis by applying the hierarchical Bayes method. In addition, the Kano method was used to elicit consumer satisfaction. This not only enabled the identification of preferences but also why preferences were based on either features that were must-haves or on attributes that were not expected but were highly attractive and, thus, led to high satisfaction. The results of surveys conducted in 20 countries in 5 continents showed that the installation of a charging network on freeways is an absolute necessity. This was completely independent from the average mileage driven per day. High cash grants were appreciated as attractive; however, combinations of lower grants with charging facilities resulted in similar preference shares in market simulations for each country. The results may serve as initial guidance for policymakers and practitioners in improving their incentive programs for electric mobility. (C) 2015 The Author.

Aggregate shocks, by contrast, are the root of sectoral inflation persistence, but have negligible relative variance. We show that simple factor models do not cope well with essential features of price data. In particular, sectoral inflation series are subject to features such as measurement error, sales and item substitutions. In factor models, these blow up the variance of sector-specific shocks, while reducing their persistence. We control for such effects by estimating a refined factor model and find that inflation variance is driven by both aggregate and sectoral shocks. Sectoral shocks, too, generate substantial inflation persistence. Both findings contrast with earlier evidence from factor models, but align well with recent micro evidence. Our results have implications for the foundations of price stickiness, and provide quantitative inputs for calibrating models with sectoral heterogeneity.

The results suggest less favorable perceptions about this form of sustainable real estate development in smaller communities and those with weaker economic fundamentals. Furthermore, women employed in economic development are found to have more favorable attitudes toward these buildings than their male counterparts.

Part I: Spatiotemporal studies of real freeway traffic,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Managed lanes; Carpool lanes; Toll lanes; Spatiotemporal analysis,,"Most special-use freeway lanes in the US, whether reserved for carpools, toll-paying commuters or both, are physically separated from the adjacent regular-use lanes by some form of barrier. Vehicle movements in and out of a special lane of this type are permitted only at select access points along the route. The barrier at each select point might open for a distance of 400 m or so. Limiting access in this way is said to reduce the turbulence that might otherwise occur were the special lane not to have a barrier, such that vehicles could instead enter or exit that lane anywhere along its length. Yet, real freeway traffic studied in spatiotemporal fashion shows that access points are prone to become bottlenecks. The problem occurs when traffic in the regular lanes becomes dense, as commonly happens during a rush. Drivers then seek refuge in the special lane in greater numbers. Since the vehicular maneuvers through the access point are focused within a limited physical space, they can become disruptive and further degrade traffic. Degradation can occur both in the special lane and in the adjacent regular ones. The damage can be worse than when there is no barrier to limit special-lane ingress and egress. The problem is shown to be reproducible across sites and across days at each site. Policy implications are discussed. Select designs and policies to address the problem are thereafter explored in Part II of the paper using traffic simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It identifies the cost of reducing CO2 emissions in the power sector through the promotion of wind and solar energy for the years 2006-2010. A RE carbon surcharge and an implicit carbon price due to the RE incentives are calculated. The RE carbon surcharge is the ratio of the net cost of the RE over the CO2 emission reductions resulting from actual RE injections into the electric power system. The implicit carbon price is the sum of the RE carbon surcharge and the EUA price. Results show that for the period analyzed both the RE carbon surcharge and the implicit carbon price of wind are on the order of tens of euro per tonne of CO2, while for solar are on the order of hundreds of euro per tonne of CO2.","[Mareantonini, Claudio; Ellerman, A.

Past studies tested the hypothesis using the dispersion of sectoral shocks as a proxy for the size of sectoral shifts and reported contradicting results which are sensitive to the model specification. This paper shows that the dispersion of sectoral shocks alone is insufficient to capture the aggregate layoffs caused by the sectoral shocks and that the shape of the distribution (skewness) of sectoral shocks plays a significant role. The sectoral shift hypothesis is tested as a joint test of the significance of dispersion and skewness. The new test strongly supports the hypothesis, and it is robust to model specifications. Sectoral shifts are also found to be a significant source of cyclical variation in the aggregate unemployment rate.","[Byun, Yanggyu] Korea Econ Res Inst, Div Macroecon Policy Res, Seoul, South Korea; [Hwang, Hae-shin] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Hwang, HS (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",econbyun@keri.org; hshwang@tamu.edu,,,,,,,25,0,0,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

We deal with both international and domestic transport markets in the model analysis. In the international markets, only airlines compete against each other, while in the domestic market airlines and HSR compete against each other. The results suggest that the improvement of connectivity between air and HSR at the airport increases its international passengers, and therefore, that strengthens its role as gateway, for example, gathering more inter intra transit passengers. However, the results also suggest that the demand of the area which the airport belongs to affects the role of airport as gateway. (C)2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular readers gain a detailed, candid and thought-provoking insight into extreme cultures of commitment and practice. John tells us how workers are socialized into accepting, adopting and propagating extreme workplace behaviour.

A drawback concerns boundary effects which cause inconsistencies near the endpoints of the support and bias in finite samples. To cope, sample trimming is typically used, which leads to non-random data loss. Monte Carlo experiments show this leads to poor performance near the support boundaries and on the interior due to bandwidth selection issues. We propose a modification that employs boundary correction techniques, and we demonstrate substantial improvement in finite-sample performance. We implement the new estimator using oil lease auctions data and find that trimming masks a substantial degree of bidder asymmetry and inefficiency in allocations.

Using a unique dataset of actual building energy use, physical, spatial, and occupancy characteristics - collected from New York City's Local Law 84 energy disclosure database, the Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) database, and the CoStar Group - this paper analyzes energy consumption across commercial office buildings and presents a new methodology for a market-specific benchmarking model to measure relative energy performance across peer buildings. A robust predictive model is developed to normalize across multiple building characteristics and to provide the basis for a multivariate energy performance index. The paper concludes with recommendations for data collection standards, computational approaches for building energy disclosure data, and targeted policies using k-means clustering and market segmentation.","[Kontokosta, Constantine E.] NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, Metrotech Ctr 1, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA; [Kontokosta, Constantine E.] NYU, Polytech Sch Engn, Metrotech Ctr 1, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA",New York University; New York University; New York University Tandon School of Engineering,"Kontokosta, CE (通讯作者)，NYU, Ctr Urban Sci & Progress, Metrotech Ctr 1, 19th Floor, Brooklyn, NY 11201 USA.",ckontokosta@nyu.edu,,"Kontokosta, Constantine/0000-0003-4831-9996",Real Estate Research Institute; New York University Provost's Office,Real Estate Research Institute; New York University Provost's Office,"Special thanks to the New York City Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability and the CoStar Group for data access.

In our paper, in contrast, we focus our attention on the characteristics of inland waterway ports in a European context. This is an overlooked part in the scientific literature on inland port development, which is up to now mainly concerned with US-based understandings of inland ports. We try to broaden the application of the inland port concept by explaining the development of inland ports in terms of inland waterway bounded cargo throughput. Based on a large-scale quantitative dataset of inland port development in Dutch municipalities we perform various statistical analyses to arrive at a more detailed understanding of the question: What are the characteristics of European inland waterway ports and what transport and economic factors influence cargo throughput on the municipal level? The results in particular highlight the importance of the presence of a container terminal, the diversity in types of goods which are being handled by the inland port and the accessibility of the inland port relative to the regional motorway network as important factors in explaining the size and growth of inland ports. Interestingly, the popular claim in policy of 'investments in inland port development leading to employment growth' cannot be confirmed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article shows how the design of IMF conditionality is linked to the normative orientations of the staff and their common professional training. Professional ties from similar training help to bind the staff together around a shared set of normative orientations that inform the IMF's policy goals. When borrowing-country officials do not share these orientations, the staff are motivated to tighten conditionality. This behaviour also fits with staff concerns about time-inconsistency and moral hazard. I find robust statistical support for this argument using a dataset based on the professional ties that exist between the IMF staff and borrowing-country officials. Yet conditionality is not found to be more lenient when country officials share the normative orientations of the IMF staff. Staff concerns about time-inconsistent preferences and moral hazard likely weigh against more lenient treatment where normative adherence is stronger.","London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Chwieroth, JM (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Int Relat, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,102,42,47,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

We structurally estimate parameters that match the key moments of the German labour market. Our estimation and calibration are based on a single plant-level data source, that is, the IAB establishment and worker panel. The calibration shows that trade liberalisation reduces unemployment in the long run. In our counter-factual policy simulations, we focus on the effect of labour market policies on the trade and unemployment nexus and we explore how the magnitude of the effects differs under different bargaining regimes. Labour market institutions have stronger effects under collective bargaining. Compared with trade or the bargaining power of unions, the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment turns out to be rather modest.","[Capuano, Stella; Schmerer, Hans-Joerg] Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany",,"Capuano, S (通讯作者)，Inst Employment Res IAB, Nurnberg, Germany.",,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,15,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2015,38.0,7.0,,,SI,,1037,1063,,10.1111/twec.12220,0.0,,,27,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CM8YK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357989600002,0

This new technology has the potential to impact vehicle safety, congestion, and travel behavior. All told, major social AV impacts in the form of crash savings, travel time reduction, fuel efficiency and parking benefits are estimated to approach $2000 to per year per AV, and may eventually approach nearly $4000 when comprehensive crash costs are accounted for. Yet barriers to implementation and mass-market penetration remain. Initial costs will likely be unaffordable. Licensing and testing standards in the U.S. are being developed at the state level, rather than nationally, which may lead to inconsistencies across states. Liability details remain undefined, security concerns linger, and without new privacy standards, a default lack of privacy for personal travel may become the norm. The impacts and interactions with other components of the transportation system, as well as implementation details, remain uncertain. To address these concerns, the federal government should expand research in these areas and create a nationally recognized licensing framework for AVs, determining appropriate standards for liability, security, and data privacy.

J,"Kim, K",,,,"Kim, Kyeongsu",,,Can carsharing meet the mobility needs for the low-income neighborhoods? Lessons from carsharing usage patterns in New York City,TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Carsharing; Mobility; Social inclusion,,"For decades, carsharing has become an attentive dialogue among transportation planners and civic groups who have long supported and business owners and government officials who see carsharing as a means to realize their interests i.e., another market for revenue generation and replacement of government own vehicles with carshare units. It has particularly drawn attention in New York City (NYC). As of today, NYC is the largest carsharing market in the United States, accounting for about one third of all North American carsharing members. In addition to market-driven forces, the City government has pronounced pro-carsharing policies. Yet carsharing is still considered as an exclusive program to middle-income, white, and young populations. The purpose of this study is to see if carsharing can help meet the mobility demand for urban residents, especially in the marginalized neighborhoods. By investigating a leading carsharing program - Zipcar's vehicle utilization pattern in NYC, I attempt to disentangle how neighborhoods with different socio-demographics are associated with carsharing usage. The study result revealed that there is high demand for midsize (standard) vehicles on weekdays and weeknights. In addition, carsharing usage was highly correlated with the number of total vehicles, not the number of Zipcar parking lots, if the cars are accessible within walking distances. More importantly, carsharing in low-income neighborhoods did not differ from the typical carsharing locations. What matters is the affordability. Hence, there is no reason not to consider new services or expanding existing service boundaries to the outer boroughs in the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The practical and theoretical challenge of the rail capacity is its dynamics and uncertainty, which are common in China and elsewhere. Based on the capacity balance, a train service-demand intention set (TSDIS) at High-Speed Rail (HSR) line (t@l-TSDIS) is defined, which takes the number of trains, the average speed, the heterogeneity and the stability as the core elements for the capacity usage. For dynamics and uncertainty, we update the norm for capacity measure as the time needed to fulfill the task list t@l-TSDIS. Then we develop the objectives and constraints for the Mathematical Program for Line Capacity (MPLC), which aims at minimization of heterogeneity and running time as well as maximization of reliability. For solving MPLC, the Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategy (PAES) and fuzzy logic penalty function are introduced. Furthermore we propose a rolling optimization tactic oriented by the practical problem, which combines the improved Pareto Archived Evolutionary Strategy (iPAES) with an interactive technique. In a case study, we apply the proposed ideas and methodology to Beijing-Shanghai HSR (BS-HSR) line much closer to the railway practice. By using the computer language C# to compile the Console program, Pareto optimized results for MPLC are achieved, including the standard and practical values for the heterogeneity indices, reliability indices and running time indices. We also discuss the sensitivity of the heterogeneity index. This research demonstrates that it is useful to analyze the line capacity usage for China HSR with the proposed optimization approach.

Why - and what are the implications? This article traces environmental instruments to pressures on governments when the World Trade Organization (WTO) was designed in the early 1990s: environment-related trade disputes were on the rise, environmentalists were concerned even with regional trade agreements, and countries from the North and the South clashed over the possibility of green-protectionism. Today, WTO-permissible environmental instruments share key features: 1) information-revealing conditions compel states to divulge private information in order to maintain trade-restricting environmental measures, and 2) that information is funneled through the trade regime's formal dispute settlement mechanism, endowing WTO rules and officials with structural supremacy over areas of international law that lack such mechanisms of their own. An illustration from the WTO's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement shows how this works in practice, putting trade law experts in the delicate position of adjudicating in matters beyond their area of expertise. Examining this advances knowledge in political science, law, and policy: about dispute settlement, institutional design, and information-provision in international organizations.","Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Johnson, T (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Sanford Sch Publ Policy, 201 Sci Dr,SB 236,Box 90245, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",tana.johnson@duke.edu,,,,,,,88,21,21,1,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

It does so by recapitulating the main findings from a study on Spanish-Moroccan co-operation on civilian and military crisis management. The findings support the claim that common practice precedes collective identity in processes of security community-building in that the EU has helped bring together and perpetuate a community of security practitioners in the western Mediterranean that builds upon, as well as transcends, already existing bilateral relations.","Swedish Inst Int Affairs, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden",,"Bremberg, N (通讯作者)，Swedish Inst Int Affairs, Drottning Kristinas Vag 37,POB 27035, S-10251 Stockholm, Sweden.",niklas.bremberg@ui.se,"Bremberg, Niklas/JLL-2195-2023",,,,,,77,31,34,0,32,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

The closures generate plausibly exogenous variation in transit access across space and time, allowing us to test the popular notion that crime can be facilitated by public transit. Closing one station reduces crime by 5% in the vicinity of stations on the same train line. Most of this effect remains after controlling for decreased ridership, indicating that a decrease in the availability of victims does not drive most of our results. We find suggestive evidence that crime falls more at stations that tend to import crime, i.e. stations where perpetrators are less likely to live. We also see larger decreases at stations on the same line when the transit authority closes stations that tend to export crime. These heterogeneous effects suggest that the response of perpetrators to increased transportation costs contributes to the decrease in crime. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Calibration reveals substantial preference heterogeneity between men and women. For example, utility losses stemming from weight gains are ten times greater for women compared to men. Counterfactual experiments show that changes in food prices and household income account for half of the increase in weight of adult men, but only a small fraction of women's weight. We argue that quantitative models of food consumption choices and body weight have a unique role to play in future research in the economics of obesity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper shows that standard RD estimation using a rounded discrete running variable leads to inconsistent estimates of treatment effects, even when the true functional form relating the outcome and the running variable is known and is correctly specified. This paper provides simple formulas to correct for this discretization bias. The proposed approach does not require instrumental variables, but instead uses information regarding the distribution of rounding errors, which is easily obtained and often close to uniform. Bounds can be obtained without knowing the distribution of the rounding error. The proposed approach is applied to estimate the effect of Medicare on insurance coverage in the USA, and to investigate the retirement-consumption puzzle in China, utilizing the Chinese mandatory retirement policy.

Using the entire digitized returns of the 1911 population census, we find that such marriages were relatively rare, occurring in less than 1% of total marriages. Some of this infrequency can be attributed to ethnoreligious hostility especially in the north of the country. However, we also show that the rarity of intermarriage reflects local marriage markets, as non-Roman Catholics living in communities with fewer coreligionists were more likely to intermarry. We examine the individual characteristics of partners in these marriages, looking at the religious denomination of their children, their decision to marry out, and their fertility behavior. Our findings illustrate how the frequency of intermarriage reflects historical levels of intolerance, but only after local marriage market conditions have been accounted for. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Working in a job that provides too few' hours can have serious ramifications for the economic livelihood of workers. Working-class workers are central here. Drawing on analysis of large-scale survey data, the article identifies that workers in lower level occupations experienced the most substantial post-recessionary growth in the proportions working too few' hours. Did these work-time changes narrow or widen class inequalities in feelings of financial hardship? The article concludes that although middle-class workers also saw their financial positions damaged, this so-called first middle-class recession' did not erode class inequalities in financial hardship among UK workers.","[Warren, Tracey] Univ Nottingham, Sociol, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England",University of Nottingham,"Warren, T (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, B27 Law & Social Sci Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",tracey.warren@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Warren, Tracey/0000-0002-1485-4969",British Academy [BR100093],British Academy,This research was funded by award BR100093 from the British Academy.,,47,52,58,1,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This article draws on the first large scale study of stripping work in the UK, exploring original empirical data to examine why women continue to seek work in an industry that is profoundly precarious and often highly exploitative. It suggests that rather than either a career' or a dead end' job, many women use lap dancing strategically to create alternative futures of work, employment and education. It is argued that precarious forms of employment such as lap dancing can be instrumentalized through agentic strategies by some workers, in order to achieve longer term security and to develop opportunities outside the sex industry. As such, it is averred that engagement in the industry should instead be understood in a wider political economy of work and employment and the social wage.","[Hardy, Kate] Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England; [Sanders, Teela] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds; University of Leeds,"Hardy, K (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, GM 12 Maurice Keyworth Bldg, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",k.r.hardy@leeds.ac.uk,,,,,,,39,26,29,2,18,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

A neorealist, zero-sum framing of international monetary relations is not inevitable, yet casts a persistent shadow especially during periods of prospective interstate power transitions when previously peripheral countries find themselves with unexpected new capabilities. This article seeks to understand and theorise the financial statecraft of emerging economies, moving beyond the traditional understanding that closely identifies the concept with financial sanctions imposed by a strong state on a weaker state. We propose that the aims of financial statecraft may be either 'defensive' or 'offensive'. Financial statecraft may be targeted either 'bilaterally' or 'systemically'. Finally such statecraft may employ instruments that are either 'financial' or 'monetary'. As emerging market economies have moved up in the ranks in the interstate distribution of capabilities, they have also expanded their financial statecraft strategies from narrowly defensive and bilateral to those involving offensive tactics and targeted at the global and systemic level. Historical and contemporary examples illustrate the analysis.","[Armijo, Leslie Elliott] Portland State Univ, Hatfield Sch Publ Affairs, Portland, OR 97207 USA; [Katada, Saori N.] Univ So Calif, Sch Int Relat, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA",Portland State University; University of Southern California,"Armijo, LE (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Hatfield Sch Publ Affairs, Portland, OR 97207 USA.",leslie.armijo@gmail.com; skatada@usc.edu,,"Armijo, Leslie/0000-0001-5202-204X; Katada, Saori/0000-0002-1030-4222",,,,,73,44,46,0,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

But in 2012 it announced a new institutional view giving more scope for capital flow management and in effect restricting the rights of capital owners. The Fund's program in Iceland after the October 2008 crash helped to pave the way; it was the first time the Fund had endorsed capital controls in a developed country. The essay describes Iceland's boom and bust, and how the government and IMF tried to manage the crisis. With IMF support, the government implemented capital outflow controls, initially as an emergency response and then as a longer-term stabilization measure. The control regime evolved in a complicated game, sometimes referred to in public debate as the battle of Iceland, between the central bank implementing a professionally-led capital account liberalization strategy versus political parties seeking to turn the controls to their advantage. From this political economy perspective we explain why the temporary capital controls remain in place more than five years on. At the end we draw some broad lessons from the Iceland case for the financial booms and busts to come.","[Sigurgeirsdottir, Silla] Univ Iceland, Dept Polit Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland; [Wade, Robert H.] London Sch Econ, London, England",University of Iceland; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Sigurgeirsdóttir, S (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Polit Sci, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland.",,,,,,,,62,10,12,1,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

First, we isolated bacteria from citrus leaf surfaces that were able to inhibit X. citri subsp. citri in vitro. Among the selected isolates, we focused on one with remarkable activity. The strain was characterized as Pseudomonas fluorescens after sequencing its 16S rDNA and analyzing the sequence with BLASTn. The purification and chemical analysis of the active compound allowed us to assign the inhibitory activity to enantio-pyochelin (E-Pch). Since this molecule is a siderophore, we wondered if the inhibition observed was a result of iron scavenging. Surprisingly, when we supplemented media with an excess of iron, we observed practically no change in the inhibition activity. In an attempt to identify the action mechanism of E-Pch, we evaluated the ability of E-Pch to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) within a culture of X. citri subsp. citri and its correlation with the inhibitory activity. In fact, we observed increased ROS levels when E-Pch was added. In addition, the reducing agent, ascorbic acid, lowered ROS levels and the antibiotic activity, implying that inhibition is probably caused by oxidative stress. Finally, we studied the use of E-Pch in a model of canker disease. EPch reduced canker formation on leaves of 'Eureka' and 'Lisbon' lemon cultivars. These results show E-Pch as a promising compound for citrus canker biocontrol.","[Adler, Conrado; Michavila, Gabriela; Lopez, Fabian E.; Corbalan, Natalia S.; Lami, Maria J.; Vincent, Paula A.; de Cristobal, Ricardo E.] Univ Nacl Tucuman, INSIBIO CONICET UNT, Inst Super Invest Biol, Dept Bioquim Nutr, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina; [Filippone, Maria P.; Castagnaro, Atilio P.] ITA NOA EEAOC CONICET, Inst Tecnol Agroind Noroeste Argentino, Estn Expt Agroind Obispo Colombres, Las Talitas, Tucuman, Argentina; [Filippone, Maria P.; Castagnaro, Atilio P.] ITA NOA EEAOC CONICET, Las Talitas, Tucuman, Argentina",Universidad Nacional de Tucuman; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"de Cristóbal, RE (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Tucuman, INSIBIO CONICET UNT, Inst Super Invest Biol, Dept Bioquim Nutr, RA-4000 San Miguel De Tucuman, Tucuman, Argentina.",rdecristobal@fbqf.unt.edu.ar,,"Filippone, Maria Paula/0000-0002-5030-6943; Corbalan, Natalia/0000-0002-3588-3099; Castagnaro, Atilio/0000-0002-1599-2255",,,,,14,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,937,945,,,,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600117,0

The potential of Eastern Croatia as a tourist destination is noticeable in the increasing number of visitors and the range of events through which tourism businesses offer their products and services. In this way, tourism becomes the generator of product sales and exports. To increase the number of visits, this region should be more intensively promoted on the European and world markets. This is quite feasible with proper investment in high-quality marketing promotion on the Internet, which would significantly improve the position of Eastern Croatia in the online environment. Online advertising has been gaining importance because of the growing number of Internet users and constant technology improvements. The tourism sector in Eastern Croatia should strive to expand the range of tourism products, reduce seasonality, improve customer satisfaction, increase the average daily spending, raise the employment and self-employment rates, and probably most urgently, make the region an internationally recognized destination. Marketing activities are essential for accessing the domestic and international markets. By applying Web 2.0. techniques and tools, tourism businesses can pinpoint the segment they want to attract, and then use social networks, e-mail marketing and/or browser advertising to deliver the information on the destination and tourism offer. The paper will investigate to what extent business entities have recognized the importance of online promotion. The goal of the paper is to analyse the current situation regarding the presentation of Eastern Croatia on the Internet and to explore the potentials of this type of advertising.

The use of Open Educational Resources (OER) could significantly facilitate and accelerate the development and training of personnel. Using OER employees can gain new knowledge as well as improve their knowledge and skills and to apply them in their work more effectively. The paper aims to provide theoretical and practical insights for the development and implementation of an OER platform for management of academic and entrepreneurial knowledge. Particular attention is paid to the integration of OER with some solutions of the metadata publishing. Design/methodology/approach - Advances in information technology, and especially web technology, have offered many solutions for OER sharing. However, the biggest defect is the weak search ability of these resources on the internet. The amount of resources is increasing every day and users need much more time to find exactly what they are interested in. Because of that, drawing on theoretical studies and practical challenges, the paper deals with the integration of OER platform with some of the solutions for metadata publishing. Metadata should provide greater visibility and availability of resources on the internet. Originality/value - This paper seeks to shed more light on development and implementation of an OER platform intended primarily for academic education but suitable also for use in entrepreneurship. The development and implementation of an effective OER poses several challenges. First, it is necessary to define the objectives and target groups and, in turn the contents which will be published. Second, it is essential to define an appropriate set of metadata that should not be too exhaustive, but sufficient to adequately describe resources. Third it is necessary to explore the available platforms on the market and choose the solution that will largely meet our requirements. Finally it is crucial to adapt existing solutions to our needs. Practical implications - The paper offers a snapshot of some main platforms that are used for OER and point out their benefits and disadvantages. In doing that the study highlights how an OER platform intended primarily for academic education can be adapted for use in entrepreneurship. Moreover the papershows how it is possible to increase the visibility and searchability of resources on the Internet integrating platform for OER and metadata portal.","[Carlucci, Daniela] Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Environm &, Matera, Italy; [Kitanovic, Olivera; Vulovic, Nikola] Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Belgrade 11000, Serbia; [Rajlic, Irena] ArcelorMittalPrijedor, Prijedor, Bosnia & Herceg; [Jevremovic, Zoran] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Tech Sci, Cacak 32000, Serbia",University of Basilicata; University of Belgrade; University of Kragujevac,"Kitanovic, O (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Min & Geol, Dusina 7, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",,,,,,,,16,0,0,1,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1801,1812,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200139,0

Some recent analyses have found that mean summer maximum temperature change over Europe was +1.6 +/- 0.4 degrees C during 1880 to 2005. It seems that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extreme. The objective of this work was to identify spatial variations of the seasonal and annual extreme temperature variability and trends over Romania in the period 1985-2014. Starting with a large climatological database (30 years of daily data for 29 locations from Romania), daily minimum, maximum and amplitude temperature data were condensed into normal probability functions for which the assumption of normal distribution was accepted by the Shapiro-Wilk statistical test. These functions were then used to calculate the appearance probability of annual and monthly temperatures values. Temperatures which appear with different probabilities all year long were computed with NORMDIST function from Microsoft Office Excel. Based on these values data thematic maps were generated with isolines drawn by geo-statistical interpolation (kriging method of Surfer (R), Golden Software, 2012). Comparing the increasing trend per decade expressed by probabilities, we found that the minimum temperature had almost the same rate (21.6% in a decade) as the maximum ones (21.0% in a decade) and mean daily temperature amplitude remained unchanged from 1985 to 2014. We identified the presence of an increased variability of annual mean temperature trends between the different climatological stations. It was noted that the level of statistical significance of maximum and minimum temperature linear trends per decade was low during winter, spring and autumn. But this level of significance was very high for June, July and August months. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The calibrated model is used to gauge the change in subsidies with ESR that is consistent with the fall in the share of 'pure exporters', firms exporting all their output, observed in China, from 25.7% in 2002 to 11.1% in 2013. Our results indicate that a 6.9% reduction in the ad-valorem subsidy rate available to firms that export all their output is consistent with the observed fall in their share of exporting firms.

In-depth gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the chromatograms showed a high complexity, likely due to the addition of traits from both parents. Consequently, many minor peaks could not be identified due to co-elutions, which generated unknown mixed MS spectra. Further investigation based on a more sophisticated processing procedure (deconvolution software) and advanced chromatographic techniques (heart-cut multidimensional gas chromatography) have been carried out. Compared to deconvolution software, the use of a two-dimensional GC-MS system proved to be more efficient to elucidate the co-elutions. Finally, our study showed that, even though the hybrid contained many of the compounds found in one or both parents, a few compounds that have never been identified in any of the parents were identified. The presence of these volatile compounds in hybrids may result from the interaction between the two genomes during hybridization, in which one may cause the activation of some genes in the other, which are otherwise silent in the parent genome.","[Delort, Estelle; Decorzant, Erik; Jaquier, Alain] Firmenich Co, Corp R&D Div, Analyt Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland",Firmenich,"Delort, E (通讯作者)，Firmenich Co, Corp R&D Div, Analyt Innovat, Geneva, Switzerland.",estelle.delort@firmenich.com,,,,,,,17,2,2,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,293,303,,,,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600035,0

Fungal strains were isolated from two indigenous grape varieties Cadarco and Musloaso of Moderat collected from Mini*-Maderat vineyard. The obtained isolates were identified at genus and/or species level by taxonomic criteria. During bunch closure stage, the level of moulds isolates has been 10(2)-10(3) CFU/g. The most frequently isolated filamentous fungus (about 30%) has been identified as Cladosporium sp. In the case of Aspergillus sp. it has been isolated only from Musloaso of Maderat variety. These results of the classical morphological identification will be further compared with the results of molecular identification by PCR-ITS-RFLP.

OH is a relatively recent production innovation, and is being adopted around the world, and there are anecdotal reports of superior yields attributed to OH. However, OH programs do not necessarily consider the soil as a critical part of the production program. This has raised concerns regarding soil acidification, waterlogging and nitrate leaching. Little objective scientific data are available on OH, and there is an industry-wide knowledge gap. A replicated extension trial is being conducted to compare citrus OH to conventional practice in young citrus. The first three years of data indicates no differences in yield, soil and/or leaf nutrient dry matter content to conventional best practice. Soil solution data is highly variable but indicates that adequate levels of nitrogen are present in the soil for both programs.

Such call was made to encourage listed public companies to provide their annual reports via XBRL and ultimately improves harmonisation between companies and between countries. The result of this study shows that to this date, no public listed companies have adopted XBRL. Such scenario indicates that there could be issues and challenges that have deter the implementation of XBRL among these companies. The result in this study serves as a starting point for CCM and other Malaysian regulators to consider the issues and challenges as to why such scenario exists and subsequently, provide strategies to encourage these companies to adopt XBRL.

In this respect, the present study was aimed to study the influence of row spacing and plant population on yield of achenes and yield components of the head under different soil and climatic conditions from South Romania. Researches were performed in field experiments in the years 2013 and 2014, in two locations from South Romania, respectively Fundulea (44 degrees 28' N latitude and 26 degrees 27' E longitude) and Moara Domneasca (44 degrees 29' N latitude and 26 degrees 15' E longitude). In each location and experimental year there were studied four sunflower hybrids (Pro 111, Pro 953, LG56.62, and P64LE19), each of them under three row spacing (75 cm, 50 cm, and twin-rows of 75/45 cm) and under three plant populations (50,000, 60,000, and 70,000 plants ha(-1)). The row spacing influenced differently the yield components of sunflower head according to the soil and climatic conditions. The highest yields were obtained at row spacing of 75 cm under favourable growing conditions and at row spacing of 50 cm under less favourable growing conditions. The increasing of plant population from 50,000 to 60,000 and further to 70,000 plants ha(-1) decreased the values of yield components of the head.

Different forms of business combinations, such as acquisition, contribute to better financial and business performance. Eastern Croatia, like other parts of Croatia, has in the last decade been facing economic crisis. Economic inefficiency leads to more complex ways of doing business and demands innovative financial techniques and instruments. The aim of this paper is to identify the importance of mergers and acquisitions in improving business and financial performance of the acquiring and target companies based on the example of the Agrokor Group's acquisition of Belje PLC (together with PIK Vrbovec meet industry). As a result of this acquisition, new products are developed, new markets are entered, new suppliers and distributors are reached and the companies are becoming more competitive in the market. Various quantitative and qualitative methods were used. Both scientific and technical literature and financial reports were analysed. Data synthesis has emphasized the importance of acquisition. By comparing statistical and financial reports before and after the acquisition conclusions on the effects of acquisition were reached. The results show that this acquisition was risky; nevertheless, it was a good business call, good investment and a great step forward for the Agrokor Group. However, the positive effects of the acquisition are a result of changes in management and organization, the use of new technology and knowledge, whereby the key role was played by a change in the market strategy and conducting a new business philosophy. It is predicted that the two corporations will become recognisable force in the Croatian market and will become a serious competitor. Expanding the Agrokor Group into eastern Croatia by acquisitions has proved to be a great external business growth strategy also for entering foreign markets.","[Kovacevic, Marina; Buljat, Maja; Krcelic, Petra] Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia",,"Kovacevic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Baltazar Zapresic, Vladimira Novaka 23, Zapresic 10290, Croatia.",kovacevic.marina4@gmail.com; maja.buljat@bak.hr; petra.krcelic@bak.hr,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,351,359,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100034,0

We find that, contrary to our initial expectations, general subjects are not neglected at Czech universities.

They cause direct fruit damage through oviposition and larval feeding, and warrant regulatory restriction on the movement of citrus fruits across national and international boundaries. Current quarantine mitigations for fruit flies in citrus include fumigation, high-temperature forced-air, vapor heat, cold, and irradiation treatments. Cold treatment has a multitude of schedules with various combinations of low temperature and treatment duration, depending on species of citrus and the guild of associated fruit fly pests. Current probit 9-based mitigation for fruit flies in citrus includes fumigation, high-temperature forced-air, vapor heat, cold, and irradiation treatments. The probit 9 treatment efficacy (99.9968% desired response, e.g., mortality) is the unofficial obligatory level of treatment efficacy for high risk pests in highly susceptible hosts. For naturally poor hosts, the probit 9 standard may be too rigid and impractical, and treatment efficacy lower than probit 9 may be sufficient to achieve the desired quarantine security. In the alternative treatment efficacy approach, risk may be defined either as the number of survivors or as the probability of a mating pair being present in a shipment, rather than as the effective mortality of the treated infesting individuals. The objective of this workshop is to discuss current and explore alternative methods of achieving commodity quarantine security, with particular emphasis on attaining acceptable efficacy levels other than probit 9 and the possibilities of integrating less than probit 9 treatments in developing systems approaches to mitigate risk of fruit fly pests.","APHIS, USDA, PPQ, CPHST,Plant Epidemiol & Risk Anal Lab, Honolulu, HI 96850 USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA),"Liquido, NJ (通讯作者)，APHIS, USDA, PPQ, CPHST,Plant Epidemiol & Risk Anal Lab, Honolulu, HI 96850 USA.",Nicanor.J.Liquido@aphis.usda.gov,,,,,,,0,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1071,1073,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.134,0.0,,,3,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600134,0

Using propensity-score matched sample to control for selection bias, we find that nonlocal investors overpay on the purchase by an estimated 13.8 % and sell at an estimated 7 % discount. These disadvantages relative to local investors expand with the geographic distance separating investor and asset. Nonlocal investors fundamentally overvalue similar assets sold to each other relative to assets transacted between locals, and are less patient as sellers.

It will show that both sides involved viewed the vote as a great matter of principle and invoked a number of British traditions in order to justify their stance. Opponents of entry sought to portray EEC membership as endangering three great traditions: Cobdenite liberalism, British internationalism and the UK's ability to govern itself. Those on the other side of the argument rejected all three of these claims, viewing the choice for Europe as opting for an exciting future rather than clinging unrealistically to former glories, and claimed that they were acting in line with another central British tradition - that of being a country that mattered and had a say when crucial economic and political decisions were being made.

Detached leaf assays were first demonstrated more than 40 years ago and reliable data suggesting a single gene determining susceptibility has been emerging for at least 20 years. However it is only recently that the requirement for genetic resistance in new hybrids has become a priority, following increased disease prevalence in Australian mandarin production areas previously considered too dry for the pathogen. Almost all of the high-fruit-quality parents developed so far by the Queensland-based breeding program are susceptible to ABS necessitating the screening of their progeny to avoid commercialisation of susceptible hybrids. This is done effectively and efficiently by spraying 3-6 month old hybrid seedlings with a spore suspension derived from a toxin-producing field isolate of Alternaria alternata, then incubating these seedlings in a cool room at 25 degrees C and high humidity for 5 days. Susceptible seedlings show clear disease symptoms and are discarded. Analysis of observed and expected segregation ratios loosely support the hypothesis for a single dominant gene for susceptibility, but do not rule out the possibility of alternative genetic models. After implementing the routine screening for ABS resistance for three seasons we now have more than 20,000 hybrids growing in field progeny blocks that have been screened for resistance to the ABS disease.","[Miles, Andrew K.] Univ Queensland, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia; [Miles, Andrew K.] EcoSci Precinct, Queensland Dept Agr Fisheries & Forestry, Dutton Pk, Qld, Australia; [Newman, Toni K.; Gultzow, Debra L.; Parfitt, S.

Development of new seedless mandarin cultivars has a high priority for many citrus industries worldwide. The recovery of triploid hybrids is the most promising approach to achieve this goal, since triploids have a very low pollen and ovule fertility. They are seedless or produce very low numbers of seeds and do not induce the formation of seeds in other cultivars by cross pollination. In Spain we are carrying a triploid breeding program since 1996 based on 2x x 2x, 2x x 4x and 4x x 2x sexual hybridizations followed by embryo rescue and flow cytometry, together with the use of different approaches to produce new tetraploid parents. The objective is to obtain new high quality easy peeling and seedless mandarin cultivars. More than thirty spontaneous autotetraploid apomictic genotypes to be used as male parents have been selected from seedbeds by flow cytometry. Also nine autotetraploid non apomictic genotypes, mainly to be used as female parents, have been obtained by chromosome duplication with treatments of micrografted shoot tips with colchicine or oryzalin. Symmetric protoplast fusion is also being used to produce allotetraploid genotypes. So far, we have obtained more than 5,500 triploid hybrids from 130 parental combinations by 2x x 2x pollinations, more than 4,300 triploid hybrids from 100 parental combinations by 2x x 4x pollinations, and more than 5,600 triploid hybrids from 103 parental combinations by 4x x 2x pollinations. In 2008 we released the first cultivars originated in the program, the seedless late maturing mandarins 'Garbi' and 'Safor', obtained from 2x x 2x crosses. More than 400,000 trees of these cultivars have been planted by growers during the last three years.","[Navarro, Luis; Aleza, Pablo; Cuenca, Jose; Juarez, Jose; Pina, Jose A.; Ortega, Carmen; Navarro, Antonio; Ortega, Violeta] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain",Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Navarro, L (通讯作者)，Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Protecc Vegetal & Biotecnol, Valencia, Spain.",lnavarro@ivia.es,"Aleza, Pablo/M-3710-2014; Navarro, Luis/D-1001-2012; Cuenca, Jose/N-7047-2014; Aleza, Pablo/ABF-4339-2020","Aleza, Pablo/0000-0002-8936-1448; Navarro, Luis/0000-0001-5163-5960; Aleza, Pablo/0000-0003-3554-5337; CUENCA, JOSE/0000-0002-3094-9933",,,,,32,36,39,0,16,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,389,395,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600048,0

The present research was conducted to establish the influence of age upon the quantitative and qualitative indices of the native buffalo semen. There were analyzed 20 native buffalo males, from different age categories. At every semen collecting there were recorded the following morphologic and morphometric sperm indices: sperm volume, sperm concentration (x 10(6) spz/ml), total number of sperm cells/ejaculate(x10(9)), head length, head width, tail length, head area and shape factor. The influence of the age was made along two years, studying the dynamics of the sperm indices through the computer image analysis. Descripted statistics were performed on the recorded data to determine normality. Statistical analysis was performed as per standard statistical methods. The results revealed the fact that the best performances were recorded in bulls older than three years old. The study clearly demonstrates that there is a variation in reproductive parameters in the bovine bulls, which could be studied at the molecular level to unveil any genomic markers associated with low fertility and/or infertility. The males may be utilized to obtain semen by subjecting the young ones to training at an early age, thereby decreasing the initial age of semen donation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

It causes vein enations on leaves and woody galls on trunk and branches of sensitive citrus species such as Mexican lime, rough lemon and Citrus volkameriana. The disease is currently diagnosed by biological indexing on sensitive indicator plants, an expensive and time-consuming method. In order to identify its causal agent and develop specific and reliable molecular detection methods, we analyzed small RNAs (sRNAs) from VE-infected Etrog citron plants by deep sequencing using the Illumina Solexa platform. Assembly of VE-associated sRNAs yielded several contigs that showed sequence homology with Pea enation mosaic virus 1 (PEMV-1), the type species of genus Enamovirus, family Luteoviridae. The gaps between adjacent contigs were filled by RT-PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing in order to obtain the complete genome sequence of a new virus, Citrus vein enation virus (CVEV). The CVEV genomic RNA has 5,983 nt organized in five open reading frames, resembling that of PEMV-1.

The father's time-use decisions are taken as given. The main goal is to analyze the sensitivity of maternal time use to the price of child care, taxes, benefits and child care subsidies. To account for non-convexities in the budget sets, we specify a discrete choice model. We estimate the model on data on couples with young children from the HILDA survey representative of the Australian population, which contains detailed information on time use and bought-in child care. Simulations based on the estimated parameters show that the time decisions of mothers with pre-school children are highly sensitive to changes in wages and the cost of child care. Our results also suggest that lowering effective tax rates faced by partnered mothers as second earners, by switching from family payments that are targeted on joint incomes to payments that are universal and funded by a more progressive individual-based income tax, would lead to a substantial increase in their labor force participation and hours of work.","[Apps, Patricia] Univ Sydney, Sch Law, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Apps, Patricia; Kabatek, Jan; van Soest, Arthur] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Kabatek, Jan] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Social & Econ Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Kabatek, Jan; van Soest, Arthur] Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands; [Rees, Ray] Univ Munich, CES, Munich, Germany; [van Soest, Arthur] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econometr, Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Soest, Arthur] Tilburg Univ, OR, Tilburg, Netherlands",University of Sydney; IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Melbourne; Tilburg University; University of Munich; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Kabátek, J (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Kabátek, J (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Social & Econ Res, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.;Kabátek, J (通讯作者)，Netspar, Tilburg, Netherlands.",j.kabatek@uvt.nl,"van Soest, A/AGL-3772-2022","van Soest, A/0000-0002-4765-8382; Kabatek, Jan/0000-0002-5947-7941",Australian Research Council's Discovery Project funding scheme [DP1094021]; Australian Research Council [DP1094021] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council's Discovery Project funding scheme(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"This research was supported under the Australian Research Council's Discovery Project funding scheme (Project ID: DP1094021).

This paper uses a large Norwegian dataset to focus on the relationship between birth order and a range of health and health-related behaviors, outcomes not previously available in datasets of this magnitude. Interestingly, we find complicated effects of birth order. First-borns are more likely to be overweight, to be obese, and to have high blood pressure and high triglycerides. For example, compared to fifth-borns, first-borns are about 5% points more likely to be obese and 7% points more likely to have high blood pressure. So, unlike education or earnings, there is no clear first-born advantage in health. However, first-borns are about 13% points less likely to smoke daily than fifth-born and are more likely to report good physical and mental health. Later-borns also score lower on well-being with fifth-horns being about 9% points less likely than first-borns to report that they are happy. Our findings are generally monotonic with middle-borns having outcomes that are intermediate between first- and fifth-borns. We find that these effects are largely unaffected by conditioning on education and earnings, suggesting that these are not the only important pathways to health differentials by birth order. When we explore possible mechanisms, we find that early maternal investment may play a role in birth order effects on health. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that obligations to protect human rights affect not only state behavior but also the behavior of dissidents. We present a theory in which the effect of HRTs on dissent is conditional on expectations of when it will constrain government behavior. We assume that HRT obligation increases the likelihood that government agents face litigation costs for repression but argue that leaders are only constrained when they would be most likely to repress. The expectation of constraint creates opportunity: citizens are more likely to dissent in HRT-obligated states with secure leaders and weak domestic courts.

Recent findings from the biological literature suggest that the so-called slow growth period around age 9 is a sensitive period for male germ cell development. We build on this evidence and investigate whether undernutrition at those ages transmits to children and grandchildren. Our findings indicate that third generation males (females) tend to have higher mental health scores if their paternal grandfather (maternal grandmother) was exposed to a famine during the slow growth period. These effects appear to reflect biological responses to adaptive expectations about scarcity in the environment, and as such they can be seen as an economic correctional mechanism in evolution, with marked socio-economic implications for the offspring.

We build on this literature by exploring the role of social interactions in the hospital sector using the large incidence of cesarean sections, usually considered an inappropriate outcome in the childbirth service. In doing so, we lay out a simple model of hospitals' behavior where the effect of peers' behavior emerges simply by sharing the same regional health authority responsible for auditing inappropriate behavior. In this setting, enforcement congestion induces a peer effect among hospitals that could make inappropriate behaviors more likely and, as a result, could increase the excess variance among regions. Then, using a unique dataset of Italian hospitals and 2007-2012 cesarean data, we empirically investigate whether the behavior of each hospital is affected by the behavior of hospitals within the same region. Our empirical findings show a significant and strong presence of peer effects among hospitals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To address this question I define a restrictive and a permissive notion of Pareto optimality and consider the large set of hierarchical exchange mechanisms which contains serial dictatorship as well as Gale's top trading cycles. Fix a housing problem with boundedly rational agents and a hierarchical exchange mechanism. Consider the set of matchings that arise with all possible assignments of agents to initial endowments in the given mechanism. I show that this set is nested between the sets of Pareto optima according to the restrictive and the permissive notion. These containment relations are generally strict, even when deviations from rationality are minimal. In a similar vein, minimal deviations from rationality suffice for the set of outcomes of Gale's top trading cycles with all possible initial endowments to differ from the set of outcomes of serial dictatorship with all possible orders of agents as dictators.","[Bade, Sophie] Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Egham, Surrey, England; [Bade, Sophie] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany",University of London; Royal Holloway University London; Max Planck Society,"Bade, S (通讯作者)，Univ London, Royal Holloway Coll, Egham, Surrey, England.;Bade, S (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Bonn, Germany.",sophie.bade@rhul.ac.uk,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,OCT,2016,47.0,3.0,,,,,501,510,,10.1007/s00355-016-0974-z,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EA6UU,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000386765300001,0

The WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards (SPS Agreement) aims to limit the use of non-tariff barriers like regulatory standards as protectionist measures. Yet, few attempts have been made to explore how these rules shape national policy-making processes, and particularly the ability of civil society organizations to ratchet up protective regulations. Through a study of standard-setting for pesticide residues in soft drinks in India, I argue that WTO rules are at once legal obligations backed by the coercive threat of economic sanctions and discursive standards for what constitutes appropriate regulatory practice.' As discursive standards, the rules shape the rationalities and strategies of diverse actors in domestic regulatory contests. These standards of appropriate regulatory practice are used instrumentally by transnational firms to undermine the influence of civil society in policy-making but can also offer opportunities for civil society organizations to contest and even enlarge the boundaries of appropriate regulatory practice.","[Quark, Amy A.] Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA",William & Mary,"Quark, AA (通讯作者)，Coll William & Mary, Dept Sociol, Williamsburg, VA 23185 USA.",aaquark@wm.edu,,,College of William & Mary Faculty Summer Grant,College of William & Mary Faculty Summer Grant,College of William & Mary Faculty Summer Grant.,,91,6,6,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Overall, study results indicate that the national- and regional-level data are inconsistent with a housing bubble scenario. Most of the results are robust to a variety of tests and alternate specifications.

I argue that List's theory of the national economy is characterised by a major ambivalence, as it incorporates both imperial and anti-imperial elements. On the one hand, List pitted his national principle against the British imperialism of free trade and the relations of dependency it heralded for late developers like Germany. On the other hand, his economic nationalism aimed less at dismantling imperial core-periphery relations as a whole than at reproducing these relations domestically and expanding them globally. I explain this ambivalence with reference to List's designation of imperial Britain as the prime example of successful economic development and a model to be emulated by late industrialisers. List thereby fashioned his ideas on national development out of the historical experience of an empire whereby he internalised its economic logic and discourse of the civilising mission. Consequently, List's national economy culminated in an early vision of the global north-south relations, in which the global industrial-financial core would expand to include France, Germany and the USA, while the rest of the world would be reduced to quasi-colonial agrarian hinterlands.","[Ince, Onur Ulas] Koc Univ, Dept Int Relat, Rumelifeneri Yolu, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey",Koc University,"Ince, OU (通讯作者)，Koc Univ, Dept Int Relat, Rumelifeneri Yolu, TR-34450 Istanbul, Turkey.",onurince@ku.edu.tr,"INCE, Onur Ulas/L-9576-2016","INCE, Onur Ulas/0000-0002-9665-5188",,,,,113,7,8,2,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

With Western capital reeling from the 2008 financial crisis, state-owned capital made inroads globally. China, as the world's largest saver, expanded its cross-border lending, funneling almost US$300 billion to developing countries since the crisis. What are the implications for debtor governments' room to maneuver? I contend that China's state-led capitalism is an important form of patient capital, characterized by a longer term horizon. I argue that its rapid global expansion has transformed the traditional relationship between economic interdependence and national policy autonomy. Without the market's threat of short-term capital withdrawal, national governments have considerably more room to maneuver. Given the recent emergence of Chinese financing, I employ a comparative case study analysis of two of China's largest debtors - Brazil and Venezuela - before and after the introduction of Chinese credit. I find that government budget deficits increase as Chinese state-to-state financing accounts for a larger share of total external public financing. These findings offer important new insights for the study of globalization, Latin American development, and China-Latin American relations, by helping explain the conditions under which nations veer from Western governance models.","[Kaplan, Stephen B.] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Kaplan, Stephen B.] George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University; George Washington University,"Kaplan, SB (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.;Kaplan, SB (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Elliott Sch Int Affairs, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",,,,Smith Richardson Foundation [20139332]; Minerva Initiative [180909],Smith Richardson Foundation; Minerva Initiative,Smith Richardson Foundation [20139332]; Minerva Initiative [180909].,,81,52,61,3,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

A CDA is a form of public-private partnership whereby the right to price and collect revenues from toll roads is leased to a private entity for a long but finite period of time. In exchange, this provides local and state governments with a quick influx of cash and/or additional infrastructure. Uncertainty associated with such long-term leases is of substantial public concern. This paper examines five different strategic options, namely a buyout option, a conditional buyout option, a revenue-sharing option, and two types of minimum revenue guarantee options. The buyout option in particular could give the public sector additional control over the future use of leased facilities and address potential concerns regarding long-run uncertainty and possible unforeseen windfalls for the private sector. The paper's contributions include the analysis, feasibility assessment and valuation of several strategic options, sensitivity analysis of the solutions, an economic consumer demand-based revenue model for purposes of cash flow simulation, and analysis of option price sensitivity to moneyness. The main conclusion is that strategic options can provide useful risk reduction, but generally have significant value relative to the lease itself. By scaling down payoffs, options could be realistically included in CDAs and other PPPs. For some parameter values, option values to the developer and public authority are offsetting, allowing for costless risk reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.
