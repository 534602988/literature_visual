A relevant question is how to effectively reduce rates of obesity. I examine the effect of advice from a physician or heath care provider to lose weight on individual weight outcomes using survey data. I account for selection bias using a control function approach and rely on data restrictions to control for simultaneity. I find robust results indicating that advice has a significant effect on weight loss. Several studies suggest physicians may not adequately advise their patients about weight loss. The results of this paper highlight an important opportunity for physicians to advise at-risk patients. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We introduce two main novelties: in the first place, we include the FDI variable, dividing it between types of foreign investor (industrial versus financial) besides the analysis with the division by country of origin. Second, we analyse whether FDIs may have effects not only on the probability that a firm exits from the domestic market, but also on whether it stops being internationally involved, that is, whether it stops importing or exporting. We find that German firms, in most cases, suffer from higher competition introduced by foreign firms except when they are part of a high-R&D region or a high-tech sector, because they have enough absorptive capacity to take advantage of possible spillover effects. We also find that US FDIs have a crowding out effect for firms located in low-tech sectors but not in high-tech sectors. The results are reversed when considering financial investments instead of industrial investments. Finally, we find that FDIs are negatively correlated with exits from export markets but positively with those from import markets.","[Franco, Chiara] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Geluebcke, John P.

In contrast to traditional neo-classical models of international trade that imply net negative effects, industrial organization and learning-by-doing trade models describe how protective tariffs can encourage output expansion, productivity improvement, and price reductions. Taking Canada's 1879 National Policy as a natural experiment, we explore the effect of a policy that substantially increased tariff protection to some, but not all, Canadian manufacturing industries. Using treatment intensity and difference-in-differences approaches, we find strong support for the predictions of the new trade models. After 1879, industries that received greater protection experienced faster growth in output and productivity, as well as larger price reductions. The industries targeted by the National Policy also exhibited greater returns to scale and faster learning rates. These results have important implications for the infant-industry debate in addition to addressing a central theme in Canadian economic history, (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This is problematic given the dramatic changes experienced by the industry in the last two decades and the fact that there are unique determinants of systematic risk owing to the tourism industry's idiosyncratic business environment. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study is to identify financial/operating determinants that influence systematic risk for online travel agencies (OTAs). Panel data from 10 US OTA companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Index from 2001 through 2010 were analysed via a two-way, random-effects model using generalized least squares. The results indicate that advertising expenditures, liquidity and firm size are significant determinants of the systematic risk of OTAs. Appropriate financial/operating management for all three determinants are recommended to decrease that risk. This investigation of OTAs' systematic risk provides practical insights to the OTA industry.","[Lee, Won Seok] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Convent Management, Seoul 130701, South Korea; [Lee, Won Seok; Kerstetter, Deborah] Penn State Univ, Dept Recreat Pk & Tourism Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Moon, Joonho; Lee, Seoki] Penn State Univ, HRIM, Dept Hospitality Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Kyung Hee University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Moon, J (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, HRIM, Dept Hospitality Management, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",lws79877@gmail.com; jzm244@psu.edu,"Moon, Joonho/AAE-6212-2022; Lee, Seoki/AFK-7195-2022","Lee, Seoki/0000-0003-4720-9170",,,,,78,7,11,0,55,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

A fractional integrated transfer function is introduced to catch the long-range dependence in this bivariate causality model and a pseudo spectrum based estimator is proposed to estimate the long memory parameter in the transfer function. In recent years, a wavelet domain-based method has gained popularity in estimations of long memory parameter in unit series. No extension to bi-series or multi-series has been made and this paper aims to fill this gap. We will construct an estimator for the long memory parameter in the bi-variable causality model in the wavelet domain. The theoretical background is derived and Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate the performance of the estimator.","Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Bergen, Norway",Norwegian School of Economics (NHH),"Li, YS (通讯作者)，Norwegian Sch Econ, Dept Business & Management Sci, Bergen, Norway.",yushu.li@nhh.no,,,Swedish Research Council [421-2009-2663],Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),Yushu Li gratefully acknowledges funding from Swedish Research Council (project number 421-2009-2663).,,36,2,2,1,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This issue is addressed in the present paper which analyses the effect of managing relationships among three partners (trade organizer, exhibitor and end customer) on the exhibitor's performance during the fair, and comparing that effect with the influence of transactional marketing management, in which business performance depends on conventional tools. The results point to an overbalance on the side of transactional marketing in the case of tourism and travel exhibitors. By contrast, in the case of the business-to-business relationship between trade show organizers and exhibitors, the weight of relationship marketing seems to be comparatively higher and, most relevant, to affect the exhibitor's performance in terms of their business with end customers during the show.","[Rodriguez Oromendia, Ainhoa; Reina Paz, Maria Dolores; Rufin, Ramon] UNED, Fac Econ & Business Sci, Madrid 28040, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED),"Rufín, R (通讯作者)，UNED, Fac Econ & Business Sci, C Senda del Rey 11, Madrid 28040, Spain.",rrufin@cee.uned.es,"Martin, Ainhoa Rodriguez/JQX-0769-2023; Rodríguez Oromendía, Ainhoa/HPB-7967-2023","Rodríguez Oromendía, Ainhoa/0009-0002-0856-4532",,,,,36,10,12,2,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

The author questions this practice because much evidence suggests that LOS is an 'endogenous' independent variable. One of the basic assumptions of OLS regression is thus violated, and a new method - instrumental variable (IV) regression - is called for to produce a consistent, unbiased estimate of LOS. A non-technical case study on IV regression shows that the LOS-TTE relationship estimated by IV regression analysis is only about half the analogue OLS estimate. The study concludes with several important implications for the statistical modelling of micro-level tourism expenditures and for cross-sectional regression-based tourism studies in general.","Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway",Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences,"Thrane, C (通讯作者)，Lillehammer Univ Coll, Fac Econ & Org Sci, Box 952, N-2604 Lillehammer, Norway.",christer.thrane@hil.no,,,,,,,24,18,18,0,10,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1354-8166,2044-0375,,TOURISM ECON,Tour.

Existing research, however, disagrees on the extent to which the intensified business lobbying has resulted in increased business influence on EP policy outcomes. Some studies find a business bias' in the EP, while others still perceive it to be a forceful promoter of diffuse interests (such as consumer and environmental groups). This article examines the conditions under which business groups shape policy outcomes in the EP. The article uses a comparative qualitative case study design of four recent legislative dossiers, and draws on process-tracing of EU documents and lobbying letters, and 145 interviews. It finds that the ability of business to leave its fingerprints on EP reports depends on a number of factors - most notably business unity, low issue salience and dossiers being dealt with by mainstream committees.","[Rasmussen, Maja Kluger] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rasmussen, MK (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Govt, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",M.K.Rasmussen@lse.ac.uk,,"Dionigi, Maja Kluger/0000-0002-0610-6784",,,,,31,45,48,3,40,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

We propose a class of mechanisms such that each Nash-implementable scoring rule can be implemented via a mechanism in that class. Moreover, we investigate the class of generalized scoring rules and show that with a restriction on score vectors, our results for the standard case are still valid.","[Dogan, Battal] Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; [Koray, Semih] Bilkent Univ, Ankara, Turkey",University of Rochester; Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Dogan, B (通讯作者)，Univ Rochester, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",battaldogan@gmail.com,"Dogan, Battal/AAL-2072-2021",,,,,,11,3,3,1,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,FEB,2015,44.0,2.0,,,,,423,432,,10.1007/s00355-014-0835-6,0.0,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CA5YG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348984000010,0

Evidence from US-India Bilateral Trade,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATIONS; UNITED-STATES; PATTERNS,"Recently, the apex environmental agency of India observed that domestic industrial pollution has been increasing at an alarming rate over the last two decades, and the need to rein in traditional polluting industries. This raises the pertinent question of whether the poor domestic pollution regime has affected the pattern of India's trade in dirty manufactured products in the post-liberalisation era since 1991. We find that on the whole, India has remained a net importer of pollution-intensive manufactured goods; however, there is a distinct trend of increasing specialisation in specific dirty industries especially in the bilateral trade with high-income countries, and to a lesser degree with low-income countries. The USA being India's single largest country trading partner in the post-liberalisation era, we test for pollution offshoring at the finer industry level in US-India bilateral trade. While we find that the pollution haven effect is not significant, India's specialisation in certain dirty manufacturing industries through the last decade remains a disturbing trend. India needs to integrate environmental sustainability within industrial growth urgently, and it is pertinent to implement policies which would reflect the true pollution costs in an industry that is increasingly competing in the international market.","[Sawhney, Aparna; Rastogi, Rashmi] Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India","Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi","Sawhney, A (通讯作者)，Jawaharlal Nehru Univ, Ctr Int Trade & Dev, New Delhi 110067, India.",,"Sawhney, Aparna/AAW-4137-2020; Rastogi, Rashmi/JJD-1008-2023","Sawhney, Aparna/0000-0003-4878-7773;",,,,,27,8,9,1,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2015,38.0,2.0,,,,,360,378,,10.1111/twec.12164,0.0,,,19,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CB4SQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349618800006,0

This approach confines already producing fields to peripheral concerns and obscures artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) production from mainstream debates on sustainable mining and indigenous rights. The article provides an overview of mining reforms on multiple scales and a case study of Guyana's gold sector. Looking closely at ASM processes in the Upper Mazaruni river basin, the traditional homeland of the indigenous Akawaio and Arekuna, the evidence reveals a compelling case for denying the hype of sustainable mining. Oddly enough, indigenous involvement with mining presents a unique opportunity to rethink progressive ASM designs for two key reasons. First, vested interests in long-term survival on the same land are a qualitative advantage for overcoming the limits of short-term, fragmented engagements with mid-stream ASM activity. Second, the embedded ecological knowledge of indigenous communities can inform more inclusive, place-based interdisciplinary frameworks for reforming ASM and building lasting solutions through a holistic approach.","San Francisco State Univ, Liberal Studies Program, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA",California State University System; San Francisco State University,"Hennessy, L (通讯作者)，San Francisco State Univ, Liberal Studies Program, Burk Hall 238,1600 Holloway Ave, San Francisco, CA 94132 USA.",loganh@sfsu.edu,,,,,,,146,13,16,0,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The principal objective of the study was the determination of the effect of moisture content of kernels of new spring wheat cultivars on specific energy needed to crash them by a laboratory hammer mill. In all the cases an increase of kernel moisture causes an increase of the specific energy. The lowest specific energy during grinding, throughout the entire range of kernel moisture, was characteristic of cultivar Arabella, while the highest values of specific energy were obtained in the case of cultivar Mandaryna. The relationship of the specific energy to the kernel moisture content was described by means of linear equations.

Our aim is to investigate the complexity of ISNs adopting a similar approach to that developed by Hidalgo and Hausmann (2009) to measure the country economic complexity. In particular, we define a complexity index measuring the economic complexity of the firms involved in an ISN and provide some applications to real case studies. Design/methodology/approach - We define two matrixes, one identifying the waste each firm produces, and the other mapping the wastes each firm uses. Using these matrixes, we compute four indexes: 1) the diversity index of the firm producing wastes exchanged; 2) the diversity index of the firm using the wastes; 3) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms producing it; and 4) the ubiquity index of the waste exchanged in terms of number of the firms using them. A overall firm complexity measure is defined by using these indices. Originality/value - This paper made a methodological advance in the study of complexity within ISNs by applying an economic complexity approach. Complexity of ISNs is a fundamental property of the system, because it allows adaption and emergence useful to improve performance, which thus should be exploited rather than reduced. The approach proposed here allows the firm complexity to be assessed in a simple manner, without requiring high computational efforts like in other methods developed in the literature, but at the same time in a rigorous way, because the main driver of the economic complexity is taken into account. Practical implications - The study provides a rating of firms in a ISN based on the complexity index, which is useful to identify the most critical firms in terms of impact on the network resilience. The higher the firm complexity, the higher the risk that the firm unavailability due to a disruptive event can cause problem for the survival of the ISN.","[Albino, Vito; Fraccascia, Luca; Giannoccaro, Ilaria] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Fraccascia, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, Viale Japigia 182, Bari, Italy.",,"Giannoccaro, Ilaria/H-6875-2013; Fraccascia, Luca/I-8078-2019","Fraccascia, Luca/0000-0002-6841-9823",,,,,21,4,4,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,277,292,,,,,,16,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200022,0

Integration is welfare enhancing when the cost difference between two regions is large enough. The benefits from export profits increase the total welfare in the exporting country, whereas the importing country benefits from a lower price. In this case, market integration also improves incentives to invest compared to autarky. The investment levels remain inefficient, however, especially for transportation facilities.

Improved cultivation techniques and crop management practices have advanced harvest by several weeks. According to market statistics, early asparagus achieves higher prices than asparagus offered during the regular season, but it also involves increased cultivation costs. In addition, the early crop is exposed to greater variations in the price level from year-to-year and is more sensitive to price quantity relationships. Therefore, the decision to grow early asparagus is associated with considerable uncertainty. Economic experiments based on game theory can be used to analyze decision-making. This study dealt with the decision to cultivate early or normal asparagus under changing market conditions. The profit of an asparagus grower depends on his own production decision, the production decision of competitors and consumer sentiment in the market in accordance with price fluctuations. Low price volatility led to significantly higher profits than large variations in price. On occasions, a conservative strategy (conventional supply period) was more successful than a risky strategy (early delivery). It was also demonstrated that the interaction between actors is more important for commercial success than the decisions of an individual actor.","[Balling, S.; Hege, D.; Sparke, K.] Geisenheim Univ, Geisenheim, Germany",,"Balling, S (通讯作者)，Geisenheim Univ, Geisenheim, Germany.",,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,55,59,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.9,0.0,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800009,0

The term and the principles of sustainable tourism are explained: the principles of ecological sustainability, sociocultural, technological, as well as of economic sustainability. These principles are complementary in tourism, which means that it is only by means of their interactive implementation that the sustainable development of a tourist destination may be provided. The application of these principles is particularly important in rural tourism, whose development is based on cumulative attractions of natural, socio-cultural and economic resources that might ensure the sustainable development of rural areas only through interactive activities. Rural tourism is the least developed kind of tourism in Croatia, although more than 90% of the area of Croatia is actually the rural area. This is the result of the past tourism policy which preferred maritime tourism, and neglected the so-called Green Croatia. The accession of Croatia to the European Union creates new market and investment opportunities for the development of rural tourism through special interest tourism. The goal of this paper is to investigate and explain the principles of sustainable development and to point out their possible implementation in rural tourism of continental Croatia.The initial hypothesis in this paper is that for long-term sustainable development of rural tourism the implementation of interactive principles of sustainable development is necessary. This hypothesis is proven through the analysis of the results of past research by applying the desk research method, analysis method, synthesis method and comparison method.","[Bartoluci, Mato; Hendija, Zvjezdana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Tourism, JF Kennedy Sq 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia; [Petracic, Mateja] Karlovac Univ Appl Sci, HR-47000 Karlovac, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Bartoluci, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Tourism, JF Kennedy Sq 6, HR-10000 Zagreb, Croatia.",mbartoluci@efzg.hr; zhendija@efzg.hr; mateja.petracic@vuka.hr,"Alves, Juliano/GQO-7605-2022",,,,,,24,0,0,1,13,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,26,36,,,,,,11,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100002,0

These standards define the guidelines to manage projects efficiently and effectively but not always in an explicit mode, the important principles of General Management. Some of these elements are important in the management of the Historical Information, Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement. The standards defined by ISO are not limited to suggest the mode of project management in particular contexts as can be risk management or quality but, reading between the lines, give us important lessons for the management of organizations in a project management context. Through a detailed analysis of these norms are to highlight the principles through which organizations and managers can manage more effectively and efficiently departments or companies. Another result is to define the principles through which organizations manage information and put them to our disposal by the organization in order to improve organizational processes. Design/methodology/approach - I propose an approach for improving the profitability of the projects through the management of an integrated system of knowledge management in the enterprise organization. The approach involves the analysis of the most important ISO norms related to the project management context to define the General Management principles to improve the shared knowledge.

Additional costs are the ones that accompany the process of buying different kind of licenses, permits as well as the costs associated with a potential corruption component and lost profits resulting from the situation when a company is ready to operate but cannot start off because of bureaucratic delays. Alternative costs are those of time resources needed for getting emission and waste disposal permits as wells as the cost of some environmental management procedures.

Diversity does exist within the Poncirus trifoliata species, but little is known regarding the behaviour variability of genotypes to abiotic constraints. The citrus diversity of 72 P. trifoliata genotypes was investigated using SSR markers. Two major genetic groups were clearly identified. Five genotypes, belonging to each genetic group, were then selected to investigate their properties of tolerance to water deficit. Water deficit was applied by withdrawing irrigation for 4 weeks. Physiological parameters such as leaf stomatal conductance and gravitational water quantity were estimated. Among genotypes, we observed that some genotypes such as 'Rubidoux' were clearly more tolerant to water deficit than others such as 'Pomeroy'. Interestingly, the genotypes that were sensitive belonged to one genetic group and the less tolerant ones belonged to the other group. Therefore, our results suggest that among the Poncirus genus, it is possible to select genotypes as parent in breeding programs, which are better tolerant to water deficit.","[Ben Yahmed, Jihene; Ollitrault, Patrick; Morillon, Raphael] Ctr Cooperat Int Rech Agron Dev CIRAD, UMR AGAP, Montpellier, France; [Costantino, Gilles; Luro, Francois] INRA, Ctr INRA Corse, UR GEQA, San Giuliano, France; [Ben Mimoun, Mehdi] Inst Natl Agron Tunisie, Tunis Mahrajene, Tunisia; [Ben Yahmed, Jihene; Talon, Manuel; Morillon, Raphael] Inst Valenciano Invest Agr, Ctr Genom, Valencia, Spain",Universite de Montpellier; CIRAD; INRAE; Universite de Carthage; Instituto Valenciano de Investigaciones Agrarias (IVIA),"Luro, F (通讯作者)，INRA, Ctr INRA Corse, UR GEQA, San Giuliano, France.",luro@corse.inra.fr,"Ollitrault, Patrick/HLQ-0557-2023; Talon, Manuel/C-8540-2014; Yahmed, Jihène Ben/AAA-5623-2020; Mimoun, Mehdi Ben/AAI-9156-2020","Talon, Manuel/0000-0003-4291-9333; Yahmed, Jihène Ben/0000-0002-2910-6947; Mimoun, Mehdi Ben/0000-0002-3379-8229; Ollitrault, Patrick/0000-0002-9456-5517; Morillon, Raphael/0000-0001-6762-1715",,,,,12,0,0,0,4,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1379,1384,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600174,0

Citrus fruit and juices are rich in flavonoids (primarily flavonones), with the two more prominent being hesperidin in oranges and naringin in grapefruit. Citrus products are also rich in other potentially beneficial compounds such as carotenoids, limonoids and vitamin C. Most beneficial effects of citrus phytochemicals seem to be related to specific steps of the chronic inflammation process. Persistent inflammation is considered to be at the root of most chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, osteoporosis, dementia and some forms of cancer. The strongest clinical evidence to date has provided insight into both the physiological responses and mechanisms of response to citrus juice consumption in potentially reducing risk of development of cardiovascular disease, and to the role of citrus consumption on benefits to cognitive activities and function. However, it should be kept in mind that fruits and juices are not drugs, and that the beneficial effects will be mild and without the more dramatic effects expected with drug therapies.","[Cancalon, Paul F.; King, D.] Florida Dept Citrus, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",,"King, D (通讯作者)，Florida Dept Citrus, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",dking@citrus.state.fl.us,,,,,,,42,1,1,1,22,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,727,734,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.91,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600091,0

Over the years, models and tools to define effective innovation policies have been developed. Notwithstanding, there is a strong discrepancy among proposed theoretical frameworks, innovation policies and related regional performance. The research questions we attempt to answer are: i) what are critical masses of resources and competencies necessary to sustain the growth of RISs? ii) how much effective are current innovation policies; iii) what are the most effective policies to reassess their current pattern? Design/methodology/approach - To address the research questions we adopt an approach grounded on complexity science and we consider RISs as Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) (Squazzoni and Boero, 2002). Agent-Based Modeling is one of the most suited methodological approaches to analyze CASs (Heath et al, 2009) and it has been increasingly recognized as a useful tool to support policy-making in different fields and at different levels (OECD, 2009; Brenner and Werker, 2009). Therefore, according to this, we propose an agent-based computational laboratory to support policy-makers in assessing and defining the most adequate regional innovation policies. Originality/value - The proposed lab introduces the CAS approach in the analysis of RISs by integrating the key concepts of traditional perspectives on territorial innovation systems with new ones. Although the complexity has been recognized as a distinctive feature of territorial innovation systems, it has been poorly used to develop innovation policies to support the competitiveness of regions. Additionally, while the agent-based models proposed in the literature are used mainly with the aim of theory building and are poorly validated against reality, the CARIS lab has been built to be a simulation tool for policy advice (Brenner and Werker, 2009). Practical implications - Once fully developed, the CARIS laboratory should help researchers and practitioners to better investigate what are critical masses of resources and competencies necessary to sustain the growth of RISs, how much effective are current innovation policies and what are the most effective policies to reassess the current pattern. According to the European Commission indications, such topic is very relevant, in particular, for lagging Regions, which, despite conspicuous policy interventions, have been unable to develop significant innovation patterns. As the validation process will be completed, the computational laboratory could be used as a policy advice tool.","[Cannavacciuolo, Lorella; Ponsiglione, Cristina; Quinto, Ivana; Zollo, Giuseppe] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, I-80125 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II,"Quinto, I (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Ind Engn, 80 Piazzale Tecchio, I-80125 Naples, Italy.",,"Ponsiglione, Cristina/AFP-2237-2022; Cannavacciuolo, Lorella/AAC-1067-2021; Quinto, Ivana/AAO-3661-2020","Ponsiglione, Cristina/0000-0002-8953-5911; Cannavacciuolo, Lorella/0000-0001-7740-7595;",,,,,36,0,0,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,19,32,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200001,0

However, prepared potato products, such as crisps are gaining market share, so convenience is probably a stronger driver for changes in consumption than negative health claims associated with the low carb-high fat, Atkins or Montignac diets. Changing consumption patterns raise questions about the future of the fresh potato market and how a rather bulky product can be differentiated and re-marketed to beat increasing competition, not least from substitute products such as pasta and rice. This study undertook focus group interviews related to consumption and a quantitative consumer survey on attitudes to various product related attributes in a shopping situation. The focus group results indicated that convenience is one of the strongest drivers behind changing consumption patterns and revealed some significant choice-related factors. The survey results showed that sensory properties (taste and texture), origin and named varieties were among the more important attributes, indicating that these could be relevant marketing arguments. Overall, these results indicate that rather than focusing on bulk and low cost, a strategic option for the fresh potato industry could be to differentiate into convenience and underline consumers' positive associations with potatoes.","[Fernqvist, F.] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Fernqvist, F (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, S-90183 Umea, Sweden.",,"Fernqvist, Fredrik/B-8969-2015","Fernqvist, Fredrik/0000-0002-6534-3587",,,,,26,2,2,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-91-0,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1103.0,,,,,,125,131,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1103.19,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BF0DT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378599800019,0

With reindeer husbandry related a cultural traditions and ancestral activities of indigenous minorities of the North - the Evenks, Evens, Yukaghirs, Dolgan and the Chukchi people living on the territory of Yakutia. According to the Government Decree 2009 - the 21 districts in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) relates to the areas of traditional residence and traditional activities, including reindeer herding. As a result of adaptation of indigenous peoples of the North to the features of natural areas of Yakutia with an area of 3.1 million square kilometers, historically several areas of doing reindeer farming. Tundra type of reindeer herding was characterized by a large size of herds, reindeer were used for food and for sewing clothes. hi taiga type of reindeer herding historically reindeers used for transportation, herds were small, there was no long migrations, reindeer herding was combined with hunting and fishing. Development of reindeer husbandry requires large areas of land. The state policy of the USSR aimed at improving the lives of Northern peoples included the relocation of the nomadic population to a sedentary lifestyle, the creation of compact settlements, the establishment of large agricultural enterprises (kolkhozes and sovkhozes). This led to the forced migration of herders from remote nomads to the bigger cities. As a result, traditional nature use was forced to coexist with other forms of land use. In the 1990s, following the collapse of the state farm and collective-farm system with the advent of laws on indigenous peoples of the North and nomadic tribal community, many peoples return to the nomadic way of life. Currently the Northern tundra, mountain-tundra and mountain-taiga complexes which comprise 90,3% of the total area of Yakutia, live 59.2% of the indigenous peoples of the North from their total population in Yakutia. In this territories also there are 86.5% of all livestock deer Republic and 60,1% of the total number of nomadic communities. The southern part of the Republic, where he actively goes through the process of industrial development of the district is characterized by a significant number of nomadic tribal communities with a small area of reindeer pastures (about 10%) with a large value of reindeer capacity. On this territory in 2010 lived 13.0% of the indigenous peoples of the North from their total number in the Republic. The study of the processes occurring in the development of reindeer husbandry in some areas of Yakutia shows a strong correlation with socio-economic conditions of the indigenous peoples of the North, their culture and lifestyle from the development of reindeer herding. Resettlement of indigenous peoples of the North in Yakutia is characterized primarily by features of their placement and quality of reindeer pastures.","[Filippova, Viktoriia] Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Humanities Res & Indigenous Studies North, Yakutsk, Russia; [Savvinova, Antonina; Gnatyuk, Galina] MK Ammosov North Eastern Fed Univ, Fed State Autonomous Educ Inst Higher Profess Edu, Yakutsk, Russia",Institute for Humanities Research & Indigenous Studies of the North; Yakut Science Centre of Complex Medical Problems; Russian Academy of Sciences; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk,"Filippova, V (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Siberian Branch, Inst Humanities Res & Indigenous Studies North, Yakutsk, Russia.",,"Filippova, Viktoriia Viktorovna/M-6988-2016",,,,,,2,0,0,0,6,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,601,+,,,,,,3,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400076,0

Because mycological quality is important for industrial use of seeds of this plant, the goal of the study was to identify the most dominant fungi occurring on Dracocephalum moldavica L. seeds using molecular techniques. The method of molecular identification was based on rDNA-extraction and the subsequent amplification of the D2 large subunit. Two fungal strains (G435/14 and G443/14) were isolated from Dracocephalum moldavica L. seeds. The strains were identified as Fusarium sporotrichioides (G435/14) and Alternaria alternata (G443/14).

Using the contingency theoretical approach and addressing the current lack of empirical evidence on the issue, the study aimed to investigate the potential mediating role of project complexity in the impact of different types of knowledge assets on project success. The research was carried out in the context of information systems (IS) projects. Design/methodology/approach - The field survey was adopted as the most appropriate research method for this study because of its versatility, efficiency and generalisability. Usable data were obtained from 603 IS professionals across a variety of projects and were analysed through descriptive statistics. The collected data included participants' perceptions of: (1) project success as the ultimate target; (2) project team, customer and process representing human, relational and structural capital factors of the project success; and (3) project complexity as a potential mediating factor. Originality/value - The results of this study make two important contributions to research: (i) they fill the lack of empirical evidence; and (ii) provide valuable insights on how different project characteristics and knowledge assets influence project success. Specifically, external relational capital (project customer) was found to be more important than internal human and structural capital (project team and process) in moderately to highly complex projects. For simple projects, structural capital (project process) was more important than the other two types of knowledge assets (project team and customer). Such findings are consistent with the contingency theory propositions in knowledge management. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide useful guidelines for project managers on how to best organise and utilise their available knowledge assets in alignment with project complexity in order to enhance project success. Nevertheless, these implications need to be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the survey method and its application in a specific context (IS projects) and among specific subjects (IS professionals). Future research is recommended to address these limitations and extend current research to include both static (knowledge capital) and dynamic (knowledge practice) aspects of knowledge management in project management.","[Handzic, Meliha] Int Burch Univ, Dept Management, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg; [Durmic, Nermina] Int Burch Univ, Dept Informat Technol, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",,"Handzic, M (通讯作者)，Int Burch Univ, Dept Management, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg.",,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,199,208,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200016,0

The analysis of different types of data, such as social network data or users' behaviours, are very useful to delineate people customs and interests. Such information are necessary for the Recommender System, which is based on similarity and on a system that associates resources to users in a personalized way. Therefore, the analysis and processing of these data become tools to power the Recommender System, to suggest items closely related to users and to create social communities of people with similar interests. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is based on the study of literature and the analysis of possible scenarios applicable in the context of a Virtual Collective Intelligence Environment. Such virtual environment is based on the principle of Enterprise Social Software, which supports a series of actions and operations related to the management of information and knowledge. The approach based on Collective Intelligence and on social software aims specifically at the integration of explicit knowledge with the implicit one and the simultaneous extraction, derivation and determination of new knowledge, through techniques of mining, search, clustering, Recommender Systems, and so on. Originality/value - In VINCENTE Environment, the proposed Recommender System uses and analyses both social network data and people behaviours with the aim of suggesting items that are closely related to users and of creating social communities based on similar interests. The Recommender System adopts a similarity function, specifically designed to calculate both network and profile similarity between users by using social network data, taking into account all the connections between users. This approach brings many benefits, as the cold start problem prevention for new users. Moreover, by employing a fuzzy graph to establish a connection between different items, it is possible to recommend different resources, also favouring serendipitous discovery. Practical implications - This work can have different implications, such as: Applications of the Recommender System in scenarios in which services such as those ones related to the search of users in the community, to the logic of collaborative working or to the business are implemented. Applications of the Recommender System to virtual platforms with different purposes. Applications of the Recommender System to mobile app, aiming at advising users on relevant resources and information by predicting their interests and preferences on a specific item.","[Maruccia, Ylenia; Polimeno, Gloria] Dhitech Scarl High Technol Cluster, Vincente Project, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Solazzo, Gianluca; Lorenzo, Gianluca] Univ Salento, Ctr Interdipartimentale Cultura Innovat Impresa, Lecce, Italy; [Vitulano, Felice; Zambetti, Lorenzo] Exprivia Spa, Serv Line Manager Business Intelligence & Informa, I-70056 Molfetta, BA, Italy",University of Salento,"Maruccia, Y (通讯作者)，Dhitech Scarl High Technol Cluster, Vincente Project, Via Salvatore Trinchese Galleria Mazzini 61, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,"Solazzo, Gianluca/GZL-4946-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,0,1,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1465,1476,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200113,0

One of the critical underlying mechanisms for capability building identified in the literature is the role of knowledge integration, which operates within product innovation projects and contributes to dynamic capability development. Therefore, the main research question is how does the integration of knowledge across product innovation projects lead to the development of capability? Design/methodology/approach - We adopted a case-based approach and investigated the case of a successful firm that was able to sustain its performance through a series of product innovation projects. In particular this research focused on the role of KI and firm-level capability development over the course of four projects, during which the firm successfully managed the transformation of its product base and renewal of its competitive advantage. For this purpose an in-depth case study of capability development was undertaken at the Iran Khodro Company (IKCO), the key player in the Iranian auto industry transformation. Originality/value - This research revealed that along with changes at each level of product architecture design knowledge and design capability have been developed at the same level of product architecture, leading to capability development at that level. It can be argued that along the step by step maturation of radical innovation across the four case projects, architectural knowledge and capability have been developed at the case company, resulting in the gradual emergence of a modular product and capability architecture across different levels of product architecture. Such findings basically add to extensive emphasis in the literature on the interrelationship of the concept of modularity with knowledge management and capability development. Practical implications - Findings of this study indicate that firms manage their knowledge in accordance with the level of specialization in knowledge and capability. Furthermore, firms design appropriate knowledge integration mechanisms within and among functions in order dynamically align knowledge processes at different levels of the product architecture. Accordingly, the outcomes of this study may guide practitioners in managing their knowledge processes, through dynamically employing knowledge integration modes step-by-step and from the part level to the architectural level of product architecture across a sequence of product innovation projects to encourage learning and radical innovation.","[Mohannak, Kavoos; Kashan, Alireza Javanmardi] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT),"Mohannak, K (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Management, 2 George St, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",,,"Mohannak, Kavoos/0000-0002-0132-4440",,,,,17,0,0,1,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2319,2329,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200182,0

The goal was realized by performing a strict experiment. Celeriac (Diamant cultivar) was the test plant. A controlled-release fertilizer was used for fertilization; its NPK composition (%) was 1805-10+4Ca0+21\480. Moreover, conventional fertilizers of ammonium nitrate, granular triple superphosphate and potassium salt were used. Based on the results of the conducted experiments, indices that reflect the efficiency of nitrogen fertilization (agronomic effectiveness, productivity coefficient, and physiological effectiveness) were calculated. The yield of plants in the control treatment amounted to 32.1 Mg.ha(-1). The highest yield (49.73 Mg.ha(-1)) was obtained in the treatment with the addition of 400 kg of the slow-acting fertilizer and full doses of phosphorus and potassium. The most optimal values of the indices of fertilization effectiveness were obtained in the treatments where 400 and 500 kg.ha(-1) of the slow-acting fertilizer had been added. Calculated indices of fertilization efficiency indicate that, in relation to integrated methods of production with the use of conventional fertilizers, fertilization optimization with the use of slow-acting fertilizers may improve fertilization efficiency.","[Niemiec, Marcin] Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland; [Szelag-Sikora, Anna; Cupial, Michal] Agr Univ Krakow, Inst Agr Engn & Informat, PL-30149 Krakow, Poland",Agricultural University Krakow; Agricultural University Krakow,"Niemiec, M (通讯作者)，Agr Univ Krakow, Fac Agr & Econ, Al Mickiewicza 21, PL-31120 Krakow, Poland.",niemiecm@o2.pl,"Cupiał, Michał/N-5404-2019","Cupiał, Michał/0000-0002-1984-6861",,,,,23,16,16,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,AMSTERDAM,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2210-7843,,,AGRIC AGRIC SCI PROC,,,2015,7.0,,,,,,177,183,,10.1016/j.aaspro.2015.12.014,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE5QA,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373204000032,0

It theoretically allows the accumulation of all genes of the parents irrespective of their heterozygosity level and therefore the addition of complementary dominant traits. In the present work, protoplasts were isolated from callus of C. macrophylla and from leaves of 'Carrizo' citrange (C. sinensis x P. trifoliata). Chemical, electro-chemical and electric fusions were performed and ploidy level of the regenerated plants was evaluated by flow-cytometry. Five tetraploid plants, one pentaploid plant, one mixoploid (3x-6x) plant and one heptaploid plant were recovered. All these plants were analyzed with SSR markers, distributed in the nine chromosomes of citrus. Cytoplasmic genomes were also characterized using chloroplastic and mitochondrial markers. Results showed that mitochondrial genome was inherited from C. macrophylla in all plants while segregation was observed for chloroplastic genome. Nuclear genome analysis revealed the loss of parental alleles in most of the regenerated plants. In tetraploids, it affected mainly C. macrophylla alleles, while the alleles lost in pentaploid and heptaploid plants were mostly from P. trifoliata. Results suggest chromosome instability in this complex intergeneric combination with apparent non-random loss of chromosome fragments.

Traditional extensive value drivers, based mainly on structural capital, are gradually extended with more intensive utilization of relational and human-resources oriented alternatives also in hospitality industry. Although hotels are considered as labour intensive companies with higher proportion of low-skilled jobs, many of them have already recognized value-adding potential of organizational knowledge and intellectual capital. They implement these innovative features especially through the development of partnerships with loyal customers and systematic introduction of innovative managerial practices. Applying the elements of environmental management and sustainable development principles are characteristic trends in accommodation services. We can find them particularly in large hotel chains but accommodation facilities with small capacity are also interested in this green way. These accommodation facilities are aware that the importance of environmental protection is necessary; moreover they use this concept as a useful marketing tool for distinguishing from other accommodation facilities. The current approach to hotel management is mostly revenue-oriented, i.e. strives to generate profit from temporally and locationally specific combinations of internal, technical and social capabilities, including, e.g. market segmentation, pricing, capacity allocation, aligned incentives, organizational structure or vocational training. Accordingly, present managers maximize metrics like occupancy (OCC), average daily rate (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), revenue per available customer (RevPAC), gross operating profit per available room (GOPPAR) and many others. Consequently, our research was to identify perspective and feasible combinations of the existing revenue-driven methods with still more pervasive features of knowledge-based management and green management in hotel industry. We believe that the key path to success is in even closer, i.e. daily personal orientation on customers, specifically on their satisfaction in both functional and emotional dimensions. So far, hotel managers use mainly simple analytic and planning tools, which cannot cover the practical complexity of surrounding market and internal processes. In comparison with purely revenue-based principles, advanced managerial practices, considering also qualitative and human-related matters require additional viewpoints. We enhanced the hospitality domain with introduction of dynamic hypotheses - feasible explanations of temporal behaviour of complex structures. With the resultant interactive system dynamics (SD) model, we designed and tested several scenarios, comparing the purely revenue-oriented hotel management with its customers-oriented and organizational knowledge-supported enhancement.","[Scholz, Petr] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Travel & Tourism, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic; [Voracek, Jan] Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic",College of Polytechnics Jihlava; College of Polytechnics Jihlava,"Scholz, P (通讯作者)，Coll Polytech Jihlava, Dept Travel & Tourism, Tolsteho 16, Jihlava 58601, Czech Republic.",,"Scholz, Petr/O-1967-2019; Scholz, Petr/C-6032-2017","Scholz, Petr/0000-0002-2637-7119; Scholz, Petr/0000-0002-2637-7119",,,,,18,1,1,0,21,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1109,1121,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200085,0

We search when the distribution of age-specific fertility rates was normal, i.e. we use series of Jarque-Bera tests of normality for individual time series of age-specific fertility rates. Although it may seem that normality was not observed in the 70s of the last century - (due to significant pro-population arrangements of political regime), it is not true. The time series are not normal during first half of 80s only. Than the medians were analysed using principal components method, (which is implemented in demography package for the RStudio software). On the basis of four 20-years long time intervals from 1931-1950 to 1991-2010 we examine the changes in median fertility curves, which were significantly shifted to the right over the time. These results are important for subsequent analysis because for working with demographic data about fertility and constructing e.g. the fertility projection it is necessary to take into account the most recent data only, which are not significantly skewed and influenced by various factors.","[Simpach, Ondrej] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Simpach, O (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",ondrej.simpach@vse.cz,,,,,,,17,1,1,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1548,1557,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000148,0

We document bidirectional causality between FDI and stock market development indicators. For banking sector development indicators, the relationship is ambiguous and inconclusive. Care is therefore needed when analysing the relationship between FMD and FDI, as results may depend on whether the FMD variables used to evaluate causality are stock market or banking sector development indicators.","[Soumare, Issouf] Univ Laval, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Quebec City, PQ, Canada; [Tchana, Fulbert Tchana] World Bank, Macrofiscal Management Global Practice, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Laval University; The World Bank,"Soumaré, I (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Quebec City, PQ, Canada.",issouf.soumare@fsa.ulaval.ca; ftchanatchana@worldbank.org,,,Institut de Finance Mathematique of Montreal (IFM2); Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture (FQRSC); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Institut de Finance Mathematique of Montreal (IFM2); Fonds Quebecois de la Recherche sur la Societe et la Culture (FQRSC)(FQRNT); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This paper was partly finalized while Issouf Soumare was visiting the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University (Beijing, China).

The concentration of limonin was two times in peel than in juice sacs. With the maturity, limonin concentration in peel and sacs tended to decrease. In turn, it was increased in seeds of the seeded cultivar at the latter mature period which is much higher than in the juice sacs and peel, demonstrating that limonin is transferring into seeds. This is especially ture in 'Xuegan' that limonin in seeds was 6 and 12 times higher than respectively in peel and juice sacs in Dec. Generally, the limonin concentration in 'Xuegan' was higher than other two cultivars in Aug. to Sept., while it was rather in reverse in Oct. to Nov. At the late mature stage, the ranking of limonin in fresh juice sacs is as follows: 'Fengji' (0.025 mg.g(-1)) > 'Zhongyu #7' (0.015 mg.g(-1)) > 'Xuegan' (0.011 mg.g(-1)) which are higher than the threshold value of human-being accepted bitterness value of 0.006 mg.g(-1), requesting an attention in making juice product because of bitterness.","[Wu Houjiu; Tan Anqun; Wang Hua; Ma Yaqing; Sun Zhigao; Huang Xuegeng; Guo Li; Dou Huating] Chinese Natl Res Ctr Citrus Engn Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China",,"Dou, HT (通讯作者)，Chinese Natl Res Ctr Citrus Engn Technol, Chongqing, Peoples R China.",hdou33880@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,0,1,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1475,1482,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600187,0

We use the two-stage residual inclusion method to account for the endogeneity of peer drinking in nonlinear models. For our sample of high school students, we find that peer effects are statistically and economically significant regarding the choice to participate in drinking but are not significant for the frequency of drinking, including binge drinking. Regarding alcohol prices, even though we have good price variation in our sample, alcohol prices are not found to be significant. The results are important for policymakers who are considering policies to reduce underage drinking, as we conclude that no significant impact on underage drinking will result from low-tax states' increasing excise taxes on alcohol so they are similar to those of high-tax states. Policymakers may choose to focus instead on the influence of peers and changing the social norm behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The role of the ILO in microfinance and financial inclusion has often been overlooked, in contrast to the role played by the World Bank, G20 and like institutions. The ILO is significant here because it suggests a number of ambiguities and important political dynamics that have gone overlooked in previous critical discussions of microcredit, which have often focused on the politics of commercialisation, indebtedness and accumulation by dispossession. This article draws instead on Gramsci's concepts of subalternity and organic crisis to suggest that the politics of financial inclusion' in practice are often shaped as much by the political dynamics engendered by the erosion of postcolonial order as by the imperatives of accumulation. The argument is illustrated empirically by examining ILO activities on microinsurance and inclusive finance for workers' in West Africa, with an emphasis on Senegal.","[Bernards, Nick] McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada",McMaster University,"Bernards, N (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Hamilton, ON, Canada.",bernarna@mcmaster.ca,,"Bernards, Nick/0000-0003-4576-6555",SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship,SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),The author gratefully acknowledges the support provided by a SSHRC Canada Graduate Scholarship.,,60,17,18,0,33,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

In essence it involves a one-time payment T at the beginning of a period that covers all trips within that period. Carbajo (1988) applies the two-part tariff approach to find the optimal (welfare maximizing) value for T assuming a nil effect of T on the demand schedule of each and every individual (no income effect). Here we deal with an urban area where individual trips increase with income, but where car ownership correlated with income makes the public transport share diminish towards high income segments. A theoretical model is developed to find the optimal values (maximum social welfare with a budget constraint) for T and, simultaneously, for a single ticket P, considering the effect of T on available income as well as differences across individuals regarding car ownership. The model is applied using parameters associated with monthly travel in Santiago, Chile, where both income and car ownership are highly concentrated and correlated, and where travelcards do not exist. We obtain that the two richest segments choose to pay for the single ticket and the other eight choose to buy the travel card, increasing equity.

We first establish the theoretical foundation of our empirical model as a multisector version of Anderson and van Wincoop. Estimates from data aggregated at the province/state level yield border effects that increase slightly in the early 1990s, then decline after the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), but then increase significantly after 2001. Results based on three-digit NAICS level data reveal higher border effects in the early 1990s and substantial heterogeneity across industries. The results are robust to a variety of specifications and models, and they suggest that the security measures adopted in the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September 2001 had considerable adverse effects on US-Canada trade.","[Chen, Zhiqi] Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Rus, Horatiu A.; Sen, Anindya] Univ Waterloo, Dept Econ, Waterloo, ON, Canada",Carleton University; University of Waterloo,"Chen, ZQ (通讯作者)，Carleton Univ, Dept Econ, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,"Rus, Horatiu Alin/0000-0001-6101-6741",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We acknowledge assistance with data collection from Linda Jonker and Derrick Khoo.

In the present paper we employ genetic algorithms to estimate the parameters of GARCH(1,1) models, assuming a fixed computational time (measured in number of fitness function evaluations) that is variously allocated in number of generations, number of algorithm restarts and number of chromosomes in the population, in order to gain some indications about the impact of each of these factors on the estimates. Results from this simulation study show that if the main purpose is to reach a high quality solution with no time restrictions the algorithm should not be restarted and an average population size is recommended, while if the interest is focused on driving rapidly to a satisfactory solution then for moderate population sizes it is convenient to restart the algorithm, even if this means to have a small number of generations.","[Rizzo, Manuel; Battaglia, Francesco] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00100 Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Rizzo, M (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat, Piazzale Aldo Moro 5, I-00100 Rome, Italy.",manuel.rizzo@uniroma1.it; francesco.battaglia@uniroma1.it,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,6,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

These strategies, however, are not always aimed at obtaining a price premium, but are taken above all to ensure the maintenance of the reputation of the companies towards the most demanding customers and stabilize its market share.","[Malorgio, Giulio; Biondi, Beatrice] Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Perito, Maria Angela] Univ Teramo, UNITE, Fac Biosci & Agrofood & Environm Technol, Teramo, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Teramo,"Malorgio, G (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Agr & Food Sci, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",giulio.malorgio@unibo.it,,,,,,,23,5,5,0,8,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,SEP,2016,15.0,3.0,,,,,29,36,,,,,,8,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,EF2VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390184300004,0

However, few studies have examined the differences in the travel behaviors between holidays and weekdays. This paper compares the choice of travel mode and trip chain between holidays and weekdays tours using travel survey data from Beijing, China. Nested Logit (NL) models with alternative nesting structures are estimated to analyze the decision process of travelers. Results show that there are at least three differences between commuting-based tours on weekdays and non-commuting tours on holidays. First, the decision structures in weekday and holiday tours are opposite. In weekday tours people prefer to decide on trip chain pattern prior to choosing travel mode, whereas in holiday tours travel mode is chosen first. Second, holiday tours show stronger dependency on cars than weekday tours. Third, travelers on holidays are more sensitive to changes in tour time than to the changes in tour cost, while commuters on weekdays are more sensitive to tour cost. Findings are helpful for improving travel activity modeling and designing differential transportation system management strategies for weekdays and holidays. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

One topical case is employment protection for older workers. The effect of employment protection on the total number of jobs is ambiguous. The positive effect of lower job destruction is counteracted by the negative effect of lower job creation. This ambiguity carries over to the more specific case of age-related employment protection. Numerical analysis can be illuminating when countervailing effects produce an ambiguity. In this paper, I present a numerical model based on the theoretical set-up of Ch,ron et al. (Econ J 121:1477-1504, 2011). Simulations performed with the model highlight age-specific effects of general employment protection measures and effects of measures targeted at particular age-groups on workers outside the target group. Firing taxes and hiring subsidies have age-specific consequences because employment and unemployment rates vary over the lifecycle. Positive effects of employment protection for the target group can be outweighed by negative effects for other workers.","[Boeters, Stefan] Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, CPB, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Boeters, S (通讯作者)，Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, CPB, POB 80510, NL-2508 GM The Hague, Netherlands.",s.boeters@cpb.nl,,,,,,,27,0,0,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This core finding remains robust to alternative sample selection criteria including the division of the sample into high versus low market-to-book value firms, and also holds within the subset of organizations that are active in raising additional capital in the secondary markets.","[Cashman, George D.; Harrison, David M.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [Seiler, Michael J.] Coll William & Mary, Mason Sch Business, Williamsburg, VA USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University; William & Mary,"Harrison, DM (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",george.cashman@ttu.edu; david.m.harrison@ttu.edu; Michael.Seiler@mason.wm.edu,,"Seiler, Michael/0000-0001-7071-2474",,,,,53,10,10,3,64,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Building on recent empirical results, this paper examines export behaviour of Turkish manufacturing firms for the period of 1989-2010 from survival analysis perspective. This contributes to the existing empirical literature using Turkish data. Moreover, it provides additional new insight about the exporting behaviour of the firms since this is the first and unique application for the Turkish manufacturing sector. Using duration models, we found that export market entry and exit dynamics differ considerably for the Turkish manufacturing firms. Duration to become exporter is found to be shortening with size, productivity, financing and capital intensity. Domestic market profitability, on the other hand, is found to decrease export incentive which is characterized as risk-averse properties of the Turkish firms. Export market survival is found to depend mainly on size, productivity, external financing and quality production. In order to increase export market survival probability and duration, export starters have to invest for increasing their quality competition power.",,,,aslihan.atabek@tcmb.gov.tr,"DEMIRHAN, ASLIHAN ATABEK/N-7931-2018","ATABEK DEMIRHAN, ASLIHAN/0000-0003-3789-4530",,,,,30,3,3,0,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Pick-the-winners contests are those in which players pick the outcomes of selected future binary events with a prize going to the player with the most correct picks. In contrast to soliciting probability forecasts from experts (for which competition among the forecasters leads to exaggerated and less accurate probabilities), this paper shows that competition among players is to be encouraged because it improves the accuracy of the resulting crowd probability forecasts. This improvement comes because the competition not only discourages the overbetting of favorites that occurs if prizes are awarded based on absolute performance, but also helps mitigate the public knowledge bias that occurs if everyone reports truthfully. In addition to the theoretical arguments, the paper analyzes picks from 6 years of pick-the-winners contests involving hundreds of players and 1037 college lacrosse games to find that the crowd proportions outperformed two benchmark sets of probabilities.","[Pfeifer, Phillip E.] Darden Grad Business Sch, Business, POB 6550, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA",,"Pfeifer, PE (通讯作者)，Darden Grad Business Sch, Business, POB 6550, Charlottesville, VA 22906 USA.",pfeiferp@virginia.edu,,,,,,,19,3,3,1,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,AUG,2016,81.0,2.0,,,,,255,278,,10.1007/s11238-015-9533-9,0.0,,,24,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DV6PR,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383059600007,0

New information regarding future market conditions that affect the resource rent will consequently impact current supply. Bleaker demand prospects tend to accelerate resource extraction. We show, however, that it may slow down early extraction by producers with sufficiently large reserves and thus small resource rents. The reason is that the supply from such producers is driven more by current market considerations than concern about resource scarcity. As producers with relatively smaller reserves accelerate their supply in response to bleaker demand prospects, producers with sufficiently large reserves will reduce their current supply. The surge in shale gas production will reduce residual demand facing suppliers to the European gas market. We demonstrate the effects of this in a numerical model. Most gas producers accelerate their supply while Russia reduces its supply slightly and thus loses market shares even before the additional gas enters the market.","[Grimsrud, Kristine; Storrosten, Halvor B.] Stat Norway, Res Dept, Norwalk, CT USA; [Rosendahl, Knut Einar] Norwegian Univ Life Sci, Sch Business & Econ, Oslo, Norway; [Tsygankova, Marina] Thomson Reuters Point Carbon, Oslo, Norway",Norwegian University of Life Sciences,"Storrosten, HB (通讯作者)，Postboks 8131 Dep, N-0033 Oslo, Norway.",hbs@ssb.no,"Grimsrud, Kristine Malmkvist/G-5582-2019","Grimsrud, Kristine Malmkvist/0000-0002-6580-1031",Petrosam programme of the Research Council of Norway,Petrosam programme of the Research Council of Norway,We are grateful to Torbjorn Haegeland and two anonymous reviewers for valuable comments to an earlier draft.

We use an unusually rich data set obtained from a housing market intermediary with franchisers throughout the majority of the Spanish provinces. We observe that the income tax credit increased riskier borrowing during the housing boom years. Increasing by one percentage point the ratio of the present value of the stream of explicit tax savings to the price of the property, the mortgage amount granted increases by 1.6 %, whereas it causes a 2 % decrease in the term. This in turn, implies that the time discount factor increased in our sample by about 0.7-1.1 percentage points causing individuals to borrow riskier amounts of mortgage for shorter terms. This observation has important policy implications for governments wishing to foster real estate markets growth.","[Maria Raya, Josep; Kucel, Aleksander] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Super Ciencies Socials & Empresa TecnoCamp, C Ernest Llucn 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University,"Raya, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Pompeu Fabra, Escola Super Ciencies Socials & Empresa TecnoCamp, C Ernest Llucn 32, Barcelona 08302, Spain.",josep.raya@upf.edu; akucel@tecnocampus.cat,"Raya, Josep Maria/AAR-7073-2020; Kucel, Aleksander/D-1646-2018","Raya, Josep Maria/0000-0002-2885-234X; Kucel, Aleksander/0000-0001-6597-8286",,,,,43,2,2,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The majority of data gathered thus far is taken from studies that sample members of the general population and not actual adopters of the vehicles. This paper presents findings from a study involving 340 adopters of battery electric vehicles. The data is used to corroborate some existing assumptions made about early adopters. The contribution of this paper, however, is the distinction between two groups of adopters. These are high-end adopters and low-end adopters. It is found that each group has a different socio-economic profile and there are also some psychographic differences. Further they have different opinions of their vehicles with high-end adopters viewing their vehicles more preferentially. The future purchase intentions of each group are explored and it is found that high-end adopters are more likely to continue with ownership of battery electric vehicles in subsequent purchases. Finally reasons for this are explored by comparing each adopter group's opinions of their vehicles to their future purchase intentions. From this is it suggested that time to refuel and range for low-end battery electric vehicles should be improved in order to increase chances of drivers continuing with BEV ownership.

Relatively high production costs, unregulated use of chemicals and the absence of extension services can be considered the most important in addition to groundwater pollution, high-level migration towards cities, lack of economic policy for internal and external market, and finally the inability of the government to finance the sector. In this context, organic farming might be considered as a possible alternative to the current crisis of the sector; and could be a solution to many of the abovementioned problems. In an attempt to thoroughly understand why Lebanese farmers do not apply the organic methods of production, this paper illustrates the results of a study on farmers' motivations for adopting either the organic or the conventional fanning practices. In order to carry out the research, the means-end approach (Reynolds and Gutman, 1988) has been applied. The analysis methodology traditionally used for consumer analysis has been modified and adapted to investigate the cognitive structures (objective networks) of 35 Lebanese farmers. The results help understand the reasons determining the choice of the type of agriculture to adopt and underlie the diversity of the motivations between organic and conventional farmers.","[Naspetti, Simona] Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy; [Bteich, Marie Reine; Pugliese, Patrizia] CIHEAM Bari, Mediterranean Agron Inst, Bari, Italy; [Salame, Nadine] UN, Dept Peacekeeping Operat, New York, NY USA",Marche Polytechnic University; CIHEAM; CIHEAM BARI,"Naspetti, S (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Ancona, Italy.",simona@agrecon.univpm.it,"Naspetti, Simona/C-1143-2013","Naspetti, Simona/0000-0003-0778-2386",,,,,46,9,10,0,20,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,2611-1128,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2016,15.0,2.0,,,,,70,80,,,,,,11,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,DS1TQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380384000009,0

Our results confirm the findings of different authors that AIC and AICc favor nonlinear over linear models, whereas weighted versions of WIC and all versions of SIC are able to successfully distinguish linear and nonlinear models. However, the discrimination between different nonlinear model classes is more difficult. Nevertheless, the lag order selection is reliable.

The results show that there is a remarkable level of health inequality, with significant rates of poverty (11.64 %) and richness (22.64 %).

Kenya's infant mortality rate fell by 7.6 percent per year between 2003 and 2008, the fastest rate of decline among the 20 countries in the region for which recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data are available. The average rate of decline across all 20 countries was 3.6 percent per year. Among the possible causes of the observed decline in Kenya is a large-scale campaign to distribute insecticide-treated bednets (ITN) which started in 2004. A Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition using DHS data shows that the increased ownership of bednets in endemic malaria zones explains 79 percent of the decline in infant mortality. Although the Oaxaca-Blinder method cannot identify causal effects, given the wide evidence basis showing that ITN usage can reduce malaria prevalence and the huge surge in ITN ownership in Kenya, it is likely that the decomposition results reflect at least in part a causal effect. The widespread ownership of ITNs in areas of Kenya where malaria is rare suggests that better targeting of ITN provision could improve the cost-effectiveness of such programs.

On the other hand, the shadow economy can corrode the regime's power by diminishing its control over society, encouraging scepticism about collective ideologies, and providing networks and material that can be used for opposition to the state. This article analyses these tensions in the DPRK, by drawing on 35 semi-structured interviews with North Korean defectors.","[Dukalskis, Alexander] Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg,G310, Dublin 4, Ireland",University College Dublin,"Dukalskis, A (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Dublin, Sch Polit & Int Relat, Newman Bldg,G310, Dublin 4, Ireland.",alexander.dukalskis@ucd.ie,,"Dukalskis, Alexander/0000-0002-4477-7837",University of Notre Dame; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts; Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies,University of Notre Dame; Kellogg Institute for International Studies; Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts; Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies,"This research is part of a project that received generous financial support from three institutes at the University of Notre Dame: the Kellogg Institute for International Studies; the Institute for Scholarship in the Liberal Arts; and the Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies.

SP models have advantages over RP models, requiring less data and avoiding multicollinearity problems which often confound RP analysis. However, the advantage to joint RP-SP model is that theatre-goers choices are anchored to real behaviour. The RP-SP model reveals the most important determinant of choice and willingness to pay (WTP) to be the type of show. The Royal Shakespeare Company strongly influenced choice and WTP. Reviews of productions by theatre critics influenced choice. A mixed logit model revealed considerable heterogeneity in theatre-goer tastes for types of show and variation in taste for the attributes of shows by socioeconomic and demographic profile of theatre-goers.","[Grisolia, Jose M.] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Appl Econ, Las Palmas Gran Canaria 35017, GC, Spain; [Willis, Kenneth G.] Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria; Newcastle University - UK,"Willis, KG (通讯作者)，Newcastle Univ, Sch Architecture Planning & Landscape, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 7RU, Tyne & Wear, England.",Ken.Willis@ncl.ac.uk,,"Grisolia, Jose Maria/0000-0001-7147-8851",Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC); Arts Council England (ACE),Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)); Arts Council England (ACE)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Arts & Humanities Research Council (AHRC)),"This research was funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) and Arts Council England (ACE) under their Fellowship on the economic impact of arts and humanities.

Clusters encourage practitioners to view regional economies in terms of groupings of related firms and supporting infrastructure, and to link economic development with workforce development and business support strategies. On September 15-16, 2015 researchers and practitioners gathered in Detroit for the Inner City Economic Summit, to share knowledge and experiences regarding strategies that can help drive economic growth in inner cities. In this conference summary, we analyze the findings and discussions of that meeting for the special edition of the Economic Development Quarterly May 2016 publication. The research findings presented at the summit suggest that agglomeration economies can foster employment growth in inner cities. Evidence also suggests that human capital development and a supportive business ecosystem, including better access to financing for minority entrepreneurs in inner cities, are important ingredients for a cluster-centered policy framework. The discussions at the summit underscore that industry cluster-based development strategies can be an effective intervention for change for distressed communities when they link to effective workforce training and business development programs.","[Toussaint-Comeau, Maude] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Res Dept, Community Dev & Policy Studies Div, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Newberger, Robin] Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, Community Dev & Policy Studies Dept, Chicago, IL 60604 USA; [Augustine, Darline] Univ Stellenbosch, Sch Business, Cape Town, South Africa",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Chicago; Stellenbosch University,"Toussaint-Comeau, M (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Bank Chicago, 230 South LaSalle St, Chicago, IL 60604 USA.",maude.toussaint@chi.frb.org,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,25,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

For this paper, we develop new ordered probit models for evacuation using survey data collected in the hurricane-prone state of North Carolina in 2011 and 2012. Since all covariates in the models are available from the census or based on location, the new models can be applied to predict evacuation rates for any future hurricane. The out-of-sample predictive power of the new models are evaluated at the individual household level using cross validation, and the aggregated level using available data from Hurricane Irene (2011), Hurricane Isabel (2003) and Hurricane Floyd (1999). Model results are also compared with an existing participation rate model, and a logistic regression model available from the literature. Results at the individual household level suggests approximately 70% of households' evacuation behavior will be predicted correctly. Errors are evenly divided between false positives and false negatives, and with accuracy increasing to 100% as the percentage of people who actually evacuate goes to zero or all and decreasing to about 50% when the population is divided and about half of all households actually evacuate. Aggregate results suggest the new models compare favorably to the available ones, with average aggregate evacuation rate errors of five percentage points. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Health-compromising behaviors (smoking, heavy drinking, sugared soft drinks, sweets, fast food, and tanning) declined during the crisis, and all but sweets continued to decline during the recovery. Health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruit, fish oil, and vitamins/minerals and getting recommended sleep) followed more idiosyncratic paths. Overall, most behaviors reverted back to their pre-crisis levels or trends during the recovery, and these short-term deviations in trajectories were probably too short-lived in this recession to have major impacts on health or mortality. A notable exception is for binge drinking, which declined by 10% during the 2 crisis years, continued to fall (at a slower rate of 8%) during the 3 recovery years, and did not revert back to the upward pre-crisis trend during our observation period. These lingering effects, which directionally run counter to the pre-crisis upward trend in consumption and do not reflect price increases during the recovery period, suggest that alcohol is a potential pathway by which recessions improve health and/or reduce mortality.

Given the significance of EU competition policy for the European integration process, it is essential to disentangle the economic theories underlying EU competition law. There is abundant theoretical and empirical literature examining the influence of ordoliberalism on EC/EU competition policy. However, in recent years, ordoliberal principles appear to have been replaced by neoliberalism and efficiency-enhancing rationale in EU competition policy. This article puts forward the idea of clarifying whether the European Commission incorporates Chicago School theory into EU competition law provisions. The analysis is carried out on the basis of the European Commission's guidelines, notices and block exemption regulations. The analysis reveals that the Commission does, to a considerable extent, follow the Chicago School theory. The elements of the Chicago School theory hold strongest in vertical practices; they are somewhat weaker in horizontal practices and in unilateral exclusionary conduct.","[Bartalevich, Dzmitry] Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Bartalevich, D (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Porcelaenhaven 1, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",db.dbp@cbs.dk,,,European Research Council [ITEPE-312331],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"The research leading to this publication was funded by the European Research Council (ITEPE-312331).

We provide a new theoretical study of this model and an estimation for the maximal difference between manipulability indices in the IANC model and a basic model, the impartial culture (IC). The asymptotic behavior of this difference is studied with the help of the impartial anonymous culture (IAC) model. It is shown that the difference between the IAC and IANC models tends to zero as the number of alternatives or the number of voters grows. These results hold for any other probabilistic measure that is anonymous and neutral. Finally, we calculate Nitzan-Kelly's index in the IANC model for four social choice rules and compare it with the IC model.","[Veselova, Yuliya] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Int Lab Decis Choice & Anal, Moscow, Russia; [Veselova, Yuliya] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Control Sci, Moscow, Russia","HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Russian Academy of Sciences; V.A.

The aim of the paper is to identify groups of factors which are common (or different) for both genders. The data used originate from the EU-SILC 2012 survey and the results are compared with figures from EUSILC 2008. This provides a possibility to analyze whether the economic crisis led to a shift in subjective perception of financial shortage of households. The dependence of perception of financial shortage on gender and chosen factors characterizing the household were modeled by means of logistic regression. The model including all respondents regardless of their gender shows that the odds of positive subjective perception generally grows in households with higher equalized incomes and lower housing expenditures, but also with a man of higher age as a head of household. The odds are further increased in the case of self-employed entrepreneurs ( with employees) and for households in intermediately inhabited areas. The odds are 1.6-times higher for households surveyed after the crisis (compared to the pre-crisis years).","[Bartosova, Jitka; Bina, Vladislav] Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jarosovska 1117, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic",,"Bartosová, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Exact Methods, Jarosovska 1117, Jindrichuv Hradec, Czech Republic.",bartosov@fm.vse.cz; bina@fm.vse.cz,"Bína, Vladislav/JAO-0614-2023; Bína, Vladislav/M-2056-2018","Bína, Vladislav/0000-0002-9480-9489",University of Economics in Prague [F6/34/2016],University of Economics in Prague,The research was supported by University of Economics in Prague under project F6/34/2016.,,14,1,1,0,0,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,1,10,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100001,0

Noticeably, during favorable weather conditions, such as sunny or windy hours, increasing supply of RES generation exerts a downward pressure to the formation of the equilibrium price in the market and at the same time forces an increase in line congestion. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether such RES increase has affected the exercise of market power in the Italian Power Exchange (IPEX), explicitly considering transmission line congestion. We employ our approach to construct the residual demand curve and to disentangle the measure of the unilateral market power from the congestion rent. We compute the zonal Lerner index during the period 2009 to 2013 for the main generators in the Italian day-ahead market and we analyze the correlation among market power, congestion and RES supply. In particular, we investigate whether RES development has affected congestion and firm's strategic behavior, empirically testing whether structural changes have occurred in market power or in congestion rent. Our results show that the exercise of market power has been considerably weakened during peak hours by the massive competition of RES, but it has been surprisingly reinforced in specific off-peak hours, in the absence of solar RES and in specific zones, where congestion yields market splitting. These findings support pro-competitive market regulation and reform strategies, and shed light on the impact of RES and congestion on market outcomes.","[Bigerna, Simona; Bollino, Carlo Andrea; Polinori, Paolo] Univ Perugia, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy",University of Perugia,"Polinori, P (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06123 Perugia, Italy.",paolo.polinori@unipg.it,"Polinori, Paolo/K-1281-2019","Polinori, Paolo/0000-0003-3477-965X; Bollino, Carlo Andrea/0000-0002-7751-7089",,,,,27,24,24,2,6,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,123,144,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.ppol,0.0,,,22,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600010,0

We utilize a readily available data set of transaction rents in the Chicago metropolitan area to investigate the determinants of industrial property rents. Among the factors considered are proximity to transportation infrastructure, characteristics of the property, the term structure of lease agreements, and local attributes of the neighborhood. Empirical results suggest property, lease, and local demographics play important roles in determining rents. Despite the fact that industrial property tends to locate very close to rail lines and interstate highways, transportation infrastructure has much less influence. There is evidence that there is an upward sloping lease term structure premium and that the premium varies over time. The model is also used to develop a constant quality rent index for the Chicago commercial property market. Compared to average rents and asking rents, the estimated constant quality index shows a smaller run up in rents from 2003 through 2008 and a larger drop off in rents through the end of 2011.

However, due to their asymptotic behaviour, the estimation of Hurst exponent is often biased when the sample is too short. The novel approach is based on the construction of fractional Brownian bridge and thanks to its statistical properties and artificial extension to infinite length, it can be used for short time series investigation and resulting estimate was proven not to be burdened by bias. At first, the input signal is split into short stationary segments and the optimal interval length can be obtained via multiple statistical testing. Subsequently, the estimation of the Hurst exponent and its standard deviation is performed on the interval level. The methodology is applied to the stock market indices and based on the Hurst exponent variability in time, the decision about its predictability can be made. As a referential technique, the revisited zero-crossing method is presented and its performance is discussed in the context of obtained results.","[Dlask, Martin] Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Technical University Prague,"Dlask, M (通讯作者)，Czech Tech Univ, Fac Nucl Sci & Phys Engn, Trojanova 13, Prague, Czech Republic.",dlaskma1@fjfi.cvut.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,2,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,149,154,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500026,0

Croatia is also one of the countries in which franchising in not legally regulated by specific franchising law or any laws at all.

We apply compound real options methodology to evaluate the investment in a virtual power plant platform and distributed energy resource (DER) assets in view of volatile electricity market prices and an uncertain future electricity market design. The analysis reveals two aspects of policy regime risks: a policy content effect relating to actual market dynamics resulting from a (new) policy regime, and a policy process effect relating to (uncertainty about) the speed and probability of a regime change. The paper underlines the importance of predictable policymaking to stimulate risky investment. It further details the need to account for technology-specific investment responses to different policy regimes and risks, caused by different degrees of market versus subsidy exposure and differences between platform versus non-platform technologies.","[Garnier, Ernesto] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany; [Madlener, Reinhard] Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Inst Future Energy Consumer Needs & Behav FCN, Sch Business & Econ, EON Res Ctr, Mathieustr 10, D-52074 Aachen, Germany",RWTH Aachen University; RWTH Aachen University,"Garnier, E (通讯作者)，Rhein Westfal TH Aachen, Templergraben 55, D-52056 Aachen, Germany.",garnier@rwth-aachen.de; RMadlener@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de,,,,,,,27,7,7,1,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,145,160,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.egar,0.0,,,16,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600011,0

Thus, the content of polyphenols could be used as indicator for the quality of tea. Here, the development of low-cost, portable and disposable sensor for determination of green tea quality is described. The sensor was based on immobilization of sodium metaperiodate (NaIO4) in paper as a test strip. NaIO4 was coupled with 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazone (MBTH) as coloring agent. The polyphenols sensor has response time 9 minutes and a linear range at 25-300 ppm, with a detection limit 10.2 ppm toward catechin. The reproducibility of sensor was 0.628% with life time within 20 days when stored at 4 degrees C. The total polyphenol content in green tea beverages were determined by the sensor, and the results were in agreement with the Folin Ciocalteu assay. The developed sensor can be used as a tool for determination total polyphenol content in tea samples. (C) 2016 The Authors.

These fundamentals structures consisting of rules and norms-in other words, institutions-structure the transactions forming the basis for the study of economics. Thus we consider economics as consisting of an instituted system: in Polanyi's terms, as an institutional process. However, in order to be able to speak about features characterising an institutional process, it is necessary to refer to the term that encompasses all these features: we shall do so by referring to their embeddedness. This conception can be applied to studying the market as a comprehensive and complex structure that is formed according to the following conditions: 1) the existence of actors carrying out mutual activities and forming multilateral links; 2) the embeddedness of actors' interrelations within diverse areas (e.g. cultural, cognitive, social etc.). In other words, the market emerges from a network of embedded actions. The paper attempts to establish a theoretical framework for investigation of the phenomenon of the market and to lay the foundation for apprehending the market paradigm within a network approach.","[Kazakova, Daria] Ural Fed Univ, Lenina St,13b, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Kazakova, Daria] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch Russia, Moskovskaya St 29, Ekaterinburg, Russia",Ural Federal University; Russian Academy of Sciences,"Kazakova, D (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Lenina St,13b, Ekaterinburg, Russia.;Kazakova, D (通讯作者)，Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch Russia, Moskovskaya St 29, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",Mal-ba@mail.ru,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,821,830,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100081,0

The results of the research and the proposed recommendations can be used as a basis for establishing a system of migrants' labor adaptation not only in Russia, but also in other regions of the world where there is a high proportion of the labour migrants.","[Lysenko, Elena] Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia",Ural Federal University,"Lysenko, E (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, 19 Mira St, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia.",e.v.lysenko@urfu.ru,"Lysenko, Elena/AAJ-2867-2020",,,,,,11,3,3,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1099,1108,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100109,0

The golden standard typically is the behavior of learning dynamics in potential games, where many evolutionary dynamics, e.g., replicator dynamics, are known to converge to sets of equilibria. Even in such classic settings many questions remain unanswered. We examine issues such as: - Point-wise convergence: Does the system always equilibrate, even in the presence of continuums of equilibria? - Computing regions of attraction: Given point-wise convergence can we compute the region of asymptotic stability of each equilibrium (e.g., estimate its volume, geometry)? - System invariants: Invariant functions remain constant along every system trajectory. This notion is orthogonal to the game theoretic concept of a potential function, which always strictly increases/decreases along system trajectories. Do dynamics in potential games exhibit invariant functions? If so, how many? How do these functions look like? Based on these geometric characterizations, we propose a novel quantitative framework for analyzing the efficiency of potential games with many equilibria. The predictions of different equilibria are weighted by their probability to arise under evolutionary dynamics given uniformly random initial conditions. This average case analysis is shown to offer novel insights in classic game theoretic challenges, including quantifying the risk dominance in stag-hunt games and allowing for more nuanced performance analysis in networked coordination and congestion games with large gaps between price of stability and price of anarchy.","[Panageas, Ioannis] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Piliouras, Georgios] Singapore Univ Technol & Design, Singapore, Singapore",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Singapore University of Technology & Design,"Panageas, I (通讯作者)，Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",ioannis@gatech.edu; georgios@sutd.edu.sg,,,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr [1415498] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Division of Computing and Communication Foundations; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)),,,35,13,14,0,2,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,703,720,,10.1145/2940716.2940784,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,"Bronze, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300062,0

Solar based power generation will play an important role in future sustainable energy mixes due to its high reliability, yield predictability and capacity for electricity production during peak demand when the electricity price is usually high. But nowadays the economic viability of these technologies depends on the subsidies usually granted, mainly by public authorities, and in a minor way by electricity producers. The article evaluates the potential of solar energy based technologies for viable electricity generation, focusing on Photovoltaics (PV) and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems. The evaluation was not only focused on EU but also covered global markets, assessing the necessary barriers and thresholds preventing or boosting these technologies to reach grid parity. The observed rapid growth in deployment of the studied technologies (especially PV) in recent years is largely policy-driven and whether this trend will be sustainable depends on whether governments will continue to expand financial incentives and policy mandates, as well as address regulatory and market barriers.","[Papaefthimiou, Spiros] Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania 73100, Greece; [Souliotis, Manolis] Univ Western Macedonia, Dept Mech Engn, Kozani 50100, Greece; [Andriosopoulos, Kostas] ESCP Europe Business Sch, 527 Finchley Rd, London NW3 7BG, England",Technical University of Crete; University of Western Macedonia; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Papaefthimiou, S (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Crete, Sch Prod Engn & Management, Khania 73100, Greece.",spapaefthimiou@dpem.tuc.gr; msouliotis@uowm.gr; kandriosopoulos@escpeurope.eu,,,"Greek PPC (Public Power Corporation, DEI)","Greek PPC (Public Power Corporation, DEI)","Dr. Souliotis would like to acknowledge the Greek PPC (Public Power Corporation, DEI) for the financial support.",,35,3,4,1,11,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,263,276,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.spap,0.0,,,14,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600016,0

The proposed method allows determining the riskiness of investment projects for decision makers and public stakeholders, such as regional and federal authorities. Taking into account the specifics of the state's involvement, authors discussed a quantitative risk analysis of projects under public-private partnerships.

Pioneers of Islamic banking defined profit-and-loss sharing as the desirable alternative. As far modes involving fixed return, they were either not considered by the pioneers or were deemed only permissible but not desirable. But the practice of Islamic banking did not follow this 'idealist theory' and relied heavily on 'undesirable' contracts. Later on, pragmatic approach to Islamic banking questioned the priority associated with PLS business forms and justified the modeling of Islamic banking using even controversial contracts. The paper shows that these developments in Islamic banking theory were not meant to overcome the problems that hindered the practice of its first best theory but to accommodate Islamic banking transactions according to the needs of interest based system. This academic approach could not result in the alternative of the conventional system rather leads to integration within it. Thus, Islamic banking theorists adopted a strategy that is largely responsible for the current state of affairs in Islamic banking. To take industry out of it, a shift in its approach from accommodationist to transformationist strategy is required.","[Siddique, Muhammad Zahid; Iqbal, Mazhar] Quaid I Azam Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Siddique, Muhammad Zahid] NUST, S3H, Islamabad, Pakistan",Quaid I Azam University; National University of Sciences & Technology - Pakistan,"Siddique, MZ; Iqbal, M (通讯作者)，Quaid I Azam Univ, Islamabad, Pakistan.;Siddique, MZ (通讯作者)，NUST, S3H, Islamabad, Pakistan.",zahid.siddique@s3h.nust.edu.pk; mmiqbal@qau.edu.pk,,,,,,,106,5,5,0,7,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

I will argue that an adequate answer may be found if we understand: 1.) disciplines as institutions and, therefore, as dogmatic systems, where scholars' discourse often takes the form of a legitimizing discourse regarding the founding Reference of their own discipline; 2) that scholars speak in the name of that very foundation, with which they closely identify; 3) that the issue of the legitimacy of a discipline cannot easily be separated from the issue of identity and, therefore, of a scholar's legitimacy; 4) that the excommunication may arise not only when the founding Reference is absolutized, but also as a form of self-defense of a scholar's identity-legitimacy. To understand these claims I will re-examine three paradigmatic positions: the methodological, ontological and epistemological considerations put forward by (and the debates between) Pareto, Croce and Einaudi - with specific reference to the demarcation between philosophy, economics and value-judgments.","[Silvestri, Paolo] Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti De Martiis, Turin, Italy",University of Turin,"Silvestri, P (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Econ & Stat Cognetti De Martiis, Turin, Italy.",paolo.silvestri@unito.it,"Silvestri, Paolo/HPC-5882-2023","SILVESTRI, PAOLO/0000-0001-9864-213X",,,,,129,0,0,0,2,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"VIA SANTA BIBBIANA 28, PISA, I-56127, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Since the usual optimization criteria examined in the literature on Markov reward chains, such as a total discounted, total reward up to reaching some specific state (called transient models) or mean (average) reward optimality, may be quite insufficient to characterize the problem from the point of a decision maker. It seems that it may be preferable if not necessary to select more sophisticated criteria that also reflect variability-risk features of the problem. Perhaps the best known approaches stem from the classical work of Markowitz on mean variance selection rules, i.e. we optimize the weighted sum of average or total reward and its variance. In the article explicit formulae for calculating the variances for transient and average models are reported along with sketches of algorithmic procedures for finding policies guaranteeing minimal variance in the class of policies with a given transient or average reward. Application of the obtained results to financial models is indicated.","[Sladky, Karel] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Institute of Information Theory & Automation of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Sladky, K (通讯作者)，Czech Acad Sci, Inst Informat Theory & Automat, Vodarenskou Vezi 4, Prague 18208 8, Czech Republic.",sladky@utia.cas.cz,,,,,,,9,0,0,1,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,773,778,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500133,0

There are two basic possibilities how to enforce receivables when the debtor does not want or is not able to repay. The first one is an individual enforcing where on one side there is a affected creditor and on the other side there is a debtor. When the individual enforcing process is organised there are also other related entities as court enforcing agents, lawyers etc. The second type is a collective enforcing when the debtor has more creditors who are joined together in insolvency proceedings. This paper will compare data available for individual and collective enforcing. It will show if there are differences in the development of enforcing receivables. This time development will be compared with the country economic development, especially presented by the gross domestic product. The used methods will be based on a current state description and analysis using statistic methods as descriptive statistics and regression analysis.

Attention is given to the influence of the corruption on the economic environment and in particular possible impacts on public finance. The clean economic environment with low level of corruption is favourable for the economic performance and the public finance. The key hypothesis of the paper can be expressed this way: the competitiveness is high in countries with a clean economic environment even if there are high government expenditures and high taxes. Clean and transparent economic environment could be important as taxes and the volume of the government expenditures for public finance. The same argument applies to the competitiveness. The hypothesis is tested in the second part of the paper. The relationship between the level of the corruption and competitiveness as well as relationship between corruption and public finance is not possible unequivocally prove because CPI and CGI are based fully or partly on soft data.

Specifically, we present a nonlinear revenue function and consider enterprises' different risk preferences. We analyse collecting effort level, the degree of premium and penalty, minimum return rate, total profits and show how these change with the system parameters. Results show joint investment contract is more effective than shared-saving contract, considering information asymmetry and remanufacturer being the Stackelberg leader. Under the situation of information symmetry or using shared-saving contract, if the total system profitability keeps fixed, changes in profitability of two players have no effect on the system performance. But if remanufacturer has a stronger profitability than collector, the system performance would be better in the condition of adopting joint investment contract. The subsidy of the government can promote the development of remanufacturing industry; while effectively reduce the cost of disposing the waste products.","[Zhang, Ruxiu] Xiamen Univ Technol, Dept Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University of Technology,"Zhang, RX (通讯作者)，Xiamen Univ Technol, Dept Management, Xiamen, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,7,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-273-2,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,75.0,,,,,,33,37,,,,,,5,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BG7SD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391653700008,0

Such studies elucidate the conditions and consequences for workers in these jobs, while also generally accepting as unproblematic the basic distinctions between such categories of labour and market' work. Yet such distinctions should be a central point of interrogation. This article probes these distinctions by analysing the overlapping social and legal boundaries which fragment work into categories of market', nonmarket', informal' and underground' labour. Instead of reifying these categorizations, however, this analysis shows them to be socially constructed categories that mutually constitute one another. By systematizing their points of connection and departure, the boundary map presented in this article provides the analytical structure for new comparative research across seemingly dissimilar categories of work, which will extend scholarly understanding of the fragmentation of work and the relationship between work and inequality.","[Hatton, Erin] SUNY Buffalo, Sociol, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Buffalo,"Hatton, E (通讯作者)，SUNY Buffalo, Dept Sociol, 464 Pk Hall,North Campus, Buffalo, NY 14260 USA.",eehatton@buffalo.edu,,,,,,,27,19,20,0,9,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

This is surprising in the light of the rather extensive work involved and resources spent on the reporting process by states and UN human rights treaty bodies. This article attempts to fill the scholarly neglect by examining the effectiveness of this process in three countries, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Finland. It also explores some more general conceptual, theoretical and methodological issues with respect to the definition and measurement of effectiveness of international (human rights) standards at the domestic level. The empirical results, which are based on extensive document analysis as well as 175 interviews, are used to test two hypotheses based on domestic and transnational mobilization as well as reputational and legitimacy-based explanations. The article especially finds support for the liberalist mobilization thesis, while only limited support is found for reputational and legitimacy-based explanations, at least in established liberal democracies.","Radboud Univ Nijmegen, NL-6500 KK Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"Krommendijk, J (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Montessorilaan 10,Room 02-029,Postbus 9049, NL-6500 KK Nijmegen, Netherlands.",j.krommendijk@jur.ru.nl,,,,,,,80,45,50,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

Based on individual level data, this paper investigates the channels through which height influences income in China. Our first key finding is that for males (females) a 1 centimeter (cm) increase in height leads to a 0.5% (0.02%) increase in the probability that he (she) becomes a Communist Party member. Further, the hourly wage of Communist Party members is approximately 11% higher than non-members for males, while no difference in the hourly wage between Party members and non-members is observed for females. Therefore, a 1 cm increase in height leads to approximately a 0.06% increase in the hourly wage, which is observed only for males. We label this the height premium in earnings through the political channel. Second, controlling for the political channel of the height premium, a 1 cm increase in height leads to a 1.18% (1.04%) increase in the hourly wage for males (females). We label this the height premium through the market channel. Together, these results suggest that the height premium in earnings through the market channel is much larger than that through the political channel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper investigates the impact of trade openness on output volatility, and how this impact may be affected by the country's level of development. We use a panel dataset for 33 countries for the years of 1980 through 2009. A standard deviation of quarterly real GDP over a 5-year span is used as the dependent variable. Controlling for the country and period-specific effects, the main results are as follows: trade openness increases the output volatility.

The industrial carbon dioxide emissions and GDP per capita are as measures of the industrial pollution and the level of economic development. The nonlinear methods have much more flexibility than linear model because there is no linear hypothesis, which may lead to the problem of model misspecification. Thus, nonlinear methods can obtain more accurate and effective results. Our results show that the nonlinear relationship between the industrial carbon dioxide emissions and the level of economic development has an inverted-U shape, which is the pattern of CKC curves. Moreover, Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin have crossed the CKC inflection point and are now in developmental stage of environmental pollution reduced since 2005, 2006 and 2008 respectively. However, other areas are still in the earlier stage of environmental pollution, economic growth is accompanied by the tendency towards worsening environmental pollution.","[Chen, Linna] Fudan Univ, Sch Econ, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Linna] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Chen, Shiyi] Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China",Fudan University; University of Kansas; Fudan University,"Chen, SY (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, China Ctr Econ Studies, Fudan Dev Inst, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.",linnachen@ku.edu; shiyichen@fudan.edu.cn,"long, chen/JVM-8568-2024; wei, li/JWP-9848-2024",,"Chang Jiang Scholars Program of Education Ministry; National Social Science Foundation [14ZDB144, 12AZD047]; National Natural Science Foundation [71173048]; Shanghai Leading Talent Project; Fudan Zhuo-Shi Talent Plan",Chang Jiang Scholars Program of Education Ministry; National Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Shanghai Leading Talent Project; Fudan Zhuo-Shi Talent Plan,"Shiyi Chen acknowledges the support from Chang Jiang Scholars Program of Education Ministry, National Social Science Foundation (Major Program: 14ZDB144; Key Program: 12AZD047), National Natural Science Foundation (71173048), Shanghai Leading Talent Project and Fudan Zhuo-Shi Talent Plan.",,32,18,18,3,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

We investigate how institutional investor sentiment in the commercial real estate market affects institutional trading behavior in the REIT market and subsequently asset pricing. In particular, we test two alternative theories - flight to liquidity and style investing theory - to explain the sentiment-induced trading behavior of institutional investors in the REIT market for the pre-crisis (2002-2006), crisis (2007-2009) and post-crisis (2010-2012) period. We find that the applicability of either theory depends on economic conditions. In the pre-crisis period institutional investors switched capital in and out of REITs based on their sentiment in the private market (style investing). However, in the crisis period institutional investors switched capital from the illiquid private market to the more liquid REIT market (flight to liquidity). The flight to more liquid REITs continued into the post-crisis to a lesser extent and suggests that the financial crisis has changed institutional investment behavior. Our findings hold across different groups of REITs (e.g. high and low institutional ownership, S&P and non-S&P REITs) and property types. We also find that institutional real estate investor sentiment introduces a non-fundamental component into REIT pricing.","[Das, Prashant K.] Ecole Hoteliere Lausanne, CH-1000 Lausanne, Switzerland; [Freybote, Julia] Portland State Univ, Sch Business Adm, Portland, OR 97201 USA; [Marcato, Gianluca] Univ Reading, Henley Business Sch, Greenlands Henley Thames RG9 3AU, Oxon, England",Portland State University; University of Reading,"Freybote, J (通讯作者)，Portland State Univ, Sch Business Adm, 631 SW Harrison St, Portland, OR 97201 USA.",freybote@pdx.edu,"Freybote, Julia/HZL-8202-2023; Das, Prashant/H-8081-2019","Freybote, Julia/0000-0002-4564-3902; Das, Prashant/0000-0002-3628-7213; Marcato, Gianluca/0000-0002-6266-4676",,,,,71,42,44,4,62,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

To capture the long-run asymmetric price transmission mechanism, we develop an error correction model within a threshold cointegration and CGARCH errors framework. The empirical contribution of our paper specifies the cointegrating relation between OPEC price and non-OPEC prices and estimates how and to what extent the respective prices adjust to eliminate disequilibrium. The finding exhibits that the conditional volatility of variance has long-run memory feature and the shocks on the long-run component do not adjust quickly. The OPEC producers could not drive down (up) crude oil prices with equivalent speeds for all participants in the market. The slow adjustment of OPEC process of positive discrepancies to the long-run equilibrium indicates that OPEC does not prefer modest oil prices. While, the rapid adjustment of non-OPEC process signifies their preference of modest oil prices after oil price increases. These differences of speeds show evidence for competitive behaviors between OPEC and non-OPEC countries.","[Ghassan, Hassan Belkacem] Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Econ & Islamic Finance, Mecca 21955, Saudi Arabia; [Banerjee, Prashanta Kumar] Inst Bank Management, Dept Res Dev & Consultancy, Dhaka 1216, Bangladesh",Umm Al Qura University,"Ghassan, HB (通讯作者)，Umm Al Qura Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Econ & Islamic Finance, POB 715, Mecca 21955, Saudi Arabia.",hbghassan@uqu.edu.sa; banerjee1167@yahoo.com,"Ghassan, Hassan B./I-8589-2019","Ghassan, Hassan B./0000-0002-2007-4440",,,,,51,3,4,1,16,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This has raised threats to the stability of political regimes in two ways: (1) by enhancing the possibility of a financial crisis that could cause political turmoil; and (2) by easing access to foreign sources of financing for opposition political groups. I argue that state capitalism - defined as state-owned publicly listed corporations - is greater among one-party regimes as a way to address these dual threats. One-party regimes have both the motivation and a greater institutional capacity for addressing these threats in comparison to other regimes. Tests are conducted on 607 firms in 1996 and 856 firms in 2008 across seven East Asian economies, and are supplemented with case studies of Malaysia and South Korea. The evidence suggests that financial globalization is contributing to the rise of the state as a counter reaction.","Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Carney, RW (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia.",,,,,,,,94,17,17,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Alog-linear relationship between exports and productivity is the underlying workhorse models of trade as well. The same pattern is assumed to hold for domestic sales. How the intensity of R&D affects quality or preferences and productivity, and hence, exports and domestic sales, is less well established. This paper is devoted to estimating the relationship between productivity, R&D and sales to different markets in a flexible, nonparametric way which is embedded in a semiparametric estimation approach. Using French firm-level data, we can confirm a standard log-linear relationship for exports. However, it takes a rather non-linear functional form for domestic sales, suggesting that the data are generated by a potentially different class of models than the one considered traditionally.","[Egger, Peter H.; Erhardt, Katharina; Lassmann, Andrea] Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland; [Egger, Peter H.] CEPR, London, England; [Egger, Peter H.] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Egger, Peter H.] WIFO, Vienna, Austria",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; Ifo Institut,"Egger, PH (通讯作者)，Swiss Fed Inst Technol, KOF Swiss Econ Inst, Zurich, Switzerland.",,,"Erhardt, Katharina/0000-0001-9422-810X; Egger, Peter/0000-0002-0546-1207",,,,,15,1,1,0,11,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JUL,2015,38.0,7.0,,,SI,,1115,1129,,10.1111/twec.12223,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CM8YK,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357989600005,0

This article introduces a novel explanatory framework for perceptions research and applies this to popular perceptions of the EU and China in 19 Sub-Saharan African countries, shedding light on a neglected dimension of the 'traditional' versus 'emerging donors' debate. It finds, first, that China has quickly succeeded in becoming more well-known among African populations than the EU. Second, popular perceptions do not reflect the antagonism pervading the discourse on 'emerging donors', with both the EU and China enjoying broad-based popular support. Finally, preferences are a function primarily of individual experiences and outlooks, refuting earlier claims on the importance of national-level factors.","Univ Leuven, Leuven Int & European Studies LINES Inst, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium",KU Leuven,"Keuleers, F (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Leuven Int & European Studies LINES Inst, Parkstr 45,Box 3602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium.",floor.keuleers@soc.kuleuven.be,,,PhD Fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO),PhD Fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO)(FWO),The research for this article was made possible by a PhD Fellowship of the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO).

By differentiating mother, father, both parents, and none of parents exposed to famine, the analysis puts mother's and father's famine exposure in one unifying framework. Therefore, the methodology achieves identification without concern for multicollinearity and omitted variable bias found in the previous literature. The results imply that 'children with both parents born in the Great Famine are significantly shorter by 0.37 standard deviations (1.89 cm for boys and 1.78 cm for girls) compared to children with no parents born in the mass starvation. There are also gender and age differences relative to the intergenerational effects of the famine.

Several studies have proposed alternative statistical models, but to date, all such approaches assume that correlations remain constant over time. This paper argues that, regardless of the correlation patterns built into such statistical models, correlations might strengthen during times of financial turmoil. Consequently, mortgage-backed securities might have been appropriately diversified during  normal times, but less so during extreme market swings. Using monthly data on housing prices in four major U.S. cities, the main findings confirm that housing prices do, indeed, exhibit correlations that change over time, and more importantly, those correlations appear to strengthen in the midst of market turmoil.","Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",Western Kentucky University,"Zimmer, DM (通讯作者)，Western Kentucky Univ, Dept Econ, Grise Hall 426, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",david.zimmer@wku.edu,,,,,,,27,17,18,0,17,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

The effects of greening requirements were determined, based on the Italian FADN data, by looking at the change of total Gross Margin deriving from the introduction of crop diversification and Ecological Focus Areas requirements. These changes were assessed for 16 representative farms where these specialised systems prevail. The paper shows that greening requirement will probably have some significant negative effects, in terms of gross margin, especially for farms specialised in maize production and located in the plains. Data also indicates that for farms specialised in maize production, the green payments do not generally compensate the reduction of farm gross margin, while for farms specialised in durum wheat, the green payments would cover the reduction of farm gross margin caused by the introduction of the new environmental obligations.","[Cimino, Orlando; Henke, Roberto] INEA, I-00161 Rome, Italy; [Vanni, Francesco] INEA Toscana, INEA, I-50144 Florence, Italy",,"Vanni, F (通讯作者)，INEA Toscana, INEA, Via Benedetto Marcello 45, I-50144 Florence, Italy.",cimino@inea.it; henke@inea.it; vanni@inea.it,"Vanni, Francesco/R-6068-2018; Cimino, Orlando/AAP-3594-2021","Cimino, Orlando/0000-0001-9841-7223; Vanni, Francesco/0000-0003-4009-3013",,,,,26,22,22,1,13,BONONIA UNIV PRESS,BOLOGNA,"VIA UGO FOSCOLO, 7, BOLOGNA, 40123, ITALY",1594-5685,,,NEW MEDIT,New Medit,JUN,2015,14.0,2.0,,,,,22,31,,,,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Agriculture,CP9AF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360185400004,0

In this scenario, we apply the evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas (the Prisoner's dilemma and the Stag Hunt) to two levels of networks, playing network interaction game (scale-free networks) and imitating the strategies of dynamic learning networks by concentrating on the levels of dynamically overlapping levels in both networks. It was found that the higher level of dynamically overlap can promote the emergence of cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Stag Hunt. When networks overlap dynamically, it leads to cooperation in the Stag Hunt; when the networks do not overlap, cooperation will not occur in the Prisoner's dilemma. Specifically, if two kinds of networks in the real world truly dynamically overlap at least partially, in some sense, the self-organizing phenomenon arising out of the overlapping effect could solve coordination failure in the market without external enforcement mechanisms, which contradicts conventional intervention polices.","Univ Bremen, Dept Econ & Business Studies, D-28359 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Zhang, YL (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Dept Econ & Business Studies, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.",zhang.yanlong@hotmail.com,,,China Scholarship Council,China Scholarship Council(China Scholarship Council),"I am particularly grateful to Prof. Wolfram Elsner, leading scholar in evolutionary political economics, for his rigorous cultivation of critical thought and active support.

We test for such spillovers by analyzing how increases in insurer size resulting from the implementation of Medicare Part D affected drug prices negotiated in the non-Medicare commercial market. On average, Part D lowered prices for commercial enrollees by 3.7 percentage. The external commercial market savings amount to $1.5 billion per year, which, if passed to consumers, approximates the internal cost savings of newly insured subsidized beneficiaries. If retained by insurers, it corresponds to a greater than 9.25 percentage average increase in profitability on stand-alone drug insurance.","[Lakdawalla, Darius] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Lakdawalla, Darius; Yin, Wesley] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Yin, Wesley] Univ Calif, Oakland, CA USA",University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Lakdawalla, D (通讯作者)，Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",,"Lakdawalla, Darius/B-4409-2011","Lakdawalla, Darius/0000-0001-5934-8042",RWJ Foundation; National Institute on Aging,RWJ Foundation; National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We thank Caleb Alexander, Mike Chernew, David Cutler, Mark Duggan, Richard Frank, Kevin Lang, Adriana Lleras-Muney, Joseph Newhouse, David Meltzer, Dilip Mookherjee, Fiona Scott Morton, Jon Skinner, and seminar participants at Boston University, Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School, University of Illinois at Chicago, ASHE, NBER, and the Robert Wood Johnson Scholars in Health Policy annual meeting for helpful comments.

This article adopts a narrative identity work approach to explore how individuals may exert agency to make sense of and negotiate with the structuring features of such discourses. Older entrepreneurs are an interesting case through which to explore these processes because ageing is predominantly portrayed as a form of decline to be resisted or hidden and as inherently anti-enterprise. Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with two UK-based older entrepreneurs reveal how they engaged problematically with discourses around enterprise culture and ageing in constructing their identities. Sedimentation and innovation are proposed as valuable concepts for understanding how particular discourses become embedded in the understanding and identity work of individuals and how they seek to exert agency. The findings demonstrate the difficulties in innovative identity work for older entrepreneurs and this is discussed in terms of narrative resource poverty.","[Mallett, Oliver] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Management, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Wapshott, Robert] Univ Sheffield, Sch Management, Entrepreneurship, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Durham University; University of Sheffield,"Mallett, O (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Sch Business, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England.",oliver.mallett@durham.ac.uk,,"Mallett, Oliver/0000-0002-2327-3592; Wapshott, Robert/0000-0002-9462-0782",,,,,32,52,55,3,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Similarly, emerging scholarship finds that civil war inhibits processes of economic globalisation which are argued to produce economic growth. A case in point is international trade, which is reportedly stymied by intra-state war. In contrast, this article employs a critical theoretical framework which acknowledges the often violent tendencies of globalised capitalism. By analysing Colombia's palm oil industry, this article argues that civil war violence can facilitate international trade. In the case study which is presented, violence perpetrated by Colombia's public armed forces and right-wing paramilitaries has enabled the palm oil sector to enter and compete in the globalised economy. This includes processes of forced displacement, which have acquired land for palm oil cultivation, and violence directed at civil groups deemed inimical to the interests of the palm oil sector. By employing a micro-level approach, this article attempts to isolate violent trends related to palm oil cultivation in Meta, the largest African palm-growing region in Colombia. An attempt is therefore made to give an empirically informed account of how violence in Colombia's civil war is facilitating palm oil exports.","Univ Salford, Directorate Polit & Contemporary Hist, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England",University of Salford,"Maher, D (通讯作者)，Univ Salford, Directorate Polit & Contemporary Hist, Salford M5 4WT, Lancs, England.",d.j.maher@salford.ac.uk,,"Maher, David/0000-0002-0948-5476",,,,,147,38,47,1,59,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

While most qualitative studies of agricultural protectionism assume that it is exceptional or at least in some ways still different, this paper builds on an emerging quantitative literature that finds evidence of similarity with industrial protectionism. The paper enhances first-generation general statistical models of agricultural protectionism in the political science literature by considering political-institutional variables central to the industrial protectionism literature. The results of several cross-sectional time-series analyses suggest that the politics of agricultural producer support conform to general patterns of protectionism in other areas of industry.","Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA",Arizona State University; Arizona State University-Tempe,"Thies, CG (通讯作者)，Arizona State Univ, Sch Polit & Global Studies, Tempe, AZ 85281 USA.",,,"Thies, Cameron/0000-0002-9932-1394",,,,,60,2,2,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

This article explains how the transnational financial policy community can influence the content of financial governance by organizing itself via a club model. This agent-centered explanation advances the concept of a club to highlight the mechanisms through which actors operate, the expertise and skills valued by this community and the way in which principles for what constitutes appropriate financial governance are derived. Evidence is provided by an investigation of the Group of Thirty, part-think tank, part-advocacy group, a hybrid organization whose members are active in both the official and private sectors. Club characteristics can be seen in the group's high profile and prestigious membership, which self-presents a strong sense of honor. The article highlights the club as a location for those traditionally understood as financial elites. It emphasizes the collective attributes of the club, such as reputational consistency of membership, but also the importance of a track record of policy work for the enduring relevance of club arrangements in agenda-setting, consensus building and establishing mechanisms for private influence in financial governance. The study draws on 80+ interviews with key stakeholders from the community, including group members, conducted between 1998 and 2010.","[Tsingou, Eleni] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School,"Tsingou, E (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Business & Polit, Frederiksberg, Denmark.",,,"Tsingou, Eleni/0000-0002-2072-8897",,,,,94,119,124,1,40,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

The directive on services adopted by the Parliament and the Council by the end of 2006 aims at removing barriers to the free movement of service providers on the internal market. Previous studies quantified ex ante sizable effects of implementing the directive in its original form. This paper is a first attempt to evaluate ex post the trade effects induced by a directive - which excludes the country-of-origin principle - by performing a difference-in-difference-(in-differences) estimator on a sample of EU- and non-EU countries in the period 2004 to 10. We account for non-tariff trade barriers and the endogeneity of regional trade agreements and find that the service directive adds to a reallocation of business services trade within the EU. Accounting for the trade effect of past deregulations, the EU directive fosters a deeper integration of the new member states into the European service value-added-chain and promotes business service exports from third countries towards the EU significantly more than trade of country pairs in the control group. The reorientation of the EU-15 towards the new members is in turn associated with less intense intra-EU-10 businesses, while business trade between EU-15 members is not significantly affected.","Univ Jena, Jena, Germany",Friedrich Schiller University of Jena,"Dettmer, B (通讯作者)，Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.",,,,,,,,95,3,3,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,MAR,2015,38.0,3.0,,,,,445,478,,10.1111/twec.12149,0.0,,,34,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CD6DM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351179700003,0

We find that with the combined bundle of attributes offered by vehicles available today, gasoline vehicles continue in both countries to be most attractive to consumers, and American respondents have significantly lower relative willingness-to-pay for BEV technology than Chinese respondents. While U.S. and Chinese subsidies are similar, favoring vehicles with larger battery packs, differences in consumer preferences lead to different outcomes. Our results suggest that with or without each country's 2012-2013 subsidies, Chinese consumers are willing to adopt today's BEVs and mid-range PHEVs at similar rates relative to their respective gasoline counterparts, whereas American consumers prefer low-range PHEVs despite subsidies. This implies potential for earlier BEV adoption in China, given adequate supply. While there are clear national security benefits for adoption of BEVs in China, the local and global social impact is unclear: With higher electricity generation emissions in China, a transition to BEVs may reduce oil consumption at the expense of increased air pollution and/or greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, demand from China could increase global incentives for electric vehicle technology development with the potential to reduce emissions in countries where electricity generation is associated with lower emissions.

Using a panel of citations to economics and business journals, we show that the enormous effects found in previous studies were an artifact of their failure to control for article quality, disappearing once fixed effects are added as controls. The absence of aggregate effects masks heterogeneity across platforms: JSTOR has a uniquely large effect, boosting citations around 10%. We examine other sources of heterogeneity, including whether JSTOR disproportionately increases cites from developing countries or to long-tail articles. Our theoretical analysis informs the econometric specification and allows citation increases to be translated into welfare terms.","[McCabe, Mark J.] Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [McCabe, Mark J.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [McCabe, Mark J.] SKEMA Business Sch, Euralille, France; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Dartmouth Coll, Hanover, NH 03755 USA; [Snyder, Christopher M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Boston University; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; SKEMA Business School; Dartmouth College; National Bureau of Economic Research,"McCabe, MJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",,,,University of Goettingen; Andrew W.

This equivalence provides a decomposition result and a construction method, which is used to analyze concrete dual measures. Moreover, this paper aims to extend this characterization to the most general setting. Compared with Aumann and Serrano (2008), it, therefore, relaxes the axiom of positive homogeneity, and allows for risk-neutral and risk-seeking agents, as well as for all integrable gambles.","Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Deutsche Bank,"Schulze, K (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Dept Banking & Financial Supervis, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",klaas.schulze@arcor.de,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,FEB,2015,78.0,2.0,,,,,289,304,,10.1007/s11238-014-9421-8,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348124200008,0

Although intestinal worm infections can be treated using safe, low-cost drugs, some have challenged the view that mass school-based deworming should be a policy priority. We review well-identified research which both uses experimental or quasiexperimental methods to demonstrate causal relationships and adequately accounts for epidemiological externalities from deworming treatment, including studies of deworming campaigns in the Southern United States, Kenya, and Uganda. The existing evidence shows consistent positive impacts on school participation in the short run and on academic test scores, employment, and income in the long run, while suggesting that most parents will not pay for deworming treatment that is not fully subsidized. There is also evidence for a fiscal externality through higher future tax revenue, which may exceed the cost of the program. Our analysis suggests that the economic benefits of school-based deworming programs are likely to exceed their costs in places where worm infestations are endemic. This would likely be the case even if the benefits were only a fraction of estimates in the existing literature.","[Ahuja, Amrita] Douglas B Marshall Jr Family Fdn, Houston, TX 77002 USA; [Baird, Sarah] George Washington Univ, Dept Global Hlth, Global Hlth, Washington, DC 20052 USA; [Hicks, Joan Hamory] Univ Calif Berkeley, Ctr Effect Global Act, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Kremer, Michael] Harvard Univ, Dept Econ, Developing Societies, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Kremer, Michael; Miguel, Edward] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Miguel, Edward] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Environm & Resource Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Powers, Shawn] Adbul Latif Jameel Poverty Act Lab, Cambridge, MA USA",George Washington University; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Ahuja, A (通讯作者)，Douglas B Marshall Jr Family Fdn, Houston, TX 77002 USA.",amrita.b.ahuja@gmail.com; sbaird@gwu.edu; jrhamory@berkeley.edu; mkremer@fas.harvard.edu; emiguel@berkeley.edu; smpowers@mit.edu,,"Miguel, Edward/0000-0001-6927-709X",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (National Institutes of Health) [R01HD044475],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (National Institutes of Health)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The authors thank Felipe Gonzalez for research assistance and Jessica Harrison for helpful comments.

We aim also to conduct the comparative change point analysis of living standards trends between OECD average, selected countries and Israel. The common index of living standards is the Gross National Income (GNI). Thus, GNI adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP) per capita as well as the real GNI in local (national) currency converted into U.S. dollars (utilizing the Atlas Method) per capita were investigated for the considered countries over a period of last few decades. The change point analysis reveals a complex pattern of change. In particular, we found significant changes in short-term trends of living standards in most considered countries. The growth of living standards in considered countries has decreased last years in comparison with several previous years. However, we did not found significant changes in long-term trends of living standards.

Worldwide geographical structure of inbound tourist flows is typical for Moscow as well as for other global cities. Geographical diversification is a prerequisite and also a tool for sustainable tourism development in Moscow.

Actually, all this increase has been reached thanks to the promoted activity of museums being under direct control of Ministry of Culture of Russia: among 5,5 million of visitors federal museums account for about 2,5 million. -Specific feature of museum tourism modern stage is outrunning growth of individual museum visitors number (3,4 million) as compared to the group visitors (about 600 thousand). - The majority of museum service consumers are satisfied by the service quality, as long as they are motivated for museum revisit (according to All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center data). However, according to the same data 62% of Russian residents do not visit museums and exhibitions at all. It's remarkable that herewith 47% of respondents in 2010 and 51% in 2013 expressed their wish to visit museums and exhibitions more often. It indicates either museum service deficiency on the market, which is rather unlikely, or unsatisfactory museum service promotion (bad marketing). Nowadays museums adapted to the market and receiving large tourist flows widely use modern management technologies from resource audit and strategic planning to branding; actively introduce informational and communication technologies; employ animation and gaming technologies and, consequently, change the correlation between educational and entertainment component of visitor servicing in favor of the latter.","[Alexander, Fedulin; Tatiana, Krivosheeva; Olga, Vapnyarskaya] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cerkizovo, Russia",Russian State University of Tourism & Service,"Alexander, F (通讯作者)，Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Cerkizovo, Russia.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,12,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,171,178,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400022,0

The objective of this study was to develop a color chart for 'Satsuma' and 'Nova' mandarins and to analyze the relation between the external color instrumentally measured as CCI (100a/Lb) and the sensorial color evaluation. Fruits of both varieties were classified and selected to take pictures with different color indexes using the range from -24 to 7 for 'Satsuma' and from -21 to 10 for 'Nova'. Charts were developed with 25 and 100 cm(2) size photos for 'Satsuma' and 'Nova' respectively. The CCI was determined by the average of 4 measurements in the equatorial area of 25 fruits per variety using a colorimeter. Fruit previously photographed were evaluated by sensory panel of 12 judges. Correlation analysis was used to compare the relation. Besides the fruit previously photographed were evaluated by sensory panel of 12 judges between values indicated by the judges and the colorimeter measurements. The high correlation between CCI values and sensory evaluation (r=0.982 for 'Satsuma' and r=0.978 for 'Nova') indicated that these charts are useful and accurate for determining the external color in 'Satsuma' and 'Nova' mandarins.,"[Bello, Fernando; Vazquez, Daniel E.; Almiron, Nanci; Cocco, Mariangeles; Meier, Guillermo E.] Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Estn Expt Agr Concordia, Concordia, Argentina",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Bello, F (通讯作者)，Inst Nacl Tecnol Agr, Estn Expt Agr Concordia, Concordia, Argentina.",fbello@correo.inta.gov.ar,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1491,1496,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600189,0

Higher plants have distinct behaviours when faced with Fe chlorosis, and several mechanisms may be activated under Fe shortage. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of ferric-chelate reductase (FC-R), a key enzyme in Fe uptake, and to verify whether relationships with leaf chlorophyll contents could be established. Plants were grown in nutrient solutions without Fe (0 mu M Fe), with 1 mu M Fe, with 120 mu M Fe and with 120 mu M Fe plus CaCO3 (1 g L-1). Total leaf chlorophyll in young and mature leaves was determined using a calibration model based on a relationship between SPAD readings and concentration of chlorophyll (r(2)=0.95; P<0.01). The activity of FC-R was determined in roots apexes and several biomass parameters in shoots (number of leaves, height, dry and fresh weight) and roots (dry and fresh weight) were evaluated at the end of the experiment. The activity of FC-R increased in plants grown without iron (0 mu M Fe).

Using repeated observations on objectively measured data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we document that reduction in height is an important phenomenon among respondents aged 50 and over. On average, physical stature decline occurs at an annual rate of between 0.08% and 0.10% for males, and 0.12% and 0.14% for females which approximately translates into a 2-4 cm reduction in height over the life course. Since height is commonly used as a measure of long-run health, our results demonstrate that failing to take age-related height loss into account substantially overstates the health advantage of older birth cohorts relative to their younger counterparts. We also show that there is an absence of consistent predictors of physical stature decline at the individual level. However, we demonstrate how deteriorating health and reductions in height occur simultaneously. We document that declines in muscle mass and bone density are likely to be the mechanism through which these effects are operating. If this physical stature decline is determined by deteriorating health in adulthood, the coefficient on measured height when used as an input in a typical empirical health production function will be affected by reverse causality. While our analysis details the inherent difficulties associated with measuring height in older populations, we do not find that significant bias arises in typical empirical health production functions from the use of height which has not been adjusted for physical stature decline. Therefore, our results validate the use of height among the population aged over 50. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These firms are seeking sustainable competitive advantage through enhanced employee performance. However, this is tightly dependant on competence and day-to-day management practices of the entrepreneurs. The purpose of this paper is to explore management practices in entrepreneurial firms and to study how entrepreneurs' human capital developed over the years helps them improve business performance and growth. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws upon 15 interviews with entrepreneurs and their employees and subsequent data collected in case studies. The interview approach was adopted in order to gain data that would provide a clear picture of day to day practice and enable comparison between the views and attitude of the entrepreneurs and the perception and experience of the employees. Originality/value - Though it is widely believed that intangibles, such as company image, networking and the external environment have an important impact on company sustainability and competitive advantage (Sveiby, 2001; Roos et al., 2005), competence and attitude of entrepreneurs as well as their relationships with employees are a key factor affecting firm performance. Critical to these factors is the human capital of the entrepreneur him/herself which also impacts on the management on intangibles. Individuals accumulate human capital over their lifetime. Its comprising elements include not only formal knowledge, skills, competence and abilities, but tacit knowledge and experience gained over the years. Research findings confirm that entrepreneurs through their attitude, way of doing things and day-to-day practice, and thus their human capital, impact on firm performance and growth. Practical implications - The outcomes from this study can inform further research and contribute to improve guidelines on good entrepreneurial practices on strategy management.","Tech Univ Sofia, Dept Econ Ind Engn & Management, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria",Technical University Sofia,"Galabova, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Sofia, Dept Econ Ind Engn & Management, 8 Kliment Ohridski Blvd, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria.",,"Galabova, Lidia Petrova/F-9506-2014","Galabova, Lidia/0000-0002-7209-3109",,,,,28,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,132,142,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200010,0

HLB affects all cultivated citrus varieties and is extremely difficult to control. Genetic resistance to HLB is not present in commercial scion or rootstock cultivars. A possible mid-term solution to this problem is to shorten the grove rotation and time to profitability by adapting open hydroponics systems (OHS) or other similar evolving advanced citrus production systems (ACPS) to Florida conditions. These methods have been shown to bring new groves into production 2-3 years earlier than with standard practices. Such new citrus production systems that feature high density plantings being developed and adapted for Florida growing conditions will require improved tree-size controlling rootstocks that bear early and produce good yields of fruit with juice of high quality. We have been exploring somatic hybridization of complementary diploid rootstocks via protoplast fusion to generate allotetraploid rootstock candidates, and more recently we have been conducting rootstock breeding at the tetraploid level by crossing superior somatic hybrids to produce ` tetrazyg' rootstocks. Preliminary greenhouse and field testing suggests that selected allotetraploid rootstocks generally exhibit good soil adaptation, disease resistance, nursery and young tree growth, and also a strong tendency to reduce tree size. A major rootstock trial is underway that features high planting densities and a production system that mimics the principles of OHS, with a goal of identifying superior rootstocks for use in ACPS. This trial includes selected somatic hybrids, 'tetrazygs', diploid hybrids and commercial controls, all with mid-season processing sweet orange scions 'Valquarius' and 'Vernia'. We are observing significant rootstock effects on both yield and fruit quality, with good performance from several somatic hybrid and 'tetrazyg' rootstocks. We have also observed an unexpected reduced impact of HLB in the trial. Our working hypothesis is that there is a rootstock/nutrition interaction that is affecting HLB disease frequency and severity.","[Grosser, Jude W.; Barthe, Gary A.; Castle, Bill; Gmitter, Frederick G., Jr.; Lee, Orie] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Grosser, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, IFAS, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",,,,,,,,6,13,15,0,5,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,319,327,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.38,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600038,0

This lower CLBV incidence in symptomatic calamondin trees could be due to a low virus titer in this host or, alternatively, the bud union crease observed could be caused by a different pathogen or by the interaction with other biotic or abiotic factors.","[Guardo, Maria; Sorrentino, Guido; Caruso, Angelo] Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee CRA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA),"Guardo, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Ric Agrumicoltura & Colture Mediterranee CRA, Consiglio Ric & Sperimentaz Agr, Acireale, Italy.",maria.guardo@entecra.it,,,,,,,16,0,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,825,830,,,,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600103,0

Production of ligninolytic enzymes during fluoranthene degradation by Armillaria sp. F022 is related to an increase in biomass. Armillaria sp. F022 has been shown to degrade a 10 mg/L solution by 100% within 30 d. Fluoranthene removal decreases with an increase in fluoranthene concentrations. The highest cell weight of Armillaria sp. F022 was showed in the 10 mg/L of fluoranthene culture (>= 4,400 mg/L) after 30 d of incubation. Three fluoranthene metabolites were isolated from the culture medium and analyzed by a thin layer chromatography (TLC), UV visible absorption and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The oxidation of fluoranthene is initiated by deoxygenation at the C-2,3 and C-7,8 positions. Naphthalene-1,8-dicarboxylic acid, benzene-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, and phthalic acid were identified by GC-MS to be present in silylated forms. Two ligninoytic enzymes, namely, laccase and 1,2-dioxygenase, were revealed during the fluoranthene degradation. The results indicate the presence of complicated processes for the regulation of fluoranthene-degrading enzymes. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Despite rising growth, fertility decline, and rising wage and education levels, married women's labor force participation hovered around 18 percent. Analysis of five large cross-sectional micro surveys shows that a combination of supply and demand effects have contributed to this stagnation. The main supply side factors are rising household incomes and husband's education as well as the falling selectivity of highly educated women. On the demand side, the sectors that draw in female workers have expanded least, so that changes in the sectoral structure of employment alone would have actually led to declining participation rates.","[Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany; [Klasen, Stephan; Pieters, Janneke] IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Pieters, Janneke] Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",University of Gottingen; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Wageningen University & Research,"Pieters, J (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",sklasen@uni-goettingen.de; janneke.pieters@wur.nl,,,,,,,54,150,159,3,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0258-6770,1564-698X,,WORLD BANK ECON REV,World Bank Econ.

Its effect may be influenced by the concentration applied, the fruit physiological stage or the specific susceptibility of the cultivar to develop physiological disorders. However, the industry only applies this hormone to citrus fruit for degreening purposes and there is no information on the effect of ethylene on the quality of fruit harvested after color break and stored under commercial conditions to extend its postharvest life. We have examined the effect of treating mature 'Navelate' orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) for 4 days with 2 mu l/L ethylene at 90-95% relative humidity (RH) on the quality of fruits stored at 2 or 12 degrees C and 90-95% RH. Exposure to ethylene had little effect on increasing fruit color but considerably reduced the incidence of calyx abscission, of non-chilling peel pitting at 12 degrees C and of chilling injury after 40 days storage at 2 degrees C. Ethylene had no deleterious effect on fruit firmness, weight loss, calyx senescence or acidity and reduced soluble solids by only 4%. Furthermore, ethylene did not enhance off-flavor perception and increased the content of bioactive flavonoids in the pulp by about 18% in fruit stored for up to 40 days at 2 or 12 degrees C. Therefore, treating the fruits with 2 mu l/L ethylene may constitute a useful tool to extend postharvest life of mature citrus fruits since it reduces postharvest physiological disorders and has no negative effect on external or internal fruit quality.","[Lafuente, Maria T.; Alferez, Fernando; Romero, Paco] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, E-46010 Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Lafuente, MT (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",mtlafuente@iata.csic.es,"Romero, Paco/E-8865-2017; Alferez, Fernando/I-3992-2016; Lafuente, Maria/K-7944-2014","Romero, Paco/0000-0002-7811-0897; Lafuente, Maria/0000-0002-6987-1440",,,,,20,0,0,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1507,1513,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600191,0

The analysis makes use of an integrated choice and latent variable model (ICLV) which merges classic choice models with the structural equation approach (SEM) for latent variables. This hybrid model improves the explanatory power considerably compared with a conventional discrete choice model. The results suggest that charge complexity decreases the resistance in considering behavioural changes. Car drivers tend to avoid a travel option where the price is not known beforehand, a phenomenon known as ambiguity avoidance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In this perspective, many international surveys show that the economic contribution of copyright-based industries is becoming increasingly important. In this way the study aims to analyse the methodology used in a many surveys on the evaluation of economic contributions of copyright-based industries in the national economy. Finally, the research proposes a new methodology that will support the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the Italian copyright industries in terms of their value added to the country's Gross Domestic Product as well as their contribution to employment. The research question of this paper is the following: how is it possible to assess the impact of copyright-based industries in the Italian national economy? Design/methodology/approach - The research uses a multi-method approach based on a qualitative and quantitative investigation, with the aim of assessing the economic impact of copyright-based industries in Italy. On the first level we analyse the best international practice used for evaluation of the economic impact of intensive copyright industries. On the second level, using a quantitative method an attempt is made to measure the economic performance of intensive copyright industries with reference to Italy. The selected year for the survey is 2011. This study adopts WIPO's guidelines Wipo Guide on surveying the Economic Contribution of the Copyright-Based Industries and the Ernest & Young study entitled: 1er Panorama des Industries Culturelles et Creatives. Au Couer du Rayonnement et de la Competitivite de la France. The main source data is collected by statistic databases like Istat, Eurostat and United Nations Statistics Division. The industrial classification starts with the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) suggested in the WIPO Guide and, after the conversion, first in NACE and than in ATECO 2007, we identify the industries and their activities as relevant to copyright-based industries in Italy. Originality/value - This study aims to compare the classification and the methods used for determination of the economic impact of the intensive copyright industries. Moreover, this study attempts to propose an alternative method to assess the economic contribution of copyright-based industries in Italy. Practical implications - This study, presenting the value of the economic impact of this sector on Italian GDP, will make public opinion aware of the importance of this sector on the national economy.","[Manfredi, Simone; Ricci, Federica; Nappo, Fabio; Gilvari, Ida Samantha] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, I-03043 Cassino, Italy",University of Cassino,"Ricci, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Via St Angelo, I-03043 Cassino, Italy.",,"Nappo, Fabio/AAI-3589-2021; Manfredi, Simone/AAJ-1396-2021",,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,822,838,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200062,0

Sport is a powerful driving force behind individual actions and transformation and various social events and trends. Sport activities are very often a significant factor in one's personal growth and development and in finding one's place in the immediate environment, as well as in the pace and the direction in which a community or society is developing. By definition and level, sport can be classified as top or selective and mass or non-selective. From the economic standpoint, every type of sport stimulates the general level of consumption, as well as the production, while top sporting events directly boost all areas of economy, from the construction of sport facilities and the production of sport equipment, food and medications, to tourist and promotional activities. The impact of sport is reflected in cultural and political aspects of almost any society.","[Milanovic, Dragan; Custonja, Zrinko; Skegro, Dario] Univ Zagreb, Fac Kinesiol, Horvacanski Zavoj 15, Zagreb, Croatia","University of Zagreb; University of Zagreb, Faculty of Kinesiology","Milanovic, D (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Kinesiol, Horvacanski Zavoj 15, Zagreb, Croatia.",dragan.milanovic@kif.hr; Zrinko.custonja@kif.hr; dario.skegro@kif.hr,"Custonja, Zrinko/AAA-4062-2020; Custonja, Zrinko/ACS-4168-2022; Škegro, Dario/AAK-8320-2020",,,,,,11,0,1,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,603,611,,,,,,9,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100060,0

Six treatments were studied: C (control), S (30 mM NaCl), KR (30 mM NaCl+10 mM KNO3 applied to the root system), KL (30 mM NaCl+10 mM KNO3 applied to the leaves), CaR (30 mM NaCl+10 mM Ca(NO3) 2 applied to root system) and CaL (30 mM NaCl+10 mM Ca(NO3) 2 applied to the leaves). Although plant growth was unaffected by all the saline treatments, salt injury in the form of leaf burn was observed. Salinity also affected leaf gas exchange parameters, which decreased with the application of 30 mM NaCl. The potassium and calcium applications did not lead to increased photosynthesis rate. Neither the Ca nor the K treatment reduced the high Cl levels in the leaves, and leaf Na was only reduced by the CaR treatment. The calcium levels in leaves following the CaR treatment were higher than in C plants, whereas the CaL, KR and KL treatments led to lower Ca levels than in C plants. This was also the case with membrane stability, which increased with CaR but not with the foliar application of Ca or either of the K treatments. Cellular damage produced by salinity decreased with KL and both Ca treatments. These results suggest that, in general, the adverse effects of salinity on the nutritional and physiological response of C. macrophylla are not alleviated by the foliar treatments of Ca and K applied in this experiment.","[Navarro, Josefa M.; Andujar, Silvia; Rodriguez-Moran, Manuel] Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain",,"Navarro, JM (通讯作者)，Inst Murciano Invest & Desarrollo Agr & Alimentar, Dept Citricultura, Murcia, Spain.",josefam.navarro2@carm.es,"Navarro, Josefa M./S-1831-2019; Navarro, Josefa M/Q-6256-2016","Navarro, Josefa M./0000-0002-8811-4576; Navarro, Josefa M/0000-0002-8811-4576",,,,,40,0,0,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1749,1756,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.224,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600224,0
J,"Pardolesi, R",,,,"Pardolesi, Roberto",,,LAW AND ECONOMICS IN ITALY: SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT THE ACADEMIC AND JUDICIAL RECEPTION OF EAL,HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The origins and developments of law and economics (L&E) in Italy can be described as an uneasy but successful enterprise with some shadows, most of which regarding the future. The most telling proxy of the inroad of L&E is probably represented by judicial imprinting. Ranging from Constitutional Court to judges of peace, there is plenty of judgements whose holdings are based on the achievements, or at least appear to be sensitive to the hints, of the economic analysis of law, though with different weights and degrees of recognition. On the whole, however, the Italian judiciary not only did not refute the hurdle, but possibly tried to abide by the directives stemming from L&E work. In a sense, on this count, L&E has undoubtedly entered into the legal discourse (or, concededly, the legal parlance). A relevant part of the Italian trajectory has been drawn in what might be called the first scenario of L&E, where it carries out an exploratory activity, in a scientific environment which rejects the need to use any technicalities in economics. The second scenario is characterized by the surge of the economists, who bring along sophisticated analytical tools and hardly conceal a degree of intolerance towards unstructured, informal rationales. This paves the way towards a process of divergence, which would be at odds with the original interdisciplinary inspiration of L&E, while shutting the door to further developments. If, then, a third scenario is to come, the goal to be pursued should be all too obvious: positing economic analysis as a legal source, relevant to the making of the law and to its actual enforcement. This goal cannot be accomplished against (or despite) jurists.","[Pardolesi, Roberto] Univ Luiss G Carli, Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Pardolesi, R (通讯作者)，Univ Luiss G Carli, Rome, Italy.",rpardole@luiss.it,,,,,,,83,0,0,0,5,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Fruits from both varieties were subjected to prolonged water stress conditions inducing non-chilling peel pitting in the rind. Treatment with phospholipase inhibitors reduced the disorder in both varieties suggesting that phospholipid metabolism is involved in citrus peel quality. Expression of genes encoding PLA(2) and PLD was studied by real time RT-PCR during water stress and in response to ABA. Expression of CssPLA(2)alpha was dependant on ABA in fruit from both varieties, since ABA application restored expression in the mutant, showing for the first time the involvement of this hormone in the activation of PLA(2). CsPLD alpha expression increased with dehydration in mature-green fruit from 'Navelate' but not from 'Pinalate', and ABA did not counteract this effect. Together, results show that susceptibility to stem-end rind breakdown (SERB) and regulation of phospholipase gene expression varies with maturation and that ABA action is upstream phospholipase activation in response to water stress.","[Romero, Paco; Gandia, Monica; Alferez, Fernando] CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, E-46010 Valencia, Spain",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); Instituto de Agroquimica y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (IATA),"Alférez, F (通讯作者)，CSIC, Inst Agroquim & Tecnol Alimentos, Jaime Roig 11, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",alferez@iata.csic.es,"Gandía, Mónica/ABE-5929-2021; Gandía, Mónica/E-7808-2011; Romero, Paco/E-8865-2017; Alferez, Fernando/I-3992-2016","Gandía, Mónica/0000-0002-8663-0403; Romero, Paco/0000-0002-7811-0897;",,,,,13,0,0,0,8,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1515,1519,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600192,0

In an attempt to understand deviant behaviour which can potentially become a criminal offence, PLS-SEM opens up a valuable mean to analyse latent constructs are designed from a composite of indicators. At its basic, this is called a first-order variable. Using the first-order variable in a basic predictor-criterion research model illuminates in-depth structure on how each component of these variables affects each other. However, as an analysis moves to a more complex level, the first-order variable poses a great challenge to the researchers. This is especially true when the main focus of a study is to look at a general predisposition of a group of related first-order variables with the criterion.

In order to understand further this intelligent infrastructure, our contribution aims to investigate the Internet of Things by a revised conceptualization of the topic. The investigation has been carried out on a scientific contribution produced in the last twenty years for economic and corporate purpose, in order to comprehend and manage the new opportunities offered to economic activity from Internet of Things. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a qualitative approach with the inclusion of a single method approach. In this way, following an analysis of existing literature on the Internet of Things we have applied four keywords (Internet of Thing, Communication Internet, Energy Internet and Logistics Internet) in two databases (Google Scholar and Ebsco) to provide a range of scientific contributions to fill out the literature review. Research is developed according to the study of national and international literature. Originality/value - The Internet of Things will connect everything to everyone in a connected network made up of a Communications Internet, Logistics Internet and Energy Internet in a single integrated system. It has been estimated that in 2020 over 200 billion sensor devices will be connected, creating a market size that in 2025 will be between $2,7 trillion and $3 trillion per year. These devices promise efficiency, social and individual benefits through quantification and monitoring of previously immeasurable qualities. Therefore, the analysis of the literature on Internet of Things, in the time frame between 1995-2015, represents the method to fully appreciate the characteristics, opportunities, possible applications, risks and possible issues linked to the topic. Practical implications - The electronic sensors are now ubiquitous everywhere. The connected sensor-based devices create new types and quantities of high quality information, opening up new opportunities to create services that will provide the society, the environment, the economy and individuals with tangible benefits. Our conceptualization aim to contribute to the identification of the main features, application scenarios and correspondent potential applications of Internet of Things, offering new ideas for further analysis.","[Russo, Giuseppe; Marsigalia, Bruno; Evangelista, Federica; Palmaccio, Matteo] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Business & Law, Loc Folcara, Italy",University of Cassino,"Evangelista, F (通讯作者)，Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Business & Law, Via S Angelo, Loc Folcara, Italy.",,"Russo, Giuseppe/AAI-9324-2021",,,,,,45,0,0,0,26,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,966,977,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200073,0

Many leadership approaches such astransformational, servant, authentic or ethical leadership stress morality as their fundamental core. And so the question of how to practically develop moral leaders arises. This paper will introduce the Moral Awareness Leadership Program (MALP), the leadership training which is designed to support the development of moral leaders through expansion of moral awareness. Moral awareness can be developed by complementary practices of integrity self-evaluation and mindfulness. Integrity self-evaluation is designed to help participants to recognize the level of compatibility between their behavioural, verbal and mental actions, and the compatibility of these actions with the environment. Mindfulness is suitable practice for more conscious work with intuitive and heuristic determinants of moral choice. Mindfulness helps to include those subtle mental factors into integrity self-evaluation and to create more mental space for reasoning. MALP is designed to complement academic and corporate educational programs, which aim to answer the growing demand for moral and mindful leaders in our business environment.","[Vich, Marek] Univ Econ Prague, Namesti W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Vich, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Namesti W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",marek.vich@malp.cz,"Vich, Marek/GWZ-1336-2022; Silva, Gleibson/HPF-3674-2023; Silva, Gleibson/AAA-8482-2021","Vich, Marek/0000-0001-8124-1532; Silva, Gleibson/0000-0003-0945-2567; Silva, Gleibson/0000-0003-0945-2567",,,,,17,0,0,2,10,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1652,1665,,,,,,14,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000158,0

The paper shows how the German IC Center has been built up and how the different stakeholder groups spread the idea of using Intellectual Capital Statements (ICS) as a continuous management instrument to improve innovation and the future development of organizations. The paper includes how the crucial functions qualification & training, implementation, quality assurance and dissemination regarding IC are organized in Germany and what results have been achieved since the movement started in 2008. Approach: The definition of IC and the methodology of proceeding ICS in small and medium - sized enterprises as well as in larger companies and organizational networks have been adequately researched in the last years. Originally started as a pilot project Intellectual Capital Statement - Made in Germany in the Fit fur den Wissenswettbewerb (Fit for the Knowledge Competition) initiative, and funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, the concept of ICS is now established across Germany as a national movement of IC training, implementation and quality assurance. Furthermore the German researchers collected experiences on the European level in the European pilot - project Intellectual Capital Statement Made in Europe (InCaS). The concept of Intellectual Capital has thus far been researched and tested specifically with regard to enterprises and as a concept of establishing national IC Center. The experiences from Germany are the basis for the adaptation of establishing national IC Center worldwide. Value and practical implications: The paper will practically show how a national IC Center in Germany is working and how this concept is transferable to other countries which could benefit from developments and results on the practical and theoretical side made in Germany. The paper will also outline actual research activities on defining a regional concept of IC to close the gap between the well investigated concept of IC on the company level (micro) and the concept of national IC (macro).","[Wuscher, Sven; Kohl, Holger; Orth, Ronald] Fraunhofer Inst Prod Syst & Design Technol IPK, Div Corp Management, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Wuscher, S (通讯作者)，Fraunhofer Inst Prod Syst & Design Technol IPK, Div Corp Management, Pascalstr 8-9, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2453,2464,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200192,0

Based on an evaluation of publicly available tire noise data and the European road traffic noise emission model CNOSSOS, it is shown that on the road side there is a significant noise reduction potential in the usage of low-noise tires. From a three months measurement campaign a noise model was derived to predict the maximal sound pressure level of heavy duty vehicles during a pass-by in 7.5 m distance with the parameters vehicle speed and number of axles. With help of recently published information about external costs caused by heavy duty vehicles and the noise prediction tool, a model was developed to derive a money equivalent that can be used as a bonus/malus in a heavy duty vehicle fee. As a measure at the infrastructure, the installation of low-noise pavements is an effective, durable and economically attractive measure. Recent experiences with different technologies from all over the world are compiled and evaluated. On the rail side, an overview of the possible noise reduction strategies is given, followed by a discussion of the current policy and legislation in the EU and on the national level of different European countries.

We assess the relationship of these self-reported shocks with child health in a multi-shock approach to account for concomitance of adverse events from the natural, biological, economic and health sphere. We employ a unique farming household panel dataset containing information on children living in poor, rural households in eight regions of Senegal in 2009 and 2011 and account for structural changes occurring between survey periods due to the large scale, national Nutrition Enhancement Program. By zooming in to the micro level we demonstrate that Senegal as a Sahelian country, mainly reliant on subsistence agriculture, is very vulnerable to climate variability and international price developments: According to our conservative estimates, the occurrence of a drought explains 25% of the pooled weight-for-age standard deviation, income losses 31%. Our multi shock analysis reveals that the shocks are perceived as more severe in 2011 with droughts explaining up to 44% of the standard deviation of child health, increased prices up to 21%. Yet, the concomitance of droughts and increased prices after the structural change, i.e. the Nutrition Enhancement Program, indicates that the health of children experiencing both shocks in 2011 has improved. We argue that these results are driven by the increase in rural household income as theoretically outlined in the agricultural household model. Thus, adequate policy responses to shocks do not only depend on the nature but also on the concomitance of hazardous events. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

While ostensibly commercial in purpose, do BITs have domestic political ramifications? I argue that BITs affect a leader's tenure through their effect on the property rights environment in developing countries. BITs, by segmenting a country's property rights environment for foreign and domestic firms, reduce the incentive for foreign firms to lobby for property rights protections in the host country thus leading to a stagnating domestic property rights environment. In autocracies, a stagnating domestic property rights regime benefits domestic business elites who can continue to stymie small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The political benefits of BITs, however, decrease as a country becomes more democratic. Using a dataset of developing country leaders over the period 1965-2011, I find support for my hypothesis that BITs are associated with a decreased hazard of losing office and that the effect diminishes with higher levels of democracy. My results highlight the consequences of the legalization of global investment on the domestic political economy.","[Mazumder, Soumyajit] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Mazumder, S (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",smazumder@g.harvard.edu,,,,,,,148,8,9,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

This paper uses the Nepal Demographic and Health Surveys of 2006 and 2011, combined with earlier NASA satellite observations of variation in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at each child's location and time of birth to identify the trimesters of gestation and periods of infancy when climate variation is linked to attained height later in life. We find significant differences by sex: males are most affected by conditions in their second trimester of gestation, and females in the first three months after birth. Each 100-point difference in NDVI at those times is associated with a difference in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) measured at age 1259 months of 0.088 for boys and 0.054 for girls, an effect size similar to that of moving within the distribution of household wealth by close to one quintile for boys and one decile for girls. The entire seasonal change in NDVI from peak to trough is approximately 200-300 points during the 2000-2011 study period, implying a seasonal effect on HAZ similar to one to three quintiles of household wealth. This effect is observed only in households without toilets; in households with toilets, there is no seasonal fluctuation, implying protection against climatic conditions that facilitate disease transmission. We also use data from the Nepal Living Standards Surveys on district-level agricultural production and marketing, and find a climate effect on child growth only in districts where households' food consumption derives primarily from their own production. Robustness tests find no evidence of selection effects, and placebo regression results reveal no significant artefactual correlations. The timing and sex-specificity of climatic effects are consistent with previous studies, while the protective effects of household sanitation and food markets are novel indications of mechanisms by which households can gain resilience against adverse climatic conditions.

Yet few scholars have examined the determinants of bikeshare station usage using a fine-grained approach. We estimate a series of Bayesian regression models of trip generation at stations, examining the effects bicycle infrastructure, population and employment, land use mix, and transit access separately by season of the year, weekday/weekend, and user type (subscriber versus casual). We find that bikeshare stations located near busy subway stations and bicycle infrastructure see greater utilization, and that greater population and employment generally predict greater usage. Our findings are nuanced, however; for instance, those areas with more residential population are associated with more trips by subscribers and on both weekdays and non-working days; however, the effect is much stronger on non-working days. Additional nuances can be found in how various land use variables affect bikeshare usage. We use our models, based on 2014 data, to forecast the trips generated at new stations opened in 2015. Results suggest there is large variation in predictive power, partly caused by variation in weather, but also by other factors that cannot be predicted. This leads us to the conclusion that the nuances we find in our inferential analysis are more useful for transportation planners. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Multimodal travel provides an especially promising opportunity. However, until now the underlying reasons why consumers choose specific alternatives have not been fully understood. Hence, the design of new travel modes is mainly driven by obvious criteria such as environmental friendliness and convenience but might not consider consumers' real or latent needs. To close this research gap, sixty in-depth interviews with urban travelers were conducted. To identify the perceptual differences of customers among different travel modes, the repertory grid technique as an innovative, structured interview method was applied. Our data show that urban travelers distinguish and select travel alternatives based on 28 perceptual determinants. While some determinants associated with private cars such as privacy, flexibility and autonomy are key indicators of travel mode choice, costs and time efficiency also play a major role. Furthermore, by comparing travel modes to an ideal category, we reveal that some perceptual determinants do not need to be maximized in order to fulfill customer needs optimally. A comparison of consumers' perceptual assessments of alternative travel modes identifies specific advantages and disadvantages of all alternatives, and provides fruitful implications for government and private mobility providers.

Hence the estimation results reported in the literature may be spurious. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the strong relationship (i) disappears when cross-sectional dependence is accounted for using the CCEP estimator and (ii) is highly sensitive to small changes in the composition of the sample, to data revisions, and to the exact definition of the volatile-age labor share.

The Lisbon Treaty, which relaxed the voting requirements in the Council, accelerated its adoption. In the 'shadow of the vote', opponents (mainly continental CMEs) abandoned the defence of the status quo for less exacting legislation. The majority of Member States instead understood that consensus was necessary to appease the domestic concerns of countries like Germany and to strengthen their negotiating position vis-a-vis the Parliament. Despite the inevitable watering-down, the final law modifies domestic pension arrangements across the EU, thereby benefiting mobile workers. The implications are twofold. First, political economists should take into account the growing European influence on domestic pension policy-making. Second, the extension of QMV to sensitive areas of social policy will probably enhance overall harmonization.","[Guardiancich, Igor] Univ Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark",University of Southern Denmark,"Guardiancich, I (通讯作者)，Univ Southern Denmark, Ctr Welf State Res, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Management, Campusvej 55, DK-5230 Odense M, Denmark.",igu@sam.sdu.dk,,"Guardiancich, Igor/0000-0002-9255-0725",Department of Political Science and Public Management of the University of Southern Denmark,Department of Political Science and Public Management of the University of Southern Denmark,"This article has benefited from comments by a number of scholars.

Using the generalized sup ADF (GSADF) test introduced by Phillips et al. (Testing for multiple bubbles. Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 1843, 2012), we quantitatively examine the existence of explosive periods in the gold market during the period between 1968 and 2013. The date-stamping strategy associated with the test provides a real-time estimation for the origination and termination dates of each explosive period in the gold market, and several explosive periods, including both the famous 1980 explosion and the most recent 2011 explosion, are identified. Our results also demonstrate that, when multiple explosive periods exist within a specific time interval, the GSADF test is more accurate and effective in detecting them than the approach introduced by Phillips et al. (Int Econ Rev 52(1):201-226, 2011), which is relatively conservative. This paper provides further evidence that gold is the safe haven for assets under huge risk and the gold price reacts to political and economic uncertainties relatively faster than other selected commodities do.","[Long, Wei] Tulane Univ, Dept Econ, 6823 St Charles Ave, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA; [Li, Dingding] Univ Windsor, Dept Econ, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada; [Li, Qi] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Li, Qi] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA",Tulane University; University of Windsor; Capital University of Economics & Business; Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station,"Li, Q (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Int Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.;Li, Q (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",wlong2@tulane.edu; dli@uwindsor.ca; qi-li@tamu.edu,,"Long, Wei/0000-0002-8875-0329",University of Windsor Internal SSHRC-GRF grant; National Nature Science Foundation of China [71133001],University of Windsor Internal SSHRC-GRF grant; National Nature Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We would like to thank two referees for providing insightful comments that greatly improved the paper.

A constant market share analysis for the 2002-2011 period shows that, except for Romania, both CEE states and China increased their market shares in each other's market mainly due to their improved competitiveness in intermediate goods. However, with the notable exception of Slovakia, other CEE economies and China tended to gain market shares in product groups characterised by relatively non-dynamic import demand growth.

Although the Court has always been criticized for this pro-integrationist role, Member States have never cut back the CJEU's power. Recently, however, the environment for legal integration has changed: the CJEU is dealing more and more with politically sensitive issues; and that in a period when the integration project as such is becoming increasingly contested. Contrary to the expectations of many scholars, this had not led to more resistance against the CJEU's case law or its power. This article approaches this surprising fact by investigating the CJEU's jurisprudence on Golden Shares, which has substantially reduced national competencies in the contentious issue of corporate control. It shows that the persistent acceptance of the CJEU can be explained with the low and manageable short-term costs of legal integration.","[Werner, Benjamin] Univ Bremen, Inst Intercultural & Int Studies InIIS, POB 33 04 40, D-28334 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Werner, B (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Inst Intercultural & Int Studies InIIS, POB 33 04 40, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",bwerner@uni-bremen.de,,"Werner, Benjamin/0000-0001-8528-9840",,,,,41,5,5,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This paper develops a new structured approach for airports to evaluate, prioritize and categorize CSR strategies, using Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport Corporation (TIAC) as an example. Based on TIAC's CSR-related activities, 18 CSR strategies grouped into 5 CSR goals (corporate governance and finance, green airport and environmental management, service quality and social relationship, employee and work environment management, and safety and security) are identified using the CSR value chain and diamond framework. The pairwise comparison method used in analytic hierarchy process and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method are used respectively to evaluate the relative importance, feasibility and achievability of these 18 strategies and to analyze their causal relationships via expert questionnaire surveys. A new method is developed to plan and manage the implementation of CSR strategies by incorporating the viewpoints of both internal and external stakeholders, thus reflecting the practical effects and strategic implications of the CSR implementation. The result suggests that TIAC's CSR strategies in relation to airport safety and security, service quality and corporate governance are most significant and have a high implementation priority. This paper contributes to the airport industry and CSR research by proposing a proactive mechanism for quantitatively evaluating, prioritizing and categorizing CSR strategies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal of this paper was to examine how well this measure is related to international export performance at the firm level. To this end, we use Belgian firm-level data for the period 1999 to 2010 to analyse the impact of unit labour costs on exports. We find an estimated elasticity of the intensive margin of exports with respect to unit labour costs between -0.2 and -0.4. This elasticity varies between sectors and between firms, with more labour-intensive firms having a higher elasticity. The microdata also enable us to analyse the impact of unit labour costs on the extensive margin. Our results show that higher unit labour costs reduce the probability of starting to export for non-exporters and increase the probability of exporters stopping. While our results show that unit labour costs have an impact on the intensive margin and extensive margin of firm-level exports, the effect is rather low, suggesting that pass-through of costs into prices is limited. The latter is consistent with recent trade models emphasising that not only relative costs, but also demand factors such as quality and taste matter for explaining firm-level exports.","[Decramer, Stefaan; Konings, Jozef] Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; [Fuss, Catherine] NBB, Brussels, Belgium; [Fuss, Catherine] Univ Libre Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium; [Konings, Jozef] CEPR, London, England",KU Leuven; Universite Libre de Bruxelles; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Decramer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.",,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,OCT,2016,39.0,10.0,,,,,1558,1583,,10.1111/twec.12412,0.0,,,26,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DZ2LJ,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385673000005,0

According to breakpoint tests, two periods (pre-2003 and post-2003) have to be distinguished. While international travel to and from Brazil can be seen as a luxury good for the whole period, low economic growth rates at the global level and the real appreciation of the Brazilian currency real from 2003 onward have led to stagnating real tourism exports and decreases in long-term income and price elasticities. However, high economic growth rates in Brazil and the real appreciation from 2003 onward have led to strongly growing real tourism imports and increases in long-term income and price elasticities.

The wholesale market integration effects of this establishment, however, remain to be systematically examined. We use econometric techniques based on pairwise unit root tests, cointegration analysis and a time varying coefficient model to study the extent of market integration in the physically interconnected regional markets based on daily electricity spot prices. The results from the pairwise unit root tests provide mixed evidence of price convergence while cointegration analysis does not reject the absence of persistent price differences across the physically interconnected regions. The results from the time-varying filtered coefficient model suggest that full market integration has not been achieved yet. We empirically show the presence of significant network losses and constraints across the inter-regional interconnectors in the NEM. Our findings suggest that convergence in generation and network ownership, coupled with harmonisation of network regulation and regulatory institutional framework, will be increasingly important factors in improving wholesale market integration across all energy-only markets as they experience an increase in the share of renewable energy.","[Nepal, Rabindra] Charles Darwin Univ, CDU Business Sch, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia; [Foster, John] Univ Queensland, Sch Econ, Energy Econ & Management Grp, Colin Clark Bldg,Level 6,Room 639, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",Charles Darwin University; University of Queensland,"Nepal, R (通讯作者)，Charles Darwin Univ, CDU Business Sch, Darwin, NT 0909, Australia.",rabindra.nepal@cdu.edu.au; j.foster@uq.edu.au,"Nepal, Rabindra/J-2027-2019","Nepal, Rabindra/0000-0001-9378-6206; Foster, John/0000-0002-2601-1539",,,,,57,17,18,0,14,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2016,37.0,4.0,,,,,215,237,,10.5547/01956574.37.4.mep,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ5OZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385912700010,0

Microdata from the Spanish National Health Survey (SNHS) 2011-2012 are analysed. Corrected concentration indices (CCI) are calculated to measure inequality. Path analysis is employed to disentangle direct and indirect effects of SES on obesity, where dietary patterns, physical activity and sleep habits act as mediator variables. Multivariate logistic models are used to select those exogenous variables to be included in the path diagram. Men and women are analysed separately. Our results show significant pro-rich inequality in the distribution of obesity (the poorer the more obese), particularly for women (CCI= -0.070 for men, CCI = -0.079 for women). The indirect effects of SES on obesity (those transmitted via mediator variables) are quite modest (3.3% for males, 2.4% for females) due to three reasons. Firstly, dietary habits do not show a significant mediating effect. Secondly, the mediating effect of physical activity in leisure time, although significant (14% for males, 11.1% for females), is offset by that related to main activity. Finally, sleep habits contribution to total effect of SES on obesity is statistically significant but small (roughly 1%). Our results indicate that promoting physical activity in leisure time for those with a low SES, particularly for men, would contribute to prevent obesity and to reduce health inequalities. Promotion of adequate sleep habits for women With a low SES might have a similar effect. However, interventions aimed to reduce sedentarism related to main activity, although useful to prevent obesity, would amplify the obesity socioeconomic gradient. Since effects of SES are different for men and women, socioeconomic health inequalities should be addressed also from a gender perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of existing literature reports on the results from single cities. This study presents the results of a nationwide travel survey implemented to examine multiple modes of urban passenger transport across five mainland state capitals in Australia, with a focus of urban rail. The study aims to explore differences in mode choices among surveyed travellers sampled from the five cities by accounting for two types of factors: service quality and features of public transport, and socio demographic characteristics. A stated preference approach is adopted to elicit people's valuation of specified mode-choice related factors and their willingness to pay. In particular, the availabilities of wireless and laptop stations two factors rarely examined in the literature, were also considered in the SP survey. The survey data were analysed using mixed logit models. To test for preference heterogeneity, socio-demographic factors were interacted with random parameters, and their influences on marginal utilities simulated. The analysis reveals that intercity differences, user group status, gender, income, and trip purposes partially explain observed preference heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Depending on the degree of complementarity between local public goods, median voters strategically delegate policy to either 'conservative' or to 'liberal' representatives under decentralized decision-making. In the first case, it accentuates the free-rider problem in public good provision, while it mitigates it in the second case. Under centralized decision-making, the process of strategic delegation results in either too low or too much public spending, with the outcome crucially depending on the sharing of the costs of local public spending relative to the size of the spillover effects. Hence, with a common financing rule, centralization is welfare improving if and only if both public good externalities and the degree of complementarity between local public goods are both relatively large.","[Cheikbossian, Guillaume] Univ Montpellier, Fac Econ LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France; [Cheikbossian, Guillaume] Toulouse Sch Econ, Ave Raymond Dugrand CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France",Universite de Montpellier; Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Cheikbossian, G (通讯作者)，Univ Montpellier, Fac Econ LAMETA, Ave Raymond Dugrand CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.;Cheikbossian, G (通讯作者)，Toulouse Sch Econ, Ave Raymond Dugrand CS 79606, F-34960 Montpellier 2, France.",guillaume.cheikbossian@umontpellier.fr,,,,,,,49,3,3,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,AUG,2016,47.0,2.0,,,,,315,348,,10.1007/s00355-016-0962-3,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DX5WC,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000384452400005,0

The study draws on Eurobarometer micro-data integrated with country-level information to respond to this question. Performing a multilevel analysis across 21 European countries, it considers macro factors that influence the decisions of mid-life women to give up or reduce paid work in order to care for a frail elderly parent. The results show that, while the overall level of expenditure on long-term care is not influential, settings characterized by limited formal care services, and strong norms with regard to intergenerational obligations, have a negative impact on women's attachment to the labour market. Policies and cultural factors also influence the extent to which women are polarized: in more defamilialized countries, regardless of their level of education, female carers rarely reduce their level of employment.","[Naldini, Manuela] Univ Turin, Family & Welf Syst, Sociol, Turin, Italy; [Naldini, Manuela] Coll Carlo Alberto, Moncalieri, Italy; [Pavolini, Emmanuele] Univ Macerata, Econ Sociol & Social Policy, Macerata, Italy; [Solera, Cristina] Univ Turin, Sociol, Turin, Italy",University of Turin; Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Macerata; University of Turin,"Solera, C (通讯作者)，Univ Turin, Dept Cultures Polit & Soc, Lungo Dora Siena 100, I-10153 Turin, Italy.",cristina.solera@unito.it,"Naldini, Manuela/AAI-2069-2019; Pavolini, Emmanuele/HJH-5328-2023","Naldini, Manuela/0000-0002-3433-7598;",,,,,48,41,43,5,40,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The reform is simulated in an ex ante behavioural microsimulation approach. Behavioural responses resulting from changes in capital income taxation are estimated in an empirical demand model for household savings and asset allocation, which is applied to German survey data. Significant reductions in tax rates result in income gains for most of the households. Gains are found to be greater for households in higher tax brackets, whereby income inequality increases, in particular in East Germany. Moreover, households increase savings and alter the structure of asset demand as a result of shifts in relative asset prices. As a result, utility losses reduce welfare effects for almost all households, in particular for households with greater savings.","[Ochmann, Richard] IGES Inst, Friedrichstr 180, Berlin, Germany",,"Ochmann, R (通讯作者)，IGES Inst, Friedrichstr 180, Berlin, Germany.",richard.ochmann@iges.de,,,Fritz Thyssen Stiftung through project 'Taxation and Asset Allocation of Private Households-Empirical Analyses and Simulations of Policy Reforms for Germany',Fritz Thyssen Stiftung through project 'Taxation and Asset Allocation of Private Households-Empirical Analyses and Simulations of Policy Reforms for Germany',"This paper greatly benefited from valuable discussions with Martin Browning, Andre Decoster, Peter Haan, Carsten Schroder, Viktor Steiner, Arthur van Soest, and audiences at the 2011 annual congress of the European Economic Association, the 2011 annual congress of the Verein fur Socialpolitik, and in economic policy seminars at DIW Berlin and Free University of Berlin, as well as useful comments from two anonymous referees.

Such heterogeneity may arise due to state and federal policies, differences in market structure, and other factors that influence demand and costs. This paper examines the relative importance of such factors on equilibrium solar PV system prices in the United States using a detailed dataset of roughly 100,000 recent residential and small commercial installations. As expected, we find that PV system prices differ based on characteristics of the systems. More interestingly, we find evidence suggesting that search costs and imperfect competition affect solar PV pricing. Installer density substantially lowers prices, while regions with relatively generous financial incentives for solar PV are associated with higher prices.","[Gillingham, Kenneth] Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Sch Management, Dept Econ, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Deng, Hao] Yale Univ, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA; [Wiser, Ryan; Darghouth, Naim Richard; Barbose, Galen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Natl Lab, 1 Cyclotron Rd, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Nemet, Gregory] Univ Wisconsin, 1225 Observ Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Rai, Varun] Univ Texas Austin, 2315 Red River St,SRH 3-256, Austin, TX 78712 USA; [Dong, Changgui] Natl Renewable Energy Lab, 15013 Denver W Pkwy, Golden, CO 80401 USA",Yale University; Yale University; United States Department of Energy (DOE); Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; United States Department of Energy (DOE); National Renewable Energy Laboratory - USA,"Gillingham, K (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Sch Forestry & Environm Studies, Sch Management, Dept Econ, 195 Prospect St, New Haven, CT 06510 USA.",kenneth.gillingham@yale.edu,"Barbose, Galen/AAH-4507-2019; Nemet, Gregory/B-3422-2008","Barbose, Galen/0000-0003-4687-2309; Rai, Varun/0000-0002-4080-9299; Gillingham, Kenneth/0000-0002-7329-2660; Nemet, Gregory/0000-0001-7859-4580",Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Solar Energy Technologies Office) of the U.S. DOE [DE-AC02-05CH11231],Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Solar Energy Technologies Office) of the U.S. DOE(United States Department of Energy (DOE)),"We thank Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Hilary Staver, Paige Weber, and Divita Bhandari for research assistance.

Electricity prices vary dramatically between moments in time, between location, and according to lead-time between contract and delivery. This three-dimensional heterogeneity has implication for the economic assessment of power generation technologies: different technologies, such as coal-fired plants and wind turbines, produce electricity that has, on average, a different economic value. Several tools that are used to evaluate generators in practice ignore these value differences, including levelized electricity costs, grid parity, and simple macroeconomic models. This paper provides a rigorous and general discussion of heterogeneity and its implications for the economic assessment of electricity generating technologies. It shows that these tools are biased, specifically, they tend to favor wind and solar power over dispatchable generators where these renewable generators have a high market share. A literature review shows that, at a wind market share of 30-40%, the value of a megawatt-hour of electricity from a wind turbine can be 20-50% lower than the value of one megawatt-hour as demanded by consumers. We introduce System LCOE as one way of comparing generation technologies economically.","[Hirth, Lion] Neon Neue Energieokon Gmbh, Karl Marx Pl 12, D-12043 Berlin, Germany; [Hirth, Lion; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany; [Hirth, Lion; Ueckerdt, Falko; Edenhofer, Ottmar] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany; [Edenhofer, Ottmar] Tech Univ Berlin, Chair Econ Climate Change, Berlin, Germany",Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung; Technical University of Berlin,"Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Neon Neue Energieokon Gmbh, Karl Marx Pl 12, D-12043 Berlin, Germany.;Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Mercator Res Inst Global Commons & Climate Change, Berlin, Germany.;Hirth, L (通讯作者)，Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res PIK, Potsdam, Germany.",hirth@neon-energie.de,"Edenhofer, Ottmar/E-1886-2013","Edenhofer, Ottmar/0000-0001-6029-5208; Hirth, Lion/0000-0002-5563-3310",,,,,114,55,58,0,39,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2016,37.0,3.0,,,,,1,27,,10.5547/01956574.37.3.lhir,0.0,,,27,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DP8OL,,"hybrid, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378757400001,0

This article examines the contribution of Nataliya Narochnitskaya, a historian and nationalist politician, to this exercise in authoritarian soft power.

The dynamic panel data model has several advantages over a standard hedonic regression. In addition, we incorporate age effects into our panel data model, and by doing so we correct the age bias in the repeated sales method and in the simple average method. Our estimates show that rental growth is cyclical but it generally lags behind broader economic growth. Surprisingly, the long-term average rental growth is significantly lower than what is usually perceived, and the volatility of rental growth can be significantly under estimated when the conventional methods are adopted. We also find significant cross-property type and cross-region variations in the rental adjustment process. In contrast to the existing literature, we find a strong negative relation between rental growth and cap rate, and that this relation is significantly stronger than that between NOI growth and cap rate. Finally, we establish an empirical relation between price return and rental growth in the commercial real estate market.","[An, Xudong] San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Dept Finance, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore; [Fisher, Jeffrey D.] Indiana Univ, Dept Finance, Kelly Sch Business, 1309 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Hu, Maggie Rong] Univ New S Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, ASB Bldg Level 3, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",California State University System; San Diego State University; National University of Singapore; National University of Singapore; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington; University of New South Wales Sydney,"An, XD (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, 5500 Campanile Dr, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.;Deng, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Real Estate, Dept Finance, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore.;Deng, YH (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace,04-02, Singapore 119613, Singapore.;Fisher, JD (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Dept Finance, Kelly Sch Business, 1309 E Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.;Hu, MR (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Banking & Finance, ASB Bldg Level 3, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",xan@mail.sdsu.edu; ydeng@nus.edu.sg; fisher@indiana.edu; m.hu@unsw.edu.au,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171; Hu, Maggie/0000-0002-1693-6730",RERI,RERI,"We are grateful to David Geltner, Peng Liu, Walt Torous, Elysia Tse and an anonymous referee for numerous constructive suggestions.

In this essay we examine the evolution of the party system in Ukraine, focusing on the extent to which the Euromaidan has addressed previous problems and weaknesses. So far the post-Soviet Ukrainian party system has been exceptionally unstable as electoral legislation, the factional composition of Ukraine's parliament, and the dominant parties in Ukraine underwent frequent changes. We argue that, despite advances in democratisation as a result of the revolutionary events of 2013-2014, the essential features of Ukraine's party system have not changed.

Although important contributions have been made in the literature, quantifying the size of the fiscal multiplier remains a challenge. Indeed, the challenge of estimating a unique fiscal multiplier is probably an ill-posed one. The magnitude of the multiplier may well depend on country- and time-specific characteristics of the fiscal stance under scrutiny. In this paper, we estimate state-specific multipliers for Spain depending on the state of the economy along several dimensions. The government spending multiplier is estimated to be larger during recessions and banking stress periods, but much smaller (or even negative) during periods of weak public finances. Combining these three dimensions into a single global turmoil indicator via principal component analysis, the estimated multipliers are 1.4 for crisis (or turbulent) times and 0.6 for tranquil times.","[Hernandez de Cos, Pablo; Moral-Benito, Enrique] Banco Espana, Calle Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain",Banco de Espana,"Moral-Benito, E (通讯作者)，Banco Espana, Calle Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain.",enrique.moral@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,18,19,5,14,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

More than 90% of non-business visitors and 67% of business visitors came to the region for at least one nature-related reason. Average daily expenditure was similar for both visitor segments (approximate to AUD$190), but the determinants of expenditure varied. All visitors reacted much more negatively to the prospect of environmental degradation than to a 20% increase in (local) prices, although business visitors were much less responsive than non-business visitors.

For a subset of the data, we also observe characteristics of underlying fund holdings. Despite evidence that Value-Added and Opportunistic funds differ in investment composition, we show that class does not do a good job of predicting differences in performance.

In this study I investigate how education is associated with Body Mass Index (BMI) in later stages of life. BMI, weight(kg)/height(m)(2), is the principle measure used for classifying people as obese. Using sibling data and methods that take account of unobserved endowments and environment shared by siblings, I find that there is large variation in BMI between siblings and that education is negatively associated with BMI. One more year of schooling is associated with an estimated reduction of 0.15 in BMI. When considering different education levels, completing college education is associated with 0.7 reduction in BMI relative to high school graduation only. The significant effect of education on obesity that remains in the long-run has policy implications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These are seen not only in the relationship between society and the state, but also in the para-constitutional institutions of the dual state. This article argues that whereas Medvedev created an arena for liberalization within these para-constitutional structures, Putin has firmly rejected these policies, among other things by revising the 1995 law on NGOs amended in 2006. Using the perspective of the dual state, the article argues that with the introduction of the Law on Foreign Agents (2012), the original law draft On Public Control (2014), a key element in Medvedev's modernization program, was delayed and substantially altered. Together, these amendments create precarious conditions for NGOs, pressuring their independence by threats of dissolution and reducing the quality of civil control over state organs.","[Flikke, Geir] Univ Oslo UiO, Inst European Language Literature & Area Studies, Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Flikke, G (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo UiO, Inst European Language Literature & Area Studies, Oslo, Norway.",Geir.flikke@ilos.uio.no,,"Flikke, Geir/0009-0000-5272-8448",Norwegian Research Council NORRUS [228205],Norwegian Research Council NORRUS(Research Council of Norway),"Research for this article was conducted under the NEPORUS project, Norwegian Research Council NORRUS grant no. 228205.

We consider both the route and the airport levels to inspect the local and global effects of competition, with a unifying framework to test the hypotheses of 1. airport congestion internalization and 2. the market competition-quality relationship in a single econometric model. In particular, we examine the impacts of the entry of low cost carriers (LCC) on the flight delays of incumbent full service carriers in the Brazilian airline industry. The main results indicate a highly significant effect of airport congestion self-internalization in parallel with route-level quality competition. Additionally, the potential competition caused by LCC presence provokes a global effect that suggests the existence of non-price spillovers of the LCC entry to non-entered routes.

Forty-five synthetic populations were generated for 12 census tracts in Florida for this purpose. The empirical results indicate the value of synthesizing base year populations more accurately by accommodating multi-level controls. Although fewer controls are typically available for target years, the use of multi-level controls in the target year with appropriate synthesis methods does benefit the accuracy of the synthetic population. This study also establishes that the magnitude of the overall error in the synthesized population appears to be linearly related to the magnitude of the input errors introduced via the control tables. The improvements in accuracy are statistically significant and hold after controlling for differences in population sizes and growth rates for the different census tracts. Overall, efforts to accurately synthesize base-year populations and to good forecasts of target-year controls can help synthesize accurate target-year populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Mechanisms underlying SiN's function, however, have not been well described. Extending previous agent-based modelling work, this study explored the potential role of behavioural adaptation of drivers to the presence of cyclists that followed patterns of Rescorla Wagner (R-W) learning models. Results indicated that SiN effects consistent with those present in real-world studies were replicable in a simulated environment, and that R W model input settings were able to control the strength of the SiN effect in combination with the influence of increased cyclist density.

Although it was a total political failure, the recent reshaping of the regional administration triggered a vivid public and scholarly interest on the matter. The purpose of the article is to shed new light on political constraints operating when it comes to reshaping regional design in Romania. Whereas official arguments pointed towards the necessity to address EU conditionality, the reshape was more likely underpinned by the government's attempt to gain electoral advantages in the local elections scheduled for 2012. The decisive opposition made to the project by the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (Uniunea Democrat a Maghiarilor din Romania) reveals the importance that ethnic factors have played in this context.","[Dragoman, Dragos; Gheorghita, Bogdan] Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Polit Sci, Calea Dumbravii 34, Sibiu 550324, Romania",Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu,"Dragoman, D; Gheorghita, B (通讯作者)，Lucian Blaga Univ Sibiu, Dept Polit Sci, Calea Dumbravii 34, Sibiu 550324, Romania.",dragos.dragoman@ulbsibiu.ro; bogdan.gheorghita@ulbsibiu.ro,,"Dragoman, Dragos/0000-0001-5939-3484",,,,,94,4,4,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,FEB 7,2016,68.0,2.0,,,,,270,290,,10.1080/09668136.2015.1136594,0.0,,,21,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,DI9CW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373800000004,0

As a result, less able agents may benefit from initially disadvantageous inequality.

This is done by investigating: to what extent the gender wage gap among physicians varies between fields of medicine (within-occupation segregation) and across family status; whether there is an association between parenthood and wages among physicians and, if so, whether there is a gender difference in this association; and changes in the gender wage gap among physicians over time. The results indicate a large overall gender wage difference for medical doctors. Even when gender differences in specialization are taken into account, men have higher wages than women do. For both men and women physicians, there is a positive association between parenthood and wages. The longitudinal analyses show that the gender wage gap among physicians was greater in 2007 than in 1975.","[Magnusson, Charlotta] Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden",Stockholm University,"Magnusson, C (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Swedish Inst Social Res SOFI, S-10691 Stockholm, Sweden.",charlotta.magnusson@sofi.su.se,,,"Swedish Research Council [VR Dnr 2006-1816]; Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare [FORTE Dnr 2010-0732]","Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte))","Financial support from the Swedish Research Council (VR Dnr 2006-1816) and the Swedish Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (FORTE Dnr 2010-0732) is gratefully acknowledged.",,43,17,20,5,39,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Yet research in different professional jurisdictions emphasizes the transnational nature of professional fields. Further work is therefore needed that explores the extent to which transnational professional fields are characterized by unity or heterogeneity. To that end, this article presents the results of a qualitative interrogation of the habitus of partners in Big 4' professional service firms across, primarily, five countries (Bangladesh, Canada, France, Spain and the UK). Marked differences are observed between the partner habitus in Bangladesh and the other countries studied in terms of entrepreneurial and public service dispositions. In turn, these findings highlight the methodological relevance of habitus for both the sociology of the professions and comparative capitalism literatures: for the former, habitus aids in mapping the dynamics of transnational professional fields; for the latter, habitus can elucidate the informal norms and conventions of national business systems.","[Spence, Crawford] Warwick Business Sch, Warwick, England; [Carter, Chris] Univ Edinburgh, Strategy & Org, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, Midlothian, Scotland; [Belal, Ataur] Aston Univ, Aston Business Sch, Dept Accounting, Birmingham B4 7ET, W Midlands, England; [Husillos, Javier] Univ Strathclyde, Glasgow G1 1XQ, Lanark, Scotland; [Dambrin, Claire] ESCP Europe, Paris, France; [Archel, Pablo] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Business Adm, Sch Business, Navarra, Spain",University of Warwick; University of Edinburgh; Aston University; University of Strathclyde; heSam Universite; ESCP Business School; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Spence, C (通讯作者)，Warwick Business Sch, Gibbet Hill Rd, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",Crawford.Spence@wbs.ac.uk,"Belal, Ataur/AFN-0122-2022; Husillos, Javier/R-1212-2017","Belal, Ataur/0000-0001-6144-8907; Husillos, Javier/0000-0001-7931-8801; Dambrin, Claire/0000-0002-7509-6938; Carter, Chris/0000-0003-1610-7577; Spence, Crawford William/0000-0003-0355-8002",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-33121],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Pablo Archel and Javier Husillos received financial assistance from the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (ref.

This popular postulation has blurred the attention to potential upward constraints on tax policy-making emanating from globalised capital markets. In this paper, we illustrate when and how capital markets exert an upward pressure on taxes. While the increasing access to international capital allowed governments in developed democracies to indulge their voters with deficit-financed spending, the most recent crisis has shown that this is no panacea. When international loans become costly, governments have to revert to raising revenue domestically. Using comparative time-series data since the 1980s, we investigate how rising bond yields affect the number and the direction of tax reforms, as well as the tax mix in the OECD. The empirical analysis provides some evidence that international capital markets place an upward pressure on taxes, recently above all on consumption taxes. Yet, governments have also retained room to manoeuvre as a number of tax decisions are more dependent on domestic political factors than on pressure from the capital markets.","[Lierse, Hanna; Seelkopf, Laura] Jacobs Univ Bremen, D-28759 Bremen, Germany",Jacobs University,"Lierse, H (通讯作者)，Jacobs Univ Bremen, Campus Ring 1, D-28759 Bremen, Germany.",h.lierse@jacobs-university.de; l.seelkopf@jacobs-university.de,,"Seelkopf, Laura/0000-0002-2251-3830",German Science Foundation via the Collaborative Research Center [597],German Science Foundation via the Collaborative Research Center,"The authors claim equal authorship.

An alternative approach when constructing an appropriate parametric distribution for the considered data file is to use the so-called order statistics. This paper deals with the use of order statistics as the methods of L-moments and TL-moments of parameter estimation. L-moments have some theoretical advantages over conventional moments. Lmoments have been introduced as a robust alternative to classical moments of probability distributions. However, L-moments and their estimations lack some robust features that belong to the TL-moments. TL-moments represent an alternative robust version of L-moments, which are called trimmed L-moments. This paper deals with the use of L-moments and TL-moments in the construction of models of wage distribution. Three-parametric lognormal curves represent the basic theoretical distribution whose parameters were simultaneously estimated by three methods of point parameter estimation and accuracy of these methods was then evaluated. There are method of TL-moments, method of L-moments and maximum likelihood method in combination with Cohen's method.

The electricity supply industry is changing quickly from a top-down, single-firm game to a decentralized multiple-player system, with far-reaching consequences for the governance and regulatory structure. Second, the incumbent players are facing disruptive challenges: under pressure of the energy transition, conventional centralized generation is losing profit margins very quickly. We analyze the disruptive challenges and sketch how the incumbents respond by splitting their activities into an old business, which is likely to be phased-out, and a new, future-oriented business: renewable energies, the distribution business, and customer-oriented solutions.","[Brunekreeft, Gert; Buchmann, Marius; Meyer, Roland] Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany",Jacobs University,"Brunekreeft, G (通讯作者)，Jacobs Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany.",g.brunekreeft@jacobs-university.de,,,,,,,31,14,14,0,2,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,,2016,37.0,,,,2,,243,262,,10.5547/01956574.37.SI2.gbru,0.0,,,20,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EY5JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000404014600015,0

Unfortunately, this assumes carefully breaking ties amongst different bundles in the buyer demand set. Presumably, the shopkeeper cleverly convinces the buyer to break ties in a manner consistent with maximizing social welfare. Lacking such a shopkeeper, if buyers arrive sequentially and simply choose some arbitrary bundle in their demand set, the social welfare may be arbitrarily bad. In the context of matching markets, we show how to compute dynamic prices, based upon the current inventory, that guarantee that social welfare is maximized. Such prices are set without knowing the identity of the next buyer to arrive. We also show that this is impossible in general (e.g., for coverage valuations), but consider other scenarios where this can be done.

This paper attempts to answer the following key question: For the purpose of promoting energy efficiency, do prices, technology, enterprise restructuring and other policy-related instruments affect various sectors uniformly so as to justify uniform industrial energy conservation policies, or do different industries respond significantly differently so as to require policies that are tailored to each sector separately? In this paper, we examine this question using data for China's most energy-intensive large and medium-size enterprises over the period 1999-2004. Our results suggest that in all four industries rising energy costs are a significant contributor to the decline in energy intensity over our period of study.

The grease the wheels hypothesis, which contends that bribes act as speed money, implies three testable predictions. First, on average, bribe requests should be negatively correlated with wait times. Second, this relationship should vary across firms, with those with the highest opportunity cost of waiting being more likely to pay and facing shorter delays. Third, the role of grease should vary across countries, with benefits larger where regulatory burdens are greatest. The data are inconsistent with all three predictions. According to the preferred specifications, ceteris paribus, firms confronted with demands for bribes take approximately 1.5 times longer to get a construction permit, operating license, or electrical connection than firms that did not have to pay bribes and, respectively, 1.2 and 1.4 times longer to clear customs when exporting and importing. The results are robust to controlling for firm fixed effects and at odds with the notion that corruption enhances efficiency.","[Freund, Caroline] Peterson Inst Int Econ, Washington, DC USA; [Hallward-Driemeier, Mary; Rijkers, Bob] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Peterson Institute for International Economics; The World Bank,"Rijkers, B (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",cfreund@piie.com; mhallward@worldbank.org; brijkers@worldbank.org,,,government of Norway through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development [P1481495]; government of Sweden through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development [P1481495]; government of United Kingdom through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development [P1481495]; government of Japan through the Knowledge for Change Program [TF014655],government of Norway through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Sweden through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of United Kingdom through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Japan through the Knowledge for Change Program,"This work was supported with funding from the governments of Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development (P1481495) and with funding from the government of Japan through the Knowledge for Change Program, (TF014655).

The policy will benefit the social economy of the local farmers and communities and create a variety of jobs. Attempts in fulfilling demand should uphold production sustainability, even then many indication show declining capability of soil to have increased. Reducing the capability of soil may lead to the reducing of productivity. Many well-documented data show that using organic fertilizer such as manure might improve soil's biological properties as well as its nutrition, production and quality of the obtained maize. Nevertheless, these improvements depend on the chemical composition of the green manures applied to the soil. Manures have different varieties in its chemical composition of nutrition, and heavy metal content depending on the diet. Little attention has been given by farmers on the probability of their plants might be contaminated by lead. Lead has been known to have a detrimental effect on plants. Therefore monitoring the effect is needed. The research was dedicated to participate on the effort of increasing productivity by promoting manure usage such as goat and cow manure on growing maize. Different compositions of goat and cow manure were applied on the soil media growth of maize on the glasshouse. The growth was monitored biophysically by measuring the leaves surface electrical difference and area and observing for signs of chlorosis. Result has shown that the addition of manure on soil has increases leaf area and electrical potential difference compared to the maize grown in a mere soil media. It is concluded that renewable fertilizer such as cow and goat manure was important in increasing plant growth. A composition of 2/3 soil and 1/3 goat manure was optimal for the leaves growth followed by composition of 2/3 soil and 1/3 cow manure.

Evidence from 296 Trade Agreements,WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PROMOTES TRADE; WTO; LIBERALIZATION; INTEGRATION; GATT/WTO; DESIGN,"In a seminal article, Rose (2004) found that the assumed positive impact of the WTO on international trade was questionable. This finding has been scrutinised and modified in subsequent research, using different data sets, econometric methods and separating the WTO from other forms of trade agreements. A key characteristic of the subsequent literature is the rather simplistic way in which trade agreements are treated whereby all trade agreements are lumped together. Trade agreements come, however, in many different forms and shapes. This study addresses these differences in trade agreements. Using a unique database of 296 trade agreements, we distinguish 17 trade-related policy domains and indicate whether the agreements contain legally enforceable commitments. This extensive and novel taxonomy of trade agreements enables us to allow for the possible heterogeneity of the impact of trade agreements on international trade. Using a gravity model, we find that trade agreement heterogeneity indeed matters for international trade and that countries experience significant trade increases due to comprehensive trade agreements even if not all participants are in the WTO.","[Kohl, Tristan; Brakman, Steven; Garretsen, Harry] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Kohl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",,"Kohl, Tristan/I-7133-2019","Kohl, Tristan/0000-0003-1756-602X",,,,,44,80,86,4,42,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2016,39.0,1.0,,,,,97,131,,10.1111/twec.12272,0.0,,,35,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,DC1UK,,"Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000369002300005,0

They are focused on achieving the objectives of the organization, as such, are the bearer of the mission and the strategic functioning of the social enterprise. Managers in nonprofit organisations elect a democratic or liberal leadership style, with a high participation of employees. A positive finding is that the involvement of employees in the decision-making process uses 85 percent of social enterprises involved in the research.

We construct an estimator without restrictive distributional assumptions, illustrate its performance using simulations, and apply it to the investigation of growth determinants. Once model uncertainty, dynamics, and endogeneity are accounted for, we identify several factors that are robustly correlated with growth. We find the strongest support for the neoclassical growth variables including initial income and proxies for physical and human capital accumulation, as well as evidence in favor of both fundamental and proximate factors including macroeconomic policy, geography, and ethnic heterogeneity. In addition, we demonstrate that applying methodologies that do not account for either dynamics or endogeneity yields different sets of robust determinants.

Elements of the matrix express the consequences if a decision-maker chooses a particular alternative and a particular state of the world occurs. Assuming the probabilities of the states of the world are known, alternatives are compared on the basis of the expected values and variances of their consequences. In practice, the states of the world are often described only vaguely; they are expressed by fuzzy sets on the universal set on which the probability distribution is given. In literature, the common approach in such a case consists in computing crisp probabilities of the fuzzy states of the world by formula proposed by Zadeh. In the paper, we first discuss the problems connected with the common approach. Consequently, we introduce a new approach, in which a decision matrix with fuzzy states of the world does not describe discrete random variables but fuzzy rule-based systems.

Using the CoreLogic Loan Performance dataset that contains detailed loan level information on mortgages, modification terms, second liens, and home values, we estimate a discrete time proportional hazard model with competing risks to examine the determinants of post-modification mortgage outcomes. We find that principal reductions are particularly effective at improving loan outcomes, as high loan-to-value ratios are the single greatest contributor to re-default and foreclosure. However, any modification that reduces total payment and interest (P&I) reduces the likelihood of subsequent re-default and foreclosure. Modifications that increase the loan principal-primarily through capitalized interest and fees-are more likely to fail, even while controlling for changes in P&I.","[Schmeiser, Maximilian D.] Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA; [Gross, Matthew B.] Univ Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Schmeiser, MD (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Washington, DC USA.",max.schmeiser@frb.gov,"Schmeiser, Maximilian D/A-2350-2010",,,,,,38,12,15,0,8,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

Consequently, a cluster analysis is used to group the states with similar situation in particular year (2004, 2012). A hierarchical clustering using Ward's method with Squared Euclidean distances grouped the regions into 5 groups. This enable to distinguish those with potential for favourable development as their fertility rate and number of live births is high.

On the other hand prevailing part of M&A which have been executed over past years have not generated expected results. Such a contradiction gave rise to a research question which concerns causal analysis of M&A failures. One of key reasons for M&A failures is underestimating post-acquisition integration process (PAIP). Companies usually place emphasis on pre-acquisition stage of M&A when potential synergic effects are identified and financial benefits of M&A calculated. PAIP is usually believed to come into effect almost spontaneously without heavy interference of company management.

Today most authors agree that process tracing is aimed at unpacking causal and temporal mechanisms. The article distinguishes two main types of use for process tracing. Some are more inductive, aimed at theory building (i.e. at uncovering and specifying causal mechanisms) while others are more deductive, aimed at theory testing (and refining). The paper summarizes the main added value and drawbacks of process tracing. It ends by providing ten guidelines for when and how to apply process tracing.","[Trampusch, Christine] Univ Cologne, Cologne Ctr Comparat Polit, Cologne, Germany; [Palier, Bruno] SciencesPo, Ctr Etud Europeennes, LIEPP, Paris, France",University of Cologne,"Palier, B (通讯作者)，SciencesPo, Ctr Etud Europeennes, LIEPP, Paris, France.",bruno.palier@sciencespo.fr,"Trampusch, Christine/AAD-9670-2019; Trampusch, Christine/ABC-7216-2021","Trampusch, Christine/0000-0003-1024-2065","French National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-11-LABX-0091, ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02]",French National Research Agency (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD),"This work has been partly supported by a public grant overseen by the French National Research Agency (ANR) as part of the 'Investissements d'Avenir' program LIEPP (ANR-11-LABX-0091, ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02).",,55,116,139,5,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

This matter, known also as the newsvendor problem, has various variants. After reviewing two basic formulations, we concentrate to the model when the vendor is able to change selling price. Naturally, increased price leads to smaller demand, and vice versa. To describe such an effect, we assume a nonlinear regression-like model of dependence of demand on the price, with an inflexion point at a 'base', customary price. This is in fact the main innovation proposed in the present contribution, as standardly linear or exponential demand curves are considered. We then derive optimal solution concerning both the inventory level and selling price, maximizing either expected profit or chosen quantile of profit distribution. Solutions are illustrated with the aid of simple numerical examples.","[Volf, Petr] FP TU Liberec, Dept Appl Math, Univ Nam 1, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Volf, P (通讯作者)，FP TU Liberec, Dept Appl Math, Univ Nam 1, Liberec, Czech Republic.",petr.volf@tul.cz,"Volf, Petr/E-8320-2013; Volf, Petr/AAL-7007-2021","Volf, Petr/0000-0001-5673-6066",,,,,4,0,0,0,1,TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY LIBEREC,LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 00000, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-296-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,886,891,,,,,,6,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF8XG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385239500152,0

Promotion of the development of the knowledge and abilities expected by the labour market is one of the fields of activities. On the national level of member states, these issues found reflection in their national development strategies. It is of importance to have a knowledge concerning those factors which most significantly motivate for constant education (life long learning), not stopping education prematurely, and increasing the level of education. A several years' period of implementation of the strategies associated with raising the level of education in the society, allows collecting experiences of selected EU countries in this respect and finding the crucial factors which determine achievement of the set educational objectives. The aim of the research was to isolate, from the set of the determinants for the demand for educational services, the stimulants and destimulants concerning the decision to take up higher education. In order to achieve the research objective, the authors have conducted an analysis of those EU documents associated with the development strategy which are related to the issue of education, particularly higher education.

NPK enrichments to humic substance showed significant differences on some agronomic variables than that of control. The length of plant treated with 3/3 NPK enrichment revealed the longest average of 564.2 cm, or increased by 38%. The highest fresh weight was obtained by 4/3 treatment followed by 2/3 rate of NPK enrichment. Whie the longest cucumber fruit was obtained by 3/3 rate. Total soil N was very low, consequently the NPK sorption by cucumber was very low. While soil P availability was high, however the NPK enrichment lowered the fresh cucumber fruit P content instead.

City safety grade evaluation becomes a more and more important topic. Based on a sample of 378 U.S. cities, the paper uses the multi-objective comprehensive evaluation model and SOM neural network algorithm to evaluate the safety grade of the target city. Firstly, we find two important indexes affecting the safety of the city: crime rate and arrest rate. Due to particularly prominent influence of severe crimes on city security, we decided to use the crime rate and arrest rate of seven categories of cases (murder, rape, robbery, beating, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft) as evaluation index of city security. Secondly, based on the above indexes, we analyze and summarize the crime data in 378 cities in 2014 on the official website, using the consistency coefficient of system clustering. The result shows that the optimal class number is 24, namely 24 safety levels are divided. Then, we use SOM neural network algorithm to train the samples, determine the weight of each index. Finally, we use multi-index comprehensive evaluation model to evaluate the safety level of the target city. We will change the competitive layer of model and the frequency of training, and find that the security level error is no more than 5%. It shows the model withstand the test with certain stability and accuracy. Besides, the model uses system clustering to determine the classification number, and determine the weights by using SOM neural network algorithm. It is thus clear that the result is highly scientific. In addition, the applicable scope of model is extremely broad. As for the multi-index comprehensive evaluation problems, our model is instructive and of practical significance.","[Zheng, Hao] North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Zheng, H (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,1256,1263,,,,,,8,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500267,0

The article uses a neo-Polanyian instituted economic process' approach to explore and explain the uniquely high level of bogus self-employment in the UK construction industry, facilitated by confused law and stimulated by a bespoke construction fiscal regime, resulting in endemic tax evasion. It examines how the co-evolution of employment status law and a sector-specific fiscal regime maps tightly onto the emergence of mass self-employment, as evidenced by comparative labour market and sectoral statistics. Seeing competition as an instituted process within these distinctive market arrangements, it identifies a form of degenerative competition', driving out both genuine direct-employment and self-employment, and driving in bogus self-employment, with its attendant substantial fiscal losses, failed skill reproduction and poor productivity.","[Behling, Felix] Maynooth Univ, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland; [Harvey, Mark] Univ Essex, Dept Sociol, Ctr Res Econ Sociol & Innovat, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",Maynooth University; University of Essex,"Behling, F (通讯作者)，Maynooth Univ, Natl Inst Reg & Spatial Anal, Maynooth, Kildare, Ireland.",felix.behling@nuim.ie,,"Harvey, Mark/0000-0001-5486-7257",,,,,70,55,57,2,29,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Most existing studies on the topic of changing nutrition patterns measure dietary quality by single macronutrient indicators or anthropometric outcomes. However, such an approach is often too narrow to provide a picture of overall dietary quality and is sometimes even misleading. This study contributes to the existing literature by taking into account that the analysis of dietary quality comprises two dimensions: the adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, as well as the moderate intake of nutrients that increase the risk of chronic diseases. Thereby, we apply Grossman's health investment model to the analysis of the demand for dietary quality, explicitly addressing the different dimensions of dietary quality and the intertemporal character of health investments. We apply our approach to Russia using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey from 1996 to 2008. Our results show that intake levels of vitamins and minerals as well as saturated and total fatty acids increased after 1998 along with economic recovery, while the intake of fiber decreased. Our econometric results imply an income elasticity of vitamins and minerals of 0.051, and an income elasticity of fats of 0.073. Overall, our results are in line with an ongoing nutrition transition in the Russian Federation, which is marked by decreasing deficiencies in vitamins and minerals, as well as the increasing consumption of fats with its accompanying negative health consequences.

Using a panel data set from Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS), several health measures such as poor general health status (poor GHS), hypertension, and low body mass index (low BMI) are examined. We find that for all health measures, recent past bad health has a small impact on current bad health once conditioning on individual fixed effects. For instance, in the case of poor GHS, the elderly with poor GHS in the recent past are only 4% points more likely to have poor GHS in the subsequent period compared to their counterparts.

As a remedy we propose a number of new shrinkage parameters based on the Liu (Commun Stat 22:393-402, 1993) estimator. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluate the robustness of all models for different data-generating processes under varying conditions such as altered sample sizes and error distributions. In the simulation study it is demonstrated that the Liu estimator, which is robust to multicollinearity, systematically outperforms the traditionally applied OLS approach. The simple reason is that interaction models by definition always induce substantial multicollinearity, which in turn distorts the inference of OLS. Conversely, the Liu estimator is robust against multicollinearity in interaction-term models. The advantages of our Liu-based method are also demonstrated in practice when examining the efficiency of the Swedish power retailing market. By the use of this unique data set we find strong evidence of positive asymmetric price transmission effects. Increases in Nord Pool electricity wholesale spot prices lead to immediate and full increases in the electricity retail prices, but decreases in Nord Pool prices are not completely passed down or are delayed before being passed down to consumers. This finding suggests evidence of inefficient and unjust wealth transfers from consumers to retailers in the Swedish power market.","[Shukur, Ghazi; Mansson, Kristofer; Sjolander, Par] Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Jonkoping, Sweden; [Shukur, Ghazi; Sjolander, Par] HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Shukur, Ghazi] Linnaeus Univ, Dept Econ & Stat, Vaxjo, Sweden; [Mansson, Kristofer] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ, Gothenburg, Sweden",Jonkoping University; Linnaeus University; University of Gothenburg,"Sjölander, P (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Univ, Dept Econ Finance & Stat, Jonkoping, Sweden.",ghazi.shukur@lnu.se; kristofer.mansson@jibs.hj.se; par.sjolander@jibs.hj.se,,,Torsten Soderberg Foundation,Torsten Soderberg Foundation,We would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of the Torsten Soderberg Foundation.,,15,6,6,0,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

In this paper, we apply Bayesian procedures as a numerical tool for the estimation of a female labor supply model based on a sample size that is typical for common household panels. We provide two important results for the practitioner: First, for a specification with a multivariate normal distribution for the unobserved heterogeneity, the Bayesian MCMC estimator yields almost identical results as a classical maximum simulated likelihood (MSL) estimator. Second, we show that when imposing distributional assumptions that are consistent with economic theory, e.g., log-normally distributed consumption preferences, the Bayesian method performs well and provides reasonable estimates, while the MSL estimator does not converge. These results indicate that Bayesian procedures can be a beneficial tool for the estimation of intertemporal discrete choice models.","[Haan, Peter; Kemptner, Daniel; Uhlendorff, Arne] DIW, D-10108 Berlin, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Uhlendorff, Arne] IZA, Bonn, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; University of Mannheim; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Haan, P (通讯作者)，DIW, Mohrenstr 58, D-10108 Berlin, Germany.",phaan@diw.de; dkemptner@diw.de; uhlendorff@uni-mannheim.de,"Uhlendorff, Arne/AAS-6187-2020","Uhlendorff, Arne/0000-0002-2823-4445","Thyssen foundation [10112085, 10141098]",Thyssen foundation,"The authors would like to thank Joerg Breitung, Carsten Trenkler, Victoria Prowse, Arthur van Soest, and Louis Raes for valuable comments.

We re-examine the argument that under-representation of MEPs (Members of the European Parliament) from new Member States on these key posts after enlargement might have been due to a 'learning phase'. We find that MEPs from newer Member States remain considerably less likely to act as rapporteurs during the second term after enlargement (2009-14). Most importantly, this trend also holds for shadow rapporteurships under the co-decision procedure, which is when they matter most. This structural under-representation entails important implications for European integration, most importantly that MEPs from newer Member States are less able to influence legislation. We suggest that the patterns we find could be the result of reduced willingness, a more limited skill set, or a structural disadvantage of MEPs from the accession states in the report allocation process.","[Hurka, Steffen] Univ Munich, DE-80538 Munich, Germany; [Kaeding, Michael] Univ Duisburg Essen, Essen, Germany; [Obholzer, Lukas] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Munich; University of Duisburg Essen; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Hurka, S (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Oettingenstr 67, DE-80538 Munich, Germany.",steffen.hurka@gsi.uni-muenchen.de,"Hurka, Steffen/AAD-4931-2020","Hurka, Steffen/0000-0001-7735-522X; Kaeding, Michael/0000-0002-3554-0387",,,,,45,20,21,0,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

In sum, work history related characteristics like marital status, income or retirement age strongly influence individuals' replacement rates.

While in the 1990s, most regional branches of federal ministries were under control of regional governors, and Vladimir Putin replaced the heads of agencies with new bureaucrats in the 2000s, thereby cutting their connections to the regions. This paper finds a robust influence of symbolic gestures made by regional governments in the earlier bargaining process on appointments, even controlling for the actual policies.

The present paper tests this conjecture in a three-person power-to-take experiment. Two takers decide which fraction of the responder's endowment to transfer to themselves; the responder decides which part of the endowment to destroy. Thus, responders can punish greedy takers, but only at a cost to themselves. We modify the game by letting the responder participate in takers' transfer decisions and consider the effect of low/high levels of participation on the destruction rate. We find that participation matters, but only under special conditions: Responders with participation rights destroy significantly less only if they (1) have reciprocal inclinations, and (2) are confronted with highly unfavorable outcomes. Thus, in line with standard economic modeling and leading classes of behavioral theories, our data suggest that procedural effects of decision making are mostly negligible.","[Mertins, Vanessa] Univ Vechta, Business Adm & Social Serv Management, D-49377 Vechta, Germany; [Albert, Max] JLU Giessen, Chair Behav & Inst Econ, D-35394 Giessen, Germany",Justus Liebig University Giessen,"Mertins, V (通讯作者)，Univ Vechta, Business Adm & Social Serv Management, Driverstr 23, D-49377 Vechta, Germany.",vanessa.mertins@uni-vechta.de,"Albert, Max/AAF-8027-2020; Mertins, Vanessa/JYQ-3319-2024","Albert, Max/0000-0002-0097-1654; Mertins, Vanessa/0000-0002-2843-7381",,,,,66,1,1,0,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

We show that not all workers benefit from the agglomeration economies created by the dense central business district. Low-skilled workers in the suburban district are worse off by being close to the dense central business district. High-skilled workers gain more from the urban scale. The existence of labor mobility costs induces only high-skilled workers in the suburbs to commute to the central business district which results in a decrease in the local contact efficiency for the left-behind low-skilled workers.

We find that: (1) choices are responsive to the cost of helping and hurting others; (2) The weight a decision maker places on others' monetary payoffs depends on whether the decision maker is in an advantageous or disadvantageous relative position; and (3) We find no evidence of reciprocity of the type linked to menu-dependence. The results of a mixture-model estimation show considerable heterogeneity in subjects' motivations and confirm the absence of reciprocal motives. Pure selfish behavior is the most frequently observed behavior.

This has led scholars to believe that development and urbanization are not always correlated, either across space or over time. In this paper, we use historical data at both the country level and city level over the five centuries between 1500-2010 to revisit the topic of urbanization without growth (Fay and Opal, 2000). In particular, we first establish that, although urbanization and income remain highly correlated within any given year, urbanization is 25-30 percentage points higher in 2010 than in 1500 at every level of income per capita. Second, while historically this shift in urbanization rates was more noticeable at the upper tail of the income distribution, i.e. for richer countries, it is now particularly visible at the lower tail, i.e. for poorer countries. Third, these patterns suggest that different factors may have explained the shift in different periods of time. We use the discussion of these factors as an opportunity to provide a survey of the literature and summarize our knowledge of what drives the urbanization process over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The study relies on qualitative data to analyse the extent to and circumstances under which these structures promote the organizational inclusion of migrant workers. The analysis suggests that union procedures based on participatory democracy have a positive effect on organizational inclusion as compared to top-down and centrally driven procedures. The findings underline the importance of trade union support in the functioning of special structures and the relevance of union identity and organizational structure in explaining the differences across these two national cases.

Why do some states prefer the creation of state-centered networks, while others advocate technocratic networks? This article addresses this question by examining the creation of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) in 1999. It advances an argument about how domestic regulatory structures and state power explain the variation in regulatory networks that empower certain actors over others in shaping global financial regulation. This article finds that while the USA favored a state-centered FSF, driven by finance ministries, European states preferred a technocratic forum, driven by international bodies. This is because the USA can secure control of state-centered networks given its bargaining weight, while European states tried to constrain US power through technocratic structures, especially under conditions of domestic regulatory fragmentation. The final outcome was a state-centered FSF dictated by the USA. By analyzing primary archival material and interviews with key policymakers, this study sheds light on the state preferences and bargaining capabilities of G7 states. This article also generates portable and testable implications for the creation of other regulatory networks.","[Reisenbichler, Alexander] George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Reisenbichler, A (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Dept Polit Sci, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",reisenb@gwu.edu,,"Reisenbichler, Alexander/0000-0002-8024-9521",,,,,96,7,8,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Mediator effectiveness is analysed along two dimensions: goal-attainment and conflict settlement. Investigation of the conditions of mediator effectiveness is structured around four key sets of variables: mediator leverage, mediation strategy, coherence and the conflict's context. In our empirical analysis of EU mediation between Serbia and Kosovo (Belgrade-Pristina dialogue) we find that the medium degree of EU effectiveness (both in terms of goal-attainment and conflict settlement) can be explained by its great leverage vis-a-vis the conflict parties due to their EU membership aspirations and its strategy of a mix of manipulation and formulation that draws on this leverage to move parties toward agreement through the use of positive incentives. A limited degree of EU coherence and spoiler problems in Northern Kosovo seem to have had a constraining influence on EU effectiveness.","[Bergmann, Julian; Niemann, Arne] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, D-55099 Mainz, Germany",Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Niemann, A (通讯作者)，Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Jakob Welder Weg 12, D-55099 Mainz, Germany.",arne.niemann@uni-mainz.de,,,"German Foundation for Peace Research (Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung, DSF)","German Foundation for Peace Research (Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung, DSF)","This article presents the main results of a pilot study on 'The European Union's Effectiveness as Mediator in Peace Negotiations' funded by the German Foundation for Peace Research (Deutsche Stiftung Friedensforschung, DSF), whose support is gratefully acknowledged.

We employ quantile regression techniques to estimate conditional quantile functions for longitudinal data. We show that country of origin, country of residence, and gender are all important determinants of earnings differentials. A large wage penalty occurs in the USA among female immigrants from non-English speaking countries, and the penalty is most negative among the lowest (conditional) wages. On the other hand, women in Britain experience hardly any immigrant-native wage differential. We find evidence suggesting that immigrant men in the USA earn lower wages, while British workers emigrating from English-speaking countries earn higher wages. The various differentials we report in this paper reveal the value of employing panel data quantile regression in estimating and better understanding immigrant wage effects.","[Billger, Sherrilyn M.] Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA; [Lamarche, Carlos] Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 335A, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA",Illinois State University; University of Kentucky,"Lamarche, C (通讯作者)，Univ Kentucky, Gatton Coll Business & Econ 335A, Dept Econ, Lexington, KY 40506 USA.",smbillg@ilstu.edu; clamarche@uky.edu,,,,,,,48,4,5,0,20,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

These sale systems are dependent on the honesty of customers and can only tolerate a certain share of free-riders. In an experimental field study, we investigate a case where honesty has almost disappeared, namely an honor system for the sale of newspapers on weekends. In the chosen urban study area, only a minority of customers comply with payment norms. In this difficult setting, we tested the use of eye images and descriptive social norms as cues to improving payment morale over a period of 24 weeks. We find that interventions based on eye cues as well as normative appeals do not evoke a transition from low to high levels of honesty. However, our results suggest that such interventions might still have the potential to marginally increase mean payments and therefore be economically profitable for operators of large-scale honor systems.","[Brudermann, Thomas; Seebauer, Sebastian] Graz Univ, A-8010 Graz, Austria; [Bartel, Gregory; Fenzl, Thomas] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt Worthersee, Austria",University of Graz,"Brudermann, T (通讯作者)，Graz Univ, Merangasse 18-1, A-8010 Graz, Austria.",Thomas.Brudermann@uni-graz.at,"Brudermann, Thomas/ABH-3138-2020","Brudermann, Thomas/0000-0003-4133-3322; Fenzl, Thomas/0000-0002-9310-3601; Seebauer, Sebastian/0000-0003-4592-9529",,,,,32,15,17,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,SEP,2015,79.0,2.0,,,,,285,306,,10.1007/s11238-014-9460-1,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CU1DD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363258800006,0

We characterize the equilibria of the model using a conditional sincerity concept that takes into account the possibility that some voters may be simultaneously decisive in both elections. Such a concept emerges naturally in a model with trembles. A crucial feature of the solution is the moderation of Government.

Subordination level should in theory reflect the underlying credit risk of the CMBS pool. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that subordination is purely about credit risk as intended. We find a very weak relation between subordination levels and both the ex post and ex ante measures of credit risk, rejecting our null-hypothesis. Alternatively, we find that subordination levels were driven by non-credit risk factors, including supply and demand factors, deal complexity, issuer incentive and a general time trend. We conclude that contrary to the traditional view, the subordination level is not just a function of credit risk. Instead it also reflects the market need of a certain deal structure and is influenced by the balance of power among issuers, CRAs and investors.","[An, Xudong] San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Deng, Yongheng] Natl Univ Singapore, Inst Real Estate Studies, Singapore 119613, Singapore; [Nichols, Joseph B.] Board Governors Fed Reserve, Washington, DC USA; [Sanders, Anthony B.] George Mason Univ, Sch Management, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; National University of Singapore; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; George Mason University,"An, XD (通讯作者)，San Diego State Univ, Dept Finance, San Diego, CA 92182 USA.",xan@mail.sdsu.edu; ydeng@nus.edu.sg; joseph.b.nichols@frb.gov; asander7@gmu.edu,"Deng, Yongheng/A-4272-2010","Deng, Yongheng/0000-0002-4438-5171; Nichols, Joseph/0009-0005-0968-2655",Real Estate Research Institute (RERI),Real Estate Research Institute (RERI),"We are grateful to Peter DeMarzo, Michael Dewally, Mark Flannery, Sally Gordon, Dwight Jaffee, Tim Riddiough, Amit Seru, Walt Torous, Sean Wilkoff and participants at the 2007 RERI Research Conference, 2013 AREUEA Annual Meetings, the 2013 MFA Conference and the 2013 AREUEA International Conference for helpful comments.

To achieve transportation sustainability and continued economic development, the dependency on private vehicles must be decreased by increasing public transportation usage. However, without knowing the key factors that affect public transportation usage, developing strategies that effectively improve public transportation usage is impossible. Therefore, this study respectively applies global and local regression models to identify the key factors of usage rates for 348 regions (township or districts) in Taiwan. The global regression model, the Tobit regression model (TRM), is used to estimate one set of parameters that are associated with explanatory variables and explain regional differences in usage rates, while the local regression model, geographically weighted regression (GWR), estimates parameters differently depending on spatial correlations among neighbouring regions. By referencing related studies, 32 potential explanatory variables in four categories, social-economic, land use, public transportation, and private transportation, are chosen. Model performance is compared in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and spatial autocorrelation coefficient (Moran' I). Estimation results show that the GWR model has better prediction accuracy and better accommodation of spatial autocorrelation. Seven variables are significantly tested, and most have parameters that differ across regions in Taiwan. Based on these findings, strategies are proposed that improve public transportation usage.

Instrumental variable (IV) estimators are known to estimate effects only for the compliers, representing a subset of the entire population. By combining IV with matching, we can estimate the treatment effects for the always- and never-takers as well. Since in many cases these groups are the (endogenous) outcome of some assignment process, such estimates also help in judging the implications of such a selection process. In our application to the effects of participation in active labour market programmes in Switzerland, we find large and lasting positive employment effects for the compliers, whereas the effects for the always- and never-participants are small. In addition, the compliers have worse employment outcomes without treatment than those who participate in the programme with or without the intervention under investigation. This suggests that the earlier assignment policy of the caseworkers was inefficient in that the always-participants were neither those unemployed who would experience the highest expected treatment effects nor those unemployed who had the largest need for assistance.

We also present a new data augmentation technique which allows us to transform the likelihood function of a binary probit model into one which allows for a fractional response. In contrast to Frequentist estimation of the PFP models, Bayesian methods allow for direct evaluation of the joint likelihood of the fractional response, thereby leading to gains in estimation efficiency. Furthermore, transitioning from the strictly exogenous case to the case of endogeneity only requires slight adjustments and this allows for straightforward model specification tests. Combining data from the Florida Department of Education, National Center of Education Statistics, and the U.S. Census Bureau, the model is applied empirically in order to examine the relationship between school spending and student achievement among Florida elementary schools. The study finds that greater spending has a positive and statistically significant effect on student achievement. Though, this effect is roughly 50 % larger in the model which allows for endogenous spending. Specifically, a $1,000 increase in per-pupil spending is associated with an increase in standardized test pass rates ranging from 6.2 to 10.1 %.","[Kessler, Lawrence M.] Univ Tennessee, Ctr Business & Econ Res, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Kessler, Lawrence M.] Univ Tennessee, Dept Econ, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA; [Munkin, Murat K.] Univ S Florida, Dept Econ, Tampa, FL 33620 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida,"Kessler, LM (通讯作者)，Univ Tennessee, Ctr Business & Econ Res, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",lkessler@utk.edu; mmunkin@usf.edu,,"Kessler, Lawrence/0000-0002-2953-8838",,,,,56,5,7,1,13,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Using a grounded, qualitative factor analysis approach, it investigates the elements that influence the adoption (and non-adoption) of ridesharing and identifies market segments and business models that may enable planners to overcome existing barriers. The article finds that Danish drivers and commuters appear to be split on the topic. Negative perceptions reported by respondents include lack of availability and difficulty finding rides, viewing ridesharing as unsafe or unsecure, and expectations of social awkwardness, among others. Positive perceptions reported include cost savings compared to public and private transport, greater flexibility of travel times, and the ability to socialize with vehicle occupants. These contrasting views lead us to conclude that existing theories and models of ridesharing behavior may need to be fundamentally rethought, both in Denmark and possibly elsewhere. Our results also suggest that ridesharing efforts framed around climate change or environmental sustainability will not likely be successful in Denmark. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Ostensibly produced as a means of conserving land in South-East Asia, a commodity called 'certified sustainable palm oil' has been created by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and exchanged on its own international trading platform completely independently of the flow of physical palm oil. In this way, sustainability has acquired a precise pecuniary value and can be bought by 'socially responsible' companies to offset their use of conventional and potentially environmentally destructive palm oil. This is yet another instance of the commodification of nature, but of a kind largely unexplored in the literature because it has emerged without formal governmental authority. What this case adds analytically to the study of capitalism and environmentalism is two-fold. First, what is commonly described as non-state, market-driven governance must now be seen as actively market-making. Second, rather than foreclosing politics by moving outside the state and within markets, the fragile authority of the RSPO has opened space for activists and other interest groups to challenge both the regulatory mechanisms and social purpose of primary commodity governance.","Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England",University of Warwick,"Richardson, B (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Polit & Int Studies, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",b.j.richardson@warwick.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,28,29,0,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

We highlight the effect of unintended increases in out-of-state emissions on the efficacy of overlapping state policies. We show that emission taxes do not necessarily prevent a completely offsetting increase in out-of-state emissions when states add a state-level emissions tax to the national emissions tax. In particular, states small relative to their market will be unable to reduce national emissions with a state-level CO2 tax or a system of tradable permits. However, under a national cap-and-trade regime that allows states to be carved out, a state of any size can reduce national emissions by setting a tighter state cap. This combination yields a lower total cost than the equivalent combination of national and state CO2 taxes (if one exists) but increases the cost to consumers outside the market.","[Accordino, Megan H.] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA; [Rajagopal, Deepak] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Rajagopal, Deepak] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Rajagopal, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Los Angeles, Inst Environm & Sustainabil, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",maccordino@ucla.edu; rdeepak@ioes.ucla.edu,,,,,,,15,3,3,1,15,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3.0,,,,,189,207,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.macc,0.0,,,19,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100008,0

This study develops measures employing accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity for an entire public transportation service chain as indicators for evaluating public transport services, prioritizes underperforming scenarios from the perspective of urban travelers, and derives various market segmentation strategies that consider different socio-demographic characteristics. A conceptual model is set up herein to assess these latent constructs that describe unobservable and immeasurable characteristics. As a Likert ordinal scale can generate misleading statistical inferences, the Rasch model is used to eliminate bias generated by an ordinal scale when measuring these three latent constructs separately. The Rasch model compares person parameters with item parameters, which are then subjected to logarithmic transformation along a logit scale so as to recognize specific difficulties of service scenarios that cannot be easily eliminated by certain urban travelers. The multidimensional Rasch model also measures the perceptions of urban travelers in terms of the interactions between accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity of this public transportation system. While comparing urban travelers of two large cities in Taiwan, Taipei and Kaohsiung, the empirical results demonstrate that perceived accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity differ based on travelers' age, frequency of weekly sports activities, and environmental awareness. This paper also advances appropriate improvement strategies and provides policy suggestions for urban planners, public transportation service operation agencies, and policy makers when they seek to create user-friendly public transportation services. The proposed approach can be generalized in other cities by considering their local context uniqueness and further evaluating their public transport services. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Secondly, our findings affirm that the true historical volatility of autoregressive lagged de-smoothed returns is a reasonable estimate of international direct real estate risk premiums. Thirdly, we find that changes in macroeconomic and real estate variables explain the office and retail returns more than the residential returns. There is also a high vacancy rate risk premium that we attribute to country-specific, institutional environmental factors. Furthermore, the South Asia direct real estate risk premium is found to be higher than that for North Asia. Moreover the risk premiums for North and South Asia are higher than that for the US.

Using data from the 2010 Mexican census, we exploit the age and locality population thresholds to identify the effects of the program, which at the time operated only in localities with less than 30,000 inhabitants. We find that the program reduces the labor force participation of elderly men, particularly those who live alone and who are relatively poor, but has a much weaker effect on that of elderly women. The program has no statistically significant effect on the labor force participation of either prime-age men or women who live with potential beneficiaries, and it has a negative and significant effect on the labor force participation of boys age 12-17, particularly those in the lowest wealth quintiles, but not on that of same-age girls.

I show that a larger endowment of population or resources can be immiserizing for the economy as a whole. With a larger population, the economy grows at a higher rate but per-capita income from asset holdings falls unambiguously. Since people voluntarily contribute a part of their instantaneous income toward the public good, reduced asset income may lead to lower level of provision of the public good. This brings in the possibility of immiserizing growth where higher rate of growth is associated with lower level of welfare. I also show that the socially optimum level of public good provision may well fall below the equilibrium level and that the problem of underprovision of the public good need not be aggravated in larger economies.","Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, New Delhi 110016, India",Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Delhi,"Mondal, D (通讯作者)，Indian Inst Technol Delhi, Dept Humanities & Social Sci, Room MS 000, New Delhi 110016, India.",debasis36@yahoo.com,,,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,Indian Institute of Technology Delhi,"I wish to thank the Editor, the Editor-in-Charge Professor Francois Paul Maniquet and two anonymous referees for their constructive comments made on the previous version of this paper.

We relate team performance (in terms of points gained and goals scored and conceded) to the respective days of rests that teams have had after their previous match, controlling for several measures of teams' abilities. Using different estimators we show that, under the current structure of major international tournaments, there are no relevant effects of enjoying different days of rest on team performance. However, we find that before 1990s days of rest had a positive impact on performance, presumably because athletic preparation of players was less effective.

More specifically, how the spatial and temporal dynamics of the UK housing market ensure that homeownership does not (and arguably cannot) deliver welfare provision in the way envisioned by asset-based welfare initiatives. The first section demonstrates the fundamental problem of conceptualising households as asset-holders; in particular, with regard to housing-based welfare strategies and as part of financialised growth strategies in the UK, more generally. We show that continuing to assume residential housing is a static and unchanging asset-class depoliticises how asset-based welfare intensifies household indebtedness. The second section demonstrates the temporal, spatial and social limits of homeownership in the UK. We argue that the financialisation of housing in the UK is a unique set of political and economic circumstances that cannot be repeated; therefore, current gains from residential housing are a one-off wealth windfall to particular (lucky) groups within society. The temporal and spatial limits of gains from residential housing mean that the same conditions cannot be repeated (often enough) in the way required for residential housing to provide a generalisable welfare function.

Migrants offered the greatest degree of control accumulated the most savings.

In contrast with previous research, findings suggest that in this particular instance support for the EU across Member States was affected by economic factors. In particular, both higher unemployment and higher interest rates were strongly associated with lower levels of support. Findings also suggest that young Europeans responded more strongly to adverse economic conditions during the crisis. Even though young citizens tend to have more positive attitudes towards the EU than older people, this difference has been significantly reduced in contexts of higher interest rates.","[Gomez, Raul] Univ Derby, Derby DE22 1GB, England",University of Derby,"Gomez, R (通讯作者)，Univ Derby, Dept Sociol, Kedleston Rd, Derby DE22 1GB, England.",r.gomez@derby.ac.uk,"Gomez, Raul/F-4916-2016","Gomez, Raul/0000-0002-6810-0628",,,,,44,36,38,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

If those enrolled in ABP programs offered by utilities and other service providers forgo inspection of their recurring bills, then price salience declines, prices perceived by boundedly rational agents fall, and consumption increases. This paper considers the impact of such programs on consumer demand and welfare and empirically tests whether enrollment in such programs increases demand. Results show ABP enrollment increases residential electricity consumption by 4.0% and commercial electricity consumption by as much as 8.1%.

It is argued here that a focus on formal equality has been at the expense of a more critical analysis of the employment relations consequences. The central role given to performance measurement allows employers considerable discretion over when employees retire and the scope for bargained outcomes in the new regime is limited. This may be to the detriment of older workers and will have implications for the workforce as a whole. Equality, in other words, may come at the expense of a broader conception of fairness.","[Beck, Vanessa] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Employment Studies, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Williams, Glynne] Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ind Relat, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England",University of Leicester; University of Leicester,"Beck, V (通讯作者)，Univ Leicester, Sch Management, Ken Edwards Bldg,Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England.",vab9@leicester.ac.uk,,"Beck, Vanessa/0000-0002-9024-1910",,,,,39,12,15,0,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

It is generally taken for granted that the rise of new powers is simply a reflection of their growing economic might. In this article, however, I challenge this assumption by drawing on the case of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to show that the forces driving the rise of new powers are more heterogeneous and complex than suggested by a simple economic determinism. I argue that these countries have in fact taken different paths to power: while China's rise has been more closely tied to its growing economic might, the rise of Brazil and India has been driven primarily by their mobilization and leadership of developing country coalitions, which enabled them to exercise influence above their economic weight. One important result is that Brazil and India have assumed a more aggressive and activist position in WTO negotiations than China and played a greater role in shaping the agenda of the Doha Round. Thus, although the new powers are frequently grouped together (as the 'BRICs', for example), this masks considerable variation in their sources of power and behaviour in global economic governance.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Okanagan, BC, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of British Columbia Okanagan,"Hopewell, K (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Sociol, Okanagan, BC, Canada.",,,,"US National Science Foundation [0927598]; Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada [75220060755]; Fulbright Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0927598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [0927598] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","US National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Fulbright Fellowship; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This research was supported by the US National Science Foundation (Grant No. 0927598), the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (Grant No. 75220060755), and a Fulbright Fellowship.",,75,94,104,6,99,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

At the same time, there have been critical voices against China's Keynesian measures. This article therefore asks: To what extent was China's response to the global financial crisis Keynesian? What factors determined the Chinese characteristics of Keynesian policy both in design and in implementation? It points out that China did follow a Keynesian formula in its crisis response, boosted infrastructure construction, GDP growth and created some employment. However, Chinese Keynesianism is a vulgarised version that is merged with its developmental state model. It simply boasted a big state and massive deficit spending, and socialised investment without really benefiting consumers or the private sector. This article also provides an analysis of how ideational and institutional politics in China vulgarised Keynesianism and exacerbated socio-economic problems. Ideational politics included the dominance of Keynesian discourse at the beginning of the crisis and an obsession with short-term results. Institutional factors included 'firework' local government politics, the state being captured by state-owned enterprises and a concentration of central distributive power without proper monitoring over implementation.","[Jiang, Yang] Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark",Aarhus University; Danish Institute for International Studies,"Jiang, Y (通讯作者)，Danish Inst Int Studies, Copenhagen, Denmark.",,,,,,,,129,13,13,2,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0969-2290,1466-4526,,REV INT POLIT ECON,Rev.

Finite memory of measurement errors is allowed for. Two GMM specializations are considered: (i) using instruments (IVs) in levels for a differenced version of the equation and (ii) using IVs in differences for the level version. Index sets for lags and leads are convenient in examining how the potential IV-set is affected by changes in the memory pattern. While measurement errors with long memory may give an IV-set too small for identification, problems of IV proliferation and weak IVs may arise unless the panel is short. An application based on data for (log-transformed) capital stock and output from Norwegian manufacturing firms, supplemented with Monte Carlo simulations, to illustrate finite sample biases, is considered. Overall, with respect to bias and IV strength, GMM specialization (ii) seems superior to inference using GMM specialization (i).","Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, N-0317 Oslo, Norway",University of Oslo,"Biorn, E (通讯作者)，Univ Oslo, Dept Econ, POB 1095, N-0317 Oslo, Norway.",erik.biorn@econ.uio.no,,,,,,,40,4,4,1,17,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

J,"Jinjarak, Y",,,,"Jinjarak, Yothin",,,"Supply Chains, Global Financial Shocks and Firm Behaviour towards Liquidity Needs",WORLD ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,TRADE CREDIT; BUSINESS; NETWORKS; POLICY,"Driven by the increasingly important role of supply chains in global production, this paper studies empirical association between global credit-market shocks and firm behaviour towards liquidity needs across countries and industries. Focusing on the adjustment of working-capital financing, we find two pieces of supporting evidence from international firm-level panel data covering the period 2002:I-2012:IV. First, for industries where specific investment in the input supplier-customer relationship is large, firms are more exposed to credit-market shocks. We find that measures of global credit-market shocks are negatively associated with trade receivables, trade payables and inventories, conditional on the level of contract intensity in the industries where firms operate.

Results show that multiple factors influence purchasing behavior; these factors include the amount of the seat fee, how far in advance the ticket is purchased, the number of passengers traveling together, and load factors (as revealed through seat map displays). We find that customers are between 2 and 3.3 times more likely to purchase premium coach seats (with extra legroom and early boarding privileges) when there are no regular coach window or aisle seats that can be reserved for free. In addition, we find that customers who purchase tickets closer to the departure date are less price-sensitive and are willing to pay higher seat fees. We use these model results to show that Jet Blue's seat fees are currently underpriced in many markets; an optimal static fee would increase revenues by 8% whereas optimal time-dependent fees would increase revenues by 10.2%. In addition, ifJet-Blue were to leave their seat fees unchanged and instead reserve certain rows of seats for premier customers, they could potentially increase revenues by 12.8%.

It even is the key for cooperative competitiveness. Active membership, however, decreases in many cooperatives. Thus, it is important to know what galvanizes members to become active members. The cooperative's value and the cooperative's offers motivate some members to become active members, but certainly not all of them. Therefore, more work needs to be done to understand the social attributes that transform members into active members. In this paper the incentives that sustain members' participation over time and the contribution of members' active participation in the cooperative's competitive advantage are studied. Empirical evidence is provided via a questionnaire completed by 241 cooperative members of a Dutch feed supply cooperative and interviews with cooperative experts. Results show that active membership builds on social attributes, such as cooperative culture, open communication, trust, involvement, and the willingness to be active. It is explained that these social attributes create benefits for both the cooperative and its members. Finally, suggestions are presented to stimulate active cooperative membership.","[Verhees, Frans J. H.

This paper argues that competition for export markets and political support prevents donor countries from coordinating their aid activities between one another. To test these hypotheses, we perform logit and fractional logit estimations for a large sample of recipient countries and aid activities since the early 1970s. Our empirical results reveal that export competition between donors is a major impediment to aid coordination. Although less conclusive, we also find some evidence that donors' competition over political support prevents them from coordinating aid activities more closely.","[Fuchs, Andreas] Heidelberg Univ, Res Ctr Distribut Conflict & Globalizat, Heidelberg, Germany; [Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany",Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Fuchs, A (通讯作者)，Heidelberg Univ, Res Ctr Distribut Conflict & Globalizat, Heidelberg, Germany.",,"Fuchs, Andreas/H-3956-2019","Fuchs, Andreas/0000-0002-6309-5954",German Research Foundation [DFG GZ: DR 640/2-2],German Research Foundation(German Research Foundation (DFG)),We thank participants at seminars at Heidelberg University and at the conference on 'Fragmentation or Pluralism?

To control for possible endogeneity of the FDI decision, I employ propensity score matching combined with a difference-in-differences approach. The results indicate that relative to HMT-acquired firms, OECD-acquired firms experience significantly higher productivity in the initial year of acquisition and this productivity differential persists in subsequent years, reaching 27.8 per cent by the third year. Further, OECD-acquired firms exhibit higher profits, average wages and capital per worker compared to HMT-acquired firms. These results suggest that the origin of the foreign investor differentially affects target firm performance.","US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA",,"Kamal, F (通讯作者)，US Bur Census, Washington, DC 20233 USA.",,,,,,,,41,8,8,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2015,38.0,2.0,,,,,286,314,,10.1111/twec.12147,0.0,,,29,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CB4SQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349618800003,0

This mite is highly polyphagous and can be easily found in clementine orchards, both in the trees and in the associated flora. In a previous study we found that the use of a cover of Festuca arundinacea Schreber (Poaceae) offered a better regulation of T. urticae populations than either bare soil or the traditional wild cover, which included a mix of weed species. We hypothesized that the selection of two host races of T. urticae, specialized in F. arundinacea and C. clementina, could partly explain the results obtained in field studies (bottom-up regulation). Reciprocal transplant experiments show that sympatric deme x host combinations had higher mean fitness values for most of the parameters evaluated than the allopatric combinations in clementine, but not in F. arundinacea. Because local adaptation implies mean deme fitness to be systematically higher for the sympatric deme x habitat combinations than for the allopatric ones, these results can be taken as indicative of occurrence of local adaptation in T. urticae. Molecular genetic analyses with microsatellite markers support this conclusion and indicate that host adaptation of T. urticae found in our system may indeed contribute to a better natural regulation of this mite.","[Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina; Pina, Tatiana; Antonia Gomez-Martinez, Maria; Hurtado, Monica A.; Jacas, Josep A.] UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",Universitat Jaume I,"Aguilar-Fenollosa, E (通讯作者)，UJI, Unitat Associada Entomol UJI IVIA, Dept Ciencies Agr & Medi Nat, Castellon de La Plana, Spain.",aguilare@uji.es,"Hurtado, Mónica Asunción/L-1474-2016; Jaques, Josep A./B-8352-2009; Pina, Tatiana/AAC-3928-2022; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/F-6359-2011","Hurtado, Mónica Asunción/0000-0003-2678-941X; Jaques, Josep A./0000-0003-1353-1727; Pina, Tatiana/0000-0002-3074-4751; Aguilar-Fenollosa, Ernestina/0000-0002-1070-3741",,,,,26,0,0,0,11,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1129,1132,,,,,,4,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600142,0

This distinction can be captured in a Bayesian model where uncertainty is represented by the agent's subjective belief over the parameter governing future income streams. Whether uncertainty reduces to ordinary risk depends on the agent's ability to smooth consumption. Uncertainty can have a major behavioral and economic impact, including precautionary behavior that may appear overly conservative to an outside observer. We argue that one of the main characteristics of uncertain beliefs is that they are not empirical, in the sense that they cannot be objectively tested to determine whether they are right or wrong. This can confound empirical methods that assume rational expectations.","[Al-Najjar, Nabil I.] Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Weinstein, Jonathan] Washington Univ, St Louis, MO USA",Northwestern University; Washington University (WUSTL),"Al-Najjar, NI (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Kellogg Sch Management, Dept Managerial Econ & Decis Sci, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",al-najjar@northwestern.edu; jweinstein22@wustl.edu,,,,,,,13,11,11,0,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JAN,2015,78.0,1.0,,,,,1,22,,10.1007/s11238-013-9404-1,0.0,,,22,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ3JQ,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348123800001,0

Specifically, we examine the relationship between how broadly organizations search across diverse knowledge domains in the invention process (i.e., their search breadth) and the technological generality of resulting inventive outcomes. Design/methodology/approach - We use patent data in order to identify inventions developed in the green energy sector. In particular, we refer to the IPC Green Inventory for patent collection. For the purpose of this study, we pose our attention to the Alternative Energy Production and Energy Conservation classes. Hence, we collected all the patents successfully filed at the U.S. PTO. from 1971 to 2009 that refer to the two green technological classes above mentioned. Since our aim is to assess the influence of an organization's breadth of search on the level of an invention's technological generality, the single patent is used as the unit of analysis. Our dependent variable assumes values that range from zero to one. In this case, a Tobit regression model is more appropriate for hypothesis testing. Originality/value - We reveal that search breadth is curvilinearly related to an invention's technological generality. Furthermore, we assess if a geographically dispersed inventive team moderates the costs and benefits of searching broadly, showing that it makes organizations more able to benefit from a wider search breadth Practical implications - Managers are advised of the double-edge word of a wide search breadth for the development of GPTs. Thereby, we suggest balancing the search efforts toward a wide range of knowledge domains, in order to avoid the risks to incur in the inability to gain returns from those efforts. Second, establishing dispersed teams may reduce the problems organizations face when they search broadly, being these useful to support the acquisition and integration of a diversified body of knowledge. Third, given the ever increasing need to develop more green general solutions, our findings guide organizations to focus on the conditions that are most critical for creating green GPTs in the energy field.","[Ardito, Lorenzo; Petruzzelli, Antonio Messeni; Albino, Vito] Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, I-70126 Bari, Italy",Politecnico di Bari,"Ardito, L (通讯作者)，Politecn Bari, Dept Mech Math & Management, 182 Viale Japigia, I-70126 Bari, Italy.",,"Ardito, Lorenzo/AAG-2544-2021","Ardito, Lorenzo/0000-0003-2732-6265",,,,,0,0,0,0,6,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1964,1975,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200152,0

The analyzed indicator - Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GGE) - is one of the headline indicators being tracked within the EU 2020 strategy. The GGE in the European Union countries depends on numerous economic indicators and relevant factors. The values of these indicators vary between the EU countries and, consequently, the occurrence of outliers can be envisaged in an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions. In such a case, the robust regression methods represent useful tools for analyzing dependencies. High breakdown- point robust regression methods allow to detect regression outliers, leverage points and influential observations as well. In terms of the level of the analyzed indicator, the set of the EU states is divided into two significantly different groups - the Eurozone and non-Eurozone countries, the regression analysis being performed for both the whole set of EU countries and the sub-groups.","[Blatna, Dagmar] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Blatna, D (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",blatna@vse.cz,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,178,187,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000017,0

Furthermore, in humid subtropical climates, climatic events during the floral induction period often result in the induction of multiple cohorts of inflorescences in the following spring. In this work we investigated whether patterns of accumulation of floral promoting CsFT, or floral identity genes CsAP1 and CsLFY are related to formation of the basipetal flowering gradient and cohorts. Levels of CsFT were not different in leaves located at different positions within the shoot, suggesting that there is no basipetal gradient in the generation of the putative flowering stimulus encoded by CsFT. Conversely, accumulation of CsAP1 and CsLFY occurred in a basipetal gradient in induced buds and accumulated in pattern consistent with the initiation of flowering cohorts. Our results suggest that the establishment of the flowering gradient and cohorts might be determined at the buds.","[Chica, Eduardo J.; Gene Albrigo, L.] Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Albrigo, LG (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Citrus Res & Educ Ctr, Lake Alfred, FL 33850 USA.",albrigo@ufl.edu,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,2,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1257,1265,,10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1065.160,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600160,0

In order to induce osteomyelitis in rabbits, a human strain of Staphylococcus aureus was injected in bone defects created in the rabbit tibia, a quantity of 0.2 ml being administered in each defect. We have created five groups of animals (positive control, negative control and treatment - 3 groups), the treatment groups receiving treatment in different phases of the disease (acute and chronic). The treatment consisted of copper and silver sub-millimeter-particles introduced in the same place with the Staphylococcus solution. Evaluation of installation and evolution of the disease was made by clinical, hematological, microbiological, radiological and histological monitoring. A separate study of radiological data is presented here. Radiological monitoring was done dynamically using a computerized radiology unit. Analyses were performed and scored individually and independently by three radiologists and specialists by evaluating the following parameters: periosteal relieves, bone architecture deformation, widening of bone shaft, neo-formation tissue and soft tissue deformation. The results of radiological evaluation show a mitigation of osteomyelitis as a result of the treatment and confirm that radiological analysis is a powerful tool in experimental models of this disease.

Documentary analysis was used to obtain a rich understanding of the organizational structure and to identify peculiar issues related to coordination and control implications on knowledge creation. Observation and site visits at university research laboratories and at corporate headquarters were undertaken to infer on cultural issues, as well as on responsibility and control related issues. Interviewed staff included top managers and academic researchers. Originality/value - The implications of this study are primarily related to a better understanding of choices adopted at the inter-organizational level in terms of knowledge integration processes. The study was able to expand the understanding of project inter-organizational cooperation in two respects. First, it should be noted that only a few studies have adopted the project framework to investigate the inter-organizational coordination mechanisms among University and firms. Secondly, the study has an explorative role of analysis, which can be useful for generating research hypotheses in future works, connecting the features of inter-organizational projects with the development of knowledge integration processes. Practical implications - Our results could be useful for other firms operating in the same sector, but also to the policy maker who want to stimulate this industry. Wine producers are currently affected by a global slowdown of wine consumption and by increased competition, and this has spurred them to intensify their efforts to improve product quality and to enter higher value niches in international markets. So, the wine industry has been involved in a deep process of innovation within which the processes of knowledge integration have taken on a much more significant role. We try to understand how the linkages between universities and firms may have a higher potential to create knowledge.","[Esposito, Vincenza] Univ Sannio, Dipartimento Studi Econ & Giurid Sociali SEGIS, I-82100 Benevento, Italy; [Canonico, Paolo] Univ Naples Federico II, Dipartimento Econ Management & Ist, Naples, Italy; [De Nito, Ernesto] Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Stor Econ & Sociali, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy; [Iacono, Mario Pezzillo; Martinez, Marcello] Univ Naples 2, Dipartimento Econ, I-81043 Capua, CE, Italy",University of Sannio; University of Naples Federico II; Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"De Nito, E (通讯作者)，Magna Graecia Univ Catanzaro, Dipartimento Sci Giurid Stor Econ & Sociali, Campus Univ Salvatore Venuta, I-88100 Catanzaro, Italy.",,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1133,1145,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200087,0

The flexible, erratic, temporary employment system has become the norm and is gradually replacing the stability of the long-term employment contract. At this new stage of capitalism, labour mobility has been increased, and it legitimizes the reduction of wages, as well as provoking sharp competition among workers. These processes strengthen the power of the employer: there is a gradual transition to the short-term contract, legalizing the right to dismissal without explanation and lowering the level of social security. These developments have an extremely negative impact on employees, causing significant damage to their psychosocial well-being and, as a consequence, to their physical health. Therefore, the use of these flexible forms of labour relations by companies should be considered the social pollution of the inter-organizational environment.","[Fedorova, Alena] Ural Fed Univ, Ul Mira,19, Ekaterinburg, Russia; [Dvorakova, Zuzana] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Ural Federal University; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Fedorova, A (通讯作者)，Ural Fed Univ, Ul Mira,19, Ekaterinburg, Russia.",dekan_2002@mail.ru; zdvorak@vse.cz,"Fedorova, Alena E./E-5944-2013",,,,,,10,2,2,0,3,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,403,412,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000039,0

As enterprises are facing constantly transforming framework conditions knowledge and innovation continue to gain importance in research and practice as means to realise sound economic, social and ecologic development. As mere product or incremental process innovations are neither a guarantee for success nor sufficient to cope with the emerging information, knowledge and time-competition (Stern and Jaberg, 2010) and as business model innovation has received increasing attention in times of change (Chesbrough, 2010; Amit and Zott, 2010) the latter shall be investigated complementarily. Design/methodology/approach - Building up on the results of previous research (Kohl et al., 2014) derived measures to improve the enterprises' innovation capability are analysed on the basis of 38 Intellectual Capital Statements. Furthermore, the data gained from a large scale survey among more than 1000 enterprises is analysed with regard to product as well as process innovation and are matched with the results gained from the analysis of the 38 ICS. Originality/value - The significance of intangible resources with regard to business success in general has evidently increased and may in some cases already be assessed as higher than the impact of tangible resources (Mertins et al., 2011; Kohl et al., 2014). This paper aims to draw conclusions on a broad empirical basis with regard to internal drivers of innovation and related differences between manufacturing and service enterprises. Practical implications - The analysis of the direct and indirect correlations between intellectual capital and innovation capabilities and the empirical foundation of these correlations allows sound statements regarding those intellectual capital factors, that should be focused by service and manufacturing enterprises to foster innovation. The examination of literature on intellectual capital and business model innovation builds the theoretical basis for future research with regard to those aspects and may show possible avenues for integrating business model innovation and intellectual capital management.","[Galeitzke, Mila] Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Machine Tools & Factory Management, Dept Assembly Technol & Factory Management, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Steinhoefel, Erik] Fraunhofer Inst Prod Syst & Design Technol, Business Excellence Dept, Corp Management Div, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Orth, Ronald; Kohl, Holger] Fraunhofer Inst Prod Syst & Design Technol, Corp Management Div, D-10587 Berlin, Germany; [Orth, Ronald] Fraunhofer Inst Prod Syst & Design Technol, Business Excellence Dept, D-10587 Berlin, Germany",Technical University of Berlin; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft; Fraunhofer Gesellschaft,"Galeitzke, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Berlin, Inst Machine Tools & Factory Management, Dept Assembly Technol & Factory Management, Pascalstr 8-9, D-10587 Berlin, Germany.",,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,8,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,476,489,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200037,0

This study aims to describe the strategy formulation process in the Brazilian Higher Education Institutions and to present the results of research carried out in a university situated in the State of Minas Gerais - Brazil. To achieve the research objectives, qualitative research was conducted through semi-structured interviews with the support of NVivo software and content analysis was used to data interpretation. The results show how the strategy formulation process is developed. It was observed that the strategy is related to procedure, choice and the tool. Moreover the strategy is characterized as the means to achieve a goal. It was also seen, according to the respondents' views, that the strategy is related to results, differentiation, futurity, and services to meet stakeholders' interests. Concerning the strategy components, there was association with knowledge, direction, planning, as well as internal and external influences. The strategist profile was related to the ability to choose people, global vision, knowledge and attention to the market. The strategy formulation happens through the initiative of senior managers that seeks the involvement of intermediate level leaders and the participation of staff. It can be planned through the Strategic Planning or emerging due to market fluctuations, new guidelines of the Ministry of Education, strategist behavior (behavior of the strategists) and the economy, showing that the strategy is influenced by internal and external environments. It also shows that the strategies that did not work, in the respondents' views, were due to lack of appropriate studies and planning. In conclusion, based on the research carried out, special attention should be given to studies in planning, as well as to emerging demands. The approach with the local community is valued since it is of great influence in the formulation of strategies and success of the organization. It is expected that this study contributes to the knowledge of Higher Education Institutions' reality and to the improvement of this business, collaborating with research into this issue in order to promote the right orientation of actions that will support better management.","[Gomes, Valter] Ctr Univ Planalto de Arax, Dept Appl Social Sci, BR-38180084 Araxa, MG, Brazil; [Machado-Taylor, Maria de Lourdes] Agcy Assessment & Accreditat Higher Educ A3ES, P-4450227 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Machado-Taylor, Maria de Lourdes] Ctr Res Higher Educ Policies CIPES, P-4450227 Matosinhos, Portugal; [dos Santos, Carlos Machado] Univ Tras Os Montes & Alto Douro, Dept Econ Sociol & Management, P-5001801 Quinta De Prados, Vila Real, Portugal; [Saraiva, Ernani Viana] Univ Fed Fluminense, Dept Sci & Technol, BR-28895532 Rio Das Ostras, RJ, Brazil",University of Tras-os-Montes & Alto Douro; Universidade Federal Fluminense,"Machado-Taylor, MD (通讯作者)，Agcy Assessment & Accreditat Higher Educ A3ES, Rua 1 Dezembro,399, P-4450227 Matosinhos, Portugal.",,"de Lourdes Machado, Maria/M-6743-2013","de Lourdes Machado, Maria/0000-0003-4774-2397",,,,,23,0,0,1,11,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2048,2058,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200160,0

Petch. and F. culmorum (W.C. Smith) Sacc. are the most important head-blighting pathogens of wheat in many regions of the world, including Romania. The strategies developed for the control of Fusarium spp. infections on cereals include agrotechnical practices, resistant cultivars, and fungicides use. However, the toxicity of fungicides and the low efficacy of such products to control members of the Fusarium head blight (FHB) Complex led to the development of additional strategy that can be used as part of an integrated management of FHB (directed against fungal growth and/or mycotoxins biosynthesis and accumulation). The use of biocontrol agents is an important strategy for integrated management of fungal diseases in many economically important plat species. It was shown that Bacillus spp strains could suppress various soil borne diseases, their efficacy being associated with their antagonistic properties and competitiveness in the rhizosphere (including through sporulation). The aim of this study was the in vitro evaluation of biocontrol capacity of different Bacillus spp. strains isolated from soil and compost against strains of Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum. The ability of four strains of bacilli (B1, B3, B5 and BIR) to inhibit fungal growth was established. For their identification BIOLOG system was used, coupled with molecular techniques (ARDRA). It was proved that the strains of interest belong to Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (BIR and B3) and Bacillus spp. (B1 and B5). The Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains, BIR and B3, were also evaluated in pot experiments, in climatic chamber conditions, for their ability to stimulate wheat seeds germination and/or plantlet growth and reduce Fusarium infections in first stages of wheat vegetation. After 21 days of incubation significant differences were registered between variants infected with Fusarium and supplemented with Bacillus and control variants, not only in germination rate but also in wheat plantlets development. Further differences were observed in the number of Fusarium CFU/g of soil from the soils treated with bacteria in contrast with control variants. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Three requirements uniquely determine procedurally fair ranking rules as a game form. Only when additionally assuming exogenously given true evaluations of collective rankings, which may be commonly or only privately known, and-in case of private information-beliefs concerning the evaluations by others, this game form determines proper games and allows for (game theoretic) equilibrium analysis.

We argue that the domestic-foreign lobbying may contribute to a freer trade in the domestic country, and lobbying competition may be one of the strongest forces pushing for trade liberalisation.","[Huang, Xianhai; Jiang, Mobing] Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Jie] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University; Jinan University,"Huang, XH (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, Sch Econ, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Jie/AAE-6389-2019",,,,,,17,2,2,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,JAN,2015,38.0,1.0,,,SI,,136,150,,10.1111/twec.12251,0.0,,,15,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,AZ9BS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348506900007,0

The paper presents the blueprint for a new co-design environment to enable communication and collaboration between large numbers of citizen and professional experts, developed in the course of a joint project of TU Dresden, TU Delft, and ISEN Toulon in cooperation with German and French software companies. Approach Key novelty is a Public Project Space for non-professional civic users - a highly accessible, low-threshold public interface, a Project Play Ground which features highly experiential design tools for citizens who want to engage actively in the design process. Second novelty is a collaboration platform which connects the Project Play Ground to professional urban designers. This Co-design Workspace is to function as a unidirectional exchange hub between public users and professionals to support the collection of project relevant information, the generation of initial impulses, and the discussion of propositions in the early phase of the design. Findings As key catalysers for co-design and communication, the blueprint suggests Moderated Models (MoM) that are exchanged and iterated between professionals and the public until mutual understanding is found. The Moderated Models are conceived as derivatives from a cloud-based Project Information Model (PIM) which integrates all project relevant information, including technical data as well as public input. Moderated models are published in the public Project Play Ground as to stimulate feedback e.g. via Social Media. Impact An essential functionality of the co-design environment will be the assessment of proposals on semantic and emotional level, in order to devise early detection of resistance against projects, and to prevent the build-up of negative public sentiment. The co-design environment will enable professional creatives to utilise the public's creativity, to follow public opinions and sentiments, and to derive design intelligence from them. The design and decision making process will be informed and transformed by impulses of citizen experts as a driving force.","[Jannack, Anja; Noennig, Joerg Rainer] Tech Univ Dresden, WISSENSARCHITEKTUR Lab Knowledge Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany; [Muenster, Sander] TU Dresden Dresden Univ Technol, Media Ctr, D-01062 Dresden, Germany",Technische Universitat Dresden,"Jannack, A (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Dresden, WISSENSARCHITEKTUR Lab Knowledge Architecture, D-01062 Dresden, Germany.",,"Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Munster, Sander/B-7969-2018","Munster, Sander/0000-0001-9344-912X",,,,,41,3,3,0,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2363,2380,,,,,,18,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200186,0

An insight to the transition process in Croatia in the last two decades shows that the process of creating favourable political and economic environment for the entrepreneurship development was contemporary with the transition to the market economy. The core of this manifold transition was the transition process of human resources. Croatia invested budgetary funds and provided systematic support for the needs of entrepreneurship development especially targeting SME sector and trying to boost the local and regional socioeconomic development. The improvement of intellectual capacity on the institutional as well as on entrepreneurs' level was the backbone of the Croatian systematic support model of entrepreneurship development that lasts twenty years now since the first Government Programme on Entrepreneurship and SME Development in 1997. Within this Programme framework two capital national projects have the human capital dimension enhancement as core target on the long-term basis, the Entrepreneurship Promotion and Entrepreneurship Education. There are streamlined efforts in the past two decades to widely spread the entrepreneurship education. The Croatian national authority for SME policy has recorded continuity in education and training for entrepreneurship. The National Framework Curriculum recognizes the entrepreneurship as one among eight basic key education competencies as well as the Strategy for Entrepreneurship Education Development 2020. The entrepreneurship and/or entrepreneurship economics studies are included through higher education institutions. However, the entrepreneurship on the primary and secondary school levels is still extracurricular. This fact further supports the importance of the activities implemented by the South East European Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning among eight countries to introduce the entrepreneurship as a key competence at all levels of formal, non-formal and informal education. The intellectual capacity building of the supporting entrepreneurial infrastructure staff is crucial for local and regional socio-economic development. It is still an on-going process that targets the institutions which meet the entrepreneurs' needs for counselling and consulting services, business information and training. The entrepreneurial network comprises 21 Regional Development Agencies, and about 80 entrepreneurial centres, entrepreneurial incubators throughout twenty one county of Croatia.","[Karajic, Dragica] Minist Entrepreneurship & Crafts, Ulica Grada Vukovara 78, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Karajic, D (通讯作者)，Minist Entrepreneurship & Crafts, Ulica Grada Vukovara 78, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",dragica.karaic@minpo.hr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,8,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,571,578,,,,,,8,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100056,0

Equivalised household income can be viewed as an indicator of the economic resources available to each individual in a household, but unfortunately no generally accepted and optimal methodology exits. The strong dependence is expected and quantified (from different point of view) between all treated equivalised incomes. Moreover the distributions of equivalised incomes in different types of households are modelled (and compared) with the use of lognormal and Dagum distributions.

However, the published data is not up to date - at the first stage, only estimates are published, which are subsequently made more accurate (in several steps). Moreover, even these estimates are published with a time delay of two to three months.

Besides lemon, the most sensitive species, MSD also affects other citrus species, such as citron, lime, bergamot, chinotto, sour orange, rough lemon or volkamer lemon. When the infection is through rootlets of a susceptible species, more frequently in the nursery but also in bearing plants in the grove, the pathogen may be restricted for many years to the inner layers of wood, leading to a form of the disease known as 'mal nero', a syndrome characterized by blackish discoloration of the hard wood and by the absence of almost any external symptom. Eventually, after several years, the pathogen reaches the sapwood, causing a sudden collapse of the canopy, even on resistant scions. Host resistance remains the most desirable goal among the measures to control MSD, and the search for new resistant rootstocks to replace the susceptible ones, has long been pursued by Italian researchers. This paper reviews the conclusive data collected over almost three decades of research, conducted both in the field and in a controlled environment, on the behaviour of putative lemon rootstocks towards MSD. The rootstocks tested include: alemow, sour orange ('S. Marina' and undetermined selections), 'Ichang' lemon, 'Yuzu' orange, 'Nansho Daidai' sour orange, 'Siamelo', 'Yuma' citrange, 'Sacaton', 'Swingle 4475', and 'Swingle FF9' citrumelos, and the hybrids 'Cleopatra' mandarin x Poncirus, and 'Christian' Poncirus x 'Cleopatra' mandarin.","[Nigro, Franco; Ippolito, Antonio; Salerno, Mario G.] Univ Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Nigro, F (通讯作者)，Univ Aldo Moro, Dipartimento Sci Suolo Pianta & Alimenti, Bari, Italy.",franco.nigro@uniba.it,"Nigro, Franco/J-1499-2012","Nigro, Franco/0000-0002-8273-0052",,,,,24,2,2,0,6,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,987,991,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600123,0

Two-lane roundabout is a complex traffic solution, because interweaving of traffic flows within the intersection has a direct impact on frequency of traffic accidents. Both direct and indirect costs of accidents are positively correlated with the severity of traffic accidents which are influenced by the traffic flow speed and the angle of conflict.

Using firm-level data from Chinese customs over the 2000-6 period, we investigate the relationship between the export performance of firms and how their products relate to local comparative advantage. Our key indicator measures the density of the links between a product and the local product space. Hence, it combines information on the intrinsic relatedness of a good with information on the local pattern of specialization. Our results indicate that exports grow faster for goods that have denser links with those currently produced in the firm's locality. The density of links between products seems to yield export-enhancing spillovers. However, we show that this positive effect of product relatedness on export performance is mainly limited to ordinary trade activities and domestic firms. It is also stronger for more productive firms, suggesting that spillover diffusion may be hindered by insufficient absorptive capacity.","[Poncet, Sandra] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Poncet, Sandra] CEPII, Paris, France; [de Waldemar, Felipe Starosta] Univ Paris 11, Paris, France",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Universite Paris Saclay,"Poncet, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France.",sandra.poncet@univ-paris1.fr; felipe.starosta-de-waldemar@u-psud.fr,,"Starosta de Waldemar, Felipe/0000-0003-0865-5477",FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government [ANR-10-LABX- 14-01],FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International); program Investissement d'Avenir of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),Sandra Poncet (corresponding author) is a professor at the Paris School of Economics (University of Paris 1) and a scientific advisor at CEPII; her email address is sandra.poncet@univ-paris1.fr.

Using a large panel of countries over a long period, we document that crises are typically associated with lower medium-term growth. That may be a direct causal channel, a reverse channel, or the influence of some other factors on both growth and finance. But they tend to go together.

Although the disease first emerged in the southeastern part of Asia, it is now well established in Brazil, Florida and California, which are the world's most important citrus production areas. The disease is associated with three insect-vectored, obligate intracellular bacteria of the genus 'Candidatus Liberibacter'. These bacteria reside in the host phloem cells and they are transmitted by psyllids. Early pathogen detection is important to protect free areas from pathogen introduction. Unfortunately, the disease has a long incubation period, during which the pathogen is at low concentration and non-systemically distributed. This makes diagnostic and eradication difficult. Agdia has recently developed a new, rapid, molecular detection technique, AmplifyRP (R), allowing PCR-level sensitivity detection within minutes, in the field. AmplifyRP (R) uses a recombinase-polymerase methodology for DNA amplification at a single temperature. In contrast to conventional or real-time PCR, AmplifyRP (R) has no DNA purification requirements, requires no thermocycling, and results can be read using small, user-friendly devices. A portable fluorescence reader or a lateral flow device (similar to Agdia's ImmunoStrip (R)) can be used to visualize results in as little as 30 minutes, compared to several hours for conventional PCR. AmplifyRP (R) eliminates the need for expensive PCR equipment, a large number of chemicals reagents, and the need for technically trained staff. Given its characteristics, AmplifyRP (R) is the ideal tool to monitor HLB progression by early detection of Ca. Liberibacter in citrus trees or in vector insects.","[Russell, Paul F.; McOwen, Nathan; Bohannon, Seven; Bohannon, Robert] Agdia Inc, Elkhart, IN 46514 USA; [Amato, Marcos A.] Agdia Biofords, Paris, France",,"Russell, PF (通讯作者)，Agdia Inc, Elkhart, IN 46514 USA.",prussell@agdia.com; marcos.amato@agdia-biofords.com,,,,,,,2,3,4,0,15,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,905,911,,,,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600112,0

Hayek essentially quit the study of industrial fluctuations as an explicit object of theoretical investigation following the publication of 1941's The Pure Theory of Capital. Nonetheless, several of Hayek's subsequent methodologically oriented writings bear important implications for economic phenomena, especially those of industrial fluctuations. Decisions (usually, for Hayek, of a political nature) taken on the basis of a 'pretence' of knowledge impede the operation of the price system's belief-coordinating function and thereby contribute to episodes of economic disequilibrium. Moreover, this later account - which I call Hayek's epistemic theory of industrial fluctuations - implies certain aspects of his earlier theory The two accounts are connected in virtue of the role that the limits of human knowledge play in each. Indeed, it turns out that in a sense defined in the paper - Hayek's early theory of the cyde is a special case of his more general epistemic account.

In particular, the performance of group purchase websites fails to meet users' expectation in terms of maintaining users. Therefore, how to enhance user stickiness of group purchase websites becomes a subject which is worthy of study under the fierce competition in network group purchase market. This paper will give a literature review of network group purchase, and then it will analyze some reasons of insufficient user stickiness. Based on those reasons, factors of increasing user stickiness will be discussed. Finally, some effective solutions will be put forward.

They contribute to economic growth, to reducing the unemployment rate and they also positively affect other macroeconomic indicators. Foreign companies bring with them not only foreign capital that they invest in the host country, but also new technology, modem and more effective production and management methods, classic standards of business conduct, new jobs as well as opportunities for domestic suppliers. Investment incentives for foreign investors are thus among the important public spending programs. The provision of investment incentives means not only an increase on the expenditure side of the public budget or a decrease of the income side of the public budget (due to tax credits), but it usually leads as our research demonstrated to a start of the influx of revenue sources for public budgets, already in the short or medium term horizon. The aim of the research was to develop a methodology for measuring the fiscal effectiveness of provided investment incentives in the process of their implementation, to determine what the effects are on the income side of the national budget, and for this purpose construct an indicator of fiscal effectiveness whose functional and explanatory power would need to be tested in practice among the recipients of investment incentives. The fiscal effectiveness of investment incentives was constructed as the share of outputs (in the form of revenues from taxes, social and health insurance, fees, savings on the expenditure side of the budget) on a unit of inputs (income tax credit, financial support for a created job, subsidy to cover the costs of employee retraining, administrative costs of collecting taxes, subsidies on the technical equipment of an area on which production is to be located, subsidy on the price of land). With regard for business plans, fiscal effectiveness was assessed for a period of 5 years from the approval and receipt of the investment incentive in a set of industrial enterprises in the Czech Republic.","[Vybihal, Vaclav] Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Social Sci, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Trnava, Slovakia",University of SS Cyril & Methodius Trnava,"Vybíhal, V (通讯作者)，Univ Ss Cyril & Methodius, Fac Social Sci, Dept Publ Policy & Publ Adm, Trnava, Slovakia.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,2,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,293,300,,,,,,8,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400037,0

By building on the previously reported research on leadership, culture, innovation, and knowledge management, we synergistically integrated KM-driven leadership and innovation success while exploring the meditational role of culture in that. Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual model comprising three constructs was developed, namely KM-driven leadership, culture and innovation-based success of the company. To examine the conceptual model, quantitative research was conducted among selected companies from the SMEs offering knowledge-intensive business services. The companies were contacted by telephone and interviews were carried out with 111 key informants. The data was later analysed with exploratory and confirmatory statistical methods. We applied structural equation modelling techniques (SEM) with Mplus 7.2 software package to investigate the effects of KM-driven leadership on culture, and consequently its effect on innovation-based success of the company. To investigate the meditational role of culture between KM-driven leadership and innovation-based success of the company a post-hoc analysis was undertaken. Originality/value - On the basis of the previous studies analysis, the following research gap has been identified. How does leadership based on knowledge management influences the innovation success of companies and what is the role of culture in this relation? By answering this question, the study contributes to the building of literature on the above topic twofold. First, it analyses the influence of KM-driven leadership in the creation of organizational culture, which in turn contributes to the innovation success of the company. Second, this research pioneers in that it explores the meditational role of culture among KM-driven leadership and innovation success. The results of the mediation analysis confirm that culture fully mediates the relationship of KM-driven leadership with innovation success. Practical implications - The paper proves the relation between KM-oriented leadership, culture and innovation-based success of the company. The analysis of the conceptual model confirms that culture mediates the relationship of leadership with innovation success. It highly contributes to the understanding of these phenomena in the context of small and medium-sized companies offering knowledge-intensive business services - still a topic at its early stage of research. The study also shows that KM-oriented leadership is a very important factor helping in the achievement of innovation success by companies. The relationships examined indicate the potential areas on which SME managers and executives should concentrate to achieve better innovation results.","[Zieba, Malgorzata] Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Management, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland; [Schivinski, Bruno] Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Mkt, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology; Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Zieba, M (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Dept Management, Ul Narutowicza 11-12, PL-80233 Gdansk, Poland.",,"Schivinski, Bruno/AAD-3322-2020; Zieba, Malgorzata/B-2788-2014","Schivinski, Bruno/0000-0002-4095-1922; Zieba, Malgorzata/0000-0002-5138-9330",,,,,34,2,2,0,21,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1193,1202,,,,,,10,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200091,0

The laboratory results show that as income uncertainty diminishes, participants become more extreme in their preferences for redistribution. The findings suggest that for most people, the motivation for redistribution is financial self-interest-namely as insurance against future bad luck-rather than furthering equity. However, a non-negligible group of participants propose redistribution levels inconsistent with financial self-interest, where this group is primarily made up of those with the least to lose financially from making such a proposal, and the size of this group increases when participants can communicate prior to proposing. Survey data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and General Social Survey show that these experimental findings may help shed light on the way preferences for redistribution evolve with age in the real world.","[Bjerk, David] Claremont Mckenna Coll, 500 East Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont McKenna College,"Bjerk, D (通讯作者)，Claremont Mckenna Coll, 500 East Ninth St, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",david.bjerk@cmc.edu,,,,,,,31,5,5,0,11,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,DEC,2016,47.0,4.0,,,,,791,824,,10.1007/s00355-016-0992-x,0.0,,,34,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,EE1PN,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389354300002,0

This was accomplished by characterizing the gap between the quality of service (QOS) supplied by contract regimes and that which is demanded by passengers. Analysis of a customer satisfaction survey aimed at bus users provided insight into their ranking of 14 QOS parameters while 13 active service contracts were analyzed for their impact on QOS. In-depth interviews with relevant experts completed the complex narrative that is Israel's policy of privatization in PT. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses helped identify those QOS parameters most in demand by passengers and impacted by contracts. The results show that the gap is minimal, high demand parameters receive increased priority in contracts. In addition this research documented an evolution in the method contracts employed to provide QOS. Late model contracts define an increasingly higher minimum QOS; but also strongly limit the operator's ability to make service changes. This is a trend which should improve QOS in Israel but reduce the incentive for operator enacted QOS initiatives.

Although sharing the main context conditions and maintaining a constant and fluent exchange with their colleagues in other countries, the German intellectual traditions and specific institutional context motivated several particular interests and perspectives that shape a distinct German Industrial Sociology until today. The dominance of qualitative in-depth research, the focus on the emancipative potentials in high-skill-based work organization, the cooperative industrial relations tradition and the constant attempts to link employment studies with general social theory on modern capitalist society and social change characterize German Industrial Sociology. The richness of distinct national institutional settings for comparative social research on employment regimes may be another lesson to be learned from critical reconstruction of labour sociology.","[Koehler, Holm-Detlev] Univ Oviedo, Dept Sociol, Sociol, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Köhler, HD (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Fac Econ & Enterprise, Campus Cristo, E-33006 Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",hkohler@uniovi.es,"Köhler, Holm-Detlev/K-2611-2017",,,,,,66,3,3,0,7,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Between 2005 and 2010, the average height of children under 5 in Cambodia significantly increased. What contributed to this improvement? Recent evidence suggests that exposure to poor sanitation-and specifically to widespread open defecation-can pose a critical threat to child growth. We closely analyze the sanitation height gradient in Cambodia in these two years. Decomposition analysis, in the spirit of Blinder-Oaxaca, suggests that the reduction in children's exposure to open defecation can statistically account for much or all of the increase in average child height between 2005 and 2010. In particular, we see evidence of externalities, indicating an important role for public policy: it is the sanitation behavior of a child's neighbors that matters more for child height rather than the household's sanitation behavior by itself. Moving from an area in which 100% of households defecate in the open to an area in which no households defecate in the open is associated with an average increase in height-for-age z-score of between 0.3 and 0.5. Our estimates are quantitatively robust and comparable with other estimates in the literature. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

As regressors we incorporate variables related to the new concepts of internal and imported transport infrastructure capital stocks, which are actually used in commercial flows, calculated by network analysis performed in GIS. The internally used capital stock represents own infrastructure that benefits accessing markets within the region itself, while the imported capital stock captures the spillover effect associated to the use of the infrastructure situated in neighboring regions. From a methodological perspective, we introduce spatial interdependence into these models, applying the most recent spatial econometric techniques based on instrumental variables estimation in spatial autoregressive panel models in comparison with Maximum Likelihood estimation methods. We illustrate the methodology with Spanish provincial panel data for the period 1980-2007. Results support the hypothesis that the imported capital has a positive spillover effect on production.

The implied forward rates are analyzed with a first difference model to determine its main components. Regarding the risk free rate, the traditional sport-forward relation does not hold for property derivatives. The impact of the risk free rate on forward rates appears as being complex and made of different effects; it varies according to time and maturities. Derivatives prices take into account the smoothing effect of the underlying index and REITs stocks are also relevant to explain these prices. The informational content of the swap is important. The impact of the REITs and of the smoothing decreases with maturities. The risk factor structure obtained is more complex than found in many other studies relative to commodities, securities or bonds.

It contributes to expanding our understanding of the consequences of high-technology policies by investigating in more depth the effect of the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program on the innovation effort and ability to attract external capital of small business start-ups using a new sample and estimation approach. The authors found empirical evidence that the public cofinancing of private research and development has a positive effect on the innovation propensity of small high-tech start-ups. However, contrary to theoretical expectations, they did not find any significant certification effect of receiving an SBIR award on attracting follow-on investment. What the authors discovered is a different certification effect: SBIR recipient firms are more likely to attract external patents. This finding confirms that enterprises need to orchestrate a portfolio of internal and external knowledge assets to produce innovations with unique competitive advantage.","[Galope, Reynold V.] Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Galope, Reynold V.] Georgia Inst Technol, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Galope, RV (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Andrew Young Sch Policy Studies, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",reynold.galope@gmail.com,"Galope, Reynold/JUF-6513-2023","Galope, Reynold/0000-0002-1713-895X",,,,,62,7,9,2,14,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0891-2424,1552-3543,,ECON DEV Q,Econ.

We find that changes in the variance structure driven by exogenous processes like generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) affect welfare but not the optimal feedback rule. However, changes in the variance structure driven by state-dependent processes affect both. We also derive certainty-equivalent transformations of state-dependent volatility models that allow standard quadratic dynamic programming algorithms to be employed to study optimal policy. These results are illustrated numerically using a reduced-form model of the US economy in which changes in volatility are driven by a GARCH process and the rate of inflation.

The test is developed on the basis of the fact that structural breaks of unknown form can be approximated with a low-frequency Fourier component. As a result, the statistic is able to test cointegration without estimating specific break dates. The asymptotic distribution of the test is derived, and the asymptotic critical values are tabulated. Simulation experiments show that the test can deliver robust type I error for various breaks commonly seen in economic analysis and have good power, even in small sample sizes encountered in empirical studies.

We analyze different aircraft-engine combinations, leading to a dataset of about 1,500 different observations, with relevant variability in terms of externalities produced. Our econometric analysis shows that aircraft age is a main determinant of environmental costs: a 1-year younger aircraft leads to a 0.32% in costs. We found a complementary relation among pollution, noise annoyance and global warming: the impact of age on them has the same sign. We also show that aircraft size has a positive impact on costs: this Implies that wide aircrafts generate higher per flight costs than medium, small and light ones. On the contrary, when loolcing at per-seat environmental costs, aircraft category is found to have a negative impact. However, these contrasting results tend to disappear if we include in the analysis market demand and flight frequency, with medium size aircraft performing better, in environmental terms, than both small and wide category aircraft. Hence, policy makers, in designing incentives towards an environmentally sustainable aviation, should take into account that aircraft size and market demand are crucial in terms of environmental costs: if demand is very low small aircraft may outperform larger ones, while if demand is sufficiently large medium aircraft are, on average, more environmentally friendly.

Syria and Iraq bear the brunt of the direct economic costs, while the other Levant countries lose in per capita but not in aggregate terms as the inflows of refugees increase the size of their populations. The war has undermined progress towards deeper regional trade integration, thus adding to varying degrees to the direct costs sustained by the Levant economies and, in the cases of Syria and Iraq, doubling their welfare losses. All Levant countries are foregoing opportunities to expand intra-Levant trade and the associated gains in economic efficiency.

The dramatic increase in mortgage terminations prompted extensive discussions among academics, industry practitioners, regulators, and policymakers. These discussions included such issues as the underlying causes of the mortgage market collapse and the impact of declining house prices on mortgage default and foreclosure. This special issue results from the 2013 FSU-UF Critical Issues Symposium entitled Housing Market Issues: Initiatives, Policies and the Economy where the impact of the recent market collapse was examined on topics such as the negative spillover effect of foreclosure, the determinants of mortgage default and prepayment, disequilibrium models of the housing market, and the growth of the reverse mortgage market. This introductory paper serves to set the stage by relating the papers in this special issue to the previous literature. It provides both a clear picture of the state of knowledge in these critical areas and the significant contributions of these recent studies.","[Jones, Timothy] Xavier Univ, Dept Finance, Williams Coll Business, Cincinnati, OH 45202 USA; [Gatzlaff, Dean] Florida State Univ, Coll Business, Ctr Real Estate Educ & Res, Tallahassee, FL 32309 USA; [Sirmans, G.

Simulation of electricity market and investment decisions by System Dynamics modelling is used to trace the evolution of the electricity generation mix over a 20-year period from an initially thermal system. A range of carbon prices is tested to determine the value above which market-driven development of wind power becomes economically possible. This requires not only economic competitiveness in terms of cost-price, but also profitability versus traditional fossil-fuel technologies. Results stress that wind power is profitable for investors only if the carbon price is significantly higher than the price required for making wind power MWh's cost-price competitive on the basis of levelized costs. In this context, the market-driven development of wind power seems only possible if there is a strong commitment to climate policy, reflected in a stable and high carbon price. Moreover, market driven development of wind power becomes more challenging if nuclear is part of investment options.","[Petitet, Marie; Janssen, Tanguy] RTE, Markets Dept, 1 Terrase Bellini TSA 41000, F-92929 La Defense, France; [Petitet, Marie; Finon, Dominique] PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris 09, Chaire European Elect Markets, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Finon, Dominique] CIRED CNRS, 45 Bis Ave La Belle Gabrielle, F-94736 Nogent Sur Marne, France",Universite PSL; Universite Paris-Dauphine; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole des Ponts ParisTech,"Petitet, M (通讯作者)，RTE, Markets Dept, 1 Terrase Bellini TSA 41000, F-92929 La Defense, France.;Petitet, M (通讯作者)，PSL Res Univ, Univ Paris 09, Chaire European Elect Markets, Pl Marechal Lattre de Tassigny, F-75775 Paris 16, France.",marie.petitet@ensta.org,,"PETITET, Marie/0000-0002-8808-387X",RTE; EDF; EPEX; Spot; UFE,RTE; EDF(Electricite de France (EDF)); EPEX; Spot; UFE,"This paper has benefited from the support of the Chaire European Electricity Markets of the Paris Dauphine Foundation, supported by RTE, EDF, EPEX Spot and the UFE.

Self-Congruity theory proposes that products are preferred whose symbolic meanings are congruent with personal identity. Further, Construal Level theory suggests that only those who are psychologically close to a new product category through direct experience with it can make concrete construals related to their lifestyles; most drivers lack this for EVs. For instance, potential performance benefits of EVs might offset range limitations for consumers who have such direct experience. The effect of direct experience was tested in a randomised controlled trial with 393 mass-market consumer drivers. An experimental group were given direct experience of a modern battery electric vehicle (BEV), and a control group an equivalent conventional car. Despite rating the performance of the BEV more highly than that of the conventional car, willingness to consider a BEV declined after experience, particularly if the range of the BEV considered was short. The participants willing to consider a short-range BEV were those high in self-congruity, for whom the BEV could act as a strong sytnbol of personal identity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Through these programs, households receive heavily subsidized energy efficiency upgrades as well as informational and behavioral treatments designed to encourage conservation. While previous work demonstrates that weatherization programs provide sizable energy savings, all have measured the composite effect of efficiency upgrades and behavioral treatments. In this paper, we present the first estimates which disentangle the energy savings provided by each of the individual interventions. Our results reveal that the actual energy savings achieved by the efficiency upgrades are substantially smaller than ex ante, engineering predictions. Moreover, we present evidence that the energy savings provided by the simple behavioral interventions can exceed the savings resulting from the much more costly efficiency upgrades.","[Zivin, Joshua Graff] Univ Calif San Diego, Sch Int Relat & Pacific Studies, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Zivin, Joshua Graff] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Econ, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Novan, Kevin] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California San Diego; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Novan, K (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",knovan@ucdavis.edu,"Zivin, Joshua Graff/ABF-1697-2020",,UC Office of the President; UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics,UC Office of the President; UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics,Funding support from the UC Office of the President and the UC Center for Energy and Environmental Economics is gratefully acknowledged.,,24,38,43,1,20,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2016,37.0,4.0,,,,,1,23,,10.5547/01956574.37.4.jziv,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,DZ5OZ,,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385912700001,0

Over the past 50 years, various policy interventions to improve physical conditions in distressed neighborhoods have also been heralded for their potential to reduce crime. Urban renewal programs in the mid-20th century and public housing redevelopment in the 1990s both subscribed to the idea that signs of physical disorder invite social disorder. More recently, the federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) provided funding for local policymakers to rehabilitate or demolish foreclosed and vacant properties, in order to mitigate negative spillovers-including crime-on surrounding neighborhoods. In this paper, we investigate the impact of NSP investments on localized crime patterns in Cleveland, Chicago and Denver. Results suggest that demolition activity in Cleveland decreased burglary and theft, but do not find measurable impacts of property rehabilitation investments-although the precision of these estimates are limited by the number of rehabilitation activities.

We address these key stylized facts by linking different strands of literature into a unified methodology to investigate regional unemployment disparities. This methodology simultaneously accounts for serial dynamics, spatial dependence and common factors, also known as weak and strong cross-sectional dependence. We apply this approach using provincial level data for the Netherlands. The substantial and persistent division between high and low unemployment clusters makes it an interesting case, and data availability since the early 1970s enables a comparison between prior periods of downturn and recovery to the recent economic crisis. It is found that approaches that do not simultaneously account for serial dynamics, spatial dependence and common factors, or that ignore one of these issues, may lead to biased inference.

A spatial quantile regression is applied to investigate the flood hazards impact on conditional higher- vs lower- priced homes, while accounting for spatial autocorrelation. The findings show that the location within a floodplain reduces property value. Furthermore, the negative impact of flood hazards on property values are stronger among lower-priced homes, and weaker among higher-priced homes. In addition, the study examines if a major flood in 2009 had an impact on the home buyers' perception about flood risk. The results show that about a year after the major flood, home buyers responded the most, however, the effect quickly diminished after 2010. Across quantiles, the 2009 flood had more effect on lower-priced than higher-priced homes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A reliable evaluation of port risks is essential to govern the normal running of seaborne transportation and thus the industrial economies. The occurrence of a breakdown in the trade facilitators, such as ports, will disrupt the smooth flow of supply chains for the industries. The estimation of the economic loss for an industry when a port gets disrupted is a challenging task as the relationship between the port and industry clusters is complex. This study aims to develop a systematic framework for performing economic loss estimation of industry clusters due to port disruptions. The whole risk assessment is split into three stages focusing on the establishment of a network flow model, economic estimations and evaluating risk mitigation strategies. The proposed idea is demonstrated by a case study on Shenzhen port and its related manufacturing industries. A dynamic inventory control strategy used by manufacturers is found to be beneficial for mitigating port disruption risks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The study relies on a three-year collective ethnography including participant observation, archive collection and over a hundred interviews with migrant workers, union activists, employers and civil servants.

In doing so it pays particular attention at two dimensions, the internal adoption of this regime and external endorsement/contestation of international IP norms. Much has been written about whether emerging countries will challenge or support the maintenance of an open rules-based multilateral trade system. In this context, the differentiated integration of these two countries in the IP regime is notable. Domestically, China despite much criticism for widespread IP infringement has followed a maximalist interpretation of TRIPS. India, on the contrary has followed other emerging countries in pursuing a more critical, minimalist understanding. These positions have also been visible at the multilateral arena. This empirical finding runs contrary to the assumption that defiance results from market power. The divergence is the more surprising given a recent explosion of patent filings in both countries. From a political economy perspective, this should translate into support for stricter rules under TRIPS. In explanaining the two countries' divertent insertion this paper looks beyond economic (market) power and domestic interests and underlines the role of ideational legacies, domestic interests and regulatory capacity. The paper thus stresses the need to look deep into domestic politics and ideational cleavages, as well as at their evolution over time, in order to better understand the international behaviour of emerging countries.","[Serrano, Omar] Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, Geneva, Switzerland; [Serrano, Omar] Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci, Geneva, Switzerland",University of Geneva; University of Geneva,"Serrano, O (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Global Studies Inst, Geneva, Switzerland.;Serrano, O (通讯作者)，Univ Geneva, Dept Polit Sci, Geneva, Switzerland.",omar.serrano@unige.ch,"Oswald, Omar Ramon Serrano/I-7826-2019","Oswald, Omar Ramon Serrano/0000-0002-7396-7891",Swiss Network for International Studies SNIS; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF); SNF; SNIS,Swiss Network for International Studies SNIS; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); SNF; SNIS,The Swiss Network for International Studies SNIS (http://www.snis.ch/project_rule-takers-rule-makers-emerging-powers-regulation-international-trade) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) supported this research.

However, evidence to support this has so far been limited to analyses of small-scale samples. To address this evidence gap, we use two waves of panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2009/10 and 2010/11) to identify and explain the prevalence of individual change in commute mode from year to year amongst a representative sample of the English working population (n = 15,200). One third of those that cycle or get the bus to work, and one quarter of those that walk to work, are shown to change commuting mode by the following year. Car commuting is more stable, with only one in ten car commuters changing mode by the following year. Commute mode changes are found to be primarily driven by alterations to the distance to work which occur in association with changing job or moving home. Switching to non-car commuting becomes much more likely (9.2 times) as the distance to work drops below three miles. High quality public transport links to employment centres are shown to encourage switches away from car commuting and mixed land uses are shown to encourage switches to active commuting (walking and cycling). Switches away from car commuting are found to be more likely (1.3 times) for those with a pro environmental attitude. The attitude orientation is shown to precede the behaviour change, demonstrating evidence of 'cause and effect'. Overall, the study shows that changes in commuting behaviour are strongly influenced by life events, spatial context and environmental attitude. (C) 2016 The Authors.

For 118 of the 364 US statistical areas analyzed, the tiered price indexes are bound by a long-run relationship. In general, low tier homes appreciated more than high tier homes in the past two decades. In contrast to previous periods of high volatility, however, low tier homes appreciated more during the boom and lost more value during the bust of the market. We find a shift in the long-run equilibrium during the bubble -the cointegration parameter that ties the tiers together is greater in absolute value during the bubble period compared to the periods of more moderate appreciation and depreciation rates. Moreover, the shift in the long-run equilibrium can be explained by differences in subprime originations across housing markets. We also find that short run price dynamics is driven by momentum in both segments of the market.","[Damianov, Damian S.] Univ Durham, Dept Econ & Finance, Mill Hill Lane, Durham DH1 3LB, England; [Escobari, Diego] Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA",Durham University; University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,"Escobari, D (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Rio Grande Valley, Dept Econ & Finance, Edinburg, TX 78539 USA.",damian.damianov@durham.ac.uk; diego.escobari@utrgv.edu,,"Escobari, Diego/0000-0003-4532-8563",,,,,45,14,18,0,22,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0895-5638,1573-045X,,J REAL ESTATE FINANC,J.

A further investigation of countries at different levels of development suggests two striking findings. First, besides the domestic investment, openness, human capital and IPRs protection, R&D is the key to drive economic growth in the higher-income countries, while FDI is the engine of growth in both higher-income and middle-income countries. Second, a positive and significant impact of IPRs protection on economic growth is found in both higher-income and lower-income countries.

The present paper analyses the various factors contributing to a low percentage of bicycling in the Bangalore city and elicits certain policy aspects to improve the attractiveness of bicycling. The study focuses mainly on the behavioral aspects of commuters pertaining to their childhood and current scenario, and uses a face-to-face questionnaire survey for data collection. These behavioral aspects indicated a commuter's perception about social expectation, convenience and bicycling infrastructure using a 5-point Likert scale measurement. Information is also collected about factors that might motivate bicycling, and about demographic variables like age, gender, income, etc. The study used a statistical z-test to identify the most influential attitudinal factors and to check whether the various factors are significantly different. The results gave a clear picture about the most dominant attitudinal factors that resulted in the stoppage of bicycling during a commuter's childhood, and that acted as a deterrent to their bicycle usage in a current scenario. The study determined a need for changing the attitude of people towards cycling by programs that would create a positive image for cycling. There was also a need for segregated cycle lanes and signals at intersections so that people could feel safe while travelling on cycles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Rahul, T.

Using a Markov switching framework enables us to analyze the dynamic behavior of the information shares during tranquil and crisis periods. The results show that price discovery takes place mostly on the CDS market. The importance of the CDS market even increases during the more volatile crisis periods. According to a cross sectional analysis liquidity is the main determinant of a market's contribution to price discovery. During the crisis period, however, we also find a positive link between leverage and CDS market information shares. Overall the results indicate that price discovery measures and their determinants change during tranquil and crisis periods, which emphasizes the importance of more flexible frameworks, such as Markov switching models.","[Dimpfl, Thomas; Peter, Franziska J.] Univ Tubingen, Dept Stat Econometr & Empir Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Dimpfl, T (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Stat Econometr & Empir Econ, Mohlstr 36, D-72074 Tubingen, Germany.",thomas.dimpfl@uni-tuebingen.de,"Dimpfl, Thomas/X-3909-2019; Peter, Franziska/AAJ-1635-2020; Dimpfl, Thomas/AGJ-1270-2022","Dimpfl, Thomas/0000-0003-3415-7412; Peter, Franziska/0000-0002-5366-2070; Dimpfl, Thomas/0000-0003-3415-7412","German Research Foundation (DFG) [GR 2288-3, DFG SFB 649]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We are indebted to Irina Dyshko who did an excellent job when implementing a first version of the code during her master thesis.

Despite its recognized virtue, incorporation of both temporal and frequency information has still gained limited attention in the framework of market integration. In this paper, a novel measure is proposed, which better adapts to the time-frequency content of market indices for quantifying the degree of their integration. To this end, advanced statistical signal processing techniques are employed to extract market interrelations not only across time, but also across frequency, thus distinguishing between short and long-term investors. Specifically, probabilistic principal component analysis is employed to extract the principal factors explaining the cross-market returns, while a Hough transformation, applied on appropriate time-scale wavelet decompositions of the original time series and the principal factors, is exploited to extract global patterns in the time-scale domain by detecting local features. Then, statistical divergence between the corresponding Hough transformed time-scale decompositions is used to quantify the degree of market integration. The efficiency of the proposed measure is evaluated on a set of 12 equity indices in the framework of well-diversified portfolio construction revealing an improved performance against alternative market integration measures, in terms of typical financial performance metrics.","[Tzagkarakis, George; Caicedo-Llano, Juliana] EONOS Investment Technol, 12 Rue Meder, F-75017 Paris, France; [Caicedo-Llano, Juliana] Univ Evry Val dEssonne, Evry, France; [Dionysopoulos, Thomas] AXIANTA Res, Nicosia, Cyprus; [Dionysopoulos, Thomas] Avenir Finance Investment Managers, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Tzagkarakis, G (通讯作者)，EONOS Investment Technol, 12 Rue Meder, F-75017 Paris, France.",geotzag@gmail.com; juliana.caicedollano@univ-evry.fr; dplsthomas@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,2,2,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Dealing with the variability of incomes, it is therefore distinct from a large number of studies explaining the level effects of globalization on income in the labor market. It provides an assessment that directly connects labor income risk and offshoring trends in a panel setting at the industry level using German data. Importantly, we distinguish between transitory and permanent risk to individual income. Permanent income risk is defined as the variance of unpredictable shocks to income that do not fade out over time. Different from transitory short-term fluctuations, it has a particular welfare relevance. Our findings suggest that, at the industry level, permanent labor income risk decreases with offshoring. This effect is particularly strong for offshoring to low-income destinations.","[Hogrefe, Jan] Ctr Econ Res ZEW, Mannheim, Germany; [Hogrefe, Jan] Boeing Co, Chicago, IL USA; [Yao, Yao] Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, JG Smith Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Boeing; University of Birmingham,"Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Dept Econ, JG Smith Bldg, Birmingham B15 2TT, W Midlands, England.",y.yao@bham.ac.uk,,,,,,,42,2,2,1,15,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

Twenty-two turning points are identified, all of which turn out to be robust.

Methods: Data for the period 1955-1975 were derived from published records. Data for the period 1985-2010 were derived from the Chinese National Survey on Students' Constitution and Health (CNSSCH). Since 1985, the overall sampling and measurement methods have been consistent. The mean, the standard deviation, and the variance (ANOVA) of height, weight, and BMI by age and sex of students aged 7-17 were calculated and analyzed. Results: Between 1955 and 2010, the average height and weight of children in Beijing has increased. The average increments per decade for boys and girls were 2.45 cm and 2.03 cm in height and 2.68 kg and 1.68 kg in weight, respectively. The largest height increase per decade occurred between 1975 and 1985: 4.51 cm and 3.23 cm for boys and girls, respectively. The largest height increase for the entire 55-year period under study occurred among boys at age 13 (17.85 cm) and among girls at age 11 (15.90 cm.) Conclusions: During the period 1955-2010, growth trends among children in Beijing were positive. The health and nutritional status of these children improved significantly. Since 2007, might be related to government intervention, childhood obesity has been curbed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use self-reported obesity rates, along with estimates of misclassification rates, to derive upper and lower bounds for the true population obesity rate. These bounds are then used as the basis for obesity rankings. Our results show, that once measurement error is taken into account, it is difficult to obtain meaningful rankings across European countries. However, our analysis shows that it is still possible to rank US states by obesity status using only minimal assumptions on the nature of the error process. As a result, cross-state variation in self-reported BMI, when used in conjunction with our bounds, may still provide a useful source of information for understanding the causes and consequences of obesity in the USA.","[O'Neill, Donal; Sweetman, Olive] Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Co Kildare, Ireland",Maynooth University,"O'Neill, D (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Maynooth, Dept Econ, Maynooth, Co Kildare, Ireland.",donal.oneill@nuim.ie; olive.sweetman@nuim.ie,,"O'Neill, Donal/0000-0001-5516-2603",,,,,31,0,0,0,7,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The reason, we argue, is political. While the standard model assumes governments to be democratic, more than a third of countries worldwide are non-democratic.

What explains these choices? We are most interested theoretically in the role played by regime type. The alliances literature typically uses a narrow institutional theory of the effects of regime type, which implies that more democratic regimes are more attractive alliance partners than more authoritarian regimes. Post-communist area specialists will be aware that this institutional theory fails to explain the apparent tendency of more authoritarian post-communist regimes to join the CIS/CSTO. We develop a broader ideological theory of how regime type affects alliances, in which political institutions are complemented by substantive ideological and policy goals. Applying the ideological approach to the post-communist world, we define and measure two main ideological regime types - liberal nationalist regimes and neo-communist authoritarian regimes. Multinomial logit regressions indicate that more democratic, liberal nationalist regimes are more likely to affiliate with NATO, whereas more authoritarian, neo-communist regimes are more likely to join the CIS/CSTO. Moreover, the desire of neo-communist authoritarianism regimes to affiliate with the CIS/CSTO is as strong or stronger than that of neo-liberal democracies to affiliate with NATO - largely because NATO is more reluctant than Russia to accept aspirants. We conclude that the ideological approach to regime type may offer significant explanatory value as a refinement of the institutional approach.","[Horowitz, Shale] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Tyburski, Michael] Tulane Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New Orleans, LA 70118 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; Tulane University,"Horowitz, S (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Polit Sci, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",shale@uwm.edu,"Tyburski, Michael/AAC-1360-2020","Tyburski, Michael/0000-0001-6487-4039",,,,,35,1,1,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1060-586X,1938-2855,,POST-SOV AFF,Post-Sov.

Rather, the substantive implications of independence for an SEU representation may equivalently be derived from less demanding conditions over certain smaller classes of acts. These acts, which we refer to as uncertainty-free comparable acts, have the property that they are relatively simple for a decision maker to compare because she can rank acts within any such class based on her risk preferences alone, without having to consider the underlying uncertainty.

What drives this decline? We try to answer this question by developing and implementing a detailed Fairlie decomposition approach. Using linked employer-employee data from the German Structure of Earnings Survey for 2001 and 2006, we document a sharp drop in collective bargaining coverage that amounts to 17 percentage points for males and 20 percentage points for females in West, and 8 and 14 percentage points, respectively, in East Germany. We find that neither changes in the characteristics nor changes in the coefficients associated with the characteristics as a whole provide an explanation for the drop in collective bargaining coverage. The drop in coverage is the result of an unexplained time trend.","[Sommerfeld, Katrin] ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Environm & Resource Econ, Environm Management, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany; [Fitzenberger, Bernd] Humboldt Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Chair Econometr, Spandauer Str 1, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Humboldt University of Berlin,"Sommerfeld, K (通讯作者)，ZEW, Ctr European Econ Res, Dept Environm & Resource Econ, Environm Management, L7,1, D-68161 Mannheim, Germany.",fitzenbb@hu-berlin.de; sommerfeld@zew.de,,,,,,,59,2,2,1,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

The findings indicate that in the long run each dollar of German aid is associated with an average increase of US$ 0.83 US of German goods exports. The sectors that benefit the most in terms of exports and employment are machinery, electrical equipment and transport equipment. According to our estimates using input-output analysis and a partial equilibrium framework, the aid-induced gains in sectoral exports are associated with the gross employment of approximately 216,000 people.","[Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Nowak-Lehmann, Felicitas; Klasen, Stephan] Univ Gottingen, Iberoamer Inst Econ Res, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada; Klasen, Stephan; Johannsen, Florian] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Jaume I Univ, Dept Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Jaume I Univ, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; University of Gottingen; Universitat Jaume I; Universitat Jaume I,"Nowak-Lehmann, F (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Iberoamer Inst Econ Res, Pl Gottinger Sieben 3, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany.",imartin@uni-goettingen.de; fnowak@uni-goettingen.de; sklasen@uni-goettingen.de; Florian.Johannsen@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ),We would like to thank the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) for financing the study.

In their recent work, Waltman et al. (J Evol Econ 21(5): 737-756, 2011) consider binary encoding and its possible contribution to a phenomenon referred to as premature convergence; the observation that different individual runs of the genetic algorithm can lead to very different results. While Alkemade et al. (Comput Econ 28(4): 355-370, 2006), (Comput Intell 23(2): 162-175, 2007), (Comput Econ 33(1): 99-101, 2009) argue that premature convergence is caused by insufficient population size, Waltman et al. argue that this phenomenon depends crucially on strategies being encoded in binary form. This conclusion is based on their illustration that premature convergence can be avoided even in simulations with small populations so long as real, rather than binary, encoding of strategies is utilized. Utilizing their methodology, we return to the consideration of the cause of premature convergence. After robustness checks with respect to the length of the binary string used for encoding, the fitness function, and the form of mutation, it is concluded that an alternative specification of mutation may also alleviate the occurrence of premature convergence. It is argued that this alternative form of mutation may be more appropriate in a wider range of problems where real encoding of strategies may not prove sufficient.","[Maschek, Michael K.] Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Econ, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada",University of Fraser Valley,"Maschek, MK (通讯作者)，Univ Fraser Valley, Dept Econ, 33844 King Rd, Abbotsford, BC V2S 7M8, Canada.",michael.maschek@ufv.ca,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

This paper contributes to this line of research by proposing a methodology for including cycling-related indicators in mobility surveys based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and applying an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to evaluate the structure of latent variables associated with bicycle commuting. The EFA identified six cycling latent variables: Lifestyle, Safety and comfort, Awareness, Direct disadvantages, Subjective norm, and Individual capabilities. These were complemented with a latent variable related to habit: Non-commuting cycling habit. Statistical differences and regression analysis were applied with the cycling latent variables. The study also includes the relationship between objective factors and bicycle commuting, which reveals minor associations. This methodology was applied to the starter cycling city of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain). The results confirm that in this context - in transition to a cyclable city- safety and comfort issues are not the main barriers for all commuters, although more progress needs to be made to normalise cycling. A set of customised policy initiatives is recommended in the light of the research findings, including marketing campaigns to encourage non-commuting cycling trips, bicycle measures to target social groups as opposed to individuals, bicycle-specific programs such as Bike-to-work Days, and cycling courses.

The same applies to the empirical analysis of networks in general. We use cross-unit averages to extract common factors (viewed as a source of strong cross-sectional dependence) and compare the results with the principal components approach widely used in the literature. We then apply multiple testing procedures to the de-factored observations in order to determine significant bilateral correlations (signifying connections) between spatial units and compare this to an approach that just uses distance to determine units that are neighbours. We apply these methods to real house price changes at the level of Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the USA, and estimate a heterogeneous spatio-temporal model for the de-factored real house price changes and obtain significant evidence of spatial connections, both positive and negative.

Using GMM models, the study aims to test whether accounts payable may follow a model of partial adjustment, and aims to find empirical evidence that supports the financial function of trade credit. Results support the hypothesis of the existence of a model of partial adjustment, since accounts payable of the previous year affect accounts payable of the following year. Results also support the matching hypotheses, since firms that grant extended payment terms to their customers tend to demand delayed accounts payable from their suppliers.

The core link in the institutional transformation lies in the main body of institution supply. Nevertheless, the cost-benefit analysis of the main body of institution supply is not identical with institution demanders, leading to institutional supply and demand disequilibrium due to the institutional supply insufficiency. Main bodies of institution supply on different hierarchical levels have disparate interest appeals, which have resulted in the discrepancy between the desiderative institution supply and actual institution supply.

In this contribution we have analysed consumers' expectations in a deflationary environment. The aim of this paper is to analyze consumers' expectations in a deflationary environment using data from Consumer Expectations Survey conducted by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs as well as data on rates of inflation published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development were used. We have found that European consumers consider consumer's prices as growing even during a deflation. Consumers are incompetent in predicting a future deflation. Current deflation does not help consumers to expect deflation in the following year. The severest deflation during the Great Recession was experienced in Ireland. However, there was a drawdown primarily in the Irish spending on durable-goods. The decrease of spending on non-durable goods was just modest, spending on services remained stable and spending on semi-durable goods actually grew. Based on the results of our analysis, we might conclude, that there is no evidence of a deflationary spiral.","[Fischer, Jakub] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic; [Lipovska, Hana] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Masaryk University Brno,"Fischer, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",fischerj@vse.cz; lipovska@mail.muni.cz,"Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012","Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974",[MUNI/A/0915/2015],,"The research has been supported by specific research MUNI/A/0915/2015 Economic Policy in EU and Czech Republic III and with contribution of long term institutional support of research activities by the Faculty of Informatics and Statistics, University of Economics, Prague.",,17,2,2,0,3,"UNIV BANSKA BYSTRICA, FAC ECONOMICS MATEJ BEL",BANSKA BYSTRICA,"TAJOVSKEHO, 10, BANSKA BYSTRICA, 975 90, SLOVAKIA",2453-9902,,978-80-89438-04-4,APPLI MATH STAT ECON,Applications of Mathematics and Statistics in Economics Conference Proceedings,,2016,,,,,,,95,104,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BH2KW,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000399024100010,0

Having a good allocation in mind, a mechanism with verification selects few critical agents and detects, using a verification oracle, whether they have reported truthfully. If yes, the mechanism produces the desired allocation. Otherwise, the mechanism ignores any misreports and proceeds recursively with the remaining agents. We obtain randomized truthful (or almost truthful) mechanisms without money that verify only O (ln m/epsilon) agents, where m is the number of outcomes, independently of the total number of agents, and are (1-epsilon)-approximate for the social welfare. We also show that any truthful mechanism with a constant approximation ratio needs to verify Omega (log m) agents. A remarkable property of our mechanisms is immunity (to agent misreports), namely that their outcome depends only on the reports of the truthful agents.","[Fotakis, Dimitris] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Div Comp Sci, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens 15780, Greece; [Tzamos, Christos; Zampetakis, Manolis] MIT, Comp Sci & Artificial Intelligence Lab, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",National Technical University of Athens; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Fotakis, D (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Div Comp Sci, Sch Elect & Comp Engn, Athens 15780, Greece.",fotakis@cs.ntua.gr; tzamos@mit.edu; mzampet@mit.edu,,"Zampetakis, Manolis/0009-0005-4967-5927; Tzamos, Christos/0000-0002-7560-5069",,,,,32,3,3,0,3,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,NEW YORK,"1515 BROADWAY, NEW YORK, NY 10036-9998 USA",,,978-1-4503-3936-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,771,788,,10.1145/2940716.2940743,0.0,,,18,"Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Economics",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Computer Science; Business & Economics,BF5LO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382226300072,0

In our model, tax inspectors could accept a bribe from a taxpayer for under-reporting his income or to avoid harassment in the form of red tape. The government's problem is to design a tax policy and the associated monitoring probability to enforce it. Raising tax rates increases enforcement costs as it increases bribery incentives, so it is optimal not to set tax rates at a too high level. The optimal tax policy includes an optimal supervision level required to reduce corruption, which in turns depends on tax collectors' capacity to impose red tape on taxpayers. When bureaucrats are heterogeneous in terms of their capacity to impose red tape costs, an intermediate detection probability might be appropriate efficiency-wise even if it means tolerating some level of corruption. Bureaucrats' heterogeneity as the likely source of observation of corruption in equilibrium is generic to various environments in which agents' delegated power is misused for private gains and various examples are discussed in the paper. We also show how a government could face lose-lose as well as win-win situations in the conduct of its revenue collection policies.","[Gauthier, Bernard] HEC Montreal, Inst Econ Appl, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Goyette, Jonathan] Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Adm, Dept Econ, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada",Universite de Montreal; HEC Montreal; University of Sherbrooke,"Goyette, J (通讯作者)，Univ Sherbrooke, Fac Adm, Dept Econ, 2500 Blvd Univ, Sherbrooke, PQ J1K 2R1, Canada.",jonathan.goyette@usherbrooke.ca,,,,,,,47,5,5,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2016,46.0,1.0,,,,,57,79,,10.1007/s00355-015-0903-6,0.0,,,23,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020500003,0

However, this seed contains several oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, which can cause flatulence for humans, and these substances will also create a darker color during flour processing. Effort to reduce this type of oligosaccharides is reported here by introducing fermentation technique using Lactobacillus plantarum. The aim of this study is to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of jackfruit seed flour fermented by fermentation process for 32 hours incubation time. The results showed that the jackfruit seed flour after fermentation processes have different characteristics compare to that of non-fermented one. The degree of whiteness of jackfruit flour produced under longer time of incubation during fermentation were higher compare to that of shorter duration. Based on the result of FTIR analysis, starch structure differences could not be seen between flour produced from fermentation process and without fermentation. It means that the fermentation process by L. plantarum were not able to change the structure or the degree of polymerization of the starch molecules. The only changes observed were the differences of the oligosaccharides content. The more incubation time assigned, the higher the amount of raffinose detected in the flour, followed by the decrease of the bigger oligosaccharides content such as stachyose and verbascose, as has been shown by HPLC chromatogram, which indicate that enzyme produced by L. plantarum during fermentation process is able to degrade bigger oligosaccharides rather than raffinose.

The classic models are the Q-test, the Credibility index and Rudolf Doucha's Balance analysis, all of which were created decades ago. Despite this, they are still popular. These three indicators are among the most frequently used in scientific publications. The author asked a number of questions related to their practical use. Despite their age they have not yet been answered. For instance, do they still serve the purpose for which they were created? Does the assessment of financial health return the same results using these various indicators? Can individual indicators bring contradictory results describing the financial health of analyzed companies? Which is the best indicator describing companies' economic condition? To answer these questions a set of nearly 1500 companies was analyzed. A key research finding is that the Credibility Index is the most accurate model for predicting creditworthiness and the accuracy of individual models varies. The results of the Q-test and the Balance Analysis I. using the Credibility Index can be very accurately predicted only on the basis of conditioned probability.","[Kubenka, Michal] Univ Pardubice, Inst Business Econ & Management, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Kubenka, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Inst Business Econ & Management, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",michal.kubenka@upce.cz,,,,,,,14,1,1,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,985,995,,,,,,11,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100097,0

Functional dependence is linear for MA, AR, ARMA. We consider a general functional dependence, but, existence of a forward and a backward equivalent rewritings of the given functional equation is required.

First, the classical discounted cash flow method is reviewed briefly. Further, we are focused on analytical and numerical methods for real options pricing. Depending on assumptions relating interest rates, there are divided into two groups. The first group of methods is based upon constant interest rate, whilst the second one is based upon stochastic interest rates.

Consequently, two competing approaches to this issue have emerged: an evaluative approach and an empirical (non-evaluative) approach. Advocates of both approaches agree that one of the most important challenges that they have to meet consists in accommodating the judgement that, all other things being equal, the more diverse a set of freedom is, the more overall freedom it offers us. The diversity of one's freedoms seems to depend, however, on the degree to which they are significantly different from one another, and the notion of significant difference is a value-based notion. Hence, it seems that, unlike the evaluative approach, the empirical approach cannot meet this challenge. This claim has been contested, though, by Ian Carter. In his seminal book Ameasure of freedom he argues that his empirical theory of overall freedom-measurement manages to accommodate the aforementioned judgement about freedom and diversity as effectively as any evaluative theory, and shows, moreover, why the evaluative way of dealing with this issue in general is misguided. In this article I argue that, as a matter of fact, it is Carter's non-evaluative theory of freedom and diversity that is misguided, as it cannot properly accommodate the aforementioned judgement about freedom and diversity. If my argument is sound, then it would not only undermine Carter's theory of freedom and diversity. It would also cast a very serious doubt on the empirical approach to overall freedom-measurement in general.","[Shnayderman, Ronen] Univ Hamburg, Dept Philosophy, Von Melle Pk 6, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Shnayderman, R (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Dept Philosophy, Von Melle Pk 6, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ronenshman@gmail.com,,,German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft),German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"I am very grateful to Ian Carter for his comments on an earlier version of this article, and to the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) for its financial support.",,30,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2016,46.0,1.0,,,,,39,55,,10.1007/s00355-015-0902-7,0.0,,,17,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,DH8CG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373020500002,0

Therefore, knowing the definition of management and leadership is the first thing. Different people have different ideas about management and leadership. Dubrin (2011, p. 2) defines leadership as, the ability to inspire confidence and support among the people who are needed to achieve organizational goals. Weathersby (1999, p. 2) says, Management is the allocation of scarce resources against an organization's objective, the setting of priories, the design of work and the achievement of results. Accordingly, these two terms have very close relationship between each other. On the other hand, there are many distinctions between these two as well (Solomon & Costea & Nita, 2016). Kotterman (2006) supports that it is unpractical for one person to take responsibility for both management and leadership areas. Leadership and management are two distinctive and complementary systems of action ( Kotter, 1990, cited in Kotterman, 2006, P. 15). Therefore, understanding their differences is very important because leadership and management affect the whole development of organizations (Bargau & Marian, 2015).","[Yang, Rui] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia",University of Sydney,"Yang, R (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",,,,,,,,15,1,3,0,8,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-263-3,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,85.0,,,,,,1168,1171,,,,,,4,Economics; Education & Educational Research; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research,BI0YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405302500248,0

More importantly, such incrementality demonstrates strong seasonality during the year, and do not necessarily correlate with the paid search spend levels.

In order to achieve collective interests, the authorities sought to create a social, and therefore a legal order imposed from above by marginalizing civil law in favour of public law. Property law was affected the most by this transformation, especially the traditional rule of the legal unity of real property - everything permanently connected to the ground is considered a part of it and shares the same legal status as the ground - which originated in the Roman principle superficies solo cedit. Disregarding this legal rule, common to all European civil codes, resulted in a compromised land register system and lack of legal certainty. Through reforms of the legal system after declaring its independence in 1991, Croatia started the process of returning to the civil law roots and the European identity it once had been a part of. Although the legal unity of real property was re-established and all the requirements on the normative level have been satisfied, the consequences of privatization are still present in practice due to insufficient application of law and the atavism of socialist legal reasoning and mentality. Despite some misconceptions that former socialist countries due to their communist legacy resemble a. juridical wasteland., whose legal systems are supposed to be built from the ground up, the aim of the following contribution is to analyse the challenges of a transitioning legal system in its process of rebuilding the civil-style mode of legal thought by returning to its Roman legal foundations.","[Ziha, Nikol] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Ziha, N (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Law, Osijek, Croatia.",nikolz@pravos.hr,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,2,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,73,83,,,,,,11,Business; Criminology & Penology; Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Criminology & Penology; Government & Law,BG7GA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254400008,0

While the biological and economic standards of living of a population are very different concepts, they are linked and may empirically move together. If this is so, then cohort heights can also be used to make inferences about the economic standard of living and health of a population when other data are not available. We investigate how informative this approach is in terms of inferring income, nutrition, and mortality using data on heights from developing countries over the last 50 years for female cohorts born 1951-1992. We find no evidence that the absolute differences in adult height across countries are associated with different economic living standards. Within countries, however, faster increases in adult cohort height over time are associated with more rapid growth of GDP per capita, life expectancy, and nutritional intake. Using our instrumental variable approach, each centimeter gain in height is associated with a 6% increase in income per capita, a reduction in infant mortality of 7 per thousand (or an 1.25 year increase in life expectancy), and an increase in nutrition of 64 calories and 2 grams of protein per person per day relative to the global trend. We find that increases in cohort height can predict increases in income even for countries not used in the estimation of the relationship. This suggests our approach has predictive power out of sample for countries where we lack income and health data. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Variation in the unemployment rate by state was also used to investigate the cyclical nature of sleep duration. We conducted separate estimations for males and females, as well as for those who received a fixed salary and hourly wages. The findings predominantly revealed no relationship between sleep duration and the business cycle. However, an inverse relationship between sleep duration and wages was detected. This is in accordance with sleep duration being an economic choice variable, rather than a predetermined subtraction of the 24-h day. Although the inverse relationship was not significant in all the estimations for salaried subjects, it was consistent and strong for subjects who received hourly wages. For instance, elasticity measures were -.03 for those who received hourly wages and -.003 for those who received a fixed salary. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Consumers choose between these products based on consumer reviews and their own experience. We examine how the market share of the superior product is affected by (i) the number of reviews obtained by consumers; and (ii) the type of information conveyed in these reviews. We find that when consumers randomly sample reviews from the entire population, an increase in the number of reviews can decrease the market share of the superior product. This, however, is not the case when consumers seek out reviews on each product. Further, we find that the market share of the superior product can be significantly lower when reviews convey subjective satisfaction compared to when they convey objective payoffs. This effect depends on the degree of heterogeneity in consumer expectations.","[Bhole, Bharat; Hanna, Brid G.] Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA",Rochester Institute of Technology,"Bhole, B (通讯作者)，Rochester Inst Technol, Dept Econ, Rochester, NY 14623 USA.",bharat.bhole@rit.edu; bxggse@rit.edu,,,,,,,16,1,1,1,34,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

Few empirical studies have investigated how individuals respond to advance purchase deadlines and price uncertainties induced by these deadlines. We model the number of searches (and purchases) for specific search and departure dates using an instrumental variable approach that corrects for price endogeneity. Results show that search and purchase behaviors vary by search day of week, days from departure, lowest offered fares, variation in lowest offered fares across competitors, and market distance. After controlling for the presence of web bots, we find that the number of consumer searches increases just prior to an advance purchase deadline. This increase can be explained by consumers switching their desired departure dates by one or two days to avoid higher fares that occur immediately after an advance purchase deadline has passed. This reallocation of demand has significant practical implications for the airline industry because the majority of revenue management and scheduling decision support systems currently do not incorporate these behaviors.

We hypothesise that the existing institutions were not strong enough to meet emerging social demands through formal channels. We will show evidence for the hypothesis that the government's incorporation of students' demands in its agenda was mainly a response to the role of the media, the fact that it is not difficult for students to organise themselves and express their demands, the support of students' families and the ruling government's fear of missing out on a second term in office.","[Letelier S, Leonardo E.; Davila A, Mireya] Univ Chile, Inst Asuntos Publ, Santiago 8320208, Chile",Universidad de Chile,"Letelier, LE (通讯作者)，Univ Chile, Inst Asuntos Publ, Santa Lucia 240, Santiago 8320208, Chile.",lletelie@iap.uchile.cl; miredavila67@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,6,8,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

The network consists of airports and airspace/air routes between them where airlines operate their flights. Resilience is considered as the ability of the network to neutralize the impacts of disruptive event(s). Friability implies reducing the network's existing resilience due to removing particular nodes/airports and/or links/air routes, and consequently cancelling the affected airline flights. The costs imply additional expenses imposed on airports, airlines, and air passengers as the potentially most affected actors/stakeholders due to mitigating actions such as delaying, cancelling and rerouting particular affected flights. These actions aim at maintaining both the network's resilience and safety at the acceptable level under given conditions. Large scale disruptive events, which can compromise the resilience and friability of a given air transport network, include bad weather, failures of particular (crucial) network components, the industrial actions of the air transport staff, natural disasters, terrorist threats/attacks and traffic incidents! accidents. The methodology is applied to the selected real-life case under given conditions. In addition, this methodology could be used for pre-selecting the location of airline hub airport(s), assessing the resilience of planned airline schedules and the prospective consequences, and designing mitigating measures before, during, and in the aftermath of a disruptive event. As such, it could, with slight modifications, be applied to transport networks operated by other transport modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of Italy's fiscal adjustment in the run-up to EMU is used to show that external constraints and well-functioning institutions may well be just auxiliary. The success factor in the country's macroeconomic stabilization was that competing socio-economic interests, while all in favour of disinflation, could eventually agree on the size and composition of the adjustment thanks to side-payments in the form of a devalued currency. These are unavailable under EMU, which explains why the fiscal reform momentum slowed down, notwithstanding EU fiscal rules. Domestic preference formation goes back a long way: it is associated with an incremental process of institutional change that started in 1981 with the enhanced independence of the Bank of Italy and continued with labour market and budget reform in the late 1980s.","[Marzinotto, Benedicta] Univ Udine, I-33100 Udine, Italy; [Marzinotto, Benedicta] Coll Europe, Brugge, Belgium",University of Udine,"Marzinotto, B (通讯作者)，Univ Udine, Dept Econ, Via Tomadini 30-A, I-33100 Udine, Italy.",benedicta.marzinotto@uniud.it,,,,,,,51,0,0,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This caused a debate among various organizations about who is responsible for this development. While many Non-Governmental Organizations proclaim that speculations in future markets cause the rise in food prices, academic research provides ambiguous results on this topic. This controversy is the motivation for this study. In order to offer additional insights, the relationship between the price changes of corn, wheat, and soybeans and the corresponding changes in open interests are analyzed. Commitments of Traders as well as Disaggregated Commitments of Traders reports are investigated to determine whether the activities of speculators adversely affect food prices. First, Johansen cointegration tests are employed to analyze the relationship between price and position data. Second, VAR and VECM are used to analyze short- and long-term dynamics. The results of the empirical analysis demonstrate that in the short-run price changes precede changes in open interest. Additionally,soybeans show a long-run equilibrium relationship between both series, indicating that speculators influenced past prices to some extent. However, the percentage price change is rather low. Therefore, sharp rises in soybean prices cannot be explained by it.","[Maul, Daniel; Fischer, Martin; Schiereck, Dirk] Tech Univ Darmstadt, Fachbereich Rechts & Wirtschaftswissensch, Fachgebiet Unternehmensfinanzierung, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany",Technical University of Darmstadt,"Maul, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Darmstadt, Fachbereich Rechts & Wirtschaftswissensch, Fachgebiet Unternehmensfinanzierung, Hsch Str 1, D-64289 Darmstadt, Germany.",maul@bwl.tu-darmstadt.de,,,,,,,53,1,1,0,21,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

Export intermediaries such as wholesalers serve different markets and export different products than manufacturing exporters do. Wholesalers are more prevalent in markets with higher destination-specific fixed costs and focus on products that are less differentiated, have lower contract intensity, and have large sunk entry costs. Aggregate exports to destinations with high shares of indirect exports are less responsive to changes in the real exchange rate than are exports to markets served primarily by direct exporters.","[Bernard, Andrew B.] Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, CEPR, Dartmouth, NS, Canada; [Bernard, Andrew B.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Grazzi, Marco] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] LEM Scuola Super S Anna, Pisa, Italy",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Bologna; University of Trento,"Bernard, AB (通讯作者)，Tuck Sch Business Dartmouth, CEPR, Dartmouth, NS, Canada.",,"Bernard, Andrew B/G-9809-2011; Grazzi, Marco/A-6195-2012","Grazzi, Marco/0000-0002-4196-6122; Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351","European Commission 6th FP, Project: DIME-Dynamics of Institutions and Markets in Europe [CIT3-CT-2005-513396]; Marie Curie Program Grant COFUND Provincia Autonoma di Trento; European University Institute; Tuck School of Business; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish","European Commission 6th FP, Project: DIME-Dynamics of Institutions and Markets in Europe; Marie Curie Program Grant COFUND Provincia Autonoma di Trento; European University Institute; Tuck School of Business; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC))","This is a substantially revised version of NBER working paper 17711 and CEPR discussion paper 8766, Intermediaries in International Trade: Direct versus Indirect Modes of Export.

Weak evidence of integration is found between Spain-France and Germany-France since no cross volatility transmissions are estimated. There are increasing price convergence and significant mean and volatility spillovers in the rest of the country pairs.

Distinctive developments of the generation mix are studied, assuming that a shift toward renewables may have temporary or permanent impacts on network congestion. We specifically analyze the relative performance of a combined merchant-regulatory price-cap mechanism, a cost-based rule, and a non-regulated approach in dynamic generation settings. We find that incentive regulation may perform better than cost-based regulation but only when appropriate weights are used. While quasi-ideal weights generally restore the beneficial properties that incentive regulatory mechanisms are well-known for, pure Laspeyres weights may either lead to over-investment or delayed investments as compared to the welfare-optimum benchmark. Laspeyres-Paasche weights, in turn, seem appropriate under permanently or temporarily increased network congestion. Thus, our analysis provides motivation for further research in order to characterize optimal regulation for transmission expansion in the context of renewable integration.","[Egerer, Jonas; Rosellon, Juan; Schill, Wolf-Peter] DIW Berlin, Dept Energy, Transportat, Environm, D-10117 Berlin, Germany; [Egerer, Jonas] Tech Univ Berlin, Workgrp Infrastruct Policy, Berlin, Germany; [Rosellon, Juan] CIDE, Dept Econ, Mexico City 01210, DF, Mexico",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung; Technical University of Berlin; Centro de Investigacion y Docencia Economicas A.C.

However, the cost of dedicated storage is high and all customers eventually have to pay. Deferrable demand offers an alternative form of storage that is potentially less expensive because the capital cost is shared between providing an energy service and supporting the grid. This paper presents an empirical analysis to illustrate the beneficial effects of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) and thermal storage on the total system cost using data for a hot summer day in New York City. The analysis shows how customers can reduce total system costs and their bills by 1) shifting load from expensive peak periods to less expensive off-peak periods, 2) reducing the amount of installed conventional generating capacity needed to maintain System Adequacy, and 3) providing ramping services to mitigate the variability of generation from renewable sources. Moreover, this paper demonstrates economic benefits of different types of customers with different deferrable demand capabilities under two bill payment policies, flat price payment and optimum price payment, and it finally shows how long it takes for customers to fully pay back their initial capital costs of PHEV or thermal storage under two different policies.","[Jeon, Wooyoung] Korea Energy Econ Inst, Uiwang 437713, South Korea; [Mo, Jung Youn] Korea Inst Ind Econ & Trade, Seoul 130741, South Korea; [Mount, Timothy D.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA",Korea Energy Economics Institute; Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade (KIET); Cornell University,"Jeon, W (通讯作者)，Korea Energy Econ Inst, Uiwang 437713, South Korea.",wooyoung.jeon@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,8,8,0,24,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2015,36.0,4.0,,,,,183,203,,10.5547/01956574.36.4.wjeo,0.0,,,21,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS5XP,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362151900010,0

To accommodate the spatial nature of the data we allow for spatially correlated short-run shocks. In this way, the speed of convergence to the equilibrium implied by the law of one price is estimated taking into account the effect of distances across cities. The parameters of the model are estimated using a generalized method of moments (GMM) method which incorporates moment conditions corresponding to a generalized least squares-like within estimator of regression parameters.

Drawing on interviews with young men and women who participated in a high school-based apprenticeship programme in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Ontario, this article argues that a closer consideration of the relationships between habitus and field are necessary in order to make apprenticeships a viable alternative for a larger number of young people.","[Lehmann, Wolfgang] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada; [Taylor, Alison] Univ British Columbia, Educ Studies, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario); University of British Columbia,"Lehmann, W (通讯作者)，Univ Western Ontario, Dept Sociol, Social Sci Ctr, Rm 5430, London, ON N6A 5C2, Canada.",wlehmann@uwo.ca,,"Lehmann, Wolfgang/0000-0003-3917-9979",Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC),The study was supported by a Standard Research Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC).,,46,10,12,1,23,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

The renter effect suggests that, all else equal, renters should prefer property taxation over other forms of taxation. We test that hypothesis using detailed. micro-level survey data that contains voter responses to two key questions: their willingness to pay higher property taxes to fund public services and their willingness to pay higher sales taxes to fund those services. Using a difference-in-differences estimation strategy, we find first that renters are approximately 10 to 18 percentage points more likely than homeowners to favor a property tax increase over a sales tax increase, a finding consistent with the presence of a renter effect. However, these results are not driven by the survey responses of renters. Analysis based on separate regressions for renters and homeowners reveals that renters are indifferent between a property tax increase and either a sales tax or state income tax increase, while homeowners strongly oppose a property tax increase relative to either a sales tax or state income tax increase. Further, the strong opposition among homeowners to the property tax is not eroded by including controls for income and other demographics as might be expected if these differences were driven by economic incentives. Finally, an examination of the variation in tax burden created by Proposition 13 in California shows no evidence that homeowner aversion to the property tax increases with the homeowner's relative tax burden. These findings of homeowner aversion to property taxes are consistent with recent work suggesting that salience matters when voters evaluate taxes, but also suggest that increased salience does not necessarily lead to more careful consideration of individual tax burdens.

Using Scharpf's 'input' and 'output' legitimacy concepts, it is argued in this article that its design does worsen the democratic deficit. There are good reasons to limit 'input legitimacy' for politically independent institutions. 'Output legitimacy' is then even more relevant. Transparency is a key part of 'output legitimacy'. It enables actors to judge whether the regulator is acting in the public's interest and can improve their outputs. This article focuses on the banking data that the supervisors collect. Data available to the European public is evaluated and compared to America's banking union. European practices are not comparable in terms of availability or detail. An original survey of relevant officials is conducted, which results in the finding that only 11 of 28 Member States release any information on the banks they supervise.

In this article, the innovation policy mix per country and changes in these mixes over time are identified. The analysis covers five main policy mix profiles of the EU Member States. An unexpected similarity and stability is found in the national innovation policy mixes of the Member States even though these countries face different innovation challenges. This reflects extensive transnational policy learning, which is a welcome development, but such a similarity among heterogeneous countries might indicate that innovation policies are not being tailored effectively to the real needs and situations in each Member State.","[Izsak, Kincsoe] Univ Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary; [Radosevic, Slavo] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of Debrecen; University of London; University College London,"Izsak, K (通讯作者)，Univ Debrecen, Doctoral Sch Geog Sci, Egyet Ter 1, Debrecen, Hungary.",kincso.izsak@technopolis-group.com,"Radosevic, Slavo/AAH-6516-2019; Xu, Tianying/AAB-8185-2020","Radosevic, Slavo/0000-0001-7905-2281;",,,,,42,18,18,0,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

This is a computer assisted learning program that teaches rural ethnic minority students in northwestern China Mandarin skills. Results show that this LWC-enhancing program not only improves the student test scores on the Mandarin language subject by 0.14-0.20 standard deviations but also improves the student math test scores by 0.22-0.23 standard deviations, possibly via improved language competency. It also has some positive effects on student nonacademic outcomes such as self-efficacy in studying Mandarin.

The central question of the study is to what extent and under what conditions the EU can be seen as an effective actor in multilateral security negotiations. It is argued that overall the EU was an effective player during the multilateral negotiations on the ATT, but the degree of its effectiveness varies along different dimensions. The EU was rather successful in the achievement of its goals and in maintaining external cohesion, but it scored relatively low in its efforts to commit the key stakeholders to sign up to the ATT. The EU's internal export control policy, together with the high level of institutional co-ordination and Member States' interest convergence, facilitated the EU's effectiveness in the ATT negotiations, whereas the international context proved to be the major constraining factor.","[Romanyshyn, Iulian] IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, I-55100 Lucca, Italy; [Romanyshyn, Iulian] Vrije Univ Brussel, Inst European Studies, Brussels, Belgium",IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Romanyshyn, I (通讯作者)，IMT Inst Adv Studies Lucca, Piazza San Francesco 19, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.",iulian.romanyshyn@imtlucca.it,,"Romanyshyn, Iulian/0009-0009-1512-2346",,,,,47,10,10,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Since a private contribution is measured by the amount of other goods a person is willing to give up for beach quality, it can be solicited in monetary terms or, when possible, in other forms, such as specific works. In this paper, by analysing the results of two surveys in Italy concerning stakeholders' perceptions of ICZM and their willingness to pay for these benefits, suggestions for beach management are provided to policymakers. One survey focuses on beach visitors who are asked to pay in monetary terms, while the other focuses on sunbathing establishment managers, who are asked to pay not only in monetary terms but also through beach works. The results show that the majority of these stakeholders are fully or partially aware of what ICZM is, and are unwilling to pay. However, regression analysis of those willing to pay suggests that promoting an information and education campaign about ICZM may be important if stakeholders' probability of paying is to be increased.","[Brandolini, Silva Marzetti Dall'Aste] Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Disegna, Marta] Free Univ Bolzano, Sch Econ & Management, I-39100 Bolzano, Italy",University of Bologna; Free University of Bozen-Bolzano,"Brandolini, SMD (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Sch Econ Management & Stat, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",silva.marzetti@unibo.it; marta.disegna@unibz.it,"Disegna, Marta/O-8210-2018","Disegna, Marta/0000-0002-3638-6772; marzetti, silva/0000-0001-8888-5736","EU through INTERREG IIIC; EU through BEACHMED-e, sub-project ICZM-MED","EU through INTERREG IIIC(Interreg Europe); EU through BEACHMED-e, sub-project ICZM-MED","The authors are most grateful to the referees for their helpful comments and suggestions.

Using the mandated changes to identify causality, we find that: (1) residential property values are more responsive to school spending changes than property tax rate changes; (2) business property values are more responsive to tax rate changes than school spending changes; and (3) business property values are more sensitive to changes in tax rates as compared to residential property.

Specifically the analysis focuses on East-Central Europeans in Britain: a sizeable cohort of largely economic and recent migrants. A large quantity of interviews with low-wage employers and recruiters is used to examine the role served by East-Central European migrant labour in the UK labour market, to question whether this function is distinct from conventional understandings of the function of migrant labour and to explore how employer practices and other processes produce' these employment relations. Based on the findings from this approach, an argument is developed which contends that the ready availability of a well perceived cohort of migrant labour has sustained and extended flexible labour market structures towards the bottom end of the labour market.","[McCollum, David] Univ St Andrews, Geog Migrat, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Findlay, Allan] Univ St Andrews, Populat Geog, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland",University of St Andrews; University of St Andrews,"McCollum, D (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Geog & Geosci, Irvine Bldg,North St, St Andrews KY16 9AL, Fife, Scotland.",dm82@st-andrews.ac.uk,,"McCollum, David/0000-0001-8716-6852",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Population Change [RES-625-28-0001]; ESRC [ES/K007394/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K007394/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Population Change(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This research was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Centre for Population Change (grant number RES-625-28-0001).,,37,88,94,2,36,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Based on a sample of 15,542 observations a cross-section model was estimated using ordinary least squares. The results reveal that a combination of socio-demographic, behavioural and motivation variables explain the spending patterns of international tourists in the Algarve. Analysis of the data indicates that tourist motivations related to accommodation facilities, cultural and historical resources, gastronomy, hospitality, prices and sightseeing tours positively affect tourists' spending. Moreover, the findings provide evidence that, over the years, the most loyal markets in Algarve reveal changing patterns in their spending behaviour. Destination management authorities should be aware of this spending behaviour of second-generation sun and sand visitors and should formulate strategies accordingly.

We examine if these programs led to worse mortgage outcomes using two approaches. The first examines whether more activity by CRA-covered lenders, or more loan sales to the GSEs, was associated with worse outcomes. The second uses regression discontinuity to determine if outcomes were worse at the geographic thresholds used by each program.

Inter alia, this depends on the size of the fiscal multiplier as Keynes (1933. The Means to Prosperity. London: Macmillan) underlined. We find that the government-expenditure multiplier was less than 1 in 1930s' Britain. Austerity was not self-defeating in the long run and even its initial impact probably did not raise the public debt-to-GDP ratio. In the later 1930s, there was a fiscal free lunch in that deficit-financed government spending would have improved public finances enough to pay for the interest on the extra debt.","[Crafts, Nicholas] Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Mills, Terence C.] Univ Loughborough, Sch Business & Econ, Loughborough, Leics, England",University of Warwick; Loughborough University,"Crafts, N (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Dept Econ, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",n.crafts@warwick.ac.uk; t.c.mills@lboro.ac.uk,,,Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/L011719/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,49,7,7,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

The main novelty of the paper is the use of a unique dataset, which merges the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) 2006 for Austria with structural business statistics from 2006-2008, resulting in 3,070 firm observations. For manufacturing firms, quantile regressions show that product innovations lagged two-years have a significantly positive but decreasing impact on employment growth over the conditional distribution given the impact of output and wage growth. For service firms, the positive employment effect of product innovations can only be observed for firms with high conditional employment growth rates. Results are robust with respect to the measurement of product innovations (e.g. market novelties or new to firm products). Process innovations exhibit a negative impact at the higher quantiles indicating that process innovations lead to an increase in labour productivity at the expense of employment. Furthermore organizational and marketing innovations do not have a significant impact on subsequent employment growth across the different quantiles.","[Falk, Martin] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria",,"Falk, M (通讯作者)，Austrian Inst Econ Res, Osterreich Inst Wirtschaftsforsch WIFO, Arsenal Objekt 20, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.",Martin.Falk@wifo.ac.at,"Falk, Martin Thomas/T-8325-2019","Falk, Martin Thomas/0000-0003-0518-6513",,,,,56,10,10,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0021-4027,2366-049X,,JAHRB NATL STAT,Jahrb.

In this paper we develop a flexible model of education production that incorporates the classroom-level time lost to disruption and the rate of learning during productive time as a function of teacher quality and individual propensity to acquire knowledge. We then investigate heterogeneity in class size effects by school poverty share, family income, teacher experience, and achievement percentile using data from Project STAR. We find that the benefits of small classes are consistently higher in schools with a larger low-income enrollment share. Conditional on school poverty share, we find little or no evidence that lower-income or lower-achieving students tend to realize larger benefits of smaller classes. Instead, we find that the return to smaller classes tends to increase with achievement regardless of school poverty share. Given the generally higher levels of disruption reported in higher poverty schools, this set of findings is consistent with, though not direct evidence of, the notion that reduced time lost to disruption is a primary mechanism through which smaller classes raise achievement and a compelling explanation for the empirical finding that class-size effects tend to be larger for lower-income children.","[McKee, Graham] Princeton Univ, Dept Econ, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Sims, Katharine R.

None of four arguments used to explain why it is acceptable to have the ECB as a LoLR for banks, while a LoLR role for governments has to be rejected, namely a) the missing euro area fiscal backstop, b) the long-term nature of the euro crisis, c) the example of the US as a monetary union without a LoLR for sub-states and d) the claim that central bank purchases of government bonds ultimately always lead to inflation, is convincing.

For justice officials anxious to expunge Stalin's repressive legacy, the resurrection of parole signalled a return to correctionalism, societal oversight over the Gulag, and a vastly reduced rate of incarceration. In practice, though, parole exposed significant continuities with the Stalinist Gulag, including endemic corruption, overwhelming concern with production, suspicion of outside interference in penal affairs, and constant upward pressure on the inmate population.

Consumers have an ex-ante ideal product (commitment preferences), but they and the monopolist are aware that consumers may fall prey to temptation preferences ex-post with some probability.

As a result, this paper shows that the firm narrows the variety of products, not offering those products close to temptation preferences.

The influence of past exposure to the built environment on current vehicle ownership decisions may be causal, but there are alternative explanations. Households may primarily select to live in neighborhoods that facilitate their vehicle ownership preferences, or they may retain preferences that they have developed in the past, irrespective of their current situations. This study seeks to control for these alternative explanations by including the built environment attributes of households' past residences as an influence on vehicle ownership choices. We use a dataset from a credit reporting firm that contains up to nine previous residential ZIP codes for households currently living in the 13-county Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area. Results show that past location is significant, but of marginal influence relative to the attributes of the current location. From a practical perspective, our results suggest that models that include current but not past neighborhood attributes (also controlling for standard socioeconomic variables) can forecast vehicle ownership decisions reasonably well.

Kinkel's theory, although unknown outside Bulgarian academic circles, carries a range of original ideas and new insights within the frame of Schmollerprogramm. It emphasises the importance of studying economic development as sociocultural evolutionary change, focuses on the role of unity in social life and the plurality of human motives and attempts to methodologically link theory and history into a multidisciplinary approach. Kinkel's work in general, and his theory of cyclical development in particular, can not only be of value for the study of economic thought and the diffusion of ideas, but can also offer insights into the forces underlying the profound changes that we have been witnessing recently.","[Nenovsky, Nikolay Nenov] Univ Picardie, CRIISEA, F-80027 Amiens, France; [Nenovsky, Nikolay Nenov] Univ Orleans, STUDIUM, Orleans, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Universite de Orleans,"Nenovsky, NN (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie, CRIISEA, 10 Placette Lafleur, F-80027 Amiens, France.",nenovsky@gmail.com,,"Nenovsky, Nikolay/0000-0002-9544-9024",,,,,76,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0967-2567,1469-5936,,EUR J HIST ECON THOU,Eur.

Our findings suggest no overall income convergence in the EU, however, we identify convergence clubs using an iterative testing procedure. The clubs are formed mainly on the basis of geographic region, and clustering is not necessarily related to EMU membership. The empirical evidence suggests a clear separation between the new and old EU member states in the long run, and we observe a division along the South-East vs. North-West dimension since the 1990s.","[Borsi, Mihaly Tamas] Univ Alicante, Dept Econ, E-03080 Alicante, Spain; [Metiu, Norbert] Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany",Universitat d'Alacant; Deutsche Bank,"Metiu, N (通讯作者)，Deutsch Bundesbank, Res Ctr, Wilhelm Epstein Str 14, D-60431 Frankfurt, Germany.",borsimihaly@ua.es; norbert.metiu@bundesbank.de,"Borsi, Mihaly/J-2050-2019","Borsi, Mihaly/0000-0001-7569-6207",,,,,59,115,116,0,30,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

A formal justification for this is provided by proving the existence of finite improvement paths in object allocation problems under weak assumptions on preferences, linking any initial condition to a Nash equilibrium. Because a finite improvement path is made up of a sequence of systematic best-responses, backwards movement from the equilibrium back to the initial condition can be treated like the realisation of a noise process. This underpins the use of signal restoration to predict the equilibrium from the initial condition, and an illustration is provided through an application of maximum entropy signal restoration to the Schelling model of segregation.","[Barde, Sylvain] Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England; [Barde, Sylvain] Observ Francais Conjonctures Econ, F-75340 Paris 07, France",University of Kent,"Barde, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kent, Keynes Coll, Sch Econ, Canterbury CT2 7NP, Kent, England.",s.barde@kent.ac.uk,"Barde, Sylvain/AAF-3768-2020","Barde, Sylvain/0000-0003-1465-8236",,,,,28,23,23,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

A method is proposed for panel data that targets to reconcile the pros and cons of fixed and random effects models, respectively. It applies equally to two- and three-way panel models and those with country-specific time-varying effects. It allows to filter out potential correlation between observed and unobserved heterogeneity and to identify the effects of time-invariant factors. It can also be used when panels are short in time, and to other specifications than the PPML-like gamma PML, zero-inflated, or Tobit-like models.

J,"Daucé, F",,,,"Dauce, Francoise",,,Patriotic Unity and Ethnic Diversity at Odds: The Example of Tatar Organisations in Moscow,EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The Russian Federation's policy of promoting patriotism, in place since the early 2000s, raises the issue of how the country's non-Russian ethnic groups receive this policy. To answer this question, this essay studies the reception of Russian state-promoted patriotism in the 2000s among the Tatar community in Moscow. Looking at the activities of Tatar associations (especially the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation), it shows the syntheses and compromises negotiated by activists between patriotism and ethno-cultural belonging in the capital. Paradoxically, their attempts at synthesis strengthen an essentialist representation of the Tatar community, leading ultimately, on the one hand, to criticism of state nationality policy, and on the other, to the discontent of Tatar independent activists who criticised the undemocratic rules and personal domination in the Regional Tatar National-Cultural Autonomy organisation supported by state authorities. These criticisms echo the tensions in the Russian political agenda at the beginning of the 2010s.","Ctr Russian Caucasian & East European Studies, Moscow, Russia",,"Daucé, F (通讯作者)，Ctr Russian Caucasian & East European Studies, Moscow, Russia.",daucef@yahoo.fr,,,,,,,34,4,4,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0966-8136,1465-3427,,EUROPE-ASIA STUD,Eur.-Asia Stud.,JAN 2,2015,67.0,1.0,,,SI,,68,83,,10.1080/09668136.2014.988997,0.0,,,16,Area Studies; Economics; Political Science,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Area Studies; Business & Economics; Government & Law,AZ9HU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348525400005,0

J,"Akan, T",,,,"Akan, Taner",,,THE PARADIGM OF ISLAMIC POLITICAL ECONOMY: AN INSTITUTIONALIST ANALYSIS OF MYTH AND REALITY,HISTORY OF ECONOMIC IDEAS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"From its genesis in the seventh century onwards, Islam has been a major paradigm that has shaped the politico-economic life of a vast portion of the world population, nearly a quarter at present. In view of the underdeveloped or developing structures of Muslim-majority nations, it has mostly been assumed that Islam predicates an autocratic theocracy and a conservative, rather than a progressive, economic policy that retards scientific research and entrepreneurial innovation. Conversely, with a reactive consciousness, orthodox Muslims take it for granted that Islam's divinely ordained normative axioms would be enough for them to spontaneously establish the most conciliatory political regime on the earth and an advanced economic system irrespective of the power and money-oriented dimensions of human interaction and the assimilative potential of capitalist world economy. To clarify this ambiguity between the reductionist and mythicising perceptions over the theory and praxis of Islamic political economy, this paper first and basically examines its framing institutions at the level of theory and then the causes and consequences of [in]consistencies between its theoretical axioms and their praxis by the Muslim nations.","[Akan, Taner] Kocaeli Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kocaeli, Turkey",Kocaeli University,"Akan, T (通讯作者)，Kocaeli Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Kocaeli, Turkey.",taner_akan@yahoo.com,"akan, taner/AAT-2475-2020",,,,,,56,2,2,0,3,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

Creativity is not only fantasy or imagination, but also study of new occasions of use and new ways of dressing, traveling, reading and so on. Design/methodology/approach - The UK's definition of the creative industries includes thirteen sectors: advertising, architecture, the art and antiques market, crafts, design, designer fashion, film, interactive leisure software (ie. video games), music, the performing arts, publishing, software, and television and radio. Because it was the first definition offered by a government, this original UK definition has been widely adopted by other countries, with sectors adapted based on local commercial and cultural importance. UNCTAD's 2008 report Creative Economy suggested a more inclusive definition which brought this term into popular use and recognized the wider societal impact: 'the interface between creativity, culture, economics and technology as expressed in the ability to create and circulate intellectual capital, with the potential to generate income, jobs and export earnings while at the same time promoting social inclusion, cultural diversity and human development. Basing on this definition our work is concerned with putting together creativity, technology and entrepreneurship in a typical incubation activity, enhancing the entrepreneurial potential of the region and promoting real occasions of jobs creation. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence that this is a phenomenon of small figures and not an industrial production process : creative industries are strongly based on the human talent but in a right mix with technologies and how - to-do competences. An incubator can cover in particular this last aspect but not to supply missing creativity or the technological illiteracy. Incubators are living a changing period: the original model based on fixed packages of consultancy about marketing, administration and finance, production is totally outdated. Incubation experts are looking for less structured models and much more networked organizational solutions. Practical implications - The outcomes of the application of the described methodological approach are new lines of action for incubators and similar structures and suggest interesting opportunities of exploiting research results or sub-products of the academic research as row material in the new companies creation process.","[Annicchiarico, Annamaria] Univ Bari, Tecnopolis PST, I-70121 Bari, Italy; [De Nicolo, Davide; Maddaluno, Alina] Tecnopolis PST, Bari, Italy",Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro,"Annicchiarico, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bari, Tecnopolis PST, Sci & Technol Pk, I-70121 Bari, Italy.",,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,25,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,84,92,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200006,0

GDP and its development in time is influenced by many factors. Transport infrastructure is one of the pillars of economic development. Good transport infrastructure is a prerequisite for economic growth in all countries. Transport infrastructure affects the development of many areas of the economy and its quality is also reflected in other indicators of economic performance of a country. It represents public capital, which plays an important role in investors' decisions whether to invest in the country or region, or not. The paper deals with the relationship between economic development (measured by the key macroeconomic indicator, GDP growth rate) and the quality of transport infrastructure in the Czech Republic. The attention is paid to the influence of the density of highway infrastructure in the Czech Republic on GDP. Improvements to highway infrastructure (the length of the highway network and its density) and their impact on GDP are assessed with regard to the development of indicators within the European Union.

In this paper we used a multiple linear regression and the method of ordinary least squares to find out that most effective variables determining banks' availability to grant loans or to renew/extend credit lines at maturity (for existing customers) are prompt repayments and the length of the banking relationship. On the other side, the trust in managers/owners of the companies and the collateral exert a moderate influence, while variables bank size and the nature and origin of the capital (i.e. national vs. foreign capital, state-owned vs. private capital) have little influence. Compared with the results of a similar research question from our previous research (2012), but addressed to SMEs (i.e. the demand side), we found partial similarity between banks' availability on one side and on other side, SMEs expectancies concerning the access to finance.

Anecdotes, observations, empirical evidences demonstrate that artistic interventions can provide several benefits. From a research perspective, to date there are few, if any, existing theories, models, approaches that can provide conceptual and methodological frameworks as a basis for evaluating the effects produced ABIs. This is not surprising for a relatively new field of practice. Particularly, the definition of structured approaches to assess the potential value-added of ABIs in organisations represents a key research challenge. Building on the framework of the Arts Value Map (Schiuma, 2011), this paper aims to shed light on how to integrate ABIs in the operation and strategy of an organization, and offers some insights to understand how these initiatives can turn into the desired business performance results. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a literature review about artistic interventions as a tool to enhance organizational performance and mapping and narrative approaches for evaluation, the paper suggests a mapping based model for disclosing - according to a narrative approach - how arts contribute to organizational value creation. Originality/value - Seeking to understand how artistic initiatives affect organizational dynamics and outcomes and the kinds of value generated still represents a critical issue. The paper proposes a model - based on mapping and narrative approaches-to face this challenge. Practical implications - Nowadays practitioners are more and more intrigued by what happen when the diversified ad original world of arts meets the more conventional world of public and private organisations. The proposed model can be deployed as a complementary framework to other approaches and tools to understand the benefits of bringing the arts in organisations as innovative managerial instruments to face business challenges.","[Carlucci, Daniela] Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Environm &, I-75100 Matera, Italy; [Schiuma, Giovanni] Univ Basilicata, Dept Math Comp Sci & Econ DIMIE, I-85100 Potenza, Italy; [Schiuma, Giovanni] Univ Arts London, London N1C 4AA, England",University of Basilicata; University of Basilicata; University of Arts London,"Carlucci, D (通讯作者)，Univ Basilicata, Dept European & Mediterranean Cultures Environm &, Via San Rocco 3, I-75100 Matera, Italy.",,"Schiuma, Giovanni/AAO-9916-2020","Schiuma, Giovanni/0000-0003-4990-9330",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2401,2409,,,,,,9,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200188,0

Leaders either contribute before the others (leading by example) or make a non-binding pledge before all players contribute simultaneously (leading by words). The exogenously imposed leadership is then compared to an endogenous setting where players can choose if and how they want to lead. The results show that in both settings leading by example has significant positive effects on cooperation while leading by words only has small effects as compared to situations without leadership. However, only few subjects choose to lead by example when they have the choice. The majority choose to lead by words or do not want to lead at all. The results also show that leading by example is associated with an institutional effect (players increase their contributions when they have to lead by example) and a selection effect (players who choose to lead by example are particularly cooperative).","[Dannenberg, Astrid] Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Dannenberg, Astrid] Univ Gothenburg, S-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Columbia University; University of Gothenburg,"Dannenberg, A (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, Earth Inst, New York, NY 10027 USA.",ad2901@columbia.edu,,,,,,,20,20,31,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0176-1714,1432-217X,,SOC CHOICE WELFARE,Soc Choice Welf.,JAN,2015,44.0,1.0,,,,,71,85,,10.1007/s00355-014-0817-8,0.0,,,15,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,AZ5SA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000348278800005,0

All this actions lead to increasing demand in the rural areas in main season and out of peak seasons and strengthen the competitiveness of Croatian tourism.The concept of a diffuse hotel is designed to connect small tourism providers in a specific small geographic area into a broader and more complete offer of tourist services. The diffuse hotel model enables the village or specific selected area to become a hotel with one reception, offering accommodation and gastronomic services and including other providers into a network of activities (guiding, selling of traditional food products, wine and souvenirs, horse riding etc.) Agricultural households in Dubrovnik- Neretva County very often offer just a part of service. The aim of the paper is to analyze some specific features of the diffuse hotels and to explore the possibility of improving the agricultural household tourist offer based on implementation of diffuse hotels.

Moreover, the paper tries to find out ways for the promotion of appropriate cultural values that could help promoting further, the creation of enterprises through the enhancement of entrepreneurship. This paper looks at the links between cultural variables, knowledge indices and entrepreneurship in Arab countries. Design/methodology/approach - In order to undergo the research the authors will use a regression analysis, hypothesis testing as well as secondary data on Arab countries. These data cover Hofstede's cultural dimensions and variables related to enterprise creation that will be retrieved from several databases like Doing Business and World Bank. For further analysis, the outputs from Arab countries are also compared to those from the Eastern European economies as both groups of countries went through liberalization after a period of heavy government intervention. Originality/value - The innovativeness of the paper resides in the search for cultural determinants of entrepreneurship as these are related to individuals with their specific cultural characteristics. The use of Hofstede's cultural dimensions is an important step towards looking for the link between entrepreneurship and the cultural values of each arab country. In addition, the outcomes of the paper have important value for both academia and policy makers as entrepreneurship is connected to specific cultural values that relate to the context in which enterprise creation policies are conducted. Moreover, this paper promotes the role that culture plays in knowledge economy and entrepreneurship in Arab countries. Practical implications - The outcomes from this paper are directly geared towards policy makers and those that are operating in the area of enterprise creation and development. In the context of a given country, different locations and regions might exhibit varieties of cultural dimensions that could affect the results of local initiatives focusing on entrepreneurship. Enterprise creation and entrepreneurship promotion policies need to be accounting for local cultural specificities. They should not be universal and omitting the cultural values that could drive for their entrepreneurship need to be promoted over time besides the implied specific instruments.","[Driouchi, Ahmed; Gamar, Alae] Al Akhawayn Univ Ifrane, Inst Econ Anal & Prospect Studies, Ifrane, Morocco",Al Akhawayn University,"Gamar, A (通讯作者)，Al Akhawayn Univ Ifrane, Inst Econ Anal & Prospect Studies, POB 104,Ave Hassan 2, Ifrane, Morocco.",,,,,,,,29,0,0,0,7,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2229,2242,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200175,0

Answering to these questions within a Learning Region requires an assessment effort based on openness, which includes several sources of information and viewpoints, and cooperation of stakeholders and experts. At this purpose, this paper aims to present a prototype of a Knowledge Hub focused on the evaluation of innovative early-stage startups. We focus on the architecture of the Knowledge Hub, its founding principles, the evaluation criteria, as well as the main results achieved after its preliminary application in evaluating 36 innovative startups who won a contest in the Apulia region (Italy) from 2008 onward. Design/methodology/approach - The Hub leverages on crowdsourcing and collective intelligence from experts and professionals sharing information and discussing viewpoints about technology startups, with the aim to evaluate their performance. The crowdsourcing dimension refers to the data sources (typology and ownership) used to perform the evaluation of a given startup, whereas the collective intelligence mechanisms inspire the evaluation method. Originality/value - When talking about technology startups, our national and regional experience today shows that hypes dominate over evidence-based information. Refusing transplanted approaches and imitated policies means also promoting reflexivity and evidence-based new knowledge. Practical implications - The adoption of Knowledge Hub's processes and methodology for monitoring the impact of innovative startups, and the active involvement of actors and stakeholders in the Technology Startup Ecosystem, may support a continuing assessment of TdE to improve the quality of regional strategies and programmes designed for the development and growth of specific territories. Evidence from the preliminary analyses shows peaks of dissimilarity between common sense powered by conventional media and actual outcomes, so suggesting the need for a more realistic approach in policy making for regional development.","[Elia, Gianluca] Univ Salento, Dept Engn Innovat, I-73100 Lecce, Italy; [Marinazzo, Mario] Univ Salento, Ctr Interdipartimentale Cultura Innovat Impresa, I-73100 Lecce, Italy",University of Salento; University of Salento,"Marinazzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Ctr Interdipartimentale Cultura Innovat Impresa, Campus Ecotekne Euromediterranean Incubator, I-73100 Lecce, Italy.",,"ELIA, Gianluca/N-5942-2015",,,,,,21,0,0,0,21,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,71,83,,,,,,13,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200005,0

Food and beverages have a central role above all in this actual era. Companies from different sectors have been pushed towards a renewal of production models, also due to new global consumption behaviour, not only, but for the worsening crisis of the ecological balance, the persistent social inequalities and processes of economic growth with characteristics and induced effects progressively disputable. Recently the goal of value creation in different companies was value for shareholders: now, this approach is widely obsolete. In this way of renovation, companies must be open to dialogue with its stakeholders, in order to generate a cooperation that allows to obtain consent, trust, legitimacy. If this behavior goes towards the stakeholder satisfaction, the result is a good CR (corporate reputation): the base for a long time competitivity. Design/methodology/approach - The aim of this research are as the follow: 1. a sintetic description of the concept of sustainability according to the literature; 2. show the behaviours of a company (case study) that tries to combine tradition and innovation and the process of building of CR: relationship. Originality/value - This methodology puts in evidence that a good management, the correct corporate policy leads to the assumption of favorable behavior by stakeholders thereby improving the performance and the market value (Fombrun and van Riel, 2004), finally the value of CR. The outcomes of the application is to show the first step to study towards an alignment between environmental-social interests and shareholder-CFO interests. The challenge is to invest correctly in order to achieve best results. Technological innovations combined with the reduction of use of resources or waste decrease and the environment safety is the real strategy to secure the future and to improve quality level in own CR. Food and nutrition is the content of EXPO 2015: this is another demonstration of industry evolution, with particularly attention to production techniques, respect for biodiversity, increased safety for consumers. Practical implications - It is important to invest in new management models, adopting new strategies and corporate policies: from production (reducing the environmental impact, worker safety, care and quality of products,...) marketing (consumer satisfaction,...) human resource management (training, updates, employee satisfaction,...) and the financial aspects (investment evaluation,...).","Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosophy Educ & Econ Quantitat Sci, I-65128 Pescara, Italy",G d'Annunzio University of Chieti-Pescara,"Iannone, B (通讯作者)，Univ G dAnnunzio, Dept Philosophy Educ & Econ Quantitat Sci, Viale Pindaro 42, I-65128 Pescara, Italy.",,,,,,,,39,0,0,0,23,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1976,1986,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200153,0

The paper proposes an accounting-based framework that is able to detect whether a firm is pursuing a sustainable strategy or not. The framework is applied to a case study: the Loccioni Group. This work continues a research already started from a theoretical point of view by the same authors (Iazzolino and Laise, 2014). Design/methodology/approach - Building on two previous works by the same authors (Iazzolino and Laise, 2013; 2014), the proposed framework starts from the analysis of the Value Added (VA) created by the firm and of its components: (i) HC - Human Capital and (ii) SC - Structural Capital(1), the last measuring the value created for all capital investors (within which there are also the shareholders). In order to evaluate the sustainability of a strategy, the time trend of the VA and its composition is analyzed. Findings - From results of application of the methodology on the case study it emerges that the Loccioni Group is pursuing a sustainable strategy. The firm is following a win-win strategy. Originality/value - The originality and the value of our methodological proposal can be appreciated by taking into account that in the literature there is no accounting-based methodology that is able to evaluate the sustainability of a strategy. The VA and its composition, together with other Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), allows the sustainability of a strategy to be defined. Practical implications - Managers underestimate the importance of a performance measurement that takes into account advantages in terms of intangibles (human capital, structural capital, relational capital). Our approach makes it possible to highlight the effects of sustainable strategies based on knowledge investments oriented towards the Stakeholder Value Theory and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).","[Iazzolino, Gianpaolo] Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Ippoliti, Giulia] Elica Grp, I-60044 Fabriano, AN, Italy; [Laise, Domenico] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Comp Control & Management Engn, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Calabria; Sapienza University Rome,"Iazzolino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calabria, Dept Mech Energy & Management Engn, Via Pietro Bucci 46-C, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy.",,"Iazzolino, Gianpaolo/H-4469-2011",,,,,,13,1,1,0,5,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,764,777,,,,,,14,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200058,0

Our study aimed to enrich the current data pool, by providing a macroscopical and histogical description of the chinchilla's cerebellum. 10 samples were harvested from commercially slaughtered young adults of both sexes. 5 samples were macroscopically examined and 5 samples were serially cut and stained (both Hematoxylin-Eosin and a modified Luxol-Cresyl protocol). The external features and the structure of the cerebellum were assessed and compared to literature data on other similar species (such as the rat and the rabbit). The macroscopic examination revealed that the chinchilla's cerebellum is well developed in size (average width of 2 cm) relative to the size of the encephalon (average width of 2.4 cm). The cerebellar hemispheres are globulous, with a prominent paraflocculus and the vermis is very thick. The ratio between these segments resembles that of the rabbit's. Histological samples revealed that the cerebellar cortex presents the main layers common for cerebellar cytoarchitectonics. The segmentation of the vermis is similar to that o the rat, but there are variations in lobular size, lobular orientation and placement of the primary and secondary fissures. Our results indicate that, although the structure of the chinchilla's cerebellum generally complies to rodent literature descriptions, experiments demanding stereotaxic location of lobules and foliae cannot completely rely on the existing neuroanatomic maps of other species (such as the rat), benefiting from the present description.

While attention has been paid to sensitivity of standard statistical and data mining methods for categorical data only recently, we aim at modifying standard distance measures between clusters of such data. This allows us to propose a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis for two-way contingency tables with a large number of categories, based on a regularized measure of distance between two contingency tables. Such proposal improves the robustness to the presence of measurement errors for categorical data. As a second problem, we investigate the nonlinear version of the least weighted squares regression for data with a continuous response. Our aim is to propose an efficient algorithm for the least weighted squares estimator, which is formulated in a general way applicable to both linear and nonlinear regression.

The search the reasons for a manufacturing development is very important for Russia. Nowadays the extractive enterprises are the most important part of Russians economy. For example, in 2013 year the part of mineral products in common Russian export was 76,1% (data of Russians Federal State Statistics Service). But to be competitive in the global economy the country needs in production of more complex products. Methods. The method of this research is a production function which was constructed for the Russian manufacturing. The most known production functions which are used for used in the regional economics are the Cobb-Douglas function and the CES function. In spite of long life of the Cobb-Douglas production function and availability of large amount of new functions, we can say, that this instrument is still applicable today. Many scientists use this production function in their research. So in our article we used the Cobb-Douglas function and the factors were labour, capital, transport infrastructure and innovations. The coefficients for the selected function were obtained using the correlation-regression analysis approach. Results. The result is that transport infrastructure doesn't matter for Russian manufacturing. The coefficient of innovation in logarithmic production function is 0,15 and it's significant on the 1% level. It's means that innovations play an important role in manufacturing production increasing. Conclusions. The first conclusion is regarding the possibility of using the Cobb Douglas function to research the Russian industry and regarding factors, which influence the development production. The main factor except labor and capital is innovations that means that to increase manufacturing production in Russia the government should improve innovation infrastructure.","[Kolchinskaya, E.] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Kolchinskaya, E (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Moscow, Russia.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,1,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,461,467,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400058,0

Recent studies indicate that differential mechanisms may be operating in the different lycopene-accumulating varieties, highlighting the importance to understand these processes. It is well characterized in Citrus fruit that light positively affects color development and consequently carotenoid content and composition. However, it is paradoxical that by shading degreening of the red grapefruit 'Star Ruby' is accelerated and external color is enhanced (higher red coloration). To further understand the regulatory mechanisms of light on carotenoids biosynthesis in a lycopene-accumulating grapefruit, carotenoid composition and expression of related carotenoid biosynthetic genes were analyzed in the peel of shaded and light-exposed 'Star Ruby' grapefruit. The stage of fruit development at the time of shading appears to be influential in color development.

For the study water taken from 3 different sources was used and demineralized water was used as a reference. The water quality was evaluated as far as its hardness was concerned. Water hardness was measured with a droplet test. One of the most frequently used by farmers type of agricultural nozzle TeeJet VP of the size 110/02 was used in the study. The study was performed in two combinations. One of them was carried out for the pure water and the second one for water with addition of agricultural spray adjuvant Superam 10AL. The measurements were done with three pressure values: 2 bar, 3 bar and 4 bar in three repetitions. The droplet size was measured with a laser diffractometer HELOS/R by Sympatec. The study showed that water hardness did not have any significant influence on the droplet size formed by agricultural nozzles. Adding of agricultural spray adjuvant to the water did not cause any significant change in the droplet size, however, the difference in water hardness caused the decrease of a diameter of formed droplets. The results were compared in a tabular and graphic form. In the next phase of the study for individual types of waters agricultural spray adjuvant was added to check how it influences the change of the size of droplets produced by the nozzles with sliding pressure in the whole range of the stream sprayed by the nozzle.

Anyway, many of these investigations are based on homogeneous samples without, however, verifying if firms actually arise, nor the type of company created. The paper aims to going over the limitations of previous researches on the knowledge of the process of the entrepreneurial intention by investigating a population of individuals which seized the opportunity to participate at a university-based start-up competition (Suc). Design/methodology/approach - In the frame of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) the paper examines the influence of factors affecting the entrepreneurial intention, the perception of external of environment and the perception subjective competencies. The questionnaire to measure intent is based on an integration of psychology and entrepreneurship literature and is very close to the Entrepreneurial Intent Questionnaire adopted in intent approach leading articles. The population is from seven universities localised in a specific region and the TPB is tested using the Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. Originality/value - The study is unique given that, within the entrepreneurial process, the individuals of the population investigated could be positioned beyond the intent but before the starting-up. Furthermore, these participants are considered high likely to start an high-tech or innovative businesses, and include individuals with heterogeneous characteristics who decide in team to start a business. Practical implications - The outcomes this survey show that competencies have a strong effect in favouring the entrepreneurial event while, the external environment doesn't appear to exert a clear influence on intent. These considerations have two relevant implications. On the one hand the role of universities as natural provider of skills is emphasized. On the other hand it is shown how the support promised by the universities themselves under these initiatives can help aspiring entrepreneurs to overcome the conditionings of the external environment.","[Passaro, Renato; Thomas, Antonio] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Engn, Ctr Direz Is C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy; [Scandurra, Giuseppe] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Quantitat & Business Studies, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Passaro, R (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Engn, Ctr Direz Is C4, I-80143 Naples, Italy.",,"Passaro, Renato/AFO-8339-2022; Thomas, Antonio/AAX-4976-2021","Passaro, Renato/0000-0002-3263-2294;",,,,,49,0,0,0,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,2212,2228,,,,,,17,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200174,0

In the study, the selected parameters which significantly affecting spread quality were: rotation speed of the disc, feed position of fertilizer on the disc and the vanes angle on the disc. In order to determinate the impact on spatial distribution, the results were statistically analyzed based on the analysis of variance. The study showed that the factors impacting greatly the average angle of the stationary spread pattern are: the feed position of fertilizer on the disc, the vanes angle on the disc and the fertilizer type.

Achieving distributed power generation is an important goal because the generation facilities are located near the final customers, whereby the losses of electricity in the network as well as the need for the capacity of the high voltage network are reduced. The distribution of electricity in the Republic of Croatia is carried out by the HEP Distribution System Operator (HEP ODS) that manages the distribution network and facilities, as opposed to the energy activity of the distribution of natural gas that is carried out by dozens of operators in their distribution areas. Therefore, the amounts of tariff items in the Tariff system for electricity distribution, for certain categories of customers (i.e. tariff models), are unique over the entire territory of Croatia. HEP ODS carries out the distribution of electricity in 21 distribution areas, which differ significantly in size, number of employees, number of customers, network length and the amount of distributed electricity. The indicators essential for the efficiency of the distribution system are analyzed in this paper, based on the modified regionalisation of distribution areas.

Productivity declines in many HLB-affected genotypes are often accompanied with thinned canopies, and reduced fruit size and quality. Development of citrus cultivars resistant or tolerant to HLB is the best long-term control solution for this endemic disease in Florida. HLB was assessed in diverse cultivars in commercial groves with high HLB incidence. 'Temple' had the least HLB symptoms and lowest Liberibacter (Las) titer, while 'Murcott' and 'Minneola' had the most symptoms and highest titers. The USDA Ft. Pierce, FL farm is managed to reveal genotype responses to HLB. Some current cultivars and hybrid seedlings demonstrate HLB resistance/tolerance, at least to the strain(s) of Las present in this location. Citrus trifoliata is the best documented citrus resistance source, having low Las titer even when grafted onto severely-infected rootstocks. Some cultivars and hybrids have abundant foliage symptoms, but full canopies and seemingly normal fruit set and size. In three years of a replicated trial of 'Triumph'(T), 'Jackson'(J), 'Flame'(F), and 'Marsh'(M) grapefruits or hybrids, HLB symptoms were severe in all trees and Las titers were similar. F and M were almost completely defoliated in some years while T and J had full canopies. Cumulative fruit per tree was greater for T and J (255, 220) than for F and M (29, 66). T and J fruit met commercial standards and was normal size but the fruit of F and M was unacceptable. Evidence is mounting that useful resistance/tolerance to HLB is present in cultivated citrus and sexually compatible hybrids.","[Stover, Ed; McCollum, Gregory T.; Driggers, Randall; Shatters, Robert, Jr.; Duan, YongPing; Hall, David G.] USDA ARS, USHRL, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA; [Lee, Richard] USDA ARS, Natl Clonal Germplasm Repository Citrus & Dates, Riverside, CA USA; [Ritenour, Mark] Univ Florida, Indian River Res & Educ Ctr, Ft Pierce, FL USA; [Chaparro, Jose X.] Univ Florida, Dept Hort Sci, Gainesville, FL USA",United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Stover, E (通讯作者)，USDA ARS, USHRL, Ft Pierce, FL 34945 USA.",ed.stover@ars.usda.gov,,,,,,,23,12,15,2,9,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,2406-6168,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,899,903,,,,,,5,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600111,0

In Schrage's terms (2004), invention + adoption = innovation. A paradigm based on principles of integrated collaboration, co-created shared value, cultivated innovation ecosystems, unleashed exponential technologies, and extraordinarily rapid adoption is the so-called Open Innovation 2.0. The development of this approach reflects the perception that the innovation process has evolved. The present work explores new ways to study healthcare networks as key tool for innovation creation and spreading, by deploying the emergent paradigm of open innovation. Design/methodology/approach - The present work investigates the impact of clusters, or localized networks involving industrial, academic and institutional players, in the pharmaceutical setting; the aim is to enrich the line of inquiry into cluster-based innovation by applying a social network analysis (SNA) approach, providing new perspectives for recognizing how the set of interactions and relationships in the pharmaceutical context can bring to higher levels of knowledge transfer, organizational learning and innovation spreading. Originality/value - The OI2/SNA combination approach is well suited to be adopted by the complex pharmaceutical industry, that in the last decades witnessed the development of new organizational forms, called CROs (Contract Research Organizations), firstly arisen as companies specialized in providing services to support pharmaceutical companies, and become over time capable of providing different business models, characterized by high flexibility and quality of service, cost reduction, quick access to the market, to meet the needs of its customers and ensure an increased efficiency and productivity in the biopharmaceutical industry in constant evolution. Practical implications - In the transition from the early development phase to the more mature phase, firms must build ties to start-ups and new entrants, and/or connect to third-party firms, since the supporting investments made by these firms may determine which of the alternative configurations will become 'the standard'. During this stage, the relationships across firms are defined and governed by modular interfaces that are, in turn, dictated by product interfaces. The outcomes of the present analysis mean to highlight: (i) a comprehensive perspective for understanding the dynamics of modularity and their implications for innovation networks; (ii) the presence of innovation networks as main mean to promote and support paths of knowledge creation and transfer","[Tamburis, Oscar] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Vet Med & Anim Prod, I-80137 Naples, Italy; [Bonacci, Isabella] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ, I-80126 Naples, Italy",University of Naples Federico II; University of Naples Federico II,"Tamburis, O (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Vet Med & Anim Prod, Via Delpino 1, I-80137 Naples, Italy.",,"Tamburis, Oscar/Q-1199-2018",,,,,,25,0,0,0,19,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,852,862,,,,,,11,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200064,0

In order to increase the flexicurity level in a particular country, the flexible working arrangements must be supported. One of them is the part-time employment, which is in nowadays especially appreciated solution for work-life balancing. The part-time employment increased in the Europe, especially during the economic crisis in 2008 - 2010. However, in some countries it was because of increase in involuntary part-time employment. In the study following hypothesis is tested - flexicurity can be promoted only by voluntary part-time employment increase when appropriate legislation is in force. In the Netherlands, which is taken as flexicurity benchmark country in many studies, at the last quarter of 2014 approximately the half of employment was part-time (50,1%), and most of part-time employees were women, the involuntary part-time employment in 2013 was very low, less than 10% of those employed on part-time basis. In contrary, the average level of part-time employment in other EU countries was lower (below 20%) and involuntary part-time employment was higher (approximately 30%). In Latvia the part-time employment at the last quarter of 2014 was only 6,8% and involuntary part-time employment share was close to 40%. Introducing flexible working hours has been beneficiary also for employers - that helps to meet extra demand of labour, matches flexible working hours with longer business hours, limits costs related to overtime, and others. The research investigates the similarities and differences in the labour legislation and employment statistics in Latvia, the Netherlands and other EU countries to give proposals for better flexicurity implementation through part-time employment promotion. The main finding is that cultural differences play important role and even with supportive legislation, flexicurity can encounter with limitations in flexible working arrangements.","[Vaivade, Agnese; Brekis, Edgars] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Vaivade, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",,"Brekis, Edgars/B-4654-2013",,,,,,9,0,0,0,4,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,SOFIA,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",2367-5659,,978-619-7105-48-3,INT MULTIDDISCIP SCI,,,2015,,,,,,,637,643,,,,,,7,"Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BE6YC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374911400081,0

It is, in fact, already acknowledged that evaluating the management of a museum-type institution is not easy, as, in order to measure its social and cultural efficacy, qualitative-type indicators are required. For this reason, the use of a fuzzy logic expert system can prove extremely useful since, in the process of evaluating a given phenomenon, it takes account of input variables not only of a quantitative but also of a qualitative kind. Design/methodology/approach - Of the many approaches suggested in the literature, this study will focus on the following: internal, user, economic and relational (Sinatra et al., 2002), external (Sollima, 2004). The use of these approaches has led to the definition of three areas of evaluation: 1. economic effectiveness, 2. social effectiveness, 3. cultural effectiveness. The method of analysis used is based on a model formalised through a fuzzy expert system (FES). The FES are able to merge the capabilities of an expert system to simulate the decision- making process with the vagueness typical of human reasoning, which is present in fuzzy logic. Originality/value - There is a vast amount of established literature that analyses topics such as management of museum networks and measurement of the economic, cultural and social performance of a particular museum. What is lacking, however, is an analysis of multidimensional performance in the management of a museum network. This study seeks to fill that gap by presenting a proposal for an evaluation model that will allow internal and external stakeholders to assess the multidimensional contribution provided by a complex institution such as a museum network. Practical implications - The definition of the variables that determine the performance of a museum network is the most complex part of this study. In order to identify these variables, a survey of the literature on museum performance was carried out and a questionnaire was administered to a panel of experts working in the field of management of cultural assets and, more specifically, in the museum sector. The measurement model proposed was applied to a standard case study: a museum system comprising a number of museums in the same geographical area.","[Venturelli, Andrea; Caputo, Fabio; Palmi, Pamela; Tafuro, Alessandra; Mastroleo, Giovanni] Univ Salento, Dept Management Econ Math & Stat, I-73100 Lecce, Le, Italy",University of Salento,"Palmi, P (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Dept Management Econ Math & Stat, Via Monteroni, I-73100 Lecce, Le, Italy.",,"Tafuro, Alessandra/AAT-8651-2020; Mastroleo, Giovanni/J-5627-2015; Caputo, Fabio/IAP-9343-2023","Mastroleo, Giovanni/0000-0001-8656-6547; Caputo, Fabio/0000-0002-8296-1256; Venturelli, Andrea/0000-0001-7216-2744",,,,,89,0,0,1,13,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,1582,1603,,,,,,22,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200122,0

Conditioning the model forecasts on the Greenbook nowcasts leads to forecasts that are as accurate as the Greenbook projections for output growth and the federal funds rate. Only for inflation are the model forecasts dominated by the Greenbook projections. A comparison with forecasts from Bayesian vector autoregressions shows that the economic structure of the DSGE models which is useful for the interpretation of forecasts does not lower the accuracy of forecasts. Combining forecasts of several DSGE models increases precision in comparison to individual model forecasts. Comparing density forecasts with the actual distribution of observations shows that DSGE models overestimate uncertainty around point forecasts.

Data that is used in this study are secondary data based on historical data taken from Net Asset Value (NAV) per unit with monthly sub-period of equity fund, data movement of Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index (CSPI), and BI's rate as risk-free interest rate (risk-free rate). Performance measurement engage risk-adjusted factor by using Sharpe's index, Treynor's and Jensen's. The performance's evaluation resulted that there are only 6.98% of equity fund that measured having outperform the market. Other findings in this case study is that determinats coefficient also playing an important role on determining which index that can be used for investment's referencet.","[Yuneline, Mirza Hedismarlina] STIE Ekuitas, Management Study Program, Kota Bandung, Indonesia",,"Yuneline, MH (通讯作者)，STIE Ekuitas, Management Study Program, Kota Bandung, Indonesia.",mirza.yuneline@ekuitas.ac.id,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,0,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5428,,978-94-62520-86-8,AEBMR ADV ECON,,,2015,5.0,,,,,,100,105,,,,,,6,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Management",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0MZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366326900015,0

Credit constraints have a significant effect on the relationship of the functional income distribution and economic growth. When an economy grows with credit constraints, such as China, it could change from a wage-led growth regime in classical Bhaduri-Marglin models to a profit-led growth regime in our model, and vice versa. Empirical estimation shows that if labor share improves by 1 percent, private consumption will improve by 0.59 percent and it does not have negative effect on China's economic growth. As a result, if the government could control the opportunity and strength of the economic reform policies which concern functional income distribution, private consumption and investment effectively, China's economy could transfer to a consumption-led growth path smoothly.","[Zang, Xuheng] Shandong Univ, Inst Consumpt & Dev, 27,Shandanan Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China; [He, Yang] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong University; Shandong University,"Zang, XH (通讯作者)，Shandong Univ, Inst Consumpt & Dev, 27,Shandanan Rd, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China.",xhzang@sdu.edu.cn; heyang0309@163.com,,,,,,,11,2,2,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,1794,1803,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000172,0

The purpose of congestion pricing is to manage traffic demand generation and supply allocation by charging fees (i.e., tolling) for the use of certain roads in order to distribute traffic demand more evenly over time and space. This study presents a framework for large-scale variable congestion pricing policy determination and evaluation. The proposed framework integrates departure time choice and route choice models within a regional dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) simulation environment. The framework addresses the impact of tolling on: (1) road traffic congestion (supply side), and (2) travelers' choice dimensions including departure time and route choices (demand side). The framework is applied to a simulation-based case study of tolling a major freeway in Toronto while capturing the regional effects across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The models are developed and calibrated using regional household travel survey data that reflect the heterogeneity of travelers' attributes. The DTA model is calibrated using actual traffic counts from the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and the City of Toronto. The case study examined two tolling scenarios: flat and variable tolling. The results indicate that: (1) more benefits are attained from variable pricing, that mirrors temporal congestion patterns, due to departure time rescheduling as opposed to predominantly re-routing only in the case of flat tolling, (2) widespread spatial and temporal re-distributions of traffic demand are observed across the regional network in response to tolling a significant, yet relatively short, expressway serving Downtown Toronto, and (3) flat tolling causes major and counterproductive rerouting patterns during peak hours, which was observed to block access to the tolled facility itself.

We find that shifting all diesel gallons to biodiesel results in operational cost increases ranging from 1 to 12 percent, with smaller cost increases being realized with increases in system size. Shifting all diesel gallons to CNG results in operational cost increases between 5 and 10 percent - again with smaller impacts for larger systems. These findings suggest that there are some economies of using biodiesel and CNG with large scale production. That is, the cost increases associated with increased fuel prices, decreased fuel economy, increased maintenance costs, and increased fueling costs associated with biodiesel and CNG are mitigated somewhat by large scale production. The findings of this study suggest that increased operational costs are an important consideration in policies aimed at encouraging the use of alternative fuels by U.S. public transit systems.

We find conclusive evidence that these relationships are poorly described by linear or quadratic OLS specifications. Women's wages and employment probabilities do not follow a linear relationship and are highest at a body weight far below the clinical threshold of obesity. This indicates that looks, rather than health, is the driving force behind the adverse labor market outcomes to which overweight women are subject. Further support is lent to this notion by the fact that wage penalties for overweight and obese women are only observable in white-collar occupations. On the other hand, bigger appears to be better in the case of men, for whom employment prospects increase with weight, albeit with diminishing returns. However, underweight men in blue-collar jobs earn lower wages because they lack the muscular strength required in such occupations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides an integrated synthesis of the contributions of the fields of operations research/management science (OR/MS) and economics on the subject matter. From an operating standpoint, assessing the benefits of demand management requires estimates of airport capacity and models of airport on-time performance. From a managerial standpoint, the design of demand management mechanisms can be supported by decision-making models of flight scheduling. From an economic standpoint, the welfare impact of congestion pricing, slot controls and slot auctions depends on the market structure at the airport. This paper proposes an integrated framework that underscores the interdependencies between these operating, managerial and economic aspects to foster cross-disciplinary approaches toward more effective demand management policies at busy airports worldwide.

In doing so, they face the question of institutional design: what types of rules and provisions should be included in the charter of the new international organization? We analyze this question through the lens of accession rules, with an emphasis on voting rules. We argue that democratizing states have strong incentives to design organizations with strict accession rules. Organizations with strict accession rules allow the founding members to regulate entry. This is particularly useful for transitional democracies, as democratizing states are initially unable to gain entry into the lucrative existing international organizations operated by the established democracies. Using original data on accession voting rules in 324 international organizations, we find strong evidence in support of our claims.","[Kaoutzanis, Christodoulos; Urpelainen, Johannes] Columbia Univ, Dept Polit Sci, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Poast, Paul] Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Columbia University; University of Chicago,"Poast, P (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Polit Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",paulpoast@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,51,5,8,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1559-7431,1559-744X,,REV INT ORGAN,Rev.

We developed a framework for driving-behavior measurement, incorporating second-by second data collected by IVDRs. IVDR units were installed in over 150 vehicles driven by more than 350 drivers for over a year. The experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage was a blind, control stage, with no feedback. The second stage incorporated verbal feedback given only to riskiest drivers. In the third stage all drivers received a bi-weekly written report about their driving performance. Safety events, such as braking, lateral acceleration or speeding, were recorded. Supplementary data regarding safety related events and fuel consumption were also collected. Safety incidents and fuel consumption were modeled as a function of IVDR measurement-based events, in order to identify which events best reflect safety incidents and excessive fuel consumption. Our results show that braking events best explain safety incidents, and all events together best explain fuel consumption. In addition, we found that for the riskiest drivers, feedback significantly reduced the IVDR events. Our models show that feedback can lead to a reduction of 8% in safety incidents, and 3-10% in fuel consumption, with a larger reduction obtained for large vehicles. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In comparison with previous generations of youth, those living in the developed world (i) faced the harshest economic climate in decades, (ii) lived with their parents longer and were more likely to return back home as young adults, (iii) used information and communication technologies (ICTs) extensively, and (iv) in the U.S., were subject to increasingly stringent graduated driver's licensing (GDL) regulations. All were dramatic societal changes to be sure, but how did they affect youth travel behavior? Some argue dramatically and enduringly, but usually with fragmentary evidence. We examine data from the three most recent U.S. national travel surveys and find that, with one exception, after controlling for personal, household, locational, and travel factors, the effects of factors associated with various societal trends on person-kilometers traveled (PKT) are surprisingly muted. The exception is that decreased employment is associated with substantially lower PKT; however, this effect is 32% greater among older (ages 27-61) than younger (ages 20-26) adults, suggesting that economic factors, rather than changes in youth travel preferences, were at the root of declines in personal travel in the U.S. during the 2000s.

Our contribution is twofold. First, we extend the methodology developed by Cogley and Sargent (Drifts and volatilities: monetary policies and outcomes in the post WWII U.S. Review of Economic Studies 2005; 8: 262-302) and Primiceri (Time varying structural vector autoregressions and monetary policy. Review of Economic Studies 2005; 72: 821-852) to a mixed-frequency setting. In particular, our approach allows for the inclusion of two different categories of variables (high-frequency and low-frequency) into the same time-varying model. Second, we use this model to study the macroeconomic effects of government spending shocks in Italy over the 1988:Q4-2013:Q3 period. Italyas well as most other euro area economiesis characterized by short quarterly time series for fiscal variables, whereas annual data are generally available for a longer sample before 1999. Our results show that the proposed time-varying mixed-frequency model improves on the performance of a simple linear interpolation model in generating the true path of the missing observations. Second, our empirical analysis suggests that government spending shocks tend to have positive effects on output in Italy. The fiscal multiplier, which is maximized at the 1-year horizon, follows a U-shape over the sample considered: it peaks at around 1.5 at the beginning of the sample; it then stabilizes between 0.8 and 0.9 from the mid 1990s to the late 2000s, before rising again to above unity during the recent crisis.

Drawing on a longitudinal qualitative study and employing the concepts of caringscapes' and work-time/childcare-time', this article highlights how childcare packages shape single mothers' employment trajectories. Informal carers play a crucial role within mixed (formal and informal) childcare packages in helping mothers bring children's needs, work-time and childcare-time into alignment, thus strengthening their employment trajectories. Informal carers achieve this effect by: (1) increasing the total hours of non-parental care; (2) gluing' together complex jigsaws of care; (3) offering a safety net' in times of crisis; and (4) playing a connector' role during employment transitions.","[Brady, Michelle] Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Michie Bldg, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Brady, M (通讯作者)，Univ Queensland, Sch Social Sci, Michie Bldg, St Lucia, Qld 4072, Australia.",Michelle.brady@uq.edu.au,,,Provost Doctoral Entrance Award from the University of Alberta; Department of Sociology Doctoral Research Grant from the University of Alberta,Provost Doctoral Entrance Award from the University of Alberta; Department of Sociology Doctoral Research Grant from the University of Alberta,"The field research upon which this article is based was supported by funding from a Provost Doctoral Entrance Award and a Department of Sociology Doctoral Research Grant, both from the University of Alberta.",,32,17,20,1,27,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

An analytical model is developed to study how an airline may change its network and market coverage when facing HSR competition on trunk routes. We show that prior to HSR competition, an airline is more likely to adopt a fully-connected network and cover fewer fringe markets if the trunk market is large. Under HSR competition, the airline will, for a given network structure, have a greater incentive to cover more fringe (regional or foreign) markets if the trunk market is large, or the airline network is close to hub-and-spoke. Further, the airline will, for any given market coverage, move towards a hub-and-spoke network when the trunk market is large, or the number of fringe markets covered by-the airline network is large. Both effects are more prominent when the decreasing rate of airline density economies is large. We further show that HSR competition can induce the airline to adopt network structure and market coverage that are closer to the socially optimal ones, thereby suggesting a new source of welfare gain from HSR based on its long-term impacts on airlines. Implications for operators, policy makers and specific countries (such as China) are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous research demonstrates that occupational sex segregation is important for understanding the gender wage gap, since occupations dominated by women pay less; yet less is known about why this is the case. This article explores two possible mechanisms: the devaluation of female-typical' work tasks and working-time arrangements. Hypotheses are tested by applying OLS regression and Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition analyses to the log hourly wages of a representative sample of German higher education graduates from 2001. Results confirm that occupational overtime increases and occupational part-time work decreases wages, indicating that occupations dominated by women pay less due to their female-typical' working-time arrangements. However, inconsistent with the devaluation thesis, tasks like teaching/educating increase wages for women, too, which speaks against a general lower value of female-typical' tasks, at least among the highly qualified.","[Leuze, Kathrin] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Educ Sociol, Hannover, Germany; [Strauss, Susanne] Univ Konstanz, Sociol, Constance, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; University of Konstanz,"Leuze, K (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Dept Sociol, Schneiderberg 50, D-30187 Hannover, Germany.",k.leuze@ish.uni-hannover.de,"Leuze, Kathrin Dr./ABL-8892-2022","Strauss, Susanne/0000-0001-9875-2179",,,,,61,58,69,6,144,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

Failure events are classified by the severity of the consequence of occurrence, resulting in the rate of occurrence in severity categories. The safety measures are standard statistics calculated from this distribution for comparison of airport operations by stochastic ordering. For comparisons a benchmark is developed from the aggregation of failure data on a set of comparable airports. Airport performance is then compared with the benchmark using the defined safety measures. The benchmark comparison was implemented with failure data for major airports in Canada from 2005 to 2012. The results show a number of patterns and anomalies and some airports perform poorly in comparison to a class of similar operations. We conclude by suggesting benchmarking safety measures as a natural addition to the information system on aviation safety compiled by a national regulatory body to unravel anomalies such as implementation problems of a safety management system.

Our results indicate that around 50 percent of expenditures under the Canadian subsidy and tax credit programs represented free riding. In the long run, our estimates suggest that over 80 percent of grant recipients would have chosen an identical furnace at the time of replacement. We estimate that the cost effectiveness of the programs in terms of greenhouse gas reduced was between $70 and $110/t CO2, depending on the assumptions made. Further, we find that a substantial majority of the grants were received by middle- and high-income households, such that the grant had a regressive effect on the distribution of income.

Huber proposed the pattern of future earnings as the reason of J-shaped function. But our paper secondly asserts the psychological state of personal investor as the reason. It also asserts that the psychological state of personal investor often destroys efficient market. Functional magnetic resonance imaging scans of subjects in a simple game indicate that subjects with medium amounts of information use different brain areas. The paper argues that these patterns are consistent with medium-informed investors using Matching Law strategy rather than the maximizing strategy of the least and best informed investors.

From the theoretical model, we derive the hypothesis that only the temporary component of the wage gap, which is due to assimilation costs, will diminish over time, whereas the permanent element, which is due to the productivity loss after the disabling condition, will in fact persist. We test this theoretical hypothesis using an exogenous disability shock (accident) and combine propensity score matching with a difference-in-differences method to account for observed and unobserved time-constant differences. In all our specifications, we find that the reduction in wages for the disabled is between 274 and 308 euros per month, and this represents 19-22 % of the average wage of a disabled worker. This gap, however, is more than offset when we count disability benefits and wages collectively as income. As predicted in the theoretical model, we observe that around 40 % of the initial wage gap between disabled and non-disabled individuals is reversed once the transitory drop in productivity disappears. However, we also observe a constant wage gap that remains over time and that corresponds to the permanent fall in productivity predicted by the theoretical model (60 % of the initial wage gap).","[Cervini-Pla, Maria] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain; [Cervini-Pla, Maria] EQUALITAS, Barcelona, Spain; [Silva, Jose I.] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Vall Castello, Judit] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Ctr Res Econ & Hlth, Barcelona, Spain",Pompeu Fabra University; Universitat de Girona; Pompeu Fabra University,"Silva, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Girona, Girona, Spain.",maria.cervini@upf.edu; jose.silva@udg.edu; judit.vall@upf.edu,"; Silva, Jose I/G-3365-2015","Vall castello, Judit/0000-0002-1925-1657; Silva, Jose I/0000-0002-0425-6199; Cervini Pla, Maria/0000-0001-9582-8457",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-31081],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),Constructive advice from two anonymous referees and the Editor Bernd Fitzenberger has contributed to improve this paper.

We include emissions from the consumption of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity. Higher density is associated with lower gasoline consumption in personal vehicles, cold weather is associated with higher energy consumption for heating, and higher income and family size are associated with overall greater energy use. The average Canadian household produces the lowest greenhouse gas emissions in Montreal, Quebec, followed by Vancouver, British Columbia. Highest emissions are in Edmonton, followed by Calgary. The source of energy used matters more than we expected. Despite its inclement weather, Montreal has the lowest emissions because hydropower supplies much of its household energy use (including home heating). Edmonton and Calgary have the highest associated emissions, due to their extreme weather, low density, and coal based electricity supply. The average household across all cities (weighted by population share) experienced a decline in its predicted CO2 emissions from 11.49 tonnes per year in 1997 to 9.7 tonnes in 2009 (16% over 12 years). One of the reasons for this decline is that population growth was higher in cities where emissions fell faster. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Drawing on smaller geographic units than the previous literature, we estimate regional matching functions on NUTS 3 level for the years 2000 to 2010. The elasticity between matches and unemployment ranges between 0.4 and 0.5 with 75% of this effect being driven by the impact that unemployment has on matches in neighboring regions. The effect of vacancies on matches is substantially smaller but also robustly positive. Bayesian model comparison tests suggest that spillovers from unemployment and vacancies are confined to local labor markets, which are best approximated by geographical distance rather than by present or past infrastructure or commuter numbers. Spillovers from unemployment arise exclusively after a series of major labor market reforms ('Hartz Reforms') have been implemented between 2003 and 2005, indicating that the reforms have contributed to an increased spatial mobility of the unemployed.

Bayesian structured additive regression models for zero-inflated and overdispersed count data are employed. In addition, the framework is extended towards hurdle specifications, providing an alternative approach to cover particularly large frequencies of zero quotes in count data. As a specific merit, the model class considered embeds linear and nonlinear effects of covariates on all distribution parameters. Linear effects indicate that the quantity and severity of prior illness are positively correlated with the risk of hospital admission, while medical prevention (in the form of general practice visits) and rehabilitation reduce the expected length of future hospital stays. Flexible nonlinear response patterns are diagnosed for age and an indicator of a patients' socioeconomic status. We find that social deprivation exhibits a positive impact on the risk of admission and a negative effect on the expected length of future hospital stays of admitted patients.

Recent literature suggests that monetary policy responds asymmetrically to fluctuations in either an output gap or unemployment gap. Most of these studies impose the assumption of constant inflation and interest rate targets. This paper models both of these target rates as time varying parameters using a nested specification to test for constancy in the target rates. Additionally, the paper examines the estimation strategy needed to estimate all of the policy maker's structural or deep parameters for the asymmetric preferences model. The model is estimated via maximum likelihood using an iterative Kalman filter. Results show that asymmetric policy response over the output gap disappears for all sample periods when the joint underlying dynamics of inflation and interest rate data are accounted for. Additionally, the results indicate that policy target rates are not well represented by constants for all sample periods examined. As a whole, the empirical exercise suggests that conclusions about monetary policy behavior might be sensitive to modeling assumptions about target policy rates.","[Scott, C.

Drawing upon qualitative interview data, the article argues that the precarious employment context limits opportunities for effective collective action (and unionization), and that workers employ a wide range of strategies to get by' and get ahead' instead. This analysis contributes to an understanding of the resilience of current employment relations by extending the discussion of agency with the category of reworking. Instead of challenging the way cross-border employment relations are organized, migrant construction workers employ various strategies that rework existing conditions to their advantage. On a broader scale, however, these practices contribute to the continuation of current employment relations.","[Berntsen, Lisa] Tilburg Univ, Intervict Dept, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands",Tilburg University,"Berntsen, L (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Int Victimol Inst Tilburg, Warandelaan 2, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",L.E.Berntsen@tilburguniversity.edu,,"Berntsen, Lisa/0000-0002-9964-4206",European Research Council [263782]; Evolution of Sovereignty project; European Research Council (ERC) [263782] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); Evolution of Sovereignty project; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This research was funded by European Research Council Starting Grant #263782, Transnational Work and the Evolution of Sovereignty project, PI Nathan Lillie.",,48,73,76,2,19,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

We compare this structure against three types of direct lines structures (no transfers) to serve a stylized public transport network where several flows converge into a main avenue, simultaneously optimizing fleet and vehicle sizes considering both users' and operators' costs. The best structure is shown to depend not only on the total passenger volume but also on demand imbalance, demand dispersion in the origins and the length of the trunk line. The region where the feeder-trunk structure dominates depends largely on the value assigned to the pure transfer penalty. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

For safety during construction, agencies establish slow zones in which trains must reduce speed. Slow zones create delays and schedule disruptions that result in customer dissatisfaction and discontinued use of transit, either temporarily or permanently. While transit agencies are understandably concerned about the possible negative effects of slow zones, empirical research has not specifically examined the relationship between slow zones and ridership. This paper partially fills that gap. Using data collected from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) Customer Experience Survey, CTA Slow Zone Maps, and, the Automatic Fare Collection System (AFC), it examines whether recurring service delays due to slow zones affect transit rider behavior and if the transit loyalty programs, such as smart card systems, increase or decrease rider defections. Findings suggest that slow zones increase headway deviation which reduces ridership. Smart card customers are more sensitive to slow zones as they are more likely to stop using transit as a result of delay. The findings of this paper have two major policy implications for transit agencies: (1) loyalty card users, often the most reliable source of revenue, are most at risk for defection during construction and (2) it is critical to minimize construction disruptions and delays in the long run by maintaining state of good repair. The results of this paper can likely be used as the basis for supporting immediate funding requests to bring the system to an acceptable state of good repair as well as stimulating ideas about funding reform for transit.

Local European labor markets have generally been viewed as not as flexible as those in North America, leading to greater fluctuations in local wages, labor force participation and unemployment rates, and smaller changes in local employment as economic shocks are primarily experienced by the local area's original residents. France is an interesting case. French gross migration rates-though perhaps relatively low-are higher today than a generation ago. Using a host of novel identification approaches and French employment zone data dating back to the early 1980s, we investigate whether these changes correspond to economic migration that would increase labor market flexibility. Our results detect surprising amounts of economic migration in that most new jobs are eventually taken by new migrants or outside commuters. We then reconcile these somewhat surprising findings with the still relatively low contemporary French interregional gross migration rates, concluding that other structural impediments besides relative local labor market inflexibility are behind relatively poor labor market performance.

The present paper seeks to raise interest in this question and to estimate, by contingent valuation, French households' willingness-to-pay (WTP) to improve their road safety level and reduce their risk of non-fatal injuries following a road accident. More precisely, a Tobit and a type-II Tobit model were estimated to identify factors for WTP. The results highlighted the significant positive influence of injury severity on WTP. Experience of road traffic accidents seemed to play an important role, positively influencing valuation of non-fatal injury.

Thus, the model is much more flexible than the traditional binary choice models: pregibit nests logit, approximately nests probit, loglog, cloglog, and gosset models and incorporates the linear probability model. Greater flexibility allows a more accurate estimation of the data-generating process, including asymmetric and thick/thin tails. We prove that the maximum likelihood estimator of the pregibit model is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. A Monte Carlo analysis and two real-world examples show that probit and logit estimates may show misleading evidence in cases where a pregibit model is statistically preferred. One example concerns enrollment in post-secondary education in Belgium: The pregibit estimate of the enrollment gap between Belgian natives and foreign students is 50 % larger, and the type of high school (general, technical, catholic) is more influential. The second example examines the outcome of mortgage applications in the USA. Here, pregibit estimates assign a stronger role to variables that measure the financial strength of mortgage applicants and a weaker role to demographic characteristics including minority status. More importantly, the distribution of the disturbances proves to be seriously skewed: Pregibit indicates that even high-risk applicants (with a probit acceptance probability of nearly 0) have a positive probability of getting their mortgage application approved. Apparently, mortgage officers are more inclined to uncover reasons to make a mortgage deal than to send clients away empty-handed.","[Vijverberg, Chu-Ping C.] CUNY Coll Staten Isl, Sch Business, Dept Econ, 2800 Victory Blvd, Staten Isl, NY 10314 USA; [Vijverberg, Chu-Ping C.; Vijverberg, Wim P.

Distributional impacts are calculated as differences in inequality measures of the marginal distributions of potential outcomes of receiving and not receiving the treatment. The estimation procedure involves a first non-parametric estimation of the propensity score. In the second step weighted versions of inequality measures are computed using weights based on the estimated propensity score. Consistency, semi-parametric efficiency and validity of inference based on the percentile bootstrap are shown for the estimators.

Over the past years, there has been an increasing focus on the development of modeling tools, especially when the expected outcomes appear to yield significant profits to the investors' portfolios. In alignment with modern globalized economy, the available resources are becoming gradually more plentiful, thus difficult to be analyzed by standard statistical tools. Thus far, there have been a number of research papers that emphasize solely in past data from stock bond prices and other technical indicators. Nevertheless, throughout recent studies, prediction is also based on textual information, based on the logical assumption that the course of a stock price can also be affected by news articles and perhaps by public opinions, as posted on various Web 2.0 platforms. Despite the recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Data Mining, when data tend to grow both in number of records and attributes, numerous mining algorithms face significant difficulties, resulting in poor forecast ability. The aim of this study is to propose a potential answer to the problem, by considering a Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian Inference approach, which estimates conditional probability distributions in structures obtained from a Tree-Augmented Na < ve Bayes algorithm. The novelty of this study is based on the fact that technical analysis contains the event and not the cause of the change, while textual data may interpret that cause. The paper takes into account a large number of technical indices, accompanied with features that are extracted by a text mining methodology, from financial news articles and opinions posted in different social media platforms. Previous research has demonstrated that due to the high-dimensionality and sparseness of such data, the majority of widespread Data Mining algorithms suffer from either convergence or accuracy problems. Results acquired from the experimental phase, including a virtual trading experiment, are promising. Certainly, as it is tedious for a human investor to read all daily news concerning a company and other financial information, a prediction system that could analyze such textual resources and find relations with price movement at future time frames is valuable.","[Maragoudakis, Manolis] Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Samos, Greece; [Serpanos, Dimitrios] QCRI, Doha, Qatar",University of Aegean; Qatar Foundation (QF); Hamad Bin Khalifa University-Qatar; Qatar Computing Research Institute,"Maragoudakis, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aegean, Dept Informat & Commun Syst Engn, Samos, Greece.",mmarag@aegean.gr; dserpanos@qf.org.qa,"Maragoudakis, Manolis/AAS-8112-2020; Serpanos, Dimitrios/GXV-0880-2022","Maragoudakis, Manolis/0000-0001-7701-0141; Serpanos, Dimitrios/0000-0002-1385-7113",,,,,50,10,11,0,84,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-7099,1572-9974,,COMPUT ECON,Comput.

The authors also find that the financial crisis has increased the importance of cash flow and government subsidies for increased growth in small- and medium-sized Portuguese hotels.

We show that productivity growth rates between 2000 and 2010 vary significantly and that this heterogeneity is explained by pure efficiency changes rather than scale efficiency of technological changes. Therefore, we carry out a detailed efficiency analysis to determine the drivers of port efficiency. Time series results show an upward trend for port efficiency in developing regions, as it increased from 51 percent in 2000 to 61 percent in 2010. Our analysis indicates that private sector participation, the reduction of corruption in the public sector, improvements in liner connectivity and the existence of multimodal links increase the level of port efficiency in developing regions.

We then use empirically derived parameter estimates to simulate and quantify the full range of biases. We do that for alternative income distributions and four different demand models. The biases can be quite large; they generally grow as the degree of income inequality rises, the underlying expenditure elasticity differs from one, and the rank of the model increases.","[Denton, Frank T.] McMaster Univ, Dept Econ, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada; [Mountain, Dean C.] McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada",McMaster University; McMaster University,"Mountain, DC (通讯作者)，McMaster Univ, DeGroote Sch Business, 1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4M4, Canada.",dentonf@mcmaster.ca; mountain@mcmaster.ca,,,,,,,30,2,2,0,3,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

This article explores whether a system of decentralized primary education slowed down regional convergence in schooling, since poor and backward areas could not afford to invest a suitable amount of resources in education. It also investigates whether a more centralized system introduced in 1911 fostered the development of basic education and reduced the country's regional disparities. The analysis confirms the existence of such a human capital trap and shows that centralized primary education fostered the development of Italy's schooling in the Interwar period.","[Cappelli, Gabriele] Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Tubingen, Germany",Eberhard Karls University of Tubingen,"Cappelli, G (通讯作者)，Univ Tubingen, Dept Econ, Tubingen, Germany.",gabriele.cappelli@uni-tuebingen.de,"Cappelli, Gabriele/N-6509-2015","Cappelli, Gabriele/0000-0001-8934-953X",,,,,47,29,30,0,4,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1361-4916,1474-0044,,EUR REV ECON HIST,Eur.

J,"Munyi, EN",,,,"Munyi, Elijah Nyaga",,,Beyond Asymmetry: Substantive Beliefs in Preference Formation and Efficiency of Asymmetrical Negotiations,NEW POLITICAL ECONOMY,,,English,Article,,,,,,ACP-EU relations; rhetorical framing; substantive beliefs; internalisation; negotiations,,"Contrary to extant propositions on the primacy of trade dependency in compelling faster agreement by subordinate states in asymmetrical economic negotiations, in the European Union-Africa, Caribbean and Pacific (EU-ACP) Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) negotiations, it is the states that were least materially vulnerable that were quickest to accept an EPA. Why so? I argue that the speed and propensity of ACP states to accept and ratify their EPAs were principally hinged on variances in preference formation based on what Ikenberry and Kupchan [(1990), Socialization and Hegemonic Power', International Organization, 44 (3), pp. 283-315: 283] call substantive beliefs rather than material payoffs'. The quickest states to ratify an EPA were those which most intensely shared the EU's neoliberal belief in an automatic correlation between trade liberalisation and economic growth, rather than those that were most materially vulnerable. Therefore, by taking the normative sources of preference formation by subordinate states seriously, we can not only derive a parsimonious explanation of EPA negotiating efficiency but also form a foundational conceptual model of predicting efficiency in asymmetrical negotiations that unifies the role of both normative and material considerations.","[Munyi, Elijah Nyaga] Aalborg Univ, Ctr Comparat Integrat Studies, Inst Kultur & Globale Studier, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Munyi, EN (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Ctr Comparat Integrat Studies, Inst Kultur & Globale Studier, Kroghstr 3,Room 5-233, DK-9220 Aalborg O, Denmark.",munyi@cgs.aau.dk,,,,,,,22,9,9,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1356-3467,1469-9923,,NEW POLIT ECON,New Polit.

Destination management came into focus there as early as the sixties of the 20th century, while in the Czech Republic quite a bit later, approximately in the second half of the nineties. This is apparent also in professional literature. An array of authors, both foreign and domestic, engage in destination management at present. However, the domestic authors proceed primarily from foreign experience as destination management hasn't a long tradition in the Czech Republic. Destination management is based on cooperation of involved subjects, which is regarded as an important prerequisite for further development of tourism. Nevertheless, cooperation of various subjects from the public and the private sector isn't an easy matter and so attention is aimed to various approaches to effective destination management. The paper deals with theoretical background of destination management. Besides, an item of interest is also its application in practice. The paper examines principally the situation in the Czech Republic with the aim to find out the level of tourism management in its particular destinations.","[Beckova, Helena; Novakova, Bozena] Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Becková, H (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Jan Perner Transport Fac, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",helena.beckova@upce.cz; bozena.novakova@upce.cz,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,4,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,144,153,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100015,0

Regularized logistic regression helped in prediction of Buy-Sell Index (BSI) from real stock market data. Various measures of prediction quality were discussed.

Obtained data from the Czech Statistical Office covering 14 Czech regions over years 1995-2013. As for methods, regression analysis with fixed effects and Granger Causality test were used. Results confirmed positive relationship between dependent variables and unemployment rate, real GDP per capita and R&D institutions as supporting infrastructure. Higher population density led to increase only in the case of business companies, whereas self-employed individuals were affected by higher population density negatively. More densely populated areas may require more ambitious businesses that are more frequently started by an entrepreneurial team and not by solo entrepreneurs.

However, the imperfections of the regression model, and property being real described objects in the models, lead to contradictory and unjustified conclusions. One of the reasons of the functional imperfections of regression models is a qualitative variables input method. Unfortunately, this type of variables are most usually used in decryption of property characteristics. According to the principles defining possible operations on numbers depending on the type of the scale of measurement (nominal and ordinal), the qualitative variables can be introduced into the regression models as dummy variables. In this article the authors propose an alternative implementation method of qualitative variables (describing the real estate markets) in multiple regression models, which describe the variability by means of the Osgood scale. This paper presents not only a theoretical basis of the proposed model but also the results of empirical data in relation to the classical method. Theoretical considerations are supported by the empirical study on the residential housing market in Szczecin and Bydgoszcz.","[Forys, Iwona] Univ Szczecin, Dept Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland; [Gaca, Radoslaw] Rzeczoznawca Majatkowy, Gdanska 5-3a, PL-81005 Bydgoszcz, Poland",University of Szczecin,"Forys, I (通讯作者)，Univ Szczecin, Dept Econ & Management, Mickiewicza 64, PL-71101 Szczecin, Poland.",forys@wneiz.pl; rgaca@poczta.onet.pl,"Gaca, Radosław/N-2524-2019; Foryś, Iwona/AAG-5390-2019","Gaca, Radosław/0000-0001-6029-3157; Foryś, Iwona/0000-0002-2294-0672",,,,,16,4,4,0,3,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,36,44,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000004,0

We model the relationships among spot, adjustment and regulation prices and provide empirical evidence that the intra-daily sessions are well-functioning and low-cost market tools to ease the introduction of a high share of RES. Conventional production units may bid on all market sessions but we estimate high and significant premia of readiness earned on real-time sessions.

The costs, days, and procedures required to start a business are found to be important predictors of new LLC registration. Panel regressions also show important synergies in multiple reforms of two or more business environment indicators. These results are consistent with the intuition that to be effective, reforms should be sufficiently large so that the costs of registration are lower than the expected benefits. In addition, countries with relatively weaker business environments prior to reforms require relatively larger reforms to impact the number of newly registered LLCs.

The research in 188 companies show coaching and mediation are tools top management tend to choose as solution tools. Both coaching and mediation have different aim, process, outcome and durability. The research showed there are conflicts in companies in the Czech Republic, majority (68%) is related to purely work conflict, followed by personality clashes (peer conflicts) 47% and hierarchical clashes between managers and employees 45%. Currently, coaching is more popular between management as it has been a more traditional managerial tool compared to mediation. Managers also have more experience (usually personal experience) with coaching, but very little with mediation. Conflicts between company and employees are mainly labour-lated, two main reasons are termination and disciplinaries. If there is external solution needed, litigation is still more frequently used than mediation.","[Lankasova, Radka; Stepankova, Marie; Bendova, Sarka; Snajderova, Marie] Univ Econ, Nam Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Lankasová, R (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Nam Winstona Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Zizkov, Czech Republic.",info@radkalankasova.cz; mastepank@gmail.com; bendovasa@seznam.cz; MariaSchn@seznam.cz,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,2,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-10-0,,,,2016,,,,,,,1041,1049,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG5KD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389515100103,0

Building on previous work (Marcuzzo 2008; 2012), we propose an empirical study with the aim of describing the dynamics of changes in HET in recent years, detecting three trends: 1) a sort of 'stepping down from the shoulders of giants', namely a move towards studies of 'minor' figures and/or economists from a more recent past; 2) the blossoming of archival research into unpublished work and correspondence; 3) less theory-laden investigations, connecting intellectual circles, linking characters and events. Using data from Econlit we show the evolution of the overall publication of HET articles (1955-2013) and of HET fully or partially specialized journals (1993-2013); for the latter, by devising proxies which are amenable to quantitative assessment, we demonstrate that there is some evidence to support these claims.","[Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina; Zacchia, Giulia] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat, Rome, Italy",Sapienza University Rome,"Marcuzzo, MC (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat, Rome, Italy.",cristina.marcuzzo@uniroma1.it; giulia.zacchia@uni-roma1.it,"Zacchia, Giulia/AAK-4819-2021; Marcuzzo, Maria Cristina/AAK-8514-2020","Zacchia, Giulia/0000-0002-0151-9184;",,,,,14,16,16,0,1,FABRIZIO SERRA EDITORE,PISA,"PO BOX NO,1, SUCC NO. 8, PISA, I-56123, ITALY",1122-8792,1724-2169,,HIST ECON IDEAS,Hist.

It reviews the abstracts of publications on i4.0 and it measure the level of relationship of the topic of lean on them.

Of special interest is identifying car drivers who also use public transport and/or bicycle, as this group is more likely to respond to policies that stimulate the use of those modes. It is suggested in the literature that this group may have,less biased perceptions and different attitudes towards those modes. This supposition is examined in this paper by conducting a latent class cluster analysis, which identifies (multi)modal travel groups based on the self-reported frequency of mode use. Simultaneously, a membership function is estimated to predict the probability of belonging to each of the five identified (multi)modal travel groups, as a function of attitudinal variables in addition to structural variables. The results indicate that the (near) solo car drivers indeed have more negative attitudes towards public transport and bicycle, while frequent car drivers who also use public transport have less negative public transport attitudes. Although the results suggest that in four of the five identified travel groups, attitudes are congruent with travel mode use, this is not the case for the group who uses public transport most often. This group has relatively favorable car attitudes, and given that many young, low-income travelers belong to this group, it may be expected that at least part of this group will start using car more often once they can afford it. Based on the results, challenges for sustainable policies are formulated for each of the identified (multi)modal travel groups.

This lead to the diagnostic criteria weighting, indicators of development and sustainability by the participatory approaches. The data were collected through literature reviews, structure-questionnaire, focus group discussion with local stakeholders and individual interviews using the techniques of Participatory Rapid Appraisal and conceptual content analysis. This resulted in the diagnostic criteria following the framework for evaluating sustainable land management, which are productivity, security, protection, viability, and acceptability.

We study the financial stability implications of such dependency on syndicate partners in the presence of shocks to banks' capital. Model simulations in a network setting show that such shocks can produce rare events in this market when banks have shared loan exposures while also relying on a common risk management tool such as value-at-risk (VaR). This is because a withdrawal of a bank from a syndicate can cause ripple effects through the market, as the loan arranger scrambles to commit more of its own funds by also pulling back from other syndicates or has to dissolve the syndicate it had arranged. However, simulations also show that the core-periphery structure observed in the empirical network may reduce the probability of such contagion. In addition, simulations with tighter VaR constraints show banks taking on less risk ex-ante.","[Nirei, Makoto] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Innovat Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Sushko, Vladyslav] Bank Int Settlements, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland; [Caballero, Julian] Interamer Dev Bank, Washington, DC 20577 USA",Hitotsubashi University; Bank for International Settlements (BIS); Inter-American Development Bank,"Sushko, V (通讯作者)，Bank Int Settlements, Cent Bahnpl 2, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland.",nirei@iir.hit-u.ac.jp; vlad.sushko@bis.org; julianc@iadb.org,,,BIS Research Fellowship Program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243050] Funding Source: KAKEN,"BIS Research Fellowship Program; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful for the generous support of the BIS Research Fellowship Program.

The level of market orientation differed significantly among the companies, but these differences can be mostly explained by the sector in which the company operated, by the company's size and by the company's level of maturity or development.

Building on the Customs Union between Belarus, Russia, and Kazakhstan (2010), and successfully extending membership to Armenia and Kyrgyzstan (2015), the EAEU not only connects a market of over 182 million people, but has the stated aim of utilizing European Union experience to achieve deep integration in a fraction of the time. Based on original fieldwork conducted in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, this article examines the kind of integration project currently under construction, as well as the EAEU's ability to make a significant impact in the region. As argued, despite early achievements, the EAEU is very much limited to reproducing sovereignty rather than transforming it, marking a clear disconnect between rhetoric and reality.

As Germany's policy of fiscal austerity used to be criticized by advocates of expansionary fiscal policies, it is of particular interest to study its effects upon the European Union periphery. Using quarterly data of seven Central and East European (CEE) countries over the 2002-2014 period, we find that widening of the budget deficit in Germany leads to a significant worsening of output, while the effects on the real exchange rate are rather marginal. Our results contrast with several other studies, which imply that a higher budget deficit in Germany is beneficial for other European countries. Among different spillover channels, demand and competitiveness effects seem to be outweighed by international flows effect. For the CEE countries, Germany's policy of fiscal austerity is evidently pro-cyclical. The strongest stimulating effect is obtained for Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic, which maintain fixed exchange rates, while expansionary effects are weaker for countries with a floating exchange rate regime, such as Poland or the Czech Republic.","[Shevchuk, Victor] Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland; [Kopych, Roman] Ivan Franko Natl Univ Lviv, Univ 1, UA-79005 Lvov, Ukraine",Cracow University of Technology; Ministry of Education & Science of Ukraine; Ivan Franko National University Lviv,"Shevchuk, V (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Technol, Inst Econ Sociol & Philosophy, Warszawska 24, PL-31155 Krakow, Poland.",vshevchuk@pk.edu.pl; kopych_r@bigmir.net,"Shevchuk, Victor Oleksiy/F-9951-2019",,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-47-8,,,,2016,,,,,,,169,178,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6AG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389839000018,0

Almost 20 years after its introduction into Croatian criminal law, it represents one of the most common offences in the field of economic crimes. In the introduction of the paper development of the criminal offence of fraud in economic business operations is analysed. Recent legal regulation of the offence is criticised from the nomotechnical aspect and problems arising in practice. Evaluation of the final judgements of the Municipal Criminal Court in Zagreb and Municipal Court in Split is discussed next indicating diversity of the convictions and lenient imposed punishments; mostly suspended short term imprisonment. This practice suggests arbitrariness in application of the Act on the responsibility of legal persons for the criminal offences. The results are validated by the analysis of the data of the Croatian Bureau of Statistics concerning convictions of the adult persons who have committed criminal offence of fraud in economic business operations in the period from 2010-2014. Short term suspended imprisonment, restraint in imposing security measures and special obligations, overpopulation in the jails and insufficient number of qualified persons for rehabilitation and treatment of the offenders seriously cast doubt in efficiency of special and general prevention as purposes of the punishment. The paper shows that satisfactorily legal solutions confront numerous practical challenges.

The data used for analysis was obtained through a survey conducted in the study area. Direct visit to 63 the fruit processing industries and discussion with key persons were implemented to reach deep information. Most fruit processing industries used more than one raw material supplier to reach more alternatives and more guarantees to procure large quantity of raw material. Most of big industries used contract system in raw material procurement to reduce risk because of large amount of raw material requirement for large number of production.

Each variable is defined as a percentage corresponding to the each of four SME categories; micro, small, medium and large enterprises. Major drawback of data is presence of missing data. Results indicate that only large and medium enterprises significantly influence on unemployment reduction. In the same time increase of value added of large and medium enterprises results in increase of unemployment.

The Tarmac Delay Rule stipulates that aircraft lift-off, or an opportunity for passengers to deplane, must occur no later than 3 h after the cabin door closure at the gate of the departure airport; and that an opportunity for passengers to deplane must occur no later than 3 h after the touchdown at the arrival airport. The Tarmac Delay Rule aims to protect enplaned passengers on commercial aircraft from excessively long delays on the tarmac upon taxi-out or taxi-in, and monetarily penalizes airlines that violate the stipulated 3-h tarmac time limit. Comparing the actual flight schedule and delay data after the Tarmac Delay Rule was in effect with that before, we find that the Rule has been highly effective in reducing the frequency of occurrence of long tarmac times. However, another significant effect of the rule has been the rise in flight cancellation rates. Cancellations result in passengers requiring rebooking, and often lead to extensive delay in reaching their final destinations. Using an algorithm to estimate passenger delay, we quantify delays to passengers in 2007, before the Tarmac Delay Rule was enacted, and compare these delays to those estimated for hypothetical scenarios with the Tarmac Delay Rule in effect for that same year. Our delay estimates are calculated using U.S. Department of Transportation data from 2007. Through our results and several sensitivity analyses, we show that the overall impact of the current Tarmac Delay Rule is a significant increase in passenger delays, especially for passengers scheduled to travel on the flights which are at risk of long tarmac delays. We evaluate the impacts on passengers of a number of rule variations, including changes to the maximum time on the tarmac, and variations in that maximum by time-of-day. Through extensive scenario analyses, we conclude that a better balance between the conflicting objectives of reducing the frequency of long tarmac times and reducing total passenger delays can be achieved through a modified version of the existing rule. This modified version involves increasing the tarmac time limit to 3.5 h and only applying the rule to flights with planned departure times before 5pm. Finally, in order to implement the Rule more effectively, we suggest the tarmac time limit to be defined in terms of the time when the aircraft begin returning to the gate instead of being defined in terms of the time when passengers are allowed to deplane.

Further, the relationship between energy consumption and GDP is two-way causal and has been decreasing in strength over time.

Our main findings are the following. First, our frequency analysis shows that credit-less recoveries are not unusual. Moreover, the frequency of credit-less recoveries doubles after a banking or currency crisis. Second, results from estimated panel probit models suggest that credit-less recoveries are typically preceded by large declines in economic activity and by financial stress, in particular if private sector indebtedness is high and the country is reliant of foreign capital inflows. Finally, our model performs well in predicting the credit-less recoveries experienced by emerging market economies in recent years.","[Bijsterbosch, Martin] European Cent Bank, D-60314 Frankfurt, Germany; [Dahlhaus, Tatjana] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada",European Central Bank; Bank of Canada,"Dahlhaus, T (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, 234 Laurier Ave West, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G9, Canada.",Martin.Bijsterbosch@ecb.int; dahl@bankofcanada.ca,,,,,,,25,7,7,0,6,PHYSICA-VERLAG GMBH & CO,HEIDELBERG,"PO BOX 10 52 80, 69042 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0377-7332,1435-8921,,EMPIR ECON,Empir.

The purpose of this paper is to measure the extent and characteristics of reporting error in weight, and to examine its impact on regression coefficients in models of the healthcare consequences of obesity. We analyze data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for 2003-2010, which includes both self-reports and measurements of weight and height. We find that reporting error in weight is non-classical: underweight respondents tend to overreport, and overweight and obese respondents tend to underreport, their weight, with underreporting increasing in measured weight. This error results in roughly 1 out of 7 obese individuals being misclassified as non-obese. Reporting error is also correlated with other common regressors in economic models, such as education. Although it is a common misconception that reporting error always causes attenuation bias, comparisons of models that use self-reported and measured weight confirm that reporting error can cause upward bias in coefficient estimates. For example, use of self-reports leads to overestimates of the probability that an obese man uses a prescription drug, has a healthcare visit, or has a hospital admission. These findings underscore that models of the consequences of obesity should use measurements of weight, when available, and that social science datasets should measure weight rather than simply ask subjects to report their weight.

Controlling for individual fixed effects and lagged cognition, we find that retirees face lower declines in their cognitive flexibility than those who remain employed, which appears to be persistent 6 years after retirement. However, the information processing speed of low-educated retirees declines faster. The magnitude of both changes in cognition is such that retirees appear 5-6 years younger in terms of cognitive flexibility, and older in terms of information processing speed. We show that these relationships between retirement and cognitive development cannot be explained by (1) feeling relieved from routine work, (2) changes in mood, (3) changes in lifestyle, and (4) changes in blood pressure. The decline in information processing speed after retirement particularly holds for the low educated. This could increase the social costs of an aging society. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I find evidence for both endogenous and contextual effects for all outcomes under consideration, even after controlling for confounding effects.

We propose a new set of quadratic moment conditions exploiting the correlation of the spatially lagged dependent variable with the disturbance term of the main regression equation and with the endogenous regressor. The proposed GMM estimator is more efficient than IV-based linear estimators in the literature, and computationally simpler than the ML estimator. With carefully constructed quadratic moment equations, the GMM estimator can be asymptotically as efficient as the ML estimator under normality. Monte Carlo experiments show that the proposed GMM estimator performs well in finite samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, democratization concerns different aspects, not only the extension of suffrage, but also the extent of the powers of parliament. These two different dimensions of democracy are interdependent and can even be opposed. We show that the political elite maygrant universal suffrage to counter pressure exerted by the bourgeoisie in favor of a widening of the powers of the parliament. By extending suffrage to the masses, the political elite makes it less advantageous for the bourgeoisie to seek a more powerful parliament. However, the entry, even in a parliament without powers, of representatives of the working class leads the political elite to ensure some form of redistribution.

Overall, we find that (a) carbon costs are passed through fully in most countries; (b) under some model specifications, cost pass-through is higher during pealdoad than during baseload for France, Germany and the Netherlands; and (c) the results are sensitive to the degree of cross-commodity and cross-market interaction allowed.","[Fell, Harrison] Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA; [Hintermann, Beat] Univ Basel, Fac Business & Econ, CH-4003 Basel, Switzerland; [Hintermann, Beat] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Vollebergh, Herman] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, CentER, The Hague, Netherlands; [Vollebergh, Herman] Tilburg Sustainabil Ctr, Tilburg, Netherlands",Colorado School of Mines; University of Basel; Ifo Institut; Tilburg University; Tilburg University,"Fell, H (通讯作者)，Colorado Sch Mines, Div Econ & Business, Golden, CO 80401 USA.",hfell@mines.edu; b.hintermann@unibas.ch; Herman.Vollebergh@pbl.nl,,"Vollebergh, Herman/0000-0002-0855-9031; Fell, Harrison/0000-0002-5749-3040",,,,,17,22,22,2,18,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,OCT,2015,36.0,4.0,,,,,61,83,,10.5547/01956574.36.4.hfel,0.0,,,23,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CS5XP,,"Green Accepted, Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362151900004,0

This is despite considerable evidence that unrestrained levels of visitation can be unsustainable in terms of the impact on the environment and recreational experience. This paper seeks to answer two questions. First, to what extent are visitors willing to forego access to publicly owned protected natural areas in order to ensure less crowding and/or better environmental outcomes? And second, if access were restricted, how would visitors like remaining access rights to be allocated? The results show that visitors are, in general, willing to trade off some degree of access rights for better environmental outcomes and reduced crowding; particularly the former. It is clear that peak pricing is not supported, whereas visitor caps have broad support.","[Fleming, Christopher M.] Griffith Business Sch, S Bank, Qld 4101, Australia; [Manning, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia",Australian National University,"Fleming, CM (通讯作者)，Griffith Business Sch, South Bank Campus, S Bank, Qld 4101, Australia.",chris.fleming@griffith.edu.au,"Fleming, Christopher/ABE-3736-2020; Manning, Matthew/HKE-4255-2023","Fleming, Christopher/0000-0001-7596-7775; Manning, Matthew/0000-0002-1622-4936",Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet 'Smart State' Grant,Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet 'Smart State' Grant,"This research was funded by a Queensland Department of Premier and Cabinet 'Smart State' Grant.

A small number of studies have gone beyond the traditional cross-sectional hedonic analysis to use repeat-sales data in the US for more robust estimation of rail transit's impact on property value. While the empirical literature generally supports the positive capitalization of rail transit in home value, it has produced widely varied estimates and failed to incorporate the theoretical insight that more elastic housing supply would reduce the extent of local amenities' capitalization in home value. Observing Beijing's rapid expansion of subway lines during the late 2000s, this study uses repeat rental transactions from 2005 to 2011 to investigate how home value reacts to the change in the home's distance to nearest subway station. Repeat-rentals estimates suggest a rent-distance elasticity of -0.02, 70% below the cross-sectional hedonic estimate. Moreover, using the unique history of state-owned enterprise relocations as instrument for intra-city variation in land supply, we find that the capitalization of subway proximity in home value is weaker where land supply is more elastic. Our findings support the significant bias caused by omitted variables in the hedonic estimates and confirm housing supply's role in explaining the intra-city spatial variation in estimates.

The elimination of gubernatorial elections in Russia in late 2004 provides a unique opportunity to study public reaction to policies that replaced democratically elected regional leaders with Kremlin appointees, thereby further concentrating power in the hands of the central state while simultaneously reducing the level of democratic accountability in Russian politics. Using a 2007 survey of 1500 Russians, it is possible to observe how key measures of public opinion and regime support were influenced by the elimination of gubernatorial elections. Because the timeline of gubernatorial appointments was determined exogenously based on the expiration of elected incumbent governors' terms, by 2007 some regions had governors who still held electoral mandates, while others had Kremlin appointees with no electoral mandate. This quasi experiment allows us to draw surprising conclusions about whom Russians blame - and do not blame - when power becomes increasingly centralized in the hands of the president.","US Mil Acad, West Point, NY 10996 USA",United States Department of Defense; United States Army; United States Military Academy,"Person, R (通讯作者)，US Mil Acad, West Point, NY 10996 USA.",robert.person@usma.edu,,,MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University,MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University,"I am grateful for the support of the MacMillan Center for International and Area Studies at Yale University for its generous funding of the research.

This article argues, contra existing depictions, that the post-crisis EU has increasingly adopted methods of decision-making in the economic field which marry the decision-making structure of inter-governmentalism with the supervisory and implementation framework of the Community Method. While this post-crisis' method has arisen for clear reasons-to achieve economic convergence between eurozone states in an environment where previous models of decision-making were unsuitable or unwanted-it also carries important normative implications. Post-crisis governance departs from the mechanisms of legal and political accountability present in previous forms of EU decision-making without substituting new models of accountability in their place. Providing appropriate channels of political and legal control in the EU's new' economic governance should be seen as a crucial task for the coming decade.","Hertie Sch Governance, Berlin, Germany",Hertie School,"Dawson, M (通讯作者)，Hertie Sch Governance, Friedrichstr 180, Berlin, Germany.",dawson@hertie-school.org,,,European Union,European Union(European Union (EU)),"The author would like to gratefully acknowledge the support of a Marie Curie grant, provided under the FP7 research programme of the European Union, for research related to this article.

A necessary condition for current account sustainability is that exports and imports are cointegrated. Following previous empirical studies (Husted 1992; Arize in Int Rev Econ Financ 11:101-115, 2002; Hamori in Appl Econ Lett 16:1691-1694, 2009), we analyze the long-run relationship linking exports and imports, using quarterly data.

These hypotheses are tested by employing data from the Afrobarometer and Latinobarometro surveys.

Bargaining is directed toward limiting or expanding the scope of debt assumption. Further, bargaining typically leads to some form of conditionality imposed in order to increase the chances of the debts being repaid or to ensure benefits accrue to the parties assuming the debt.","[Steinbach, Armin] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Steinbach, Armin] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",University of Oxford; Max Planck Society,"Steinbach, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",steinbach@coll.mpg.de,,,,,,,26,14,15,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0021-9886,1468-5965,,JCMS-J COMMON MARK S,JCMS-J.

Five different types of models are estimated and analysed, namely a traditional Revealed Preference (RP) data-based mode choice model, a hybrid mode choice model with a latent variable, a Stated Preference (SP) data-based mode switching model, a joint RP/SP mode switching model, and a hybrid mode switching model with a latent variable. A comparison of the RP data-based mode choice model with the mode choice models including a latent variable showed that the inclusion of behavioural factors (especially habit formation) significantly improved the models. The SP data-based mode switching models elucidated the reasons why traditional models tend to over-predict transit ridership by revealing the role played by different transit level-of-service attributes and their relative importance to mode switching decisions. The results showed that traditional attributes (e.g. travel cost and time) are of lower importance to mode switching behaviour than behavioural factors (e.g. habit formation towards car driving) and other transit service design attributes (e.g. crowding level, number of transfers, and schedule delays). The findings of this study provide general guidelines for developing a variety of transit ridership forecasting models depending on the availability of data and the experience of the planner.

The exhausts of shipboard fuel combustion are equally damaging particularly, so close to the environmentally sensitive mainland and island coasts, as well as at ports due to their urbanized character. This paper estimates, for the first time, exhaust pollutants related to cruise and ferry operations in Las Palmas Port and, in an island context. Emission assessment is based on a full bottom-up model and messages transmitted by the Automatic Identification System during 2011. Results are described as a breakdown of NOx, SOx, PM2.5, CO and CO2, according to ship classes, operative type and time, providing valuable information to environmental policy makers in port-city areas and islands under similar conditions. It is generally concluded that vessel traffic and passenger shipping in particular are a source of air pollution In Las Palmas Port. Emission maps confirm location of hot spots in quays assigned for cruise and ferry operations. Policy recommendations encourage regular monitoring of exhaust emissions and market-based incentives supported by details on polluting and operative profiles. On the other hand, feasibility studies are suggested for automated mooring, LNG bunkering facilities and also shore-side energy services, prioritizing berthing of shipping sectors (or sub-sectors) with the highest share of exhaust emissions once their local effects have been confirmed by a dispersion, exposure and impact assessment.

The Critical Importance of Accounting for Leakage in Land and Fuel Markets,ENERGY JOURNAL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Climate policy; Multi-market; Carbon leakage; Biofuels; Renewable fuel standards,GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES; ETHANOL; ENERGY; STATE,"We develop an analytical and numerical multi-market model that integrates land, fuel, and food markets, and link it with an emissions model to quantify the importance of carbon leakage relative to the intended emissions savings resulting from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for conventional biofuels. The expansion of biofuels mandated by the RFS can increase or decrease GHG emissions depending on the policy regime being evaluated. For example, replacing the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit (VEETC) with the RFS, as occurred at the end of 2011 when the VEETC was allowed to expire, would reduce emissions by 2.0 tgCO(2)e in 2015 for an expansion of ethanol of 11.4 billion liters. A policy regime consisting of the RFS alone would increase emissions by at least 4.5 tgCO(2)e for the same expansion of ethanol. Our findings highlight an important tension between land and fuel market leakage. Policy regimes that result in less land market leakage tend to lead to more domestic fuel market leakage per liter of ethanol added.","[Bento, Antonio M.; Klotz, Richard] Cornell Univ, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Bento, Antonio M.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Landry, Joel R.] Penn State Univ, State Coll, PA 16801 USA",Cornell University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University,"Bento, AM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, 432 Warren Hall, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",amb396@cornell.edu,"Bento, Antonio/ABC-2937-2020","Klotz, Richard/0000-0003-3763-6013",,,,,34,17,19,0,23,INT ASSOC ENERGY ECONOMICS,CLEVELAND,"28790 CHAGRIN BLVD, STE 210, CLEVELAND, OH 44122 USA",0195-6574,1944-9089,,ENERG J,Energy J.,JUL,2015,36.0,3.0,,,,,75,109,,10.5547/01956574.36.3.aben,0.0,,,35,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CK8CN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356466100003,0

It has been evaluated in many empirical studies and Monte Carlo experiments. Apart from the contradictory findings, the Michaud approach still lacks a theoretical foundation. I prove that portfolio resampling has a strong foundation in the classic theory of rational behavior. Every noise trader could do better by applying the Michaud procedure. By contrast, a signal trader who has enough prediction power and risk-management skills should refrain from portfolio resampling. The key note is that in most simulation studies, investors are considered as noise traders. This explains why portfolio resampling performs well in simulation studies, but could be mediocre in real life.","Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Math Stat, Hamburg, Germany",Helmut Schmidt University,"Frahm, G (通讯作者)，Helmut Schmidt Univ, Dept Math Stat, Hamburg, Germany.",frahm@hsu-hh.de,,"Frahm, Gabriel/0000-0001-7507-730X",,,,,53,6,6,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0040-5833,1573-7187,,THEOR DECIS,Theory Decis.,JUL,2015,79.0,1.0,,,,,107,132,,10.1007/s11238-014-9453-0,0.0,,,26,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,CM9ZM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358070200006,0

However, simple net present value calculations comparing upfront costs of fuel-saving technologies to future savings suggest this is not always the case. This puzzle is commonly referred to as the energy efficiency paradox. A growing number of empirical studies examine why households may under-invest in energy efficiency. Fewer studies examine similar undervaluation by businesses. We explore investment decisions within the heavy-duty trucking sector for fuel-saving technologies via focus groups and interviews to gain insight into what factors might explain apparent underinvestment in fuel-saving technologies. We find some evidence that market failures related to lack of information about technology performance and network externalities contribute to slow adoption of some technologies. However, information about new technologies for tractors seems to generate limited spillovers. There is also some evidence of split incentives between owners and drivers, though companies have invested in a variety of technologies and approaches in an attempt to address these effects. Other factors important in trucking investment decisions that are not classic market failures include tradeoffs between fuel economy and other valued truck attributes, as well as uncertainty and risk associated with new technologies if decision-makers are loss averse.

We assess whether speculation in the oil market played a role in driving this salient empirical pattern. We identify oil shocks from a large dataset using a dynamic factor model. This method is motivated by the fact that a small-scale vector autoregression is not informationally sufficient to identify the shocks. The main results are as follows. (i) While global demand shocks account for the largest share of oil price fluctuations, speculative shocks are the second most important driver. (ii) The increase in oil prices over the last decade is mainly driven by the strength of global demand. However, speculation played a significant role in the oil price increase between 2004 and 2008 and its subsequent collapse. (iii) The co-movement between oil prices and the prices of other commodities is mainly explained by global demand shocks. Our results support the view that the recent oil price increase is mainly driven by the strength of global demand but that the financialization process of commodity markets also played a role.

This pay gap is not only attributable to migrant/ethnic minority employees having acquired less human capital or social capital, to the impact of government policies and to discrimination. Based on both qualitative and quantitative data collected in 2010, this case study of the job segregation component of the wage disadvantages of migrant employees in a Dutch public organization identifies several other factors. Migrant workers'/ethnic minority employees' lower levels of participation in work-related communication and the application of socio-ideological labour control also widen this earnings gap. Moreover, migrant workers'/ethnic minority employees' institutional and relational uncertainties, due to their subordinated position in Dutch society, help to explain their lower levels of participation in work-related communication and how socio-ideological labour control works out negatively for them.","[Siebers, Hans] Tilburg Univ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Gastel, Jilles] Univ Austral Chile, Valdivia, Chile",Tilburg University; Universidad Austral de Chile,"Siebers, H (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Tilburg Sch Human, POB 90 153, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",h.g.siebers@tilburguniversity.edu,,"siebers, hans/0000-0001-6250-3816",,,,,50,19,20,2,69,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",0950-0170,1469-8722,,WORK EMPLOY SOC,Work Employ.

To better predict the occurrence probabilities of large truck involved crashes and gain direction for policies and countermeasures aimed at reducing the crash frequencies, it is essential to examine truck involved crashes categorized by collision vehicle types, since passenger cars and large trucks differ in dimensions, size, weight, and operating characteristics. A data set that includes a total of 1310 highway segments with 1787 truck involved crashes for a 4-year period, from 2004 to 2007 in Tennessee is employed to examine the effects that geometric design features and other relevant attributes have on the crash frequency. Since truck involved crash counts have many zeros (often 60-90% of all values) with small sample means and two established categories, car-truck and truck-only crashes, are not independent in nature, the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) models are developed under the bivariate regression framework to simultaneously address the above mentioned issues. In addition, the bivariate negative binomial (BNB) and two individual univariate ZINB models are estimated for model validation. Goodness of fit of the investigated models is evaluated using AIC, SBC statistics, the number of identified significant variables, and graphs of observed versus expected crash frequencies. The bivariate ZINB (BZINB) models have been found to have desirable distributional property to describe the relationship between the large truck involved crashes and geometric design features in terms of better goodness of fit, more precise parameter estimates, more identified significant factors, and improved predictive accuracy. The results of BZINB models indicate that the following factors are significantly related to the likelihood of truck involved crash occurrences: large truck annual average daily traffic (AADT), segment length, degree of horizontal curvature, terrain type, land use, median type, lane width, right side shoulder width, lighting condition, rutting depth (RD), and posted speed limits. Apart from that, passenger car AADT, lane number, and indicator for different speed limits are found to have statistical significant effects on the occurrences of car-truck crashes and international roughness index (IRI) is significant for the predictions of truck-only crashes.

In this paper, a theoretical framework is presented that yields a set of consensus rankings in the presence of such weight imprecision. The main idea is to consider a vector of weights as an imaginary voter submitting preferences over alternatives. With this voting construct in mind, the well-known Kemeny rule from social choice theory is introduced as a means of aggregating the preferences of many plausible choices of weights, suitably weighted by the importance attached to them. The axiomatic characterization of Kemeny's rule due to Young and Levenglick (1978) and Young (1988) extends to the present context. An analytic solution is derived for an interesting special case of the model corresponding to generalized weighted means and the -contamination framework of Bayesian statistics. The model is applied to the ARWU index of Shanghai University.

Income deprivation is operationalized as the Yitzhaki index, i.e., as a function of the sum of income differences between an individual and others in her reference group who are more affluent. Non-cognitive skills are extracted from a Locus of Control questionnaire and the Big Five Inventory, a self-report measurement of an individual in regard to five aspects of personality: conscientiousness, neuroticism, ektraversion, agreeableness and open-mindedness. The results, based on the 2002-2010 waves of the German Socio-Economic Panel dataset (SOEP), show that deprivation is negative and significantly related with mental health. However, neurotic individuals are more deprivation-sensitive than are others. Compared to the mean effect, a one standard deviation rise in neuroticism is associated with a deprivation effect that is 36.6% and 51.9% larger among men and women, respectively. Although to a lesser extent, extraverted men and conscientious women are also found to be more deprivation-sensitive than are others, the corresponding figures being 31.1% and 45.9%, respectively. These findings suggest that personality differences should be taken into account in the design of policies, practices and initiatives aimed at alleviating the well-being costs of income deprivation.

The primary aim of this study is to examine whether RTAs are directly related to the purchase of vehicle insurance, with our examination of data on vehicle damage insurance policyholders revealing that those drivers who purchase more insurance coverage have a higher probability of being involved in accidents, as a result of which, they will tend to submit more claims. This indicates that insurance coverage might contain information which can be used to assess the probability risk levels of RTAs. We also find that drivers with less safety awareness will tend to purchase more coverage, and that those who purchase more coverage will, in turn, tend to have more accidents and submit more claims. Our findings, which provide a number of road traffic policy implications, would appear to justify the use of the bonus-malus system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We use nationally representative data from the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study for the years 2005, 2007, and 2008 with 7282 person-year observations for men and 4611 for women. A Quality of Work Index (QWI) is calculated based on work content, job security, the possibilities for improvement, compensation, work conditions, and interpersonal relationships at work. The key independent variable is the body mass index (kg/m(2)) splined at 18.5, 25, and 30. For men, BMI is positively associated with the QWI only in the normal weight segment (+0.19 percentage points at the 10th, +0.28 at the 50th, +0.32 at the 75th, +034 at the 90th, and +0.48 at the 95th quantiles). A unit increase in the BMI for women is associated with a lower QWI at the lower quantiles in the normal weight segment (-0.28 at the 5th, -0.19 at the 10th, and -0.25 percentage points at the 25th quantiles) and at the upper quantiles in the overweight segment (-1.15 at the 90th and -1.66 percentage points at the 95th quantiles). The results imply a spill-over cost of overweight or obesity beyond its impact on health in terms of success in the labor market. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article argues that there has been a remarkable lack of attention paid to the role of gender in extending working lives and contends that this gap has arisen because of two, inter-related, oversights: little consideration of relationships between gender and flexible working beyond the child-caring phase of life; and the prevailing tendency to think of end of working life and retirement as gender-neutral or following a typical male trajectory. The findings of a qualitative study of people aged 50+ in the UK challenge some of the key assumptions underpinning the utility of flexible work in extending working lives, and provide insight into the ways in which working in later life is constructed and enacted differently for men and women.","[Loretto, Wendy] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, Org Behav, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland; [Vickerstaff, Sarah] Univ Kent, Sch Social Policy Sociol & Social Res, Canterbury CT2 7NZ, Kent, England",University of Edinburgh; University of Kent,"Loretto, W (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Business, 29 Buccleuch Pl, Edinburgh EH8 9JS, Midlothian, Scotland.",W.Loretto@ed.ac.uk,,,DWP [531],DWP,The research on which this article was based was funded by the DWP (Research Report no. 531).

We draw together two recent studies of ERPT, linking invoice currency decisions and firm performance to heterogeneity in ERPT. Like these studies, we find that the short-run reaction of export unit values to exchange rate fluctuations is significantly related to both invoice currency choice and exporter characteristics when these are analysed separately. However, we then show that when the two factors are jointly accounted for, the role of exporter characteristics largely disappears. That is, some firm types are more inclined to invoice in the producer currency, while others use either the local or a vehicle currency. In the short run, this translates into differences in exchange rate pass-through because of price rigidity in the invoice currency. Firm characteristics do not have an independent impact on pass-through beyond their effect on currency composition. Differences across invoice currencies diminish over time, but do not disappear, as prices adjust to reflect bilateral exchange rate movements.","[Fabling, Richard] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Sanderson, Lynda] Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand",,"Fabling, R (通讯作者)，Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,,,,,,27,14,14,2,26,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0378-5920,1467-9701,,WORLD ECON,World Econ.,FEB,2015,38.0,2.0,,,,,315,339,,10.1111/twec.12198,0.0,,,25,"Business, Finance; Economics; International Relations",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; International Relations,CB4SQ,,"Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349618800004,0

This study analyses the impact of various shocks on inbound tourism demand for Turkey. First, domestic and inbound tourism activities are separated by using the information provided in input-output tables and tourism satellite accounts. Second, social accounting matrix-based price multipliers are calculated to carry out analyses in which inbound tourism is included explicitly as one industry. The policy shocks involve a fall in energy prices and in the tax rate on tourism output. Hence, an upward pressure on inbound tourism demand is targeted via price changes in both the supply and demand sides of the industry. The empirical findings show that inter-industry effects are larger than the effects on inbound tourism, revealing that 'price' alone is not a satisfactory policy instrument for promoting the tourism industry. In other words, neither of the shocks employed is sufficiently influential to enable the tourism industry to reach the targets envisaged.","[Gul, Hasan; Cagatay, Selim] Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey",Akdeniz University,"Gül, H (通讯作者)，Akdeniz Univ, Dept Econ, TR-07058 Antalya, Turkey.",hasangul@akdeniz.edu.tr; selimcagatay@akdeniz.edu.tr,"Gul, Hasan/AAB-3193-2019",,"Akdeniz University, Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit [2010.03.0107.001]","Akdeniz University, Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit(Akdeniz University)","This research is financially supported by Akdeniz University, Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit with the project reference no. 2010.03.0107.001.

Since auction bids monotonically increase within individual auctions but can differ considerably across auctions, we construct a monotone series estimator with a common relative price growth curve and auction-specific slopes. Furthermore, because the impacts of auction-specific attributes may evolve along the course of auctions, we employ a varying coefficient approach to accommodate these possibly time-varying effects.

We examine this issue, finding that not only was regional poverty affected by regional labor demand shocks, the effect was stronger post-2000. Consistent with the poverty results are findings of greater post-2000 regional labor demand effects on employment rates and reduced population adjustments to asymmetric labor demand shocks.","[Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Partridge, Mark D.] Ohio State Univ, Agr Environm & Dev Econ Dept, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Rickman, Dan S.; Tan, Ying] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Econ & Legal Studies Business, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA; [Olfert, M.

IT education in business can be represented as a combination of academic and professional knowledge, skills and abilities that allow satisfying business needs and performing tasks in line with business requirements. Lifelong learning is an important step in the life of every individual that is now readily available, and can mean a major breakthrough in professional work or a complete change of business orientation. Lifelong learning refers not only to the time and training on the job, but also includes the time before, during and after the working life of every individual who care about their cultural, social and professional development. Capacity development of Croatian public institutions is supported through a number of important projects in the field of information and communication technologies at the national level. Career development and promotion in the civil service is closely associated with continuing academic education or professional training in the areas related to the workplace but also increasingly popular lifelong learning, especially in the field of ICT. The use of ICT offers the possibility of innovative methods of teaching and learning, using publicly available services, and professional collaboration worldwide. ICT Competency as a form of lifelong learning includes safe and convenient use of ICT in work, leisure and communication. This technology allows the use of the Internet, digital content, electronic media, personal computers, mobile phones, electronic ATM, electronic books, digital television, etc. ICT Competency is associated with logical and critical thinking with highly developed skills of information management and advanced communication skills. Due to the rapid technological development, well-planned and quality training is essential primarily of employees of public institutions, and then the user to be able to understand, apply and use new technological solutions. An example of this is e-Administration, which necessarily involves the use of information technology to increase the availability and facilitate the execution of public services for the benefit of citizens, business owners and employees in these services.","[Babic, Ana; Vukmirovic, Slavomir; Capko, Zvonko] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Babic, A (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ana.babic@efri.hr; vukmirovics@gmail.com; zvonko.capko@efri.hr,"Babić, Ana/S-7556-2018; Vukmirovic, Slavomir/GVS-3894-2022; Capko, Zvonko/S-2095-2018","Babić, Ana/0000-0002-2736-9022; Vukmirovic, Slavomir/0000-0002-2713-2447; Capko, Zvonko/0000-0002-7537-2904",,,,,8,5,5,0,6,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2015,,,,,,,222,231,,,,,,10,Business; Economics; Regional & Urban Planning,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Public Administration,BE4GH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371683100022,0

This enormous pest produced, at national level, damages of over 3 billion RON, i.e. 700 million EURO only in 2014. The knowledge of the problem and the pandemic control were obstructed by certain psycho-economic considerations, namely by the unawareness of the farmers, population and authorities regarding the statistical information arising from research. Using only mental statistics for this purpose was unsuccessful, the explosion of mice not being observed. With some recurrent behaviors, especially in the agricultural year 2009-2010, the common voles population (Microtus arvalis) has continuously increased, reaching 4,000-6,000 specimens/ ha in 2014. Psychological studies on population, authority and farmers reaction towards this situation have been made - the results are presented in this paper. We can state that the presentation of the statistical research results is very little taken into consideration by those tested, by the respondents. New forms of presentation in order to obtain a positive reaction against common voles were required. The emotional component has played an important role in the proposal of not destroying the pest population. In the same time, the European Union principle of precaution has played an important role in the delayed elaboration of a control plan. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The bilateral relationships may reflect the outcomes of a sport competition, product comparisons, or evaluation of political candidates and policies. It is shown that the rating vector can be obtained as a limit point of an iterative process based on the scores in almost all cases. The calculation is interpreted on an undirected graph with loops attached to some nodes, revealing that the procedure takes into account not only the given object's results but also the strength of objects compared with it. We explore the connection between this method and another procedure defined for ranking the nodes in a digraph, the positional power measure.

The analysis is founded on macroeconomic model of an open economy which is is used to derive sign restrictions that are applied to identify structural shocks. In an empirical part structural Bayesian VAR models with common serial correlation are employed. Sample covers quarterly data from 1998 to 2013 on real GDP, interest rate, real exchange rate and price level. We demonstrate that the shocks identified match well the description implied by the theory. Moreover, even though financial shocks are the single most important type of shock behind the exchange rate variability, the joint contribution of supply and demand shocks is greater. Finally, it is uncovered that financial shocks were behind the precrisis appreciation but afterwards their contribution to exchange rate misalignment was either nil or in line with that from real shocks. Overall, we find more evidence in support of the hypothesis that the flexible exchange rate in Poland acted as a shock absorber than for an alternative that it acted as a shock-propagating mechanism.","[Dabrowski, Marek A.] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland; [Wroblewska, Justyna] Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Econometr & Operat Res, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics; Cracow University of Economics,"Dabrowski, MA (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Dept Macroecon, Rakowicka 27, PL-31510 Krakow, Poland.",marek.dabrowski@uek.krakow.pl; eowroble@cyf-kr.edu.pl,"Wróblewska, Justyna/AAA-8421-2020; Dąbrowski, Marek A./V-2257-2018","Wróblewska, Justyna/0000-0002-9789-2601; Dabrowski, Marek A./0000-0003-3079-1811",,,,,14,0,0,0,0,FOUNDATION CRACOW UNIV ECONOMICS,KRAKOW,"UL RAKOWICKA 27, KRAKOW, 31-510, POLAND",,,978-83-65173-05-8,,,,2015,,,,,,,39,48,,,,,,10,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BE9WH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378308600004,0

The present work is focused on the creation of new cybrids through three different approaches of protoplast fusion: (i) symmetric hybridization, (ii) donor-recipient protoplast fusion by UV irradiation of donor protoplasts, and (iii) cytoplasts + protoplast fusion. Sixteen combinations of symmetric protoplast fusion have produced cybrids. No cybrid was obtained after UV irradiation of donor protoplasts while three combinations of cytoplasts + protoplast fusion produced cybrids. Therefore, cytoplast fusion appears much more promising than the UV approach for targeted cybridization.

In this study, we demonstrate that the evaluation criteria used to examine the effectiveness of a financial market price forecasting method should be the profit and profit-risk ratio, rather than errors in prediction. Thus, it is necessary to use a price prediction method and a trading rules learning method. We tested the proposed method on the foreign exchange market for the USD/JPY currency pair, where the features used for prediction were extracted from the trading history of the three main currency pairs with three different short-term horizons. MKR is essential for utilizing the information contained in many of the features derived from different information sources and for various representations of the same information source. The GA is essential for generating trading rules, which are described using a mixture of discrete structures and continuous parameters. First, the MKR predicts the change in the exchange rate based on technical indicators such as the moving average convergence and divergence of the three currency pairs. Next, the GA generates a trading rule by combining the results of the MKR with several commonly used overbought/oversold technical indicators. The experimental results show that the proposed hybrid method outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the returns and return-risk ratio. In addition, the kernel weights employed for different currency pairs and the different time horizons used in the MKR step, as well as the trading strategy generated in the GA step, should be beneficial during actual trading.","[Deng, Shangkun; Yoshiyama, Kazuki; Mitsubuchi, Takashi; Sakurai, Akito] Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kohoku Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan",Keio University,"Sakurai, A (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Technol, Kohoku Ku, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238522, Japan.",dsk8672@gmail.com; cloud-cluster@z8.keio.jp; mitsubuchi@ae.keio.ac.jp; sakurai@ae.keio.ac.jp,,,"fund Keio Leading-edge Laboratory of Science & Technology Research Grant; Global-COE program (Symbiotic, Safe and Secure System Design) of Keio University, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25330266] Funding Source: KAKEN","fund Keio Leading-edge Laboratory of Science & Technology Research Grant; Global-COE program (Symbiotic, Safe and Secure System Design) of Keio University, Japan; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This research was partially supported by the fund Keio Leading-edge Laboratory of Science & Technology Research Grant and by the Global-COE program (Symbiotic, Safe and Secure System Design) of Keio University, Japan.

In the salinity experiment, trees were supplied with nutrient solutions containing 0, 30, or 60 mM NaCl for two months. In the drought experiment, half the trees were reduced by 25% watering every 5 days for 20 days. In flood experiment, half the trees were flooded for 9 days. The experiments were conducted under greenhouse conditions. Leaf water relations, leaf gas exchange and mineral nutrition were measured. Interstocked Citrus trees are more salt-tolerant than non-interstocked trees. Leaf concentrations of Cl- and Na+ were higher in VL/SO trees than in VL/C/SO or VL/V/SO trees. The mechanism involved in the reduction of leaf Cl- ions by an interstock could be linked to its low Eleaf values during the day and/or to their high S:R DW ratios. 'Valencia' variety reported greater salt-tolerance to VL trees than 'Castellano', even though leaf Cl- and Na+ levels were similar in the two interstocked trees. 'Verna' lemon trees interstocked with orange varieties did not improve the flooding and drought tolerance. When 'Valencia' orange was used as the interstock, the flooding and drought tolerance was drastically reduced.","[Gimeno, Vicente; Martinez, Vicente; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco] Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Nutr Vegetal, Espinardo, Spain; [Simon, Inma; Nieves, Manuel] Escuela Politecn Super Orihuela, Orihuela, Spain; [Balal, Rashad M.] Univ Sargodha, Dept Hort, Sargodha, Pakistan",Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC); CSIC - Centro de Edafologia y Biologia Aplicada del Segura (CEBAS); University of Sargodha,"García-Sánchez, F (通讯作者)，Ctr Edafol & Biol Aplicada Segura, Dept Nutr Vegetal, Espinardo, Spain.",fgs@cebas.csic.es,"Gimeno, Vicente/AAC-4036-2020; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/C-5966-2009; martinez, vicente/C-5731-2011","Gimeno, Vicente/0000-0001-6658-8140; Garcia-Sanchez, Francisco/0000-0002-5884-4818; Simon Vilella, Inmaculada/0000-0002-0679-7554",,,,,16,0,0,0,3,INT SOC HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,LEUVEN 1,"PO BOX 500, 3001 LEUVEN 1, BELGIUM",0567-7572,,978-94-62610-53-8,ACTA HORTIC,,,2015,1065.0,,,,,,1335,1342,,,,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy; Horticulture,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BD1IA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358038600169,0

The aim of this study is to examine the earnings management practices and sustainability reporting among corporate sectors that offer Islamic products. An Islamic perspective is used to underpin the theoretical arguments for this study. This study uses longitudinal panel data analysis to examine the sustainability reporting of 16 public-listed companies in Malaysia that offer Islamic financial products for a three year period from 2011 to 2013. Content analyses on corporate annual and stand-alone reports used Global Reporting Initiatives (G3) guidelines to measure the quality of the sustainability disclosure, while the earnings management related data was obtained using the Modified Jones Model. The results of the study provide evidence that the sustainability reporting practices among companies in Malaysia that offer Islamic products are generally good over the three-year period and that financial performance improved the quality of sustainability reporting. The insignificant results between earnings management and the quality of sustainability reporting suggest that sustainability reporting is not being manipulated to cover their earnings management practices.

In order to compete successfully, a company must possess a rich knowledge-base and capabilities to use and develop it. Association between knowledge and firm performance has been a subject of active research, with the lion's share of empirical evidence dealing with either intellectual capital or knowledge processes that exist even without managerial input. Literature on the relationship between deliberate and systematic managerial practices (KM practices) and firm performance is still quite novel. The purpose of this paper is to determine if there is a systematic association between KM practices and firm performance. Design/methodology/approach - This study recaps the research on KM practices and firm performance by systematically reviewing and analyzing the empirical KM literature. Originality/value - KM literature has been recapped numerous times before. However, this paper is the first effort to review and analyzes the literature in terms of KM practices and firm performance. The results will increase the understanding of potentially most effective KM practices which are associated with firm performance outcomes. Practical implications - The results of this study serve as a guideline for managers, who are dealing with the challenges related to resource optimization; it indicates the potentially most effective managerial practices that are associated with enhanced firm performance through improved management of knowledge resources.","Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, FI-53851 Lappeenranta, Finland",Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology LUT,"Inkinen, H (通讯作者)，Lappeenranta Univ Technol, Sch Business & Management, POB 20, FI-53851 Lappeenranta, Finland.",,"Hussinki, Henri/E-1457-2017","Hussinki, Henri/0000-0003-2310-4796",,,,,63,0,0,1,10,IKAM-INST KNOWLEDGE ASSET MANAGEMENT,MATERA,"VIA D SCHIAVONE 1, MATERA, MT 75100, ITALY",,,978-88-96687-07-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,490,501,,,,,,12,"Economics; Management; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD0JE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357265200038,0

To characterize the typology of conventional sheep farms a study of the production system was conducted in 2014 in 10 sheep farms, located in the counties Cluj, Caras-Severin, Covasna, Buzau, Prahova and Teleorman. Evaluation of the production system from each farm was based on the completion of a specific questionnaire to this type of evaluation. The results showed that conventional sheep farms taken in study are diverse in terms of number of animals held and land used, the average size of sheep farm being by 313.6 heads (with limits between 105 and 720 heads), and the average area of land used per farm is 90.02 ha (with limits between 4.32 and 201.5 ha). The maintenance system of animals from these farms is extensive or semi-intensive, mainly based on the maintenance of sheep to pasture in warmer seasons and maintenance in shelters in cold season. The direction of sheep breeding in these farms is mixed, respectively for milk and meat. The main problems faced by farmers are related to the lack of market for their products, low prices for sheep products (especially for wool), delay of subsidies, lack of agricultural consultancy and workforce.

Increasing of the role of personal factors in decision-making process in professional sphere is one of the most significant trends in current research in this field. Processes of intensification and increased competition on the labor market, vocational choice and its efficacy become more and more important and responsible decision made by students. Motivational factors have a critical impact on vocational choice and play the central role in explanation and prediction of career opportunities, unemployment and well-being in the future. This study is aimed to investigating key motivational factors and professional and educational expectations, which significantly determine vocational preferences of the first-year students. Integration of existing approaches allowed to combine different sources of data about students' motivation and include into analysis various dimensions of the motivation. Comparison analysis of motivational factors, current grades and occupational preferences promotes opportunities of explanation, regulation and predicting career development on the personal level as well as on level of regional and national labor market.","[Ivanova, Tatiana] Novosibirsk State Acad Water Transport, Ul Ivana Alekseeva 4, Omsk 644043, Omsk Oblast, Russia",,"Ivanova, T (通讯作者)，Novosibirsk State Acad Water Transport, Ul Ivana Alekseeva 4, Omsk 644043, Omsk Oblast, Russia.",tanya_gaviv@mail.ru,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,1,MELANDRIUM,SLANY,"FUGNEROVA 691, SLANY, 27401, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-87990-06-3,,,,2015,,,,,,,635,643,,,,,,9,"Economics; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BF3DN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380530000061,0

The study was conducted in the research center Hortinvest, University of Agronomic Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Bucharest. The biological material used in this study case was the tomato hybrid Cindel. To obtain reliable conclusions we will provide the same quality parameters of irrigation water, using the same technology and culture in all experimental variants. The efficiency techniques that we adopted will be judged by the size of the achieved production and by assessing the quality indices of production. During the growing season vegetative growth and biometric measurements will be monitored and the duration of each phenological phase it will determine, depending on the technique used. Objectives: To establish the optimum irrigation, to determine the relationship between the type of substrate and the height of tomato plants, to determine the number of irrigations applied during the growing period, to determine the relationship between crop substrate and plants growth.
