Services offered by companies improve customer orientation of a company and increase customer satisfaction. IFC and customer orientation are the main parts of market orientation. Market orientation is one of many possible ways of improving companies' business performance and competitiveness. The aim of this paper is to describe the main findings of the research, which was focused on the relationship between IFC and the extension of services provided by manufacturers. Manufacturers of electronic components and electrical equipment based in the Czech Republic were among the participants of the research. These two industries are extremely important for today's Czech economy, especially as many companies become subcontractors for the automobile industry and the mechanical engineering industry. A Likert scale questionnaire was prepared to gather information about IFC and services. The respondents were mainly directors or managers, i.e. employees with high-level competence and knowledge of IFC and services in this particular market. A total of 60 SMEs were included in the survey. The data was collected between February and November 2014. The Spearman's rank correlation test was performed to verify the relationship between IFC and services. The main findings show the following: (1) There is a significant relationship between IFC and the development of new products and services aligned to customer needs; (2) There is a somewhat significant relationship between IFC and the quality of products and services provided in manufacturing; (3) No significant relationship exists between IFC and special services offered to VIP customers.","[Kanovska, Lucie] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Mkt & Int Trade, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic; [Tomaskova, Eva] Masaryk Univ, Fac Law, Dept Financial Law & Econ, Mkt & Publ Finance, Veveri 70, Brno 61180, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno,"Kanovska, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, Mkt & Int Trade, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",kanovska@fbm.vutbr.cz; eva.tomaskova@law.muni.cz,"Kanovska, Lucie/AGA-2051-2022; Tomaskova, Eva/D-3973-2014",,,,,,46,4,4,0,20,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

High unemployment rates of youth lead us to look for reasons and means to change this situation. However, university teachers in the entire world deal with students who do not care or who do not want to work every day. Therefore, this paper aims to present the results of intercultural study evaluating students' attitudes to job performance. The research design is based on Blanchard and Thacker's (2004) Human Performance model, which includes three main factors, namely i) Motivation, ii) Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes, and iii) Environment. The study provides insights on how students evaluate their skills, motivation and environment factors influencing their future performance in Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey, Iran, Portugal and Estonia. Totally 1355 respondents participated in the poll. The results confirm that students evaluate their task related skills, which are the most important for employers as the weakest. Basic and growth needs are the most important, and specific environment influences students more according to the study. In addition, cultural differnces among respective countries were highlighted. This survey can be useful for university teachers working with international groups in order to improve students' viewpoint on human performance at work within national and international context, and for employers to understand better new employees coming to work after graduation from universities.","[Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante] Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Glinska, Ewa] Bialystok Tech Univ, Ojca Tarasiuka St 2, PL-16001 Kleosin Bialystok, Poland; [Aslan, Imran] Bingol Univ, TR-12000 Bingol, Turkey; [Ramirez, Antonio Mihi] Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain",Kaunas University of Technology; Bingol University; University of Granada,"Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Gedimino St 50, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vilmante.kumpikaite@ktu.lt; e.glinska@pb.edu.pl; iaslan@bingol.edu.tr; amihi@ugr.es,"Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017; Aslan, İmran/B-1079-2016; Kumpikaitė-Valiūnienė, Vilmantė/D-3736-2016","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Kumpikaite-Valiuniene, Vilmante/0000-0002-8099-2737; ASLAN, IMRAN/0000-0001-5307-4474",,,,,37,2,4,0,18,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We provide the first evidence of the empirical power of the hypothesis in the Korean Professional Baseball League (KPBL). In a panel data set, team-level aggregation over years shows that fans of this league attend in ways consistent with the hypothesis at the level of game uncertainty and consecutive season uncertainty, but only the first is statistically significant. KPBL fans appear to just be looking for a good game. This is consistent with the nearly complete concentration of post-season participation among a very few teams outside of the major population centre in Seoul and a lack of local team identification among KPBL fans. Our work adds to the diversity of league structures in the competitive balance literature since talent levels in KPBL are the result of parent company advertising choices rather than geographic identification.

Applying an ordered logit regression model and controlling for gender, age, wealth, portfolio diversification and average stock holding period, this study provides empirical evidence that the investors with top results in national exams or the investors holding an academic degree trade stocks more actively. The opposite is true for the investors with no academic degree as they trade stocks less actively.

Because of this, an evolutionary process underlies most everything that characterizes human existence. This principle includes economics and markets.

Compared to students that receive no information about peer contributions, on average, students that receive information about the dollar value range of contributions at peer institutions contribute less while students that learn about the high percentage of students voting 'yes' on green fee programs at peer institutions contribute more.

These results suggest that information about participation rates can be more effective than information about dollar amounts in encouraging contributions to environmental initiatives.

Increasing presence of multinational companies with strongly internationalised organisational cultures and advanced diversity policies was expected to contribute to the change in the Slovak business environment and make it more sensitive towards different forms of diversity. This paper investigates whether the strong commitment to gender equality that many of these companies declare on the international level translates into the specific actions in their operations in Slovakia. To answer this question the paper analyses the sample of multinational companies selected from the Trend Top Ranking of 200 largest non-financial companies in Slovakia. Using the data from the publicly available sources such as companies' websites (both Slovak and international), Slovak Companies Register or recruitments ads, the paper evaluates their performance according to the set of criteria related to the gender equality. The preliminary outcomes show that while the multinationals tend to be leaders in areas such as introduction of work/family reconciliation measures, they do not perform considerably better in other areas such as representation of women in decision making bodies.","[Mitkova, L'udmila; Kottulova, Janka] Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Kottulová, J (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management, Odbojarov 10,POB 95, Bratislava 82005 25, Slovakia.",ludmila.mitkova@fm.uniba.sk; janka.kottulova@fm.uniba.sk,"Mitková, Ľudmila/AAF-9802-2019",,,,,,22,6,6,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1411,1418,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800174,0

To a slightly lesser extent, we also find size effects, firms scaling up current R&D or initiating additional projects.

The question of development has been in the front burner of every state in the international system. Oil extraction and processing as a development means for the Nigerian rental state produce a lot of genuine untoward externalities and costs socially, economically, and environmentally. Apart from the children, the most vulnerable are no doubt the womenfolk. This paper relies on social constructivism to provide explanation for the feminisation of oil-resource crisis in the Niger Delta, as this may not be adequately captured within the theoretical framework of any of the typical liberal and neo-liberal approaches. Even though the paper acknowledges that the women struggle for an equitable and distributive resource governance to bail the region out of resource curse contradiction has for the most part being peaceful, it raises concern over the long lifespan of their vulnerability as they are still much at the receiving end of the oil-crisis left-over, as well as the renewed post-amnesty conflicts in the region. With little or nothing to show by the Transnational Oil Companies (TOCs) in the form of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a social construct to mitigate oil resource governance crisis and its attendant negative socio-economic and environmental consequences with a view to restoring resource equity, and engender peace in the region, the feminisation of oil crisis in the region will continue without any end in sight at least in the foreseeable future. To avoid the likelihood that the feminisation takes the form of women employing their most powerful weaponry, it is required that the Nigerian rental state and its colluding TOCs should as a matter of urgency prioritise intervening actions. These should be such that are geared towards good oil resource governance with genuine concern for gender equality, popular participation, and resource distributive justice as regards oil extraction and processing in the region. In particular, the TOCs should refocus and reenergise their CSRs towards facilitating real economic activities for the local women to effectively draw their attention away from the oil struggle in the region.","[Ojakorotu, Victor; Idowu, Olutola Oluwole] North West Univ, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Mafikeng, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Ojakorotu, V (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Dept Polit & Int Relat, Mafikeng, South Africa.",Victor.Ojakorotu@nwu.ac.za,"olutola, oluwole O I/R-7023-2017",,,,,,27,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,213,222,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100024,0

The survey allowed identification of attitudes of students towards immigration, immigrants in the Czech Republic and, last but not least, the manifestation of intolerance and racism. Attitudes of respondents towards immigration with regard to the economy, society and culture are predominantly negative. There are also many cliches related to attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. The concerns of respondents with various categories of immigrants may be also linked to themes of racism and xenophobia.

The market is online, thus potentially open for any country in the world, but should apply to specific regulations and perceptions that vary among countries. In lending process the most important is the problem of asymmetric information and its consequences, thus the information and its disclosure is critical. Without legal disclosure and transparency requirements, the information and tools supporting the lending decision and procedures dealing with payment overdue are mostly dependent on platform organizers. The default risk falls on lenders, usually having limited proficiency in credit risk valuation and portfolio formation. The paper deals with lending or investment side, applying the main question: what are the information quality determinants when making the decision for P2P platform selection. P2P allows to act globally, but information provided should apply common requirements and standards and be equally understandable for geographically different lenders. As the result the information quality criteria are proposed, including web/platform, company related, borrower and loan type information, and then tested on Lithuanian and few European platfouns for comparison purposes.

There are costs and benefits for countries that decide to use the currency of another country or if they choose to belong to a monetary union. The main cost for a country when it is part of a monetary union is the loss of monetary policy, however if such country has credibility problems in monetary policy (high inflation in the past), this cost is significantly reduced or even it can become a benefit. Countries may choose to use another currency to import credibility (Dollarization or Euroisation), belonging to a monetary union or to create central banks with credibility. There are economies with anchors currencies, that is, economies with credible central banks (with inflation controlled for several years), while on the other hand there are economies that have no anchor currencies and therefore can choose to import credibility from economies with anchor currencies. The aim of this paper is to apply some theoretical elements of the theory of optimum currency areas to Balkans countries. We start to consider the idea that there are anchor currencies and non-anchor currencies on the economies of the world. Starting from the above, it is considered that the anchor currency for the countries of the Balkans is the euro, due to the credibility that the European Central Bank has acquired since its creation to the present. Furthermore, we propose to evaluate the relevance for Balkan countries choose one of the following three options: keep their national currencies, create a new regional currency or to use the euro (Euroisation or to be part of the euro area). To assess the relevance of any of the three options above, we estimate the co-movement of the economies of the Balkans with the eurozone and with themselves, besides we analyse the credibility of central banks in the region (the record in the inflation in the countries of the region), trade flows of the countries of the region with the euro-zone and among themselves, and finally we estimate a political proximity variable (coincidence of voting in the UN General Assembly).","[Saucedo Acosta, Edgar Juan] Univ Veracruz, AVe Luis Castelazo S-N, Xalapa 91190, Veracruz, Mexico; [Diaz Pedroza, Jesus] Autonomous Metropolitan Univ Iztapalapa, Ave San Rafael Atlixco 186, Mexico City 09340, DF, Mexico",Universidad Veracruzana; Universidad Autonoma Metropolitana - Mexico,"Acosta, EJS (通讯作者)，Univ Veracruz, AVe Luis Castelazo S-N, Xalapa 91190, Veracruz, Mexico.",esaucedo@uv.mx; jdp@xanum.uam.mx,"Saucedo-Acosta, Edgar J./AAS-3632-2020","Saucedo-Acosta, Edgar J./0000-0002-0373-7804",,,,,23,2,2,0,1,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING STREET, NEW YORK, NY 10013, UNITED STATES",1431-1933,,978-3-319-40322-9; 978-3-319-40321-2,CONTRIB ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,57,74,,10.1007/978-3-319-40322-9_4,0.0,,,18,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8CB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392198500004,0

It provides a novel empirical analysis of the determinants of institutional differences and the diffusion of institutional innovations across societies. A critical discussion of the recent literature is presented, documenting how economic and political outcomes are affected by traits that have deep historical and geographic roots and that are passed on from generation to generation. The hypothesis is presented that intergenerationally transmitted traits affect current outcomes by acting as barriers to the diffusion of technological and institutional innovations: a longer historical separation time between populations creates greater barriers. Hence, the degree of ancestral distance between a given society and the society at the frontier of institutional and technological development should be associated with higher barriers and lower adoption. This hypothesis is tested empirically with cross-country data. Empirical findings provide substantial support for the proposition that long-term historical distance from the frontier affects both current institutions and development.","[Spolaore, Enrico] Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA; [Wacziarg, Romain] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Tufts University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Spolaore, E (通讯作者)，Tufts Univ, Dept Econ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.",,"Wacziarg, Romain/F-1110-2011","Wacziarg, Romain/0000-0002-2394-7593",,,,,0,10,10,0,0,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,147,166,,,,,,20,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200009,0

China's rising corporate debt is mainly attributable to three factors: worsening capital efficiency, worsening corporate profitability and high funding costs. Based on a dynamic recursive model developed in the paper, we simulate the trajectories of China 's corporate debt-to-GDP ratio, and find that if China fails to reverse the current trends in capital efficiency, corporate profitability and financing costs, China 's nonfinancial corporate debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to rise without converging to a limit. Against most economists' intuition, given the current trends of changes in parameters, higher economic growth will not help China to escape the corporate debt trap. On the contrary, it will make China 's corporate debt problem even worse. To avert a corporate debt crisis, China needs to speed up the structural reform and change the growth paradigm so as to enhance capital efficiency and firms' profitability, while reducing firms' financing costs.","[Yu, Yongding; Lu, Ting] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Yu, YD; Lu, T (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yuyongding@126.com; luting@cass.org.cn,,"Yu, Yongding/0000-0002-5676-8508",,,,,16,5,5,3,37,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JAN-FEB,2016,24.0,1,,,,,1,17,,10.1111/cwe.12141,0.0,,,17,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7VF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373001200001,0

The objective is to present the measuring of innovation performance as it is implemented in today's Czech business environment. It begins with a comprehensive theory and the definition of essential terms. The theoretical part is followed by the analysis of the current state of the issue from the perspective of enterprises in the Czech Republic. The analysis consists of four own primary questionnaire surveys. The research outputs reveal weaknesses in current approaches to innovation effectiveness measurement. Our enterprises use all possible means to increase productivity and achieve operational excellence. However, they tend to neglect the important area of research and development. It has been proven, with help of questionnaire surveys, that many enterprises still do not measure innovation performance despite the importance of innovation as an engine of growth. Only a few organisations appear to have an effective system for measuring their overall innovation performance.","[Zizlavsky, Ondrej] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Zizlavsky, O (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Brno, Czech Republic.",zizlavsky@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Zizlavsky, Ondrej/O-4005-2015",,Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky [13-20123P],Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),This work was supported by Grantova Agentura Ceske Republiky [Grant Number 13-20123P],,80,22,24,3,45,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

It examines how traders process and learn from market information and how the learning affects limit order markets. It is found that, measured by the average usage of different group of market information, trading rules under the learning become stationary in the long run. Also informed traders pay more attention to the last transaction sign while uninformed traders pay more attention to technical rules. Learning of uninformed traders improves market information efficiency, but not necessarily when informed traders learn. Opposite to the learning of informed traders, learning makes uninformed traders submit less aggressive limit orders and more market orders. Furthermore private values can have significant impact in the short run, but not in the long run. One implication is that the probability of informed trading (PIN) is positively related to the volatility and the bid-ask spread. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

I examine the household's welfare in the equilibrium contract, and find that, first, under sufficiently rapid endowment growth, the presence of uncertainty in endowment may improve the household's welfare through relaxation of its commitment problem, and second, regardless of the endowment growth rate, the household's welfare is nonincreasing in the persistence of endowment. Numerical analysis suggests that welfare improvement from uncertainty may occur under reasonable parameters.

Based on the mixed logit demand estimation we find that consumer valuation of FTTH broadband in 2013 increased over time, while ADSL lost attractiveness relative to FTTH and in absolute terms, which suggests that consumers increasingly care about the speed of connection offered by FTTH. Consumer surplus increased substantially due to ongoing transition of consumers from less valued quadruple play tariffs with ADSL to more valued ones with FTTH. We also find that for quadruple play subscribers mobile data is complementary to fixed broadband access, which suggests that these consumers use Internet access via mobile data to sample online content but complete their online activity using fixed Internet access at home. On the other hand, mobile voice usage is a substitute to fixed broadband access and consumers reduce their voice consumption once they get a broadband connection. We also find that there are substantial switching costs between tariffs which, other things being equal, greatly decrease consumer surplus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

By collecting relevant variable data in 1978-2012, financial deepening is selected as the transition variable to construct the STR Model which could reflect the dynamic change of urbanizational economic growth effect. The result shows that urbanizational economic growth effect should present the characteristics of threshold and could be described with non-linear Smooth Transition Model (LSTR1). Meanwhile, the urbanizational economic growth effect should reveal asymmetry, in which the research findings show contemporary financial deepening (FISt) as a factor. Specifically, the linear feature appears when the FISt is lower than 0.3792 (before 1990), while it reveals non-linearity when the FISt exceeds 0.3792 (after 1990), and the non-linearity becomes the major factor in the urbanizational economic growth effect after 1990.","[Li, Xinguang; Hu, Ridong] Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Li, Xinguang] Wuyi Univ, Sch Business, Nanping 354300, Fujian, Peoples R China","Huaqiao University; Wuyi University, Fujian","Li, XG (通讯作者)，Huaqiao Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Quanzhou 362021, Fujian, Peoples R China.",lixinguang001@163.com; j_rdhu@hqu.edu.cn,,,Sponsored project of innovation base for graduate education of Quantitative Economics in Fujian Province; Ministry of Education [11JYA790048]; Fujian Province Soft Science Research project [2012R0058]; Fujian Province Social Science Research project [FJ2015 C241]; Fujian Province Department of Education [JA11273S],Sponsored project of innovation base for graduate education of Quantitative Economics in Fujian Province; Ministry of Education; Fujian Province Soft Science Research project; Fujian Province Social Science Research project; Fujian Province Department of Education,Funded project: Sponsored project of innovation base for graduate education of Quantitative Economics in Fujian Province; Humanities and Sociology Research funded project (11JYA790048) from the Ministry of Education; Fujian Province Soft Science Research project (2012R0058); Fujian Province Social Science Research project (FJ2015 C241); Fujian Province Department of Education project (JA11273S).

Using a rich panel dataset with 42 countries, 62 manufacturing sectors over 16 years (1996-2011) and covering 60% of global merchandise trade, we estimate the short-run effects of sector-level energy price asymmetry on trade. We find that changes in relative energy prices have a statistically significant but very small impact on imports. On average, a 10% increase in the energy price difference between two country-sectors increases imports by 0.2%. The impact is larger for energy-intensive sectors. Even in these sectors, however, the magnitude of the effect is such that changes in energy price differences across time explain less than 0.01% of the variation in trade flows. Simulations based on our model predict that a (sin)40-65/tCO(2) price of carbon in the EU ETS would increase Europe's imports from the rest of the world by less than 0.05% and decrease exports by 02%.

When the risk-free rate is low, compulsory licensing is shown unambiguously to increase consumer surplus. Compulsory licensing has an ambiguous effect on total welfare, but is more likely to increase total welfare in industries that are naturally less competitive. Finally, compulsory licensing is shown to be an effective policy to protect competition per se. The paper also demonstrates the robustness of these results to alternative settings of R&D competition and discusses their significance for the debate on compulsory licensing in the context of standard-setting organisations and pharmaceutical trade.","[Seifert, Jacob] Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Seifert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Sch Social Sci Econ, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",jacob.seifert@manchester.ac.uk,,"Seifert, Jacob/0000-0002-6188-0748",UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/J500136/1]; Royal Economic Society [RESJFS2014]; Economic and Social Research Council [1071658] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Royal Economic Society; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"I am grateful to the Editor, Michael Crew, and two referees for constructive feedback during the review process.

We analyze the effect of negative stereotypes about the abilities of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds on efforts and outcomes in teams. A project's success depends on the abilities and efforts of agents from different backgrounds. Under simultaneous effort contribution, the stereotype lowers efforts of all agents and the project's success chance. When the principal assigns the disadvantaged/stereotyped agent as leader in effort contribution, the effect of the stereotype is mitigated and the project's success chance is the highest; this also maximizes the principal's expected payoff. Although the principal offers symmetric incentives, the stereotyped agent often exerts higher effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, we formally discuss under what assumptions the traditional (OIS) estimates of the learning curve can deliver meaningful predictions in IAMs. We argue that the most problematic of them are the absence of any effect of technology cost on its demand (reverse causality) and the ability of IAMs to predict all determinants of cumulative capacity. Next, we show that these assumptions can be relaxed by modifying the traditional econometric method used to estimate the learning curve. The new estimation approach presented in this paper is robust to the two problems identified but preserves the reduced form character of the learning curve. Finally, we provide new estimates of learning curves for wind turbines and PV technologies which are tailored for use in IAMs. Our results suggest that the learning rate should be revised upward for solar PV. Our estimate of learning rate for wind technology is almost the same as the traditional OIS estimates. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the Survey of Consumer Finances from 1983 to 2010, I find that after robust gains in the 1980s and 1990s, pension wealth experienced a marked slowdown in growth from 2001 to 2007 and then fell in absolute terms from 2007 to 2010. Median augmented wealth (the sum of net worth, pensions, and Social Security wealth) advanced slower than median net worth from 1983 to 2007 and its inequality rose more, as DB wealth fell off. However, from 2007 to 2010, the opposite occurred. While median wealth plummeted by 41 percent and inequality spiked by 0.032 Gini points, median augmented wealth fell by only 21 percent and its Gini coefficient rose by only 0.009 points.

The incumbent knows the entrant's quality. The entrant's quality is assumed to be exogenously determined by nature, or endogenously chosen by the entrant itself. The exogenous model reveals the entrant's high price can signal its high quality, but entry deterrence occurs for the high quality entrant. Interestingly, the incumbent being informed of the entrant's quality generates an additional separating equilibrium in which the incumbent charges a higher price when the entrant's quality is relatively low, and a lower price when the entrant's quality is relatively high. Surprisingly, entry is facilitated. On the contrary to the exogenous model, the endogenous model result shows that entry deterrence still occurs for the high quality entrant with the incumbent being informed of the entrant's quality. However, in both settings, we find that the incumbent could not take advantage of its inside information of the entrant's quality.","Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Zhejiang University,"Wu, FL (通讯作者)，Zhejiang Univ, China Acad West Reg Dev, 866 Yuhangtang Rd, Hangzhou 310058, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",wufulan09@gmail.com,,,,,,,15,0,0,0,24,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

A unique feature of China's institutional setups is that local leaders are often moved from one locality to another. This feature allows us to compare leaders across cities. Adopting the decomposition method previously applied to linked employer-employee data, we find that leaders have significantly different levels of abilities to promote local economic growth. We also study how leaders' personal abilities affect their chances of promotion. We find that personal abilities become more important as a leader gets older, and this effect is most pronounced around the median age in the sample. Those results remain robust when we conduct full-information maximum-likelihood estimation of a system of equations consisting of both the growth and the promotion equations.","[Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Muyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, China Publ Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Muyang] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Publ Econ & Adm, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Zhang, MY (通讯作者)，Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, China Publ Finance Inst, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",zhang.muyang@mail.shufe.edu.cn,"ZHANG, MUYANG/J-9999-2019","ZHANG, MUYANG/0000-0001-8819-146X",National Social Science Foundation of China [09ZD020]; Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science [2014EJB004],National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science,"We thank Yuen-Yuen Ang, Michael Carter, Steven Durlauf, Ethan Kaplan, Karl Scholz, Li-An Zhou, three anonymous referees and seminar participants in Peking University, Shangdong University, Stanford University, the University of California-Davis, the University of Chicago, the University of Washington, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Third Doctoral Student Forum (Xiamen, December 2011), the Eleventh China Economic Annual Meeting (Shanghai, December 2011), the Second Annual CUHK-Fudan-Tsinghua Conference on the Chinese Economy (Beijing, December 2011), and the First Conference on Organizational Economics (Beijing, June 2012), and the 2015 AEA Meetings (Boston, January 2015) for their helpful comments.

In this paper, we apply economic modeling methods to longevity risk securitization, which is now regarded by pension and insurance industries as a solution to the problem. Specifically, we model the trade of a longevity security as a two-player bargaining game, and use Nash's bargaining solution to determine the outcome of it. Our work not only offers an alternative method for pricing longevity securities, but also reveals several properties about the market for longevity securities. First, a trade would occur if the longevity security is an effective hedging instrument, and the trade would benefit all agents involved. Second, a trade of longevity risk can reduce pension plans' bankruptcy risk, safeguarding the financial security of pension plan members. Finally, compared to the competitive equilibrium, Nash's bargaining solution yields higher trading prices. Therefore, as the market becomes more competitive, pension plans may hedge longevity risk at a lower cost. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We investigate the role of occupational mobility on the effects of trade shocks on wage inequality in a dynamic, structural econometric model of worker adjustment Each worker in our specification can switch either industry, occupation, or both, paying a time-varying cost to do so in a rational-expectations optimizing environment. We also specify a novel model of offshoring based on task-by-task comparative advantage that collapses to a very simple form for simulation. We find that the costs of switching industry and occupation are both high, and of similar magnitude. In simulations we find that a worker's industry of employment is much more important than either the worker's occupation or skill class in determining whether or not she is harmed by a trade shock, but occupation is crucial in determining who is harmed by an offshoring shock (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Artuc, Erhan] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [McLaren, John] Univ Virginia, Dept Econ, Charlottesville, VA 22904 USA",The World Bank; University of Virginia,"Artuç, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",eartuc@worldbank.org; jmclaren@virginia.edu,,"Artuc, Erhan/0000-0001-9055-7934",Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK); Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA); Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia; government of Norway through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Sweden through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government United Kingdom through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)); Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA)(Turkish Academy of Sciences); Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia; government of Norway through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Sweden through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government United Kingdom through the Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; UK Department for International Development (DFID) through the Strategic Research Partnership on Economic Development,"We are grateful for the financial support of the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK), Turkish Academy of Sciences (TUBA), and the Bankard Fund for Political Economy at the University of Virginia.

These new reference forecasts are free from additional assumptions on demographic and economic variables, often used in most reference forecasts. Instead, we only rely on the properties of the underlying stochastic process for global CO2 emissions that are, in this sense, closer to fundamentals. Our reference forecasts are clearly below the levels proposed by other reference scenarios available in the literature. This is important, as it suggests that the ongoing policy goals are actually easier to reach than what is implied by the standard reference scenarios. Having lower and more realistic reference emissions projections gives a truer assessment of the policy efforts that are needed, and highlights the lower costs involved in mitigation efforts, thereby maximizing the likelihood of more widespread environmental policy efforts.

The paper, first, outlines the two established approaches to study the value of art. The economics of the arts approach in which economic analysis is used to analyze the arts is the first of those established approaches. The other established approach is the art and commerce approach in which the relative position of the arts in society and in particular its relation to the commercial and industrial world is analyzed. The valuation approach takes elements of these two established approaches, but focuses explicitly on processes of valuation of the arts and cultural goods on markets as well as within bureaucracies, organizations, among experts, peers and other communities. Central to the valuation approach is the notion that the study of market prices is not sufficient to establish the value of cultural goods. Contributors to this emerging approach analyze valuation processes in and outside markets, the norms and conventions used to value the arts, and the role of intermediaries who are able to deal with competing notions and justifications of value.","Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Dekker, E (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Hist Culture & Commun, Postbus 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",e.dekker@eshcc.eur.nl,,"Dekker, Erwin/0000-0002-2316-2403",,,,,74,17,19,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

We use a highly disaggregated (six-digit level of the harmonized systemHSclassification) bilateral measure of market access to compare tariffs applied in 1996 and 2006, which includes the timing of the Uruguay Round and episodes of bilateral liberalization. Our econometric estimations consider impacts of tariff cuts on three components of the trade margins: extensive margin of entry (new trade relationships at the product-destination level), extensive margin of exit (disappearance of existing relationships) and intensive margin of trade (deepening existing relationships). Our main estimates indicate that a reduction of bilateral applied tariffs of 1 percentage point increases the extensive margin of entry by 0.1% and the intensive one by 2.09%, while it reduces the extensive margin of exit by 0.25%.","[Disdier, Anne-Celia] Univ Paris 01, Paris Sch Econ, F-75013 Paris, France; [Fontagne, Lionel] CEPII, F-75013 Paris, France; [Disdier, Anne-Celia] INRA, Paris Sch Econ, F-75014 Paris, France; [Mimouni, Mondher] Int Trade Ctr UNCTAD WTO, CH-1211 Geneva 10, Switzerland",heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne; Paris School of Economics; Paris School of Economics; INRAE,"Disdier, AC (通讯作者)，INRA, Paris Sch Econ, 48 Blvd Jourdan, F-75014 Paris, France.",lionel.fontagne@univ-paris1.fr,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-JSH1-0002-01]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-JSH1-0002] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"The authors are grateful to two anonymous referees for valuable comments and suggestions.

Our theory predicts that the scope for trade widens and international specialisation intensifies as incomes grow and wealthier consumers raise the quality of their consumption baskets. This implies that comparative advantages strengthen gradually over the path of development as a by-product of the process of quality upgrading. The evolution of comparative advantages leads to specific trade patterns that change over the growth path, by linking richer importers to more specialised exporters. We provide empirical support for this prediction, showing that the share of imports originating from exporters exhibiting a comparative advantage in a specific product correlates positively with the importer's GDP per head.

We find that charitable lenders on a large peer-to-peer online microfinance website appear to favor more attractive, lighter-skinned, and less obese borrowers. Borrowers who appear more needy, honest and creditworthy also receive funding more quickly. These effects are quantitatively significant: Borrowers with beauty one standard deviation above average are treated as though they are requesting approximately 11% less money. Statistical discrimination does not appear to explain our findings, as these borrower attributes are uncorrelated with loan performance or borrower enterprise performance. The evidence suggests implicit bias could explain our findings: more experienced lenders, who may rely less on implicit attitudes, appear to exhibit less bias than inexperienced lenders.

The results indicate that the negative impact of FTA concerns on its acceptance appears to be smaller than the positive impact of FTA expectations. We also conduct an opinion mining analysis to investigate individuals' feelings, opinions, and sentiments on the Korea-China ETA and test the hypothesized relationships (Study 2). Further, this research analyzes public opinions on the Korea-China FTA in three sensitive product categories-cars, agricultural and marine products, and electronics (Study 3). The number of individuals who support the Korea-China ETA is significantly greater than that of individuals who oppose it, regardless of their perception of Chinese products.

Exploiting the gradual change in the opening times of shops across states and using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel, difference-in-differences estimates indicate an average increase in the employment probability, driven by a rise in the likelihood of working marginal part-time hours. Workers in small firms are likely to experience a reduction of their propensity to work. For individuals facing high family-related, supply-side constraints, the change in shop opening hours has opposing effects on employment - positive on lower and negative on upper parts of the hours distribution. Overall, the deregulation is estimated to have raised the likelihood of working fewer hours than desired by the workers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Countries such as China are no longer willing to allow the USA to exercise this extortionate behavior. The potential geopolitical implications of a US dollar decline are immense. The USA would lose its privileged seigniorage position and with that the ability to achieve permanently higher returns on foreign assets than the returns paid to foreigners who invest in the USA. The global economy is already close to operating with three regional exchange rate anchors: the US dollar; the euro; and, increasingly, the renminbi. Hence, the transition to a tripolar system could occur sooner than many assert. Nevertheless, given the importance of financial deepening and integration in the internationalization of currencies, any shift will still be gradual.","[Ryan, John] Hugel Inst, St Edmunds Coll, Res Fellow, Cambridge, England; [Ryan, John] St Edmunds Coll, Von Hugel Inst, Cambridge, England",University of Cambridge; University of Cambridge,"Ryan, J (通讯作者)，St Edmunds Coll, Von Hugel Inst, Cambridge, England.",jmtr2@cam.ac.uk,,,,,,,30,8,9,0,30,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,NOV-DEC,2015,23.0,6,,,,,44,55,,10.1111/cwe.12135,0.0,,,12,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CX9RV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366043900003,0

The entrepreneur activity in each region depends not only on its own endowment but the entrepreneurship environment may be exerted some influence. Regional Spanish data are used to obtain evidence about this relationship using a Spatial Durbin model to embed the spatial dimension. The results reveal that both the direct and indirect effects are relatively small. Further, if unemployment increases in a region, self-employment decreases. However, if unemployment grows in neighbouring regions, incentives for entering self-employment increase, implying that there is a refugee' effect (self-employment as an answer to the lack of wage employment).","[Cueto, Begona; Mayor, Matias] Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain; [Suarez, Patricia] Univ Oviedo, Dept Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo; University of Oviedo,"Cueto, B (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, E-33006 Oviedo, Spain.",bcueto@uniovi.es,"Suárez, Patricia/F-2401-2016; Suárez, Patricia/GLN-5874-2022; Mayor, Matías/A-1216-2010; Cueto, Begoña/L-5017-2014","Suárez, Patricia/0000-0002-9533-2846; Suárez, Patricia/0000-0002-9533-2846; Mayor, Matías/0000-0001-6466-8884; Cueto, Begoña/0000-0001-6788-8532",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [ECO2009-08061],Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain(Spanish Government),Authors would like to thank the financial support by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad of Spain [project ECO2009-08061].,,19,27,33,0,67,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

But to what extent is competitive behavior in the lab associated with field choices and outcomes? We address this question in a setting of entrepreneurship, where we combine lab evidence on competitiveness with field evidence on investment, employment, profit, and sales. We find strong evidence that competitiveness in the lab is positively associated with competitive choices in the field (investment and employment) and weaker, but suggestive, evidence of a positive link to successful field outcomes (profit and sales). Other non-cognitive skills measured in the lab, including risk- and time preferences and confidence, and cognitive skills are less consistently associated with the field variables.

We report the results of an experiment that tests whether a simple, computer-based HIV risk game leads to better understanding of the relationship between HIV-risk and age among low-income South African adolescents than a version of the traditional brochure approach to dispensing information does. Our results are striking. The randomly assigned treatment group, which receives repeated doses of information about the link between age and HIV-risk as feedback to their own responses to simple questions about relative HIV-risk, is significantly more likely to correctly identify which of a pair of hypothetical men or women of different ages is more likely to have HIV than the control group. Subjects in the treatment group answer, on average, 1.65 times as many questions about HIV risk and age correctly as those in the control group. We also find that subjects' (particularly female subjects') beliefs about HIV risk among women are less accurate than their beliefs about HIV risk among men.

By allowing temporary contracts to be either renewed or converted into permanent contracts, we obtain new theoretical insights into the market equilibrium. The conversion rate is itself an incentive device that acts as a substitute for the wage, and firms pay a wage differential in favour of permanent workers. The model also predicts that even if firms hire exclusively under flexible contracts, dualism arises as a feature internal to each firm and, consequently, as a market property.","[Di Cintio, Marco; Grassi, Emanuele] Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy",University of Salento,"Di Cintio, M (通讯作者)，Univ Salento, Lecce, Italy.",,"Grassi, Emanuele/H-1707-2011; Di Cintio, Marco/M-7881-2015","Grassi, Emanuele/0000-0002-0191-4125; Di Cintio, Marco/0000-0002-5295-7491",,,,,35,4,4,0,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,OCT,2015,82.0,328,,,,,790,812,,10.1111/ecca.12151,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DA9LR,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368130800008,0

The policymaker's ability and the action he takes are unobserved, but the principal draws inferences about the policymaker's ability based on the resulting outcome before deciding whether to retain him. When the crisis is potentially catastrophic, it is in the principal's interest for the policymaker to take preventative action. However, when the crisis is sufficiently rare, he fails to do so. Instead, the policymaker directs his efforts toward activities that enhance the principal's welfare when the crisis doesn't materialize. This distortion is driven by the policymaker's desire to be retained together with the inability of the principal to observe the policymaker's action. Our framework provides a novel explanation for why policymakers often fail to prepare effectively for rare disasters and other potential crises and contributes to a growing literature on electorally induced distortions in multi-task problems.

This paper suggests that income uncertainty is not an important motive for saving, although households do have other precautionary reasons to save. Using a question from the Survey of Consumer Finances that asks how much households want for precautionary purposes, this paper shows that expressed household preferences, and liquid savings, are much lower than predicted by standard modeling assumptions. Households rarely list unemployment as a reason to save. Perceived income uncertainty does not affect liquid savings or precautionary preferences. Neither does being in an occupation with higher income volatility. Instead, households seem very concerned with expenditure shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A structural VAR model is estimated that shows that a positive shock to economic policy uncertainty in China has a delayed negative effect on global oil production, real oil prices and real stock market returns. Shocks to oil market-specific demand significantly raise China's economic policy uncertainty and reduce the real stock market returns. As measured by a spillover index, the interdependence between these variables has been rising since 2003 as China's influence in the oil market has increased.

To find the adjustment behavior on capital structure depending on macroeconomic conditions, we use dynamic partial adjustment model to estimate adjustment speeds toward targets. As the data analyzed in the study, we use non-financial firms listed in the Korean stock exchange. Through the empirical test, we find evidence that is consistent with Hackbarth, Miao and Morellec (2006) and Cook and Tang (2010)'s arguments that firms tend to adjust faster their leverage toward target level in economic expansion.

In this work we relax this assumption, allowing fractional integration in hours and productivity. We find that the sign and magnitude of the estimated responses depend crucially on the identification assumptions employed. Although the responses of hours recovered with short-run (SR) restrictions are positive in all data sets, long-run (LR) identification results in negative, although sometimes not significant responses. We check the validity of these assumptions with the Sims procedure, concluding that both LR and SR are appropriate to recover responses in a fractionally integrated VAR. However, the application of the LR scheme always results in an increase in sampling uncertainty. Results also show that even the negative responses found in the data could still be compatible with real business cycle models.","[Lovcha, Yuliya] Univ Navarra, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain; [Perez-Laborda, Alejandro] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Tarragona, Spain; [Perez-Laborda, Alejandro] CREIP, Tarragona, Spain",University of Navarra; Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Lovcha, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, E-31080 Pamplona, Spain.",yuliya.lovcha@gmail.com,"perez-laborda, alejandro/O-1459-2019; Lovcha, Yuliya/AAA-8833-2019","perez-laborda, alejandro/0000-0003-4247-598X; Lovcha, Yuliya/0000-0002-0481-7785",,,,,25,8,9,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

This paper studies a multi-region equilibrium model with frictional migration. Idiosyncratic preference shocks, a mobility cost, and imperfectly directed migration lead to slow worker reallocation in response to changes in local conditions. This leads to a dependence of local house prices on the history of labor market shocks. The model accounts for the comovements of unemployment and rental and house prices with gross migration observed in a panel of U.S. cities. Structural estimation reveals a high mobility cost for unemployed workers and a low probability of directed migration. Both of these imply that regional reallocation has a limited importance for the aggregate labor market and that the effects of housing markets on reallocation are small. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

So the question is: Should regulators limit the size of banks? To answer this question, regulators need to assess the potential costs of such regulations. If big banks enjoy substantial scale economies (i.e., average costs get lower as bank size increases), limiting the size of banks through regulations may be inefficient and likely to reduce social welfare. However, the literature offers conflicting results regarding the existence of economies of scale for the biggest US banks. We contribute to this literature using a novel approach to estimating nonparametric measures of scale economies and total factor productivity (TFP) growth. For US commercial banks, we find that around 73 % of the top one hundred banks, 98 % of medium and small banks, and seven of the top ten biggest banks by asset size exhibit substantial economies of scale. Likewise, we find that scale economies contribute positively and significantly to their TFP growth. The existence of substantial scale economies raises an important challenge for regulators to pursue size limit regulations.","[Restrepo-Tobon, Diego] EAFIT Univ, Medellin, Colombia; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] SUNY Binghamton, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Kumbhakar, Subal C.] Univ Stavanger, Sch Business, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Sun, Kai] Univ Salford, Salford M5 4NT, Lancs, England",Universidad EAFIT; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; Universitetet i Stavanger; University of Salford,"Restrepo-Tobón, D (通讯作者)，EAFIT Univ, Carrera 49 7 Sur 50, Medellin, Colombia.",drestr16@eafit.edu.co; kkar@binghamton.edu; ksun1@binghamton.edu,"Sun, Kai/AAX-1669-2020","Sun, Kai/0000-0002-5245-0439; RESTREPO-TOBON, DIEGO/0000-0002-9054-3847","Colombian Fulbright Commission; Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias); EAFIT University","Colombian Fulbright Commission; Colombian Administrative Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (Colciencias)(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); EAFIT University","We would like to thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for their helpful and insightful comments.

Specifically, I develop and test the hypothesis that when there is greater contribution heterogeneity in a particular round, average contributions will decrease more between the current round and the next round, all else being equal. I find strong support for my hypothesis with partner and stranger matching, and with and without belief elicitation about the average contributions of others. When beliefs are elicited, changes in average contributions tend to be positively associated with changes in average beliefs, but the relationship is not as strong as the one between changes in average contributions and contribution heterogeneity. In order to determine the driving force underlying the empirical relationship between contribution heterogeneity and changes in average contributions, I simulate contributions under different counterfactual assumptions about belief heterogeneity and contribution preference heterogeneity using one of the data sets. I compare the simulation models in terms of how well each matches the data. The simulations indicate that contribution preference heterogeneity is a stronger factor underlying the dynamics of contributions than belief heterogeneity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Many consumers, especially in younger age groups, consider that is normal not to pay in order to listen to music yet artists have intellectual property rights. The reconciliation of these two features of the music market is increasingly difficult within the traditional business model of the music industry. This paper uses an original survey of artists whose music is diffused freely on the online platform Jamendo (the largest of its kind) and which uses Creative Commons (CC) licences rather than copyright firstly to examine why so many artists would adhere to such an approach and secondly what the artists feel about CC. Age is clearly a factor in the choice of CC licence type, as well as whether artists derive income from their music. The choice of CC over copyright is also found to be related to its greater flexibility, its role in the development of musical creation and its function as means of sharing. It can be seen as a basis for an alternative business model in the music industry, in which sales of albums no longer constitute the main source of artists' remuneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, I assess the claim that the Great Recession has had a disproportionate impact on men. I begin by examining the position and status of women and men in the U.S. economy today in terms of labor force participation, occupational placement, relative wages, and financial responsibility for children. I discuss how women's (especially women of color's) economic status has rendered them particularly vulnerable to the impact of the Great Recession. I critique the notion of the he-cession and expose the faulty, ahistorical assumptions on which it is based. Finally, I examine the impact of state and local austerity on public sector employment and speculate as to the implications of austerity for the relative economic standing of women of various races/ethnicities.","Sarah Lawrence Coll, Econ, Bronxville, NY 10708 USA",Sarah Lawrence College,"Christensen, K (通讯作者)，Sarah Lawrence Coll, Econ, 1 Mead Way, Bronxville, NY 10708 USA.",kchristensen@sarahlawrence.edu,,,,,,,68,14,19,0,16,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Two components of the electricity retail price are expected to be influenced by the feed-in tariff regulation: the incentive to those firms producing electricity from renewable energy sources and the wholesale price of electricity. In this study we analyze the effects that the feed-in tariff regulation has on the electricity retail price for industrial consumers. We estimate the relative intensity of the impact of the cost of support electricity generation under the feed-in tariff and the electricity wholesale price on the Spanish industrial retail price. Special attention is devoted to technology-specific considerations, as well as short and long run effects. The results show that there is not a strong link between the retail and wholesale market for Spanish industrial consumers. Moreover, the results indicate that an increase of solar generation leads to a higher increase in the industrial retail price than in the case of a proportional increase of wind generation. This suggests that, when evaluating the feed-in tariff regulation impact on the retail price, the cost of incentives effect prevails over the wholesale price effect, and this is stronger for solar than for wind generation.

Brazil's large, diversified industrial base was painfully constructed over the course of the twentieth century. A major and sustained political realignment, which began in 2003, has resulted in two essential thrusts in development policy: (i) a growth with equity strategy that has dramatically reduced poverty and inequality; and (ii) a state-led industrial policy designed to upgrade manufacturing and direct the accumulation process toward specific sectors, highlighting and consolidating the National Innovation System (NIS). Nonetheless, as a result of the commodity boom that swept through Latin America, Brazil's natural resource sector achieved outsized growth from 2002 to 2012. One result has been a shift toward resource intensive activities and a broad opening to low-cost Chinese manufactures. Utilizing an institutionalist framework and method, this article analyzes the cohesion of the NIS and the emergence of the deindustrialization debate. Also, it assesses the instrumental nature of the growth with equity strategy. The article hypothesizes the viability of an endogenous neo-developmentalist strategy, while acknowledging the emergence of fundamental exogenous forces and structural ceremonial/institutional factors that have impeded the consolidation of a Brazilian social structure of accumulation.","[Cypher, James M.] Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Doctoral Program Dev Studies UAED, Econ, Zacatecas, Mexico",Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas,"Cypher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Doctoral Program Dev Studies UAED, Econ, Zacatecas, Mexico.",,,,,,,,78,5,7,2,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

These mechanisms generalize the parametric rationing mechanisms (Young, 1987), some of which date back to the Babylonian Talmud. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

On the basis of the Fourier model, we find that adjusting the monetary data for commercial sweeps leads to higher average estimates for many elasticities of substitution over the sample period. The average value of an elasticity capturing substitution between currency and demand deposits and other checkable deposits nearly doubled when the elasticity was estimated using data that was adjusted for commercial sweeps as compared with unadjusted data. We also find that the share of commercial sweeps relative to total demand deposits eventually ended up lower following each of the past two recessions than it was leading up to them.

In this paper we explore long-run nonlinear relationship between stock price and goods price. Our sample consists of 19 OECD countries; all or some of these countries have been studied before with the findings of linear cointegration between the stock index and goods price index. Based on unit root tests and linear cointegration test, we apply threshold cointegration tests, Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration test and panel VAR method. With all these econometric methods we arrive at heterogeneous findings as follows: two countries have linear cointegration, five countries have threshold cointegration, nine countries do not have any cointegration and finally two countries provide inconclusive results. Estimates of Fisher coefficient provided by linear and nonlinear cointegration methods, which range between 1.27 and 1.86, are consistent with previous studies. Impulse response analysis from panel VAR for countries having no cointegrating relation shows that shock to inflation produces negative response in stock return, which supports findings of earlier studies.","[Hassan, Kamrul; Hoque, Ariful] Murdoch Univ, Perth, WA 6155, Australia; [Rao, Ananth] Univ Dubai, Deira, U Arab Emirates",Murdoch University; University of Dubai,"Hoque, A (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, 90 South St, Perth, WA 6155, Australia.",a.hoque@murodch.edu.au,"Hassan, Kamrul/AAE-6769-2020; Hoque, Ariful/ABB-2497-2020; Rao, Ananth/A-8154-2016","Rao, Ananth/0000-0002-8110-5423; Hoque, Ariful/0000-0001-8369-6653",,,,,34,5,5,0,16,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

In much of economic theory, the determination of interest rate spreads is analytically distinct from the determination of the overall level of interest rates. But from a Keynesian perspective that regards interest as fundamentally the price of liquidity, there is no conceptual basis for picking out the difference in yield between money and a short-term government bond as the interest rate; there are many other pairs of asset yields the difference between which is determined on the same principles, and may have equivalent economic significance. In this article, we argue that this Keynesian perspective is particularly useful in explaining the secular rise in interest rate spreads since the 1980s, and that both conventional expectations and stronger liquidity preference appear to have played a role. The rise in the term and credit premiums is important for policy, because they mean that the low policy rates in recent periods of expansionary policy have not been reliably translated into low rates for private borrowers.","[Jayadev, Arjun] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Harbor Campus, Boston, MA 02125 USA; [Jayadev, Arjun] Asim Premji Univ, Bengaluru, India; [Mason, J.

This approach addresses several important econometric and modeling issues, e.g., (i) it is highly flexible and can approximate complicated nonlinear relationships without presuming a priori any particular relationship; (ii) it avoids the nonlinear transformations of potentially nonstationary income. The predominant post-1950 income-sulfur emission relationship the case for 24 of the 25 countries studied was either (i) inverted-Vs, where the emission-income relationship became negative, or (I) decoupling, where income no longer affected emissions in a long-run, statistically significant way.

He was known as a politician and central banker, as well as an economist. From the very beginning of his theoretical and practical career, or at least from the late 1920s onward, Manoilescu's ideas and theories (especially his corporatist theory) were marked by clear continuity and consistency based on the theory of protectionism grounded on productivity differences. By developing his model - an alternative to the theory of comparative advantage Manoilescu endeavored to show the need for protectionist measures to promote the development of peripheral countries. His defense of protectionism is usually presented as clumsy and founded on an incorrect method, even if he is often recognized as the forerunner of the theory of unequal exchange and the dependency theory. Few scholars note the similarity of Manoilescu's theory with Karl Marx's labor theory. This paper contributes to validating Manoilescu's conclusions, the soundness of which we test here by reconstructing the theory from a Marxian perspective. A reconstruction of this type offers new possibilities of evaluating his theory and a better understanding of its contributions and limitations.","[Nenovsky, Nikolay Nenov] Univ Picardie, CRIISEA, Econ, F-80025 Amiens, France; [Torre, Dominique] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEC, CNRS, Econ, Nice, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Cote d'Azur,"Nenovsky, NN (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie, CRIISEA, Econ, F-80025 Amiens, France.",,,"Nenovsky, Nikolay/0000-0002-9544-9024",,,,,55,6,7,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Specifically, the approach for dealing with t-distributed errors is extended to the Bayesian instrumental variable estimator by modelling the variance for each error using a Gamma distributed hierarchical prior. The computation is carried out by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for the heteroskedastic case. An example using data illustrates the approach and shows that ignoring the presence of error terms with heavy tails in the instrument equation when it exists may lead to biased estimates.","[Salois, Matthew J.] Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Balcombe, Kelvin G.] Univ Reading, Reading RG6 2AH, Berks, England",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Reading,"Salois, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",,"Balcombe, Kelvin G/F-8418-2010","Balcombe, Kelvin/0000-0001-7224-9233",,,,,17,2,2,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Current research on individual income dynamics has increasingly considered heterogeneity-do all individuals' incomes evolve in the same way, or does a particular individual's income evolve in the same way throughout their life? This paper considers the analogous questions for couples-do all couples' incomes move together in the same way, or does a particular couple's incomes move together in the same way throughout their marriage? In particular, I find evidence of correlated volatility; husbands with volatile incomes tend to have wives with volatile ones. I find weaker evidence for heterogeneity in the correlation of husbands' and wives' income changes, with some couples incomes moving together while others moving in opposite directions. Couples' income changes are negatively correlated early in marriage, particularly when young children are present, and become more positively correlated over time.","Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University,"Shore, SH (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",sshore@gsu.edu,,,,,,,46,4,4,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

In an overlapping-generations model with altruistic parents, the inability to borrow increases children's savings and parental transfers, raising children's welfare as well as average welfare in the short-run and in the long-run. Additionally, the borrowing constraint raises aggregate savings and, hence, physical capital. Consequently, when prices are flexible, the positive welfare impact of the constraint is higher.

Under similar conditions, the value function of any optimal stopping problem is shown to be (once) continuously differentiable.

We use recent cost estimates for future fusion power plants in order to incorporate fusion into the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), a long-term energy and environment model used to study the interaction between technology, climate, and public policy. Results show that fusion's growth will depend on: the chosen carbon mitigation target (if any); the availability of competing carbon-neutral options for the provision of baseload electrical power, in particular nuclear fission as well as carbon capture and storage; the chosen discount rate; the initial year of availability; and the assumed costs of fusion electricity. We quantify the present value of the fusion option while varying the assumptions about these other parameters, and we find that it is, in general for our range of assumptions, significantly larger than the estimated cost of a comprehensive R&D plan to develop fusion energy. The results emphasize the wisdom in hedging against uncertainty in future technology availability by pursuing the development of multiple options that could feasibly play a major role in the latter half of the century.

We investigate this question by developing a detailed representation of bioenergy in a global economy-wide model. We develop a scenario with a global carbon dioxide price, applied to all anthropogenic emissions except those from land use change, that rises from $25 per metric ton in 2015 to $99 in 2050. This creates market conditions favorable to biomass energy, resulting in global non-traditional bioenergy production of similar to 150 exajoules (EJ) in 2050. By comparison, in 2010, global energy production was primarily from coal (138 EJ), oil (171 EJ), and gas (106 EJ). With this policy, 2050 emissions are 42% less in our Base Policy case than our Reference case, although extending the scope of the carbon price to include emissions from land use change would reduce 2050 emissions by 52% relative to the same baseline. Our results from various policy scenarios show that lignocellulosic (LC) ethanol may become the major form of bioenergy, if its production costs fall by amounts predicted in a recent survey and ethanol blending constraints disappear by 2030; however, if its costs remain higher than expected or the ethanol blend wall continues to bind, bioelectricity and bioheat may prevail. Higher LC ethanol costs may also result in the expanded production of first-generation biofuels (ethanol from sugarcane and corn) so that they remain in the fuel mix through 2050. Deforestation occurs if emissions from land use change are not priced, although the availability of biomass residues and improvements in crop yields and conversion efficiencies mitigate pressure on land markets. As regions are linked via international agricultural markets, irrespective of the location of bioenergy production, natural forest decreases are largest in regions with the lowest barriers to deforestation. In 2050, the combination of carbon price and bioenergy production increases food prices by 3.2%-5.2%, with bioenergy accounting for 1.3%-3.5%. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, land lease sales have become a significant off-budgetary revenue to local governments since 2003. This paper investigates whether financing budget deficit is an important driving force of the recent soaring housing prices when local governments function as the monopoly supplier of urban land. A conceptual framework is developed to illustrate a transmission mechanism from budget deficit to housing prices. This leads to an empirical model consisting of two simultaneous structural equations for housing prices and land prices. Using data for the 35 major Chinese cities from 2003 to 2011, an empirical exercise shows that although budget deficit has a positive effect on land prices, it is the factors from demand side, such as amenities, income and the user cost of housing capital, that have been pulling up the housing prices.

Our sample period captures a time during which the National Bank of Poland (NBP) gained independence and it was transforming institutionally and switching to a new monetary policy regime; namely inflation targeting. Evidence indicates that central bank communication helped reduce foreign exchange market uncertainty, measured by the conditional variance of foreign exchange returns, and increased trading volume. The findings suggest that in newly emerging economies with major institutional changes, investors may react significantly to central bank communication, and central banks can hence play an important role in market development during an institutional change. Our results also have broader implications for the applicability of micro-structure models in newly emerging economies. Journal of Comparative Economics 43 (3) (2015) 727-753.

In particular, some developing countries do not collect even half of what they would if taxpayers complied with the written letter of the law. The academic literature has not been oblivious to the need to explain why people pay (or do not pay) taxes. However, the empirical literature has not yet reached consensus. This paper reports the results of a large field experiment that tried to affect compliance by influencing property tax taxpayers' beliefs regarding the levels of enforcement, reciprocity, and peer-effects of the talc system in a municipality in Argentina. Results indicate that those taxpayers that received the deterrence message have a higher probability (almost 5 percentage points) to comply than the taxpayers in the control group. No average effects are found for the other two treatments. However, this average effects masks important results. After receiving the reciprocity and the peer-effects messages, the probability of compliance increased for some taxpayers but it decreased for others according to their underlying distribution of beliefs. The evidence in this paper advances the state of knowledge, may help to reconcile some of the results in the literature, and provides the basis for advancing policies and research on tax compliance in developing countries.

We report on experiments to re-investigate the possibility that the WTP-WTA gap arises from subject misconceptions due to experimental procedures as suggested by Plott and Zeiler (2005). The contribution of this paper is two-fold: first, we attempt to replicate the findings by Plott and Zeiler that the WTP-WTA gap disappears when using procedures that are aimed at reducing misconceptions, such as extensive training and practice rounds for the BDM mechanism. However, we fail to do so as the WTP-WTA gap persists in the main task where subjects state their WTA or WTP for a mug. Second, we use the paid practice rounds to identify subjects without apparent misconceptions and find that also for those subjects who never make dominated choices in the lottery tasks, the WTP-WTA gap in the mug task exists. Thus, we find no evidence of the idea that subject misconceptions are the main source of the WTP-WTA gap. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

For that purpose, we use representative survey data from the German General Social Survey, which offers information on attitudes toward progressive, proportional and regressive taxation. On the basis of theoretical considerations, we explore the factors which, beyond an individual's financial interest, should drive preferences for progressive taxation. Our empirical results confirm that the narrow redistributive self-interest does not offer the sole explanation of the heterogeneity in individual attitudes. Rather, we show that the choice of the favored tax rate is also driven by fairness considerations and beliefs on the role of effort for economic success.","[Hennighausen, Tanja] Univ Mannheim, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Heinemann, Friedrich] ZEW Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany",University of Mannheim; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Hennighausen, T (通讯作者)，Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, L7,3-5, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany.",hennighausen@uni-mannheim.de,,,,,,,41,28,30,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

To remove demand-driven correlations, we rely on within-city comparisons. We ask whether banks whose mortgage portfolios were more heavily weighted in harder-hit cities cut back lending to a greater extent in all cities where they make small business loans, relative to other banks in those cities. The evidence is consistent with a credit crunch. Large banks reacted with heavier cuts, but consistent evidence is also found among smaller banks.

Most BG studies focus on describing BGs and why firms choose rapid internationalization has yet to be sufficiently addressed. This study was designed to understand what factors are related to BG among Korean small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Bounded by the liability of smallness, SMEs are deficient in financial and human resources, which are typically known as inhibitors of internationalization. Nonetheless, some SMEs internationalize rapidly at or near founding beyond the home continent and become BGs. In order to clearly identify factors related to BGs, two groups (BGs versus Non-BGs) were predicted by eight potential BG related factors. Analyses of 480 survey data collected from Korean SMEs nationwide revealed that among the eight BG related factors, five are found to be significant. That is, Korean SMEs with high entrepreneurial proclivity, highly unique product development, high R&D investment, less foreign network and export consumer products were discovered to be BGs. The findings of this study contribute to advancing BG theories in that, it provides empirical evidence that clearly articulates the why rapid aspect of BGs.","[Jin, Byoungho; Woo, Hongjoo] Univ N Carolina, Dept Consumer Apparel & Retail Studies, Greensboro, NC 27412 USA; [Chung, Jae-Eun] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Consumer & Family Sci, Seoul, South Korea",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Greensboro; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Chung, JE (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Consumer & Family Sci, Seoul, South Korea.",b_jin@uncg.edu; h_woo@uncg.edu; jchung@skku.edu,,,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2043346],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This research was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2043346).,,48,5,5,1,28,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

We contribute to this debate by showing that the investor may prefer tougher rather than weaker regulation of his future insider activity. This is because regulation can reduce not only the expected benefits, but also the expected costs of insider status. Tough enough regulation can make the expected cost savings greater than the lost benefits and increase incentives to invest as an insider. Weaker regulation, in contrast, can be worse than no regulation in terms of these incentives.","Ohio Univ, Athens, OH 45701 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio University,"Lskavyan, V (通讯作者)，Ohio Univ, Athens, OH 45701 USA.",lskavyan@ohio.edu,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,9,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The results not only confirm that both social trust and the quality of formal legal institutions have a positive impact on capital accumulation, but also show that they are substitutes. Specifically, the impact on capital accumulation of an upgrade of the quality of formal legal institutions is larger when social trust is low than when social trust is high, and vice versa.

Thus, they must have had more successes resulting in higher posterior probabilities of being high-ability criminals.

Usually, labour market rigidity is assessed through the researcher's reading of the legislation or other similar measures. In this work we propose a new indicator for labour market rigidity computed from data on the adjustment of employment and hours per worker. We model employment dynamics with a linear play model of hysteresis, which is adequate in the presence of non-convex employment adjustment costs, and derive a switching regression model with a time-varying splitting factor estimated on monthly data for 15 OECD countries and 14 years (1995-2008). The numerical results provide an employment rigidity ranking of countries that is neither vulnerable to enforcement issues nor to subjective interpretations of the law. With this new and practical procedure, a single parameter summarizes different labour markets according to their readiness of employment adjustment. Moreover, it is easily computed and updated from publicly available data. Comparing the new proposed ranking with others, used as a benchmark for the rigidity of employment protection legislation, we find a positive and significant association between the common employment protection legislation indices and our employment adjustment indicator. The rank correlations are especially high with the OECD indicators. Yet, our findings indicate that the OECD rankings seem to overstate employment rigidity at the ranking top positions and understate it at the bottom.","[Mota, Paulo Ricardo; Varejao, Jose; Vasconcelos, Paulo B.] Univ Porto, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Mota, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Porto, Rua Campo Alegre 823, P-4100 Oporto, Portugal.",mpaulo@fep.up.pt,"Vasconcelos, Paulo/A-8772-2008; Mota, Paulo/AAG-2886-2019; Varejao, Jose/B-6959-2009","Vasconcelos, Paulo/0000-0002-7132-880X; Mota, Paulo/0000-0001-7028-4545; Varejao, Jose/0000-0002-7053-8784",,,,,55,6,7,0,14,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42.0,3,,,,,547,569,,10.1007/s10663-014-9263-1,0.0,,,23,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800004,0

The time horizon is assumed to be finite and we allow several model parameters to be dependent on time. For the stochastic version of the model, we derive closed-form expressions of the value function as well as of the optimal pricing and advertising policy in feedback form. Moreover, we show that for small unit shares, the model converges to a deterministic version of the problem, whose explicit solution is characterized by an overage and an underage case. We quantify the close relationship between the open-loop solution of the deterministic model and the expected evolution of optimally controlled stochastic sales processes. For both models, we derive sensitivity results. We find that in the case of positive holding costs, on average, optimal prices increase in time and advertising rates decrease. Furthermore, we analytically verify the excellent quality of optimal feedback policies of deterministic models applied in stochastic models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Two important findings are addressed. First, we measure static and dynamic correlations in both macroeconomic variables and policy variables. The vector autoregression and the dynamic conditional correlation model are applied to capture the dynamics of the co-movement pattern in particular. The empirical results show evidence of synchronization in key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, inflation, export, and exchange rates within ASEAN. However, supporting evidence of economic policy linkages are found in only a few cases. Second, the panel regressions show that trade integration is the main factor in the synchronization of the business cycles within ASEAN. Moreover, monetary policy linkage contributes to this co-movement pattern. Financial integration is an important factor only in the correlation between ASEAN and the United States, while the role of fiscal policy linkage is not significant in every case.

The empirical evidence shows that less liquid stock markets are influenced by contractionary monetary policy, and highly liquid stock markets are dependent on expansionary monetary policy. The asymmetric effect of monetary shocks on stock market liquidity is also found.

Yet, the industry has greatly changed in recent decades. Regulations, first on air quality, have altered the geography of coal mining, pushing it west from Appalachia. Likewise, technological change has reduced labor demand and has led to relatively new mining practices, such as invasive mountain-top approaches. Thus, the economic footprint of coal mining has greatly changed in an era when the industry appears to be on the decline. This study investigates whether these changes along with coal's boom/bust cycles have affected economic prosperity in coal country. We separately examine the Appalachian region from the rest of the U.S. due to Appalachia's unique history and different mining practices. Our study takes a new look at the industry by assessing the winners and losers of coal development around a range of economic indicators and addressing whether the natural resources curse applies to contemporary American coal communities. The results suggest that modern coal mining has rather nuanced effects that differ between Appalachia and the rest of the U.S. We do not find strong evidence of a resources curse, except that coal mining has a consistent inverse association with measures linked to population growth and entrepreneurship, and thereby future economic growth.

We attribute the result to the bid-at-cost rule implemented as a part of a special unit commitment procedure on the day-ahead market. We first look at the industry restructuring and subsequent mergers and acquisitions. The M&A were undertaken in different market zones and did not seem to increase concentration although planned zone integration may worsen competition in the long run. We then examine short-run aspect of market power by estimating hourly price-cost mark-ups and assessing their dynamics in 2010 and 2011, a year preceding and following the market liberalisation, respectively. The hypothesis of actual market power abuse is tested, and rejected, using time series AR models. Further, a Tobit regression shows that the liberalisation decreased the mark-ups by about 1.66 percentage points. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we empirically investigate whether bank liquidity creation fosters economic growth in a large emerging market, Russia. We follow the methodology of Berger and Bouwman, Rev Financ Stud 22:3779-3837, (2009) to measure bank liquidity creation using a rich and exhaustive dataset of Russian banks. We perform fixed effects and GMM estimations to examine the relation of liquidity creation with economic growth for Russian regions for the period 2004-2012. Our results suggest that bank liquidity creation strengthens economic growth. This effect was not halted by the financial crisis. Our conclusion thus supports a positive impact of financial development on economic growth in Russia.","[Fidrmuc, Jarko] Zeppelin Univ, Dept Econ, Inst East & Southeast European Studies IOS, D-88045 Friedrichshafen, Germany; [Fidrmuc, Jarko] Austrian Inst Econ Res WIFO, Vienna, Austria; [Fidrmuc, Jarko; Fungacova, Zuzana] Charles Univ Prague, IES, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fungacova, Zuzana] Bank Finland Inst Econ Transit BOFIT, Helsinki 00101, Finland; [Weill, Laurent] Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, F-67082 Strasbourg, France",Leibniz Institut fur Ost und Sudosteuropaforschung; Zeppelin University; Charles University Prague; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Weill, L (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, EM Strasbourg Business Sch, 47 Ave Foret Noire, F-67082 Strasbourg, France.",jarko.fidrmuc@zu.de; zuzana.fungacova@bof.fi; laurent.weill@unistra.fr,,"Fidrmuc, Jarko/0000-0003-2662-1991",,,,,19,36,37,2,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

It is found that the main explanation is having children, rather than skills or academic background. The results show that each additional child reduces a woman's wage by 6.6%, and increases a man's wage by 3.4%. Furthermore, we examine three channels that may explain the motherhood penalty: periods of non-employment, a shift to the public sector and lower-paying firms and the timing of births. Having children increases a woman's period of non-employment while decreasing a man's, and each month of non-employment due to maternity leave reduces a woman's wage by 1.0%, while non-employment reduces a man's wage by only 0.6%. Mothers tend to shift from the private to the public sector and from higher-paying to lower-paying firms, which offer a more flexible and more convenient work environment, at the cost of a lower salary. Finally, a delay in having children increases a woman's wage while having little, if any, effect on a man's wage. Furthermore, controlling for this variable reduces the estimated motherhood penalty.","[Gafni, Dalit] Coll Management, Sch Econ, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel; [Siniver, Erez] Coll Management, Acad Studies, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel",,"Gafni, D (通讯作者)，Coll Management, Sch Econ, Rishon Leziyyon, Israel.",dalit@gafni.co.il; sinivr@colman.ac.il,,,,,,,32,6,9,1,40,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

However, they can produce arbitrarily large budget surpluses or deficits. We construct a performance index for a VCG mechanism to measure its budget surplus and deficit in the worst-case. Using this index, we develop mechanisms whose surpluses or deficits vanish as the number of participants increases, for both cases of bads and goods. We find that individual rationality creates an asymmetry between surplus and deficit, particularly in the case of bads. When the number of agents is large enough, a minute amount of deficit can replace unit surplus to achieve a budget balance. For the case of economic goods, unit surplus can only be replaced with unit deficit, regardless of individual rationality. This result shows that the model with bads differs fundamentally from the model with goods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, we study the effect of excludability - exclusion of the lowest contributor - on contributions in three different team production settings. We demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that excludability increases contributions. Excludability is particularly effective in production settings where the average or maximum effort determines team production. In these settings, we observe almost immediate convergence to full contribution.

We prove that there exists a unique equilibrium and examine the relation between total conflict investment (a proxy for conflict intensity) and underlying network characteristics. We also identify a class of conflict networks where peaceful conflict resolution is beneficial in the sense that conflict intensity is reduced. Outside of this class peaceful conflict resolution may be detrimental because countervailing local network effects can actually result in higher conflict intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Instrumental variables estimates show that it is more likely for individuals to gain employment in big cities. A 1 percent increase in city scale increases one's employment probability by between 0.044 and 0.050 percentage points.

It departs from the previous literature by allowing worker heterogeneity in productivity, which gives rise to a double transaction problem in a hedonic model. Deriving sufficient conditions under which assortative matching is the unique stable job-worker matching, we show that observed wage differentials between jobs reflect not only compensating wage differentials, but also worker productivity gaps between the jobs. We find that the job-worker matching pattern determines the extent to which compensating wage differentials are confounded with the worker productivity gap effect. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper evaluates the eco-efficiency of the manufacturing sector in Malaysia by taking into account both economic and ecological factors (i.e. air pollution). Manufacturing activities produce pollutants that can contribute to poor environmental performance and are regarded as undesirable outputs. Thus, it would be incomplete to measure the efficiency of manufacturing activities without considering the undesirable outputs. This study employs the Range Adjusted Measure (RAM) model which accounts for both desirable and undesirable outputs in the production process. The results show that the Malaysian manufacturing industry as a whole has an average unified eco-efficiency score of 94% (category 1) in 2010 which indicates scope for reduction of inputs and pollutants as much as 6%. The results also reveal that, on average, the eco-efficiency score of the free industrial or free trade zone states are higher than non-free industrial zone states. This may be due to two reasons, first, manufacturers in the free industrial zones are export orientated and learning effects are gained from export participation which help firms improve their efficiency over time. Second, the firms enjoy duty free imports of raw materials as well as are exempt from various taxes and duties that help reduce production costs. The empirical evidence in this study may provide some directions in formulating policies, laws, regulations and strategies pertaining to any environmental performance issue particularly concerning environmental damage caused by industrial pollutants so that the productivity growth is in balance with environmental performance.

I elaborate on a monetary structural reform, which should make sure that no bank will any longer be in a position to blur the distinction between money and credit, as this confusion in the banks' books originates various asset bubbles as well as systemically important financial institutions, both of which are major contributors to making the system increasingly fragile as time goes by. This reform of domestic payment systems will not be enough to avoid so-called global imbalances at an international level. I therefore propose, in the spirit of Keynes, a structural reform of the international monetary system, arguing for the emission of a supranational money in settlement of every individual transaction between any two monetary spaces.","Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland",University of Fribourg,"Rossi, S (通讯作者)，Univ Fribourg, Dept Econ, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland.",,"Rossi, Sergio/AAO-6365-2020","Rossi, Sergio/0009-0002-5926-5356",,,,,33,9,9,0,10,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

If so, what are the driving factors in the Korean fund market? Fund return data from 2002 to 2008 are used to determine these factors. Specifically, for short-sale constraints, we test the hypothesis of difference of opinion developed by Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001) and Hong and Stein (2003). This hypothesis provides a unique opportunity to test directly the differences of opinion among fund managers that operate fund monies under short-sale constraints using asset-allocating strategies. The results of the GJR-GARCH model show an asymmetric volatility in returns and an increase in differences of opinion among fund managers, which extended to an increase in asymmetric volatility. Furthermore, the results of this study are consistent with the model of Hong and Stein (2003), which predicts that negative asymmetries are more likely to occur when there are large differences of opinion among fund managers. Therefore, our results imply that the overvaluation effect is more remarkable in funds for which a wider dispersion of the opinions of fund managers exists. These findings are consistent with Miller's (1977) intuition and Hong and Stein's (2003) model. In addition, our results also support the stochastic bubble hypothesis and are consistent with Blanchard and Watson (1982) and Wu (1997), even after controlling for fund characteristic variables.","[Sohn, Pando] Dong A Univ, Busan, South Korea; [Seo, Ji-Yong] Sangmyung Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Dong A University; Sangmyung University,"Seo, JY (通讯作者)，Sangmyung Univ, Seoul, South Korea.",pdsohn@dau.ac.kr; jyseo@smu.ac.kr,,,Dong-A University,Dong-A University,This study was supported by research funds from Dong-A University.

In this discipline, a special area is dedicated to the research of different factors that affect the value of intangibles. Royalty rate, a price of the licensed intangible, is a typical measure of an intangible asset's value. This research paper aims at testing empirically selected factors that have been identified by theoretical literature as well as by licensing practice as relevant in determining the level of royalty rates. For this purpose, a multi-factor linear regression model is built using the latest possible sample of licensing transactions from consumer durables industry from 2002 to 2006. The authors make tests of dependent variable (royalty rate) on financial factors as well as on factors coming from different provisions of licensing agreements. Based on a sample of 67 transactions, the financial factors revealed themselves to be statistically negligible, while some license provisions, in particular the extent of rights granted and the license term appeared to be highly significant in determining the royalty rate level.","Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Svacina, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",svacina@vse.cz,"Svačina, Pavel/F-7878-2014","Svačina, Pavel/0000-0002-3784-6275",Research Project of Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics in Prague [VSE IP 100040],Research Project of Faculty of Finance and Accounting of University of Economics in Prague,This study was supported by the Research Project of the Faculty of Finance and Accounting of the University of Economics in Prague (No. VSE IP 100040).,,18,1,1,0,18,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

This article provides estimates of the relevant price elasticities based on a dynamic demand model that better addresses potential intertemporal substitution and unobservable persistent heterogeneous tastes. It finds that static analyses overestimate the long-run own-price elasticity of regular soda by 60.8%, leading to overestimated consumption reduction of sugar-sweetened soft drinks by up to 57.9% in some cases. Results indicate that soda taxes will raise revenue but are unlikely to substantially impact soda consumption.","Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Wang, EY (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.",emilywang@resecon.umass.edu,,,,,,,44,43,60,2,35,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

Stronger growth in advanced economies generates stronger EM growth, more so for those EMs with stronger trade ties with advanced economies and less so for those that are financially more open. Adverse external borrowing shocks hurt EM growth, more so for those with greater financial openness or those with limited policy space. China itself has become an important external driver of growth in other EMs. However, internal factors also matter in determining EM growth, and in the period since the global financial crisis these factors have been hampering growth for some EMs. The persistent dampening effect from internal factors in recent years suggests that trend growth could be affected as well. In sum, EMs may be entering a more challenging period of slower growth in the period ahead, reflecting both external and internal conditions. (C) 2015 Society for Policy Modeling.

The sample covers the entire modern era of the petroleum industry, which typically begins with the first drilled oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania in 1858. We estimate a two-regime model that divides the sample into high- and low-volatility regimes based on the variance-covariance matrix of the oil and stock prices. We find that the high-volatility regime more frequently exists prior to the Great Depression and after the 1973 oil price shock caused by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The low-volatility regime occurs more frequently when the oil markets fell largely under the control of the major international oil companies from the end of the Great Depression to the first oil price shock in 1973. Using the National Bureau of Economic research business cycle dates, we also find that the high-volatility regime more likely occurs when the economy experiences a recession. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We first provide a historical account of energy use in U.S. agriculture. To do this we rely on the Bennet cost indicator to study how the price and volume components of energy costs have developed over time. We then proceed to analyze the contribution of energy to productivity in U.S. agriculture employing the Bennet-Bowley productivity indicator. An important feature of the Bennet-Bowley indicator is its direct association with the change in (normalized) profits. Thus our study is also able to analyze the link between profitability and productivity. Panel regression estimates indicate that energy prices have a negative effect on profitability in the U.S. agricultural sector. We also find that energy productivity has generally remained below total farm productivity following the 1973-1974 global energy crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.,"[Ball, V.

Evidence from Italy,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Capital-energy substitution; Fuel substitution; Microdata; Panel estimation,INTERFUEL SUBSTITUTION; INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES; COMPLEMENTARITY DEBATE; FACTOR DEMAND; PANEL; CONSUMPTION,"The reaction of energy demand to price changes is a key policy issue as it describes the economy's response to changes in market conditions or to policy interventions. The issue is even more important for the Italian economy, highly exposed to energy price changes, given its almost complete fossil fuel-related energy dependence, environmental sensitivity and highly fragmented industrial structure. Besides the policy issue, there is also an important methodological debate, concerning the best way to evaluate energy demand elasticities, looking at alternative models, data and elasticity definitions. After a discussion of the main methodological issues and the related empirical literature, this paper presents an estimation of factor and fuel demand elasticities for Italian industrial firms, by using a microeconomic panel in a two-stage translog model. Using cross-price and Morishima elasticities, we obtain information on the magnitude and asymmetry of firms' responses to price changes. Moreover, the use of a micro-dataset allows the high heterogeneity of Italian firms to be considered: the results are discussed according to technology intensity, sector and firm size. Our findings show that energy is the most elastic input for all sectors and that capital and energy are substitutes in the low technology sector and weak complements in all others. Estimated interfuel elasticities show a high degree of demand sensitivity to fuel price changes and the vast majority of cross-price elasticities exhibit substitutability. Appropriate fiscal policies can thus be identified to give an effective impulse in influencing the industrial energy mix by changing relative prices. These findings constitute an important foundation for analysing energy demand by Italian industrial firms, given that empirical literature is particularly rare on the Italian case study.

First, there are always equilibria in which only two candidates receive votes. Second, there may exist an equilibrium in which three candidates receive votes. Its characteristics challenge common beliefs: (i) neither sincere voting by all voters nor pushover tactics (i.e., supporters of the front-runner voting for a less preferred candidate so as to influence who will face the front-runner in the second round) are supported in equilibrium, and (ii) the winner does not necessarily have democratic legitimacy since the Condorcet winner may not even participate in the second round.","[Bouton, Laurent] Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA; [Gratton, Gabriele] UNSW Business Sch, Sch Econ, Kensington, NSW, Australia",Georgetown University,"Bouton, L (通讯作者)，Georgetown Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20057 USA.",boutonllj@gmail.com; g.gratton@unsw.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council [DP140102426],Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We thank the co-editor, Nicola Persico, and two anonymous referees.

How much risk-sharing could be gained in small sets (or pools) of countries? To answer this question, we compute the means and variances of poolwide gross domestic product growth, for all possible pools of any size drawn from a sample of 74 countries, and compare them with the means and variances of consumption growth in each country individually. From the difference, we infer potential diversification and welfare gains. As much as two-thirds of the first best, full worldwide welfare gains can be obtained in groupings of as few as seven countries. The largest potential gains arise from pools consisting of countries in different regions and including countries with weak institutions. We argue that international risk-sharing fails to emerge because the largest potential gains are among countries that do not trust each other's willingness and ability to abide by international contractual obligations.

I show that the consumption-savings choice depends both on the marginal return on savings and on the total return on savings, implying that the incentive to save may increase with the initial level of wealth. As a consequence, a salience-based poverty trap may exist when the marginal return on savings is sufficiently high and sufficiently flat. I also consider the case of a perfect credit market and show that a poverty trap may emerge when the salience of consumption is bounded above. I discuss policy implications. In particular, imposing upon an agent a punishment for decreasing savings below a threshold leads to a higher level of savings, even when the threshold triggering the punishment is not binding.

All sets of data share the common feature that optimal controls need to be more general than functions, i.e. positive measures. Formulas are provided for golden-rule configurations (uniform density functions with cutting at the ages that solve a Faustmann problem) and for Faustmann policies, and their optimality/maximality is discussed. The results do not always confirm the corresponding ones in discrete time. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The present paper reconsiders this issue for US output growth. To this end, it focusses on the shape parameter b of the exponential power distribution (EPD), the two polar values of which constitute the normal distribution and the Laplace distribution with its fatter tails, respectively. The paper first warns against premature conclusions that neglect a structural break in output volatility. On the basis of a battery of Monte Carlo experiments, it is then found out that the results strongly depend on which subperiod is considered, the Great Inflation (GI) or the Great Moderation (GM) period, and which data are referred to, the growth rates of GDP, firm sector output, and quarterly or monthly industrial production (IP). Here, only quarterly IP can be said to exhibit fat tails in GI as well as GM; other evidence is mixed.","Univ Kiel, Inst Econ, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Franke, R (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Inst Econ, Wilhelm Seelig Pl 1, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",franke@uni-bremen.de,,,,,,,28,9,10,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2015,66.0,2,,,,,213,242,,10.1111/meca.12067,0.0,,,30,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CF5GP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000352585800002,0

This paper reviews methods for discriminating between important and unimportant covariates with particular attention given to methods that discriminate correctly with probability approaching 1 as the sample size increases. Methods are available for a wide variety of linear, nonlinear, semiparametric and nonparametric models.

Recently, Stein, Parrilo and Ozdaglar showed that this algorithm can fail to find an exact correlated equilibrium. We present a variant of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm that guarantees the polynomial-time identification of exact correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm differs from the original primarily in its use of a separation oracle that produces cuts corresponding to pure-strategy profiles. Our new separation oracle can be understood as a derandomization of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden's original separation oracle via the method of conditional probabilities. We also adapt our techniques to two related algorithms that are based on the Ellipsoid Against Hope approach, Hart and Mansour's communication procedure for correlated equilibria and Huang and von Stengel's algorithm for extensive-form correlated equilibria, in both cases yielding efficient exact solutions.

We consider both finite state Markov sunspots and sunspots in autoregressive form, and derive conditions for the existence of an heterogeneous equilibrium where only a fraction of agents condition their forecasts on the sunspot. We then show that when the fraction of agents conditioning their forecasts on a sunspot changes over time, under evolutionary dynamics, these restrictions need to evolve endogenously with population shares. We argue that such requirement questions the possibility of sunspot equilibria to emerge through a process of evolution and adaptation on agents' beliefs: in order for a sunspot equilibrium to emerge, all agents must simultaneously coordinate on the same sunspot variable at the same time.

The matching process is decomposed into its two component stages: the contact stage, in which job searchers make contact with employers, and the selection stage, in which they decide whether to match. We construct a theoretical model explaining two-sided selection through microeconomic incentives. Firms face adjustment costs in responding to heterogeneous variations in the characteristics of workers and jobs. Matches and separations are described through firms' job offer and firing decisions and workers' job acceptance and quit decisions. Our calibrated model for the United States can account for important empirical regularities, such as the large volatilities of labor market variables, that the conventional matching model cannot.","[Brown, Alessio; Merkl, Christian; Snower, Dennis] Kiel Inst World Econ, Kiel, Germany; [Merkl, Christian] Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany; [Snower, Dennis] Univ Kiel, Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW); University of Erlangen Nuremberg; University of Kiel,"Merkl, C (通讯作者)，Univ Erlangen Nurnberg, Lange Gasse 20, D-90403 Nurnberg, Germany.",christian.merkl@fau.de,,"Merkl, Christian/0000-0001-5607-8286",,,,,43,9,11,1,18,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

The high premium is the reward for holding assets that deliver low returns when consumption descends below habits. The term structure of interests rates is upward-sloping because long-term bonds are more sensitive to fluctuations of discount rates. The term structure of equity is downward-sloping because long-horizon equity gives higher chances to beat consumption habits than short-horizon equity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent technological advancement in low-cost automation has made possible the parallel operation of large numbers of small-scale and modular production units. Amenable to mass-production, these units can be more rapidly deployed but they are also likely to have a much quicker turnover. Such a paradigm shift motivates the analysis of the combined effect of lead time and lifetime on infrastructure investment decisions. In order to value the underlying real option, we introduce an optimal multiple stopping approach that accounts for operational flexibility, delay induced by lead time, and multiple (finite/infinite) future investment opportunities. We provide an analytical characterization of the firm's value function and optimal stopping rule. This leads us to develop an iterative numerical scheme, and examine how the investment decisions depend on lead time and lifetime, as well as other parameters. Furthermore, our model can be used to analyze the critical investment cost that makes small-scale (short lead time, short lifetime) alternatives competitive with traditional large-scale infrastructure.

The resulting market for advice is plagued by informational problems, since both the difficulty of the questions posed to consultants and the knowledge of those consultants are hard to assess. We show that spot contracting is not efficient because lemons (in this case, self-employed producers with intermediate knowledge) cannot be appropriately excluded from the market. However, an ex ante, firm-like contractual arrangement uniquely delivers the first best. This arrangement involves hierarchies in which consultants are full residual claimants of output and compensate producers via incentive contracts. This simple characterization of the optimal ex ante arrangement suggests a rationale for the organization of firms and the structure of compensation in knowledge-intensive sectors.

To reduce these costs, firms concentrate their efforts in locations that are perceived as talent rich or have produced successful employees in the past. Such recruitment mechanisms may lead to statistical discrimination if they reduce uncertainty for a subset of candidates or if firms relate current employee attributes with the institution. In this article, I test for statistical discrimination associated with an individual's institutional affiliation that results from targeted hiring practices by using a unique individual-level data set of National Football League (NFL) draft prospects. I find that conditional on individual ability, individuals from highly ranked college teams are drafted earlier than individuals from lower ranked institutions. Over the length of a player's professional career, a player's college institution has no effect on career success, indicating that certain players are damaged by this recruitment mechanism. Even though players can suffer substantial financial damages as a result of being drafted later in the draft, NFL team performance is not sufficiently affected for teams to exploit this bias.

We show that tightening enforcement does not increase unemployment and increases wages, total output, and welfare by enabling better allocation of workers to higher productivity jobs and improving competition in the formal labor market.","[Meghir, Costas] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06511 USA; [Meghir, Costas] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Narita, Renata] Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ, BR-05508010 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Robin, Jean-Marc] Sci Po, Off E410, F-75007 Paris, France; [Robin, Jean-Marc] UCL, London, England",Yale University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Universidade de Sao Paulo; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); University of London; University College London,"Meghir, C (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, 37 Hillhouse Ave, New Haven, CT 06511 USA.",c.meghir@yale.edu; rnarita@usp.br; jeanmarc.robin@sciencespo.fr,"Narita, Renata/N-2148-2016; Meghir, Costas/C-3370-2008","Narita, Renata/0000-0002-5982-5328;","ESRC [RES-051-27-0204]; Brazilian Ministry of Education CAPES [BEX 1960-03-2]; Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant [RES-589-28-0001]; European Research Council (ERC) [ERC-2010-AdG-269693-WASP]; Cowles Foundation; ISPS at Yale; ESRC [ES/I034021/1, ES/H021221/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H021221/1, ES/I034021/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Brazilian Ministry of Education CAPES(Coordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES)); Economic and Social Research Council through the ESRC Centre for Microdata Methods and Practice grant(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government); Cowles Foundation; ISPS at Yale; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"We thank three anonymous referees as well as Joe Altonji, Carlos Corseuil, Corina Mommaerts, Ana Reynoso, Chris Taber, and seminar participants at the NBER Labor Studies group, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Yale University for comments.

Still, there is a significant amount of ideological heterogeneity across newspapers, which is smaller than the one found for interest groups. However, when we group propositions by issue area, we find a sizable amount of ideological imbalance: broadly speaking, newspapers are to the left of the state-level median voter on many social issues, and to the right on many economic issues.

The test is very simple and is asymptotically chi-squared with 1-degree of freedom. The test is applied to sampling interval determination for realized volatilities (RVs) which validates the commonly used ad hoc rule of between 5 and 30 min for sampling interval. The proposed test gives a statistical justification for RVs of negligible serial correlation in the log-returns owning to MMN for sampling interval larger than a selected one. A Monte Carlo experiment shows reasonable size and power performance of the test. The proposed test is illustrated for two real data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Critics see it as having developed at the expense of both investment and employment in the US, Europe and Japan. Proponents emphasise improvements in the terms of trade and reductions to the cost of financing that stem from China's supply of light manufactures, its demand for Western capital and luxury goods and its high saving. The criticism implies Keynesian assumptions while proponents take a neoclassical perspective. In this paper, both are embodied in a global macro-model that emphasises bilateral linkages via trade and investment, with monetary spill-overs represented by globally integrated bond markets. Net gains are suggested for the US and Europe from China's successful export-oriented growth, though there are partially offsetting Keynesian effects. China's recent slower, more consumption focussed, growth appears also to be beneficial in those regions and in Japan notwithstanding terms of trade losses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Bitcoin's rules were designed by engineers with no apparent influence from lawyers or regulators. Bitcoin is built on a transaction log that is distributed across a network of participating computers. It includes mechanisms to reward honest participation, to bootstrap acceptance by early adopters, and to guard against concentrations of power. Bitcoin's design allows for irreversible transactions, a prescribed path of money creation over time, and a public transaction history. Anyone can create a Bitcoin account, without charge and without any centralized vetting procedure-or even a requirement to provide a real name. Collectively, these rules yield a system that is understood to be more flexible, more private, and less amenable to regulatory oversight than other forms of payment-though as we discuss, all these benefits face important limits. Bitcoin is of interest to economists as a virtual currency with potential to disrupt existing payment systems and perhaps even monetary systems. This article presents the platform's design principles and properties for a nontechnical audience; reviews its past, present, and future uses; and points out risks and regulatory issues as Bitcoin interacts with the conventional financial system and the real economy.","[Boehme, Rainer] Univ Innsbruck, Secur & Privacy, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria; [Christin, Nicolas] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Christin, Nicolas] Carnegie Mellon Univ, CyLab, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Edelman, Benjamin] Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Business Adm, Boston, MA 02163 USA; [Moore, Tyler] So Methodist Univ, Comp Sci & Engn, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",University of Innsbruck; Carnegie Mellon University; Carnegie Mellon University; Harvard University; Southern Methodist University,"Böhme, R (通讯作者)，Univ Innsbruck, Secur & Privacy, A-6020 Innsbruck, Austria.",boehme@uibk.ac.at; nicolasc@cmu.edu; bedelman@hbs.edu; tylerm@smu.edu,"; Christin, Nicolas/E-3038-2016","Bohme, Rainer/0000-0003-4518-6227; Christin, Nicolas/0000-0002-2506-8031",,,,,67,686,766,24,516,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We find that greater exposure to Western culture is in general associated with a convergence to Western norms of behaviour. Specifically, the share of education an individual receives in the West has a strong negative impact on altruism, trust towards individuals of Chinese ethnicity, and trustworthiness, while it has a significant and positive impact on trust towards Australians.

It is well-known that truthtelling is not a dominant strategy in this auction and that inefficient equilibria can arise. Edelman et al. (2007) [11] and Varian (2007) [36] show that an efficient equilibrium always exists in the full information setting. Their results, however, do not extend to the case with uncertainty, where efficient equilibria might not exist. In this paper we study the space of equilibria in GSP, and quantify the efficiency loss that can arise in equilibria under a wide range of sources of uncertainty, as well as in the full information setting. The traditional Bayesian game models uncertainty in the valuations (types) of the participants. The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise to a further form of uncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about the behavior of the underlying ad allocation algorithm. The bounds we obtain apply to both forms of uncertainty, and are robust in the sense that they apply under various perturbations of the solution concept, extending to models with information asymmetries and bounded rationality in the form of learning strategies. We present a constant bound (2.927) on the factor of the efficiency loss (price of anarchy) of the corresponding game for the Bayesian model of partial information about other participants and about ad quality factors. For the full information setting, we prove a surprisingly low upper bound of 1.282 on the price of anarchy over pure Nash equilibria, nearly matching a lower bound of 1.259 for the case of three advertisers. Further, we do not require that the system reaches equilibrium, and give similarly low bounds also on the quality degradation for any no-regret learning outcome.

Despite these general trends, there are significant regional differences in YURs and above-average YUR regions tend to cluster close to each other. Moreover, a distinction between North and South regions seems appropriate for both countries. The purpose of this study is to identify key determinants of YURs in the Russian and Italian regions, for the period 2000-2009. We also search for the existence of distance spatial effects. In particular, we estimate a modified Arellano-Bond model for the regional YUR, including some explanatory and control variables (e.g. regional GDP in PPP, regional population density, regional total unemployment rate), together with year dummies and North/South dummies. The use of distance matrixes enables important analysis to be conducted on the role played by spatial effects, which turn out to be significant. Also the negative impact of the 2008-2009 crisis is statistically confirmed (at least in the case of Italy). The relevant policy implications are highlighted in the conclusions.

The 2010 National Survey of Veterans asked a broad cross section of veterans about deployment to OEF/OIF and combat exposure. Analysis of these data suggests that impacts of deployment and combat on the current socioeconomic well-being of OEF/OIF veterans may be small, but combat appears to reduce self-reported health and other nonpecuniary indicators.

When the principal hires a single agent to perform multiple tasks, the agent allocates effort between the tasks inefficiently. I demonstrate that, even though hiring multiple agents completely mitigates this effort distortion problem, the principal is still better off hiring a single agent if the (exogenous) rewards for the tasks are sufficiently different. In contrast to similar results in the multi-task literature, this finding is not driven by risk aversion or noise. Rather, it is a direct result of the restricted contract space inherent to the environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To obtain a parsimonious representation of the futures curve, we decompose it into a level-, a slope- and a curvature factor. In a second step, we separately regress each extracted factor on measures of the market exposure of fundamental and financial traders revealing whether and how the exposure of the two trader groups affects the different dimensions of the futures curve. Spanning from 2006 until 2012, our dataset covers sub-periods of a sharp WTI-price rise as well as a diverging Brent-WTI-spread. Our contribution is threefold: First, we suggest that it is important to distinguish between level and slope as we find that fundamental traders have a measurable impact on the level of the futures curve, but do not play much of a role for its slope or curvature, whereas the exposure of financial traders mainly influences the slope of the futures curve. Despite allegations to the contrary, we find no evidence of a systematic impact of non-fundamental traders on the level of the futures curve, for example during the 2006-2008 oil price surge. Second, we suggest using relative short- and relative long positions for fundamental and financial traders instead of the net position as the former reflect better the overall economic positioning of each group. Third, we find that the exposure of financials is the key driver of the Brent-WTI spread. It confirms that financial rather than fundamental traders are responsible for integrating the two markets.

We model OPEC as a cartel of nations, not firms, and assume that politicians use two instruments: production quotas and domestic fuel consumption subsidies. The cartel-of-nations model suggests that introduction of alternatives to petroleum products may lead OPEC to reduce exports and increase domestic fuel consumption. The empirical analysis suggests that when OPEC sets production quotas, it places similar weights on consumer and producer surplus. But when OPEC countries set domestic fuel subsidies, on average 6% more weight is given to consumer surplus with some of the OPEC countries pursuing very aggressive domestic cheap fuel policies.

In my experimental posted-offer markets, each seller offers an identical good to buyers with homogeneous preferences. First, sellers simultaneously decide on the price and the tariff structure of their good, then buyers make their choices. Each seller can choose to have a one-, two- or three-part tariff. The tariff structure affects neither the value nor the price of the good but influences buyers' ability to calculate the good's price. The main results show that high-price sellers choose high complexity more often than low-price sellers if buyers are simulated in accordance with the bounded rationality model of Carlin (2009). However, the evidence for this effect is weaker if the buyers are human subjects. Importantly, prices are higher when the sellers can confuse buyers using price complexity than when sellers interact with perfectly rational robot buyers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is because there are more economic reforms in developing countries than in industrialized countries. Hence, it is important to study the inflation persistence in developing countries. The present paper investigates the pattern of inflation persistence in China, a developing and transitional economy. Specifically, the paper studies statistically the number of structural breaks in China's inflation persistence based on the monthly retail price index (MRPI) and the quarterly retail price index (QRPI) inflation series from 1983 to 2011. The findings show that there are five and three structural breaks in the MRPI and QRPI inflation persistence, respectively. The present paper also exposes a high degree of persistence over the whole sample period and a slight decline in the level of the persistence since 1994. Furthermore, the persistence of two inflation series does not change monotonously but with obvious cyclical patterns.

Higher income inequality is associated with lower self-rated life satisfaction. In contrast to expectations that inequality may primarily be an issue of concern for poorer individuals, the relationship holds strongly for higher income households, but the evidence for lower income households is less conclusive. Shadow price estimates indicate that, in order to offset the effect of annual changes in inequality over the sample period (2001-2009), an average Australian would require compensatory changes of approximately 3-9 per cent in income each year (about $3,689 in 2009).","[Nguyen, Jeremy K.] Swinburne Business Sch, Dept Accounting Econ Finance & Law, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia; [Nguyen, Jeremy K.; Fleming, Christopher M.; Su, Jen-Je] Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",,"Nguyen, JK (通讯作者)，Swinburne Business Sch, Dept Accounting Econ Finance & Law, Hawthorn, Vic 3122, Australia.",jdnguyen@swin.edu.au,"Fleming, Christopher/ABE-3736-2020","Fleming, Christopher/0000-0001-7596-7775; Nguyen, Jeremy/0000-0003-0358-1130",Australian Government Department of Social Services,Australian Government Department of Social Services(Australian Government),"The authors wish to thank two anonymous referees for very helpful comments and suggestions, but accept full responsibility for any errors or shortcomings that may remain.

The aim is a dynamic framework for the analysis of the institutional evolution of money, whereby institutional change comes from technology, and the state acts both as regulator of the institutional adjustment and guarantor of the stability and the efficiency of the monetary system. In that sense, the framework outlines the context and principles for the government regulation of financial innovation.","Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Papadopoulos, G (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.",,,"Papadopoulos, Georgios/0000-0002-6428-3156",,,,,39,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The interaction of advertising costs with the consumer's willingness to pay shapes the way markets respond to changes in sunk cost structures. This adjustment may involve firm entry and exit or modifications in advertising levels. It is shown that a non-monotonic association between advertising intensity and concentration may emerge even in the absence of collusion, requiring as a necessary condition that the ratio of operational profits and advertising cost elasticities with respect to a measure of perceived quality be decreasing. This result is robust to changes in both exogenous and endogenous sunk cost parameters. A simple tool is also proposed to empirically assess the behavior of the elasticities ratio. Finally, the model describes how intertemporal general equilibrium mechanisms may skew or even reverse the advertising-concentration relation through scale effects.","Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA",Vassar College,"Sá, N (通讯作者)，Vassar Coll, Dept Econ, Poughkeepsie, NY 12604 USA.",nesa@vassar.edu,,,,,,,39,2,3,1,32,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Among the college educated, there is strong evidence that those with lower skills enter the public sector. In contrast to the private sector, for college-educated public-sector workers, AFQT score is not correlated with pay, and college major is only weakly predictive of pay. Furthermore, simple controls for college major explain most of the public-private-sector pay gap. I conclude that the public-sector pay gap is much smaller than previously estimated and pay rigidities cause significant skill-based selection between the sectors.","Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Schanzenbach, M (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,,,,,,,59,10,13,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

Recent research argues that cognitive abilities explain the relationship. This paper reconciles the competing views by recognizing that net nutrition, a major determinant of adult height, fosters both cognitive and noncognitive abilities. Using data from Britain's National Childhood Development Study, we show that taller children have higher average cognitive and noncognitive test scores and that each aptitude accounts for a substantial and roughly equal portion of the stature-earnings premium. Together, cognitive and noncognitive abilities explain the height premium.","[Schick, Andreas] US FDA, Rockville, MD 20857 USA; [Steckel, Richard H.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",US Food & Drug Administration (FDA); University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Schick, A (通讯作者)，US FDA, Rockville, MD 20857 USA.",,,,,,,,57,25,28,2,26,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",1932-8575,1932-8664,,J HUM CAPITAL,J.

Two common, but untested reasons for this greater caution are the influence of social responsibility and a tendency to conform to the preferences of others. We study changes in risk taking in simple settings, where another's risk taking can sometimes be observed, and where decisions affect not only one's own payoffs but sometimes also affect those of a passive, second party. We find that social responsibility leads to more conservative risk behavior in group decision making. Conformism has a more symmetric effect: observing the choice of another tends to lead both individual and social decisions toward whatever the other's expressed risk preference is. Direct tests fail to link the social behavior we observe to the social preference for distributional fairness common in decision-making under certainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While the burden-sharing principles commonly advocated in climate negotiations reflect different views of what constitutes a fair way to distribute the abatement burden, their use can also be strategically motivated to legitimise a specific bargaining position. In this context, using a threshold public good game with a climate change framing, real monetary incentives and drawing on a sample of individuals from the United States, the European Union, China, India and South Africa, this multi-country study examines the degree to which the use of burden-sharing principles reflects material self-interest. In an initial treatment, participants, who represent the country of which they are a national, choose between various burden-sharing principles. In a subsequent treatment, drawing from Rawls' veil of ignorance, participants are unaware of which country they represent and are randomly allocated to a country after making their decision. A comparison of participants' choices across these two treatments indicates that the use of the historical and future polluter-pays rules by American and Chinese participants is consistent with material self-interest, or, in other words, self-interested use of burden-sharing principles.

This concern on economic instability is evidenced by a broad spectrum of indicators, based on the deviation of observed values of a given economic aggregate from its reference or trend value. In general, the choice of this or that indicator is not discussed advocating that the resulting instability indicators are closely correlated. Focusing on measurements of instability in export revenue data for 134 countries from 1970 to 2005, this paper finds that this assertion may be true for variance-based indicators, measuring the average magnitude of deviations from the trend. However, great discrepancies may arise between different measures of the asymmetry or of the occurrence of extreme deviations around the trend when different trend computation methods are used. Our purpose is, therefore, to invite further discussions regarding the use of these indicators, and to highlight the different dimensions of instability, which have been so far unheeded by the economic literature.","[Cariolle, Joel] FERDI, Paris, France; Univ Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, Clermont Ferrand, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA),"Cariolle, J (通讯作者)，FERDI, Paris, France.",,,"goujon, michael/0000-0002-4356-8347; Cariolle, Joel/0000-0001-7292-9829",,,,,54,15,15,1,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, the overuse of costly punishment may actually harm overall welfare. A main reason for over-punishment is that free-riders generate negative emotions that likely favor excessive punishments. In this paper we ask whether the venting of one's emotions in different ways can reduce the level of excessive punishment in a standard VCM-with-punishment environment while preserving the norm enforcement properties of punishment. We find that venting emotions reduces (excessive) punishment, and under certain conditions the net effect is an increase in final payoffs (i.e., welfare) to the group. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the renewed interest, the concept of populism remains vague, complicating any empirical investigation on its political and economic outcomes. Still, all populist politicians strongly emphasize the defense of the common man's interest against those of privileged elites, suggesting that such governments will have notable implications for economic policy and institutions. Using a non-partisan indicator of populism, this paper seeks to assess the impact of populist policies on institutional change, as measured by the economic freedom of the world index. Results indicate that populist governments actively reduce economic freedom. In particular, they erode legal security, reduce freedom to trade, and tighten economic regulation. Findings expand on previous research with empirical methodology, questioning the importance of ideological orientation in some definitions of populism.","[Rode, Martin] Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31009, Spain; [Revuelta, Julio] Univ Cantabria, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",University of Navarra; Universidad de Cantabria,"Rode, M (通讯作者)，Univ Navarra, Dept Econ, Campus Univ, Pamplona 31009, Spain.",martinrode@unav.es,"Rode, Martin/T-4775-2017; Rode, Martin/AAK-7286-2020; Revuelta, Julio/L-1419-2014","Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838; Rode, Martin/0000-0002-8795-7838; Revuelta, Julio/0000-0002-7516-9826",,,,,58,37,38,1,22,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

The shock absorption index is defined as the largest fraction of the anticipated initial disruption that can be absorbed by the predefined robustness limits. It provides an overall measure of the robustness of an economic system towards a disruptive event, which is driven by both the economic structure and the individual robustness of different sectors.

We model primary government spending and government revenue as time-varying transition probability Markovian processes (TVPMS). We find that while in Italy fiscal policy is substantially neutral vis-a-vis asset price movements, fiscal authorities in the UK and Spain seem to track the dynamics of wealth.

Similarly, in Spain, the spending-side of the fiscal policy plays a dominant role in stabilizing stock and housing markets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We show that this second force affects the growth rate if the consumption goods are produced with technologies exhibiting different capital intensities and if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is not equal to one. Because the aforementioned growth effect of relative prices arises only under heterogeneous consumption goods, the transitional dynamics of this model exhibits striking differences with the growth model with a single consumption good. We also show that these differences in the transitional dynamics can give raise to large discrepancies in the welfare cost of shocks.","[Caballe, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Caballe, Jordi] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, MOVE, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Caballe, Jordi] Barcelona GSE, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain; [Alonso-Carrera, Jaime] Univ Vigo, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ, Vigo, Spain; [Alonso-Carrera, Jaime] Univ Vigo, RGEA, Vigo, Spain; [Raurich, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Teoria Econ, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Raurich, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, CREB, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",Autonomous University of Barcelona; Autonomous University of Barcelona; Barcelona School of Economics; Universidade de Vigo; Universidade de Vigo; University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Caballé, J (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Econ & Hist Econ, Bellaterra 08193, Barcelona, Spain.",jordi.caballe@uab.es,"Raurich, Xavier/Q-8457-2018; Alonso-Carrera, Jaime/M-3877-2019; Caballe, Jordi/K-9199-2014","Raurich, Xavier/0000-0002-5210-1909; Alonso-Carrera, Jaime/0000-0001-8525-7769; Caballe, Jordi/0000-0003-0253-5634",,,,,34,4,4,0,12,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1690,,,BE J MACROECON,B E J.

In this paper, we study the effect of a monthly cash subsidy on the probability that young adults live apart from parents and childbearing. The subsidy, introduced in Spain in 2008, is conditional on young adults renting accommodation, and it amounts to almost 20% of the average youngsters' wage. Our identification strategy exploits the subsidy eligibility age threshold to assess the causal impact of the cash transfer. Difference-in-Differences estimates show positive effects of the policy on the probability of living apart from parents, living with a romantic partner, and childbearing for 22 year-olds compared to 21 year-olds. Results persist when the sample is expanded to include wider age ranges. The effect is larger among young adults earning lower incomes and living in high rental price areas. This is consistent with the hypothesis that youngsters delay household formation because the cost is too high relative to their income.","[Oppedisano, Veruska] London Metropolitan Univ, London E1 7NT, England; [Oppedisano, Veruska] Inst Fiscal Studies, London WC1E7AE, England; [Aparicio-Fenoll, Ainhoa] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy",London Metropolitan University; Collegio Carlo Alberto,"Oppedisano, V (通讯作者)，London Metropolitan Univ, Old Castle St, London E1 7NT, England.",ainhoa.aparicio@carloalberto.org; v.oppedisano@londonmed.ac.uk,,"Aparicio Fenoll, Ainoa/0000-0002-4428-6042",,,,,14,8,8,1,13,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

In this article, we aim to estimate the long-run properties of money demand specification for a number of East Asian economies and within a panel framework with the presence of structural breaks. Various country-specific coefficients are allowed to capture inter-country heterogeneities. Consistent with theoretical postulates, it is found that (a) the demand for money in the long-run positively responds to real income and inversely to the interest rate spread, inflation, the real effective exchange rate and the US real interest rate; (b) the long-run income elasticity is greater than unity; and (c) both the currency substitution and capital mobility hypotheses hold. The empirical findings in this article can provide useful policy guidelines to the East Asian countries' central banks in their quest for price stability. If one of the primary objectives of these countries is to minimize price instability, they should avoid creating unnecessary disequilibrium in the money market, while the employment of cointegration with the presence of structural breaks clearly recommends to central banks to use the supply of money to attain price and macroeconomic stability.","[Apergis, Nicholas] Curtin Univ, Dept Econ, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Apergis, N (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Sch Business, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",nicholas.apergis@northumbria.ac.uk,"Apergis, Nikolas/J-7125-2017",", Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,85,1,2,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Particular attention is given to volatility transmission and conditional correlation changes in the aftermath of the European crisis against the backdrop of countries which have experienced substantial decline in their equity markets. These countries are known as GIPSI (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Italy). In order to compare the conditional correlation and account for indirect transmission, the UK, Germany, and France, also referred to as EU 3, are included. To account for the time-variability of the conditional correlations, a dynamic structure is employed that uses the multivariate DCC model of Engle (2002). In order to gauge the impact of the crisis the data are divided into pre-EU crisis and during/after EU crisis, the results are fourfold. First, with the exception of the Greek market, a significant spillover effect from the GIPSI and EU 3 to the three CEE is noticed. Second, among the three CEE the stock market of Poland has shown a significantly higher level of weighted average conditional correlation as compared to Hungary and the Czech Republic. Third, the EU 3 have a higher level of weighted average correlation as compared to GIPSI and, among the GIPIS countries, Spain and Italy have higher level correlations with three CEE. Fourth, the Greek stock market remains the most volatile out of all the mature markets in the sample but the unconditional and conditional correlations during the sovereign debt crisis are substantially lower with respect to three CEE.","[Bein, Murad A.] Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey",Eastern Mediterranean University,"Bein, MA (通讯作者)，Eastern Mediterranean Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey.",murad.bein@emu.edu.tr,"Bein, Murad Abdurahman/KBB-6401-2024","Bein, Murad Abdurahman/0000-0002-3248-4316",European Social Fund through The Sectoral Operational Programme for Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926],European Social Fund through The Sectoral Operational Programme for Human Resources Development,"This article is a result of the project POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137926, Routes of academicexcellence in doctoral and post-doctoral research, co-funded from European Social Fund through The Sectoral Operational Programme for Human Resources Development 2007-2013.",,36,14,14,0,17,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

Many people feared that SARS would spread through the health care system, and outpatient visits fell by more than 30% in the course of a few weeks. We examine how both public information and the behavior and opinions of peers contributed to this reaction. We identify a peer effect through a difference-in-difference comparison of longtime residents and recent arrivals, who are less socially connected. Although several forms of social interaction may contribute to this pattern, social learning is a plausible explanation for our finding.

We conclude that inflation targeting has not led to a stronger response to inflation in the reaction function of the monetary authority. This result suggests that inflation targeting being meant to anchor inflation expectations through enhanced credibility and accountability, it may enable a central bank to stabilize inflation without pursuing aggressive action toward inflation variations.","[Creel, Jerome; Hubert, Paul] OFCE Sci Po, F-75340 Paris 07, France; [Creel, Jerome] ESCP Europe, F-75340 Paris 07, France",heSam Universite; ESCP Business School,"Creel, J (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75340 Paris 07, France.",jerome.creel@ofce.sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,74,12,12,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Using a panel of U.S. state and local government spending data, empirical tests based on this combined framework show that the effect of intergovernmental competition predicted by the Leviathan model is partially offset by the Law of 1/n.

There is no competition between two companies which offer similar products. Competition is between their Supply Chains where human resources plays an important role. Inside of any Supply Chain is created value. For the value created the final client will pay in order to get the own satisfaction. Behind the value created are processes, activities, functions, critical factors, strategies and so on, as components of Supply Chain Management. Trough human recourses implication an efficient Supply Chain achieves its objectives as optimized or minimized inventory, the whole cost of Supply Chain reduced, delivery time of products to the final consumer can be improved or flexibility can be enhanced. Value-added within manufacturing process for example is provided by flexibility (a good reaction and adjustment to customer's enquiry), quality of goods, production system able to reduce activity time, cost processes or to identify the bottlenecks which will improve the next production processes. Supply Chain Management performance shows the entire chain ability to meet end-customer needs through product availability and responsive, on-time delivery but keeping under permanent control the company boundaries. Because of Supply Chain Management meaning, the flow of information, products and services across a network of supply chain partners, manufacturing plants, and customers, the most challenging key factor would be an accurate communication. Communication between Supply Chain partners, processes, either vertically or horizontally is the efficient information. Based on it, the top management of each company should take decision for all business level. Partners of Supply Chains share up to date information with regards to sales, demand forecasts, inventory levels, production capacity, minim maxim boundaries, marketing campaigns, and so on. Inaccurate or distorted information leads to the Bullwhip Effect, the moment when a stable demand becomes lumpy orders through the Supply Chain.","Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dinu, MD (通讯作者)，Acad Econ Studies Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania.",danielapopa74@yahoo.com,,,,,,,10,0,0,0,6,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,377,383,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600044,0

Specifically, home production takes housing, home input, and home hours as inputs and produces a good that is substitutable with market good. As such, the model differentiates both consumption goods and labor effort according to their respective roles in home production and market activities. Using a calibrated model, we conduct a policy experiment where we eliminate the current pay-as-you-go Social Security system. We find that the experiment has important implications for labor supply as well as consumption decisions and that these decisions are influenced by the presence of the home production technology. More importantly, comparing our economy to a one-good economy without home production, the welfare gains of eliminating Social Security are magnified significantly especially in the long run. The reasons are twofold and related to the general aspects of home production. First, home production implies a more elastic labor supply rendering the payroll labor tax more distortionary. Second, home production introduces insurance possibilities that are not present when only market-produced goods are available and, thus, reduces the need for government redistributive policies.

Subsequent leading theorists were not as explicit, although economic theory continued to be influenced by physics as the work of Pareto, Fisher and Samuelson indicates. However, the physics methodological framework has made a recent reappearance in the relatively new field of econophysics. Although there are a few methodological similarities, there are also many important differences between mainstream economics and econophysics. Econophysicists' emphasis to statistical mechanics rather to mechanical models, their reservations towards rational agent theory and their rejection of many standard assumptions of mainstream economics are examples of such differences. The paper examines the above from a methodological viewpoint. It also discusses the possible reasons for this historical development and its implications for economic methodology.","[Drakopoulos, Stavros] Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Univ Campus, Athens 15771, Greece; [Katselidis, Ioannis] Athens Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Athens 10434, Greece",National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; Athens University of Economics & Business,"Drakopoulos, S (通讯作者)，Univ Athens, Dept Philosophy & Hist Sci, Univ Campus, Athens 15771, Greece.",sdrakop@phs.uoa.gr,"Drakopoulos, Stavros A./H-5089-2019","Drakopoulos, Stavros A./0000-0001-9884-9261",,,,,86,8,8,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The paper analyses networking, virtual workplace, and other characteristics of job design in entrepreneurial organisation. Results of the research in Lithuanian organisations show positive correlations between corporate entrepreneurship, networking at the workplace, and virtual workplace. Moreover, more entrepreneurial and less entrepreneurial organisations differ in job complexity. No significant correlation between corporate entrepreneurship and two other characteristics of job design, i.e. multitasking and job autonomy, was found. However, they have relationships with virtual workplace as well as networking or job complexity.

We assume small or mid-size loans that are assigned in a standardized way and collateralized by residential or commercial property. The focus on this specific type of loans entails two major advantages: Firstly, reduction of complexity is followed by easier-to-grasp methodology and increased handiness of results when comparing with other recent approaches in the field. Secondly, the focussing allows to take into account the characteristic properties of the housing market and its underlying uncertainty and so choose a tailor-made modeling for the collateral. The choice of an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion as the stochastic process of the collateral combines the desirable features with the charm of analytical solvability which seems to be of advantage as regards acceptance among practitioners. Further key improvements of this approach are the explicit consideration of loan ranking, the disentanglement of the time of default and the time of liquidation as well as the introduction of liquidation cost.

We apply demand estimation techniques to betting market data, and find that the observed FLB is explained by a two-type population consisting of canonical traders, who hold virtually correct beliefs and are the majority type in the population (70%); and noise traders exhibiting significant belief dispersion. Furthermore, exploiting variation in public information across markets in our data set, we show that our belief heterogeneity model empirically outperforms existing preference-based explanations of the FLB.","[Gandhi, Amit] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison,"Gandhi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Madison, WI 53706 USA.",,,,,,,,55,21,22,2,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

Our decompositions of the poor/nonpoor income gap suggest that at least three-fourths of the gap is explained by differences in productive factors.

Our model accounts for the joint effects of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent oil markets and simultaneously captures asymmetry, volatility persistence and regime shifts contained in the underlying financial data. We find that stock market returns strongly exhibit a regime-switching behaviour, but they react differently to the increases in the price of oil. More precisely, the conditional volatility of studied stock markets during the bear market phases is found to be less affected by oil price surges than during the bull market phases. Whether the effects of oil shocks are positive or negative depends greatly on the degree of reliance on imported oil, the share of the cost of oil in the national income and the degree of improvement in energy efficiency of a given country. Finally, the relatively opposite effects of the WTI and Brent oil markets suggest the potential of substitution between them as well as the necessity of a diversification strategy of oil supply sources.","[Jammazi, Rania] Int Finance Grp Tunisia, Sousse 4023, Tunisia; [Jammazi, Rania] Univ Sousse, Sousse 4023, Tunisia; [Duc Khuong Nguyen] IPAG Business Sch, IPAG LAB, F-75006 Paris, France",Universite de Sousse; IPAG Business School,"Nguyen, DK (通讯作者)，IPAG Business Sch, IPAG LAB, F-75006 Paris, France.",duc.nguyen@ipag.fr,"Nguyen, Duc Khuong/AAE-6889-2020","Nguyen, Duc Khuong/0000-0002-7796-8787",,,,,65,19,19,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This leveraging (and deleveraging) cycle cannot be accounted for by the relaxation, and subsequent tightening, of collateral requirements in mortgage markets observed during the same period. We base this conclusion on a quantitative dynamic general equilibrium model calibrated using macroeconomic aggregates. and microeconomic data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. From the perspective of the model, the credit cycle is more likely due to factors that impacted house prices more directly, thus affecting the availability of credit through a change in collateral values. In either case, the macroeconomic consequences of leveraging and deleveraging are relatively minor, because the responses of borrowers and lenders roughly wash out in the aggregate. These results suggest that household debt overhang alone cannot account for the slow recovery from the Great Recession. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is desirable to find a model of public finance policy that respects the achievement of macroeconomic stability while eliminating the increasing indebtedness of the economy.

The results show evidence of both a common time-varying trend and a common transitory component between inflation and short-term inflation expectations from households, professionals and markets. While the common time-varying trend has declined in both level and volatility since the early 1980s, it was found that consumer expectations are disproportionately influenced by the visibility of prices of select few goods. Roughly speaking, a 1% point increase in food and energy prices leads to about 1/3% point increase in consumer forecasts of inflation. In terms of policymaking, this finding suggests that stability in highly visible prices can moderate inflation in a meaningful way.","[Palardy, Joseph; Ovaska, Tomi] Youngstown State Univ, Dept Econ, Youngstown, OH 44555 USA",University System of Ohio; Youngstown State University,"Ovaska, T (通讯作者)，Youngstown State Univ, Dept Econ, Youngstown, OH 44555 USA.",tpovaska@ysu.edu,"Ovaska, Tomi/AAG-2390-2019","Ovaska, Tomi/0000-0002-3618-3406",,,,,30,7,7,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This in turn raised the interest in consumer engagement, which was described as a psychological state that occurs by virtue of interactive customer experiences with a company or a brand (Brodie at al., 2011). Recent research in marketing highlights the importance of the role of consumer engagement into value co-creation, providing a considerable number of studies, exploring the drivers, types, dimensions of consumer engagement as well as its outcomes, as expressed by consumer perceived value, loyalty, etc. However, as yet there is a lack of understanding how consumer engagement contributes to value co-creation and what benefits it brings to the company as well as to consumer. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to explore the role of consumer engagement in value co-creation from the company's perspective, identifying the value company gets as an outcome of co-creation process. The focus on the value for company in this article is explained by the fact that it is traditionally analysed mainly through economic perspective, meanwhile consumer perceived value is agreed being multidimensional. The authors of this article suggest that value for company, as generated through co-creation process, should also be viewed as multidimensional and propose three-dimensional structure: economic, social and functional value. The study contributes to the domain of consumer engagement and value co-creation research by revealing the techniques of consumer engagement, with an emphasis on gamification as one of them, and diverse benefits the cocreation processes bring to company through the analysis of focus group discussion with representatives of companies in Lithuania that engage consumers in value co-creation.","[Piligrimiene, Zaneta; Dovaliene, Aiste; Virvilaite, Regina] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Piligrimiene, Z (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",zaneta.piligrimiene@ktu.lt; aiste.dovaliene@ktu.lt; regina.virvilaite@ktu.lt,"Dovaliene, Aiste/HJY-5606-2023","Gravelines, Zaneta/0000-0003-3930-2383",European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure,European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure,This research is funded by the European Social Fund under the Global Grant measure.,,36,30,36,7,133,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It is an internal mechanism that controls and monitors the actions of managers and aligns the utility functions between corporate owners and managers. The board of directors performs multiple functions that concern, for example, the replacement of the managers, financial policy, the preparation of strategic plans and other actions that affect the performance of the company. The board plays an important role since on the one hand it controls the actions of management and on the other it advises the management regarding the strategies to be adopted. In this study, 100 announcements regarding the appointment of the board of directors of 100 Italian listed companies during the period 2012-2014 are investigated. The results show a positive reaction within 20 days around the announcement date. In four of the six time windows, cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) are positive and statistically significant. The positive reaction of the market would appear, however, to be linked more to the composition of the board of directors than to the size of the board of directors.","[Rossi, Fabrizio] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy; [Cebula, Richard J.] Jacksonville Univ, Davis Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA",University of Cassino; Jacksonville University,"Cebula, RJ (通讯作者)，Jacksonville Univ, Davis Coll Business, Jacksonville, FL 32211 USA.",rcebula@ju.edu,"Rossi, Fabrizio/AAL-5961-2021; Cebula, Richard J/P-7535-2018",,,,,,44,9,10,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The results indicate that a standard deviation increase in services liberalization within a firm is associated with a 9.2 percent increase in TFP. The effect is stronger for firms with high productivity, bringing about a reallocation of resources within an industry. Industry-level results show that the effect of reallocation on industry productivity is almost as strong as the within-firm effect. The dynamic interaction of services liberalization and TFP through the investment channel reinforces the effect. The effect is robust to different estimation methods and to different sub-samples of the data.

The long-run model is estimated on annual data for the period 1950-1951 to 2009-2010. The optimal single-equation and maximum-likelihood (ML) system estimates of the model provide a consistent support for the long-run relationship between imports and exports. The OLSGH estimates provide no support and that ML system estimates a consistent support for cointegration in both the models estimated with one and two structural breaks in level. The new cointegration breakdown tests generally suggest that the cointegration prevails from 1951 to 2010. The evidence supporting the cointegration between imports and exports overwhelms the evidence providing a mixed or no support for cointegration. The estimates of slope parameter above zero and the dominant support for cointegration between imports and exports vindicate the validity of IBC and the sustainability of CADs. The short-term management strategies need to be accompanied by long-term improvements in productivity to reduce inflation, lever up the competitiveness of exports and ensure the sustainability of the external value of domestic currency.","Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Singh, T (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Griffith Business Sch, Nathan Campus,170 Kessels Rd, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",Tarlok.Singh@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,47,8,8,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Instead of business cycle linkages, however, this paper examines the evolution of the dependence of ASEAN-5 and other Asian economies on their traditional and emerging growth engines (the United States, EU, Japan, China, and India). For this we use a structural vector autoregression model that yields time-varying growth multiplier effects. Although China has overtaken others as a major export destination for ASEAN-5 and despite the United States losing much of its relative economic clout in Asia, the multiplier effects show that the United States is still about 1.5 times more growth-enhancing than China for ASEAN-5. The EU has also not lost out completely to China as a growth engine. China, however, has overtaken Japan to become about 1.88 times more growth enhancing than Japan for ASEAN-5. India has yet to become a significant growth engine, although it is of increasing importance to Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia.

We test for the presence of hidden cointegration across 12 sub-Saharan African countries spanning the period 1971-2011. The empirical results confirm the growth hypothesis for a subset of countries, suggesting that their growth could be adversely affected by conservation policies, while for a second subgroup of countries they confirm the conservation hypothesis, indicating that conservation policies could enhance the growth process in these countries. The differentiation of the results could be captured entirely by the linear approach, indicating that the lack of cointegration between renewable energy production and economic growth found in previous studies may be due to failures to properly delimit the nonlinearity property in the data.","[Tiwari, Aviral Kumar] ICFAI Univ, Kamalghat, India; [Apergis, Nicholas] Curtin Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; [Olayeni, Olaolu Richard] Obafemi Awolowo Univ, Ife, Nigeria",Curtin University; Obafemi Awolowo University,"Apergis, N (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Nick.Apergis@curtin.edu.au,"Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011; Apergis, Nikolas/J-7125-2017","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263; , Nick/0000-0002-0375-2457",,,,,35,29,29,2,25,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We investigate the hypothesis of increasing globalization by examining the convergence of prices for refined products across different markets. Using data on refined products from market centers in the US and Europe, we test for convergence of prices using standard time-series techniques. The data plainly show that markets for refined petroleum products have become more interrelated as Europe exported its gasoline surplus and global demand for petroleum products approached refining capacity. Econometric evidence supports the hypothesis that the US and European markets for oil and refined products are integrated. We find evidence that a structural break during the financial crisis of 2008 changed the long-run equilibrium price relationships and the short-run price dynamics. Refined product markets are likely to experience continued globalization given trends in the United States and Europe and because of key export-oriented refining capacity investments made to take advantage of access to specific crude oil sources.

We find that there exists a great dispersion in environmental efficiencies across provinces and regions, and the growth of environmental productivity is almost due to the environmental technical change rather than the environmental efficiency change.

A persistent sticky floor effect and declining gender wage gaps over time are observed. Aggregate decompositions using a reweighting approach show that most of the gap and changes in gaps are due to (changing) coefficients effect. Detailed decompositions show that within the (changing) characteristics effect, education contributes to the narrowing of the gap over the whole distribution, and within the coefficients effect age and the constant term are the most influential factors but with opposite effects.","[Adireksombat, Kampon] Siam Commercial Bank, Econ Intelligence Ctr, Bangkok, Thailand; [Fang, Zheng; Sakellariou, Chris] Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Sakellariou, C (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore, Singapore.",kampon@gmail.com; fangzheng@unisim.edu.sg; ACSAKE@ntu.edu.sg,"Fang, Zheng/H-4201-2019","Fang, Zheng/0000-0002-8622-8959; Sakellariou, Chris/0000-0003-3299-4348",,,,,40,0,1,0,12,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

This idea finds a strong theoretical support in credit rationing theory. However, this is vigorously challenged by De Meza and Webb (1987, 2000) suggesting that firms can benefit from an excess of credit, i.e. overlending. Credit rationing or overlending? The contribution of this empirical article is twofold: to our knowledge, it is the first to make an attempt in measuring the relative importance of these two types of financing imperfection and to explore factors leading to one or the other. We exploit a rich panel data set on the access to bank credit for new French businesses during the mid-1990s. Our results show that credit rationing was not highly spread among French new firms. The story told by De Meza and Webb (1987) appears to be a much more realistic model. In addition, we identify factors, linked to the starter, the project or the industry, that are closely associated with credit rationing and/or overlending. Most factors enter into a consistent relation: when they are positively (negatively) associated with credit rationing, they are negatively (positively) associated with overlending.","[Bonnet, Jean] Univ Caen, UMR CNRS 6211, Fac Econ & Business Adm, CREM CAEN, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14032 Caen, France; [Cieply, Sylvie] Univ Caen, UMR CNRS 6211, Inst Banque Assurance, CREM CAEN, Caen, France; [Dejardin, Marcus] Catholic Univ Louvain, Fac Econ Social & Polit Sci, Namur, Belgium; [Dejardin, Marcus] Univ Namur, CERPE, Namur, Belgium",Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite de Caen Normandie; Universite Catholique Louvain; University of Namur,"Bonnet, J (通讯作者)，Univ Caen, UMR CNRS 6211, Fac Econ & Business Adm, CREM CAEN, 19 Rue Claude Bloch, F-14032 Caen, France.",jean.bonnet@unicaen.fr,"Bonnet, Jean/H-1841-2015; Dejardin, Marcus/ABB-3285-2020","Bonnet, Jean/0000-0001-9718-3939;",,,,,50,10,12,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper analyses a different remuneration system: employee share ownership. We find that whether firms choose to share ownership or not depends on both the type of competition in the product market and the way in which workers organise to negotiate wages. If wage setting is decentralised, under duopolistic Cournot competition both firms share ownership. If wage setting is centralised, only one firm shares ownership if the degree to which goods are substitutes takes an intermediate value; otherwise, the two firms share ownership. In this case, if the union sets the same wage for all workers neither firm shares ownership. Therefore, centralised wage setting discourages share ownership. Finally, under Bertrand competition neither firm shares ownership regardless of how workers are organised to negotiate wages.","[Carlos Barcena-Ruiz, Juan] Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Bárcena-Ruiz, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Dept Fundamentos Anal Econ 1, UPV EHU, Ave Lehendakari Aguirre, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",juancarlos.barcena@ehu.es,"Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/G-6104-2011","Barcena-Ruiz, Juan Carlos/0000-0002-8808-2543","Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia [ECO2012-32299, ECO2015-66803-P]; Gobierno Vasco [IT1124-16]; University of the Basque Country [EHU14/05]",Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Spanish Government); Gobierno Vasco(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country,"We would like to thank three referees for their helpful suggestions.

The asymmetric triangular mixing density has the potential to overcome behavioural limitations associated with the most frequently applied mixing densities like the normal and lognormal distribution. With only three parameters it remains parsimonious whilst its bounded support can easily be brought in line with behavioural intuitions. The triangular mixing density is not associated with an incredibly large upper (or lower) bound and it can accommodate varying degrees of skewness in unobserved preference heterogeneity. The proposed estimation procedure is based on the principle of mixture densities and circumvents additional simulation chatter arising when applying the inverse cumulative density function method to generate draws from the mixing density.,"[Dekker, Thijs] Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",University of Leeds,"Dekker, T (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Inst Transport Studies, 36-40 Univ Rd, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",t.dekker@leeds.ac.uk,"Dekker, Thijs/M-7763-2013","Dekker, Thijs/0000-0003-2313-8419",,,,,10,4,4,0,3,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",1755-5345,,,J CHOICE MODEL,J.

The central feature of the ball-catching task is that it allows researchers to manipulate the cost of effort function as well as the production function, which permits quantitative predictions on effort provision. In an experiment with piece-rate incentives we find that the comparative static and the point predictions on effort provision are remarkably accurate.

Specifically, we consider the effects of monetary policy on the length of production time and entry and exit decisions for firms. We show that higher rates of inflation cause households to substitute away from money balances and increase the allocation of bonds in their portfolio thereby causing a decline in the real interest rate. The decline in the real interest rate causes the period of production to increase and the productivity thresholds for entry and exit to decline. This implies that when the real interest rate declines, prospective firms are more likely to enter the market and existing firms are more likely to stay in the market. Finally, we present reduced form empirical evidence consistent with the predictions of the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using an augmented gravity model that controls for the endogeneity problem in our estimation, we introduce a war variable and distinguish between different types of conflicts. The results show that wars have a significantly negative impact on exports, imports and trade. Civil conflicts hinder exports, imports and trade significantly. The disaggregated version of the gravity model shows that non-state conflicts have a detrimental effect on bilateral trade flows in manufacturing, and that none of the conflicts do affect trade in services. We also find that, on average, a conflict is equivalent to a tariff of 5% of the value of trade.","[Karam, Fida] Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Hawally, Kuwait; [Zaki, Chahir] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt",Gulf University for Science & Technology (GUST); Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Karam, F (通讯作者)，Gulf Univ Sci & Technol, Hawally, Kuwait.",Karam.f@gust.edu.kw,"Zaki, Chahir/AFQ-2972-2022; Karam, Fida/K-5366-2018","Karam, Fida/0000-0002-3144-8006",African Growth & Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP),African Growth & Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP),This work was supported by the African Growth & Development Policy Modeling Consortium (AGRODEP) facilitated by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).,,39,2,2,2,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The authors highlight the initial arguments of supporters and opponents of this accession, the ways in which those arguments are presented in the media, and the differences in the standpoints of the business, government and expert communities. The authors further analyze changes in the content of this discussion and its discursive space following Russia's accession to the WTO. Our research on print media shows that positive assessments of Russia's accession to the WTO prevailed before it entered into force. However, after the accession negative assessments started to dominate. This may be explained by the fact that before the accession it was mainly politicians and officials who expressed support for the act, while after the accession the negative views of the business community became more prevalent. Politicians and officials supported the accession by relying on abstract values of progress and open markets, while businessmen's (mainly agribusiness) views took into account the non-competitiveness of their industries. Media campaigns helped some industries to create images of victims (resulting from enforcement of the treaty) in order to legitimize the industry lobby and the need for government subsidies to compensate for the damage caused by the WTO.","[Kazun, Anastasia; Barsukova, Svetlana] Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, Moscow, Russia; [Kazun, Anastasia; Barsukova, Svetlana] HSE Dept Econ Sociol, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Kazun, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ, Higher Sch Econ, Lab Studies Econ Sociol, Moscow, Russia.;Kazun, A (通讯作者)，HSE Dept Econ Sociol, Moscow, Russia.",adkazun@hse.ru; sbarsukova@hse.ru,"Barsukova, Svetlana/ABG-2575-2021",,,,,,51,0,0,0,7,NECPLUS,PARIS,"16, RUE CLAUDE TILLIER, PARIS, 75012, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

A legal claim to subsidized child care became effective for children aged 1 year or older. Moreover, a new child care allowance ('Betreuungsgeld') came into effect. It is granted to families who do not use publicly subsidized child care. Both reforms target children of the same age group and are unconditional on parents' income or employment status, yet affect mothers' incentives for labor supply and child care choices differently. Our model facilitates estimating the joint reform impact as well as disentangling the individual effects of both policies. A new comprehensive data set with information on labor supply, the use of and potential access restrictions to various child care arrangements is used. We find the overall effect of both reforms to be small but positive as far as mother's labor supply and the use of formal care is concerned. The legal claim's positive impact on mothers' labor supply and the use of formal child care is largely offset by the negative effect on both outcomes resulting from the introduction of the child care allowance.

We contributed to this debate with an early study, The Effect of File Sharing on Record Sales: An Empirical Analysis, that was published in the Journal of Political Economy in 2007. Perhaps surprisingly, we found that piracy contributed to the decline in music sales but was not the main cause. In this article, we review and respond to recent criticism of our work by Stan Liebowitz in Econ Journal Watch. We show how the use of proxies for file sharing can result in misleading conclusions. We close by reviewing what we know about the impact of file sharing on record sales today. In our view, new music formats are an important if understudied channel through which changes in technology influence the demand for entertainment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our results suggest that credit ratings along with global financial conditions re the main determinants of EMBIG spreads. The determinants of EMBIG spreads are not invariant to speculative and investment grade episodes and transitions between them. The recent global crisis changed the determinants of EMBIG spreads and led to credit ratings' impact to converge between speculative and investment grade countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Even without any increase of payment or fringe benefits, promotion could provide an incentive for hard work because it could be a signal of one's ability and the possibility of a better job offer in one's future career. Outside firms that cannot observe the agents' current performance use promotion status in order to predict the agents' ability. We point out that some of the results of the standard career concerns model do not hold here. Because promotion is a binary decision, extra effort becomes effective only when the promotion has not been made without it. This shows that the dispersion of an agent's ability and noise as well as well-known signal-to-noise ratio play important roles in promotion.","[Park, Sangwon] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imun Dong, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Park, S (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 270 Imun Dong, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",swonpark@hufs.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,This work was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund.

We show that, in spite of the public news firm maximizing social welfare, neither media plurality nor social welfare needs to be higher under the mixed duopoly compared with the private duopoly.

This paper uses a comparative perspective in examining Indonesia's role in automotive production networks in the context of the contemporary debate on opportunities for reaping gains from economic globalization through engagement in global production sharing. This research aims to answer two questions; the first addresses the determinants of a country's participation in the global production network, the second asks why Indonesia is being left behind in global production networks. Our analysis is based on the Jones and Kierzkowski fragmentation theory. The unbalanced panel trade data for 98 countries for the period 1988-2007 are estimated using the least square dummy variable method. The results show that in Asian countries, foreign direct investment openness is the most important determinant followed by trade cost, trade openness, competitiveness, and labor quality. Indonesia is being left behind for a number of reasons, such as restrictive foreign investment policies, higher trade costs and remaining high protection in the automotive sector in terms of tariff and non-tariff measure, and a low education level that hampers the absorption capacity in technology.","[Soejachmoen, Moekti P.] Mandiri Inst, Plaza Bapindo,Mandiri Tower,18th Floor, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia",,"Soejachmoen, MP (通讯作者)，Mandiri Inst, Plaza Bapindo,Mandiri Tower,18th Floor, Jakarta 12190, Indonesia.",moekti.soejachmoen@bankmandiri.co.id,,,,,,,23,6,6,2,201,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

With loan guarantee, government provides financial guarantees to enhance project creditworthiness. With direct investment, government invests capital directly in the project. In both forms of support, the government receives shares proportional to its financial commitment. We find that loan guarantees are more effective in reducing project borrowing costs. In a perfect information environment, loan guarantee support will yield more wealth to the government than a cost equivalent direct investment. But, in an informationally asymmetric environment where the government knows less about project quality than do private partners, in other words the so-called plum problem rather than the familiar lemon problem, this implication is mitigated. We show how the portion of shares given to the government can be a bargaining tool and can mitigate information asymmetry when structuring PPPs. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It might be officially launched one day by the UK government, but without any certainty as to whether it would be completed at all. There seems to be no trade policy model, which would be optimal for both sides: keeping the UK within the Single European market for goods and capital, while introducing constraints on the free flow of labour is not a real option. A possible strategy for both parties may be procrastination: declaring that Brexit is underway, but maintaining the pre-2016 conditions of economic co-operation and integration, prolonging the current Cat-like situation.","[Toeroek, Adam] Univ Pannonia, Econ, Veszprem, Hungary; [Toeroek, Adam] Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, Hungary",University of Pannonia; Budapest University of Technology & Economics,"Török, A (通讯作者)，Univ Pannonia, Econ, Veszprem, Hungary.;Török, A (通讯作者)，Budapest Univ Technol & Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",torok.adam@yahoo.com,,,,,,,27,1,1,0,10,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We employ multivariate probit and instrumental variable techniques to model adoption decisions and their impact. We find that the adoption of both modern inputs (inorganic fertiliser and improved seed) and organic fertiliser is positively associated with crop productivity and crop income. The use of crop residues does not seem to correlate positively with crop productivity and could even have a negative effect. We find a strong negative association on crop productivity among households reporting that they had experienced a delayed onset of the rainy season. We also find that factors driving modern input use are different from those of crop residues and organic fertiliser. While the latter can be characterised as low-investment capital requirements, more labour requirements and longer times for results, the former includes higher investment capital requirements, fewer labour requirements and shorter times for returns. Furthermore, we find that weather variability is one of the strongest determinants of the type of practice adopted. In regions with greater rainfall and temperature variability, crop residue incorporation into soils is more widely adopted. The probability of using modern inputs and organic fertiliser is negatively and strongly correlated with variability in rainfall and temperature. Households with higher levels of wealth, education and labour are most likely to adopt modern inputs. Distance to the nearest market and extension service also plays a strong role in adoption; the greater the distance, the less likely they are to use modern inputs. The converse holds true for organic fertiliser use: the greater distance the farm household is from the market and the extension centre, the more likely it is to use organic fertiliser.","[Asfaw, Solomon; Lipper, Leslie] UN, Food & Agr Org, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Econ & Social Dev, Viale Terme di Caracalla, Rome, Italy; [Di Battista, Federica] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy",Food & Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO); University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Asfaw, S (通讯作者)，UN, Food & Agr Org, Agr Dev Econ Div ESA, Econ & Social Dev, Viale Terme di Caracalla, Rome, Italy.",Solomon.asfaw@fao.org,,,,,,,73,80,88,1,29,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

Do some policies complement each other? Do others substitute for each other? To address these questions, we develop a two-country dynamic general equilibrium model with entry and exit of firms that are monopolistic competitors. Distortions in the model include barriers to entry of firms, barriers to international trade, and barriers to contract enforcement. We find that a reform that reduces one of these distortions has different effects depending on the other distortions present. In particular, reforms to trade barriers and barriers to the entry of new firms are substitutes, as are reforms to contract enforcement and trade barriers. In contrast, reforms to contract enforcement and the barriers to entry are complements. Finally, the optimal sequencing of reforms requires reforming trade barriers before contract enforcement.

In turn we provide a direct empirical test of the hypotheses coined by Amartya Sen that the salience of a real identity escalates conflict but that of a mere classification would not do so. In a baseline treatment, two groups - East Asians and Caucasians - engage in a group contest, but information on the racial composition of the groups is not revealed. In the minimal identity treatment each group is arbitrarily given a different color code, whereas in the real identity treatment the race information is revealed. Supporting Sen's hypotheses, we find that compared to the baseline, free-riding declines and conflict effort increases in the real identity treatment but not in the minimal identity treatment. Moreover, this occurs due to an increase in efforts in the real identity treatment by females in both racial groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our framework incorporates such regulations into the Lucas (1978) model and applies it to France where many labor laws start to bind on firms with 50 or more employees. Using population data on firms between 1995 and 2007, we structurally estimate the key parameters of our model to construct counterfactual size, productivity, and welfare distributions. We find that the cost of these regulations is equivalent to that of a 2.3 percent variable tax on labor. In our baseline case with French levels of partial real wage inflexibility, welfare costs of the regulations are 3.4 percent of GDP (falling to 1.3 percent if real wages were perfectly flexible downward). The main losers from the regulation are workers-and to a lesser extent, large firms-and the main winners are small firms.","[Garicano, Luis] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Garicano, Luis] London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Garicano, Luis; Lelarge, Claire; Van Reenen, John] CEPR, London, England; [Lelarge, Claire] Banque France, Ctr Econ Performance, DGEI DEMS SAMIC 46 2401, F-75049 Paris 01, France; [Van Reenen, John] MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Van Reenen, John] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK; European Central Bank; Bank of France; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Garicano, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Management, Dept Econ, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Garicano, L (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Ctr Econ Performance, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.;Garicano, L (通讯作者)，CEPR, London, England.",luis.garicano@gmail.com; claire.lelarge@banque-france.fr; vanreene@mit.edu,"Van Reenen, John/AAG-9587-2019",,Economic and Social Research Council; International Growth Centre; European Commission; ESRC [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/M010341/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); International Growth Centre; European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"Garicano: Department of Management, Department of Economics, and Centre for Economic Performance, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London, WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom, and CEPR (e-mail: luis.garicano@gmail.com); Lelarge: Banque de France, 46-2401 DGEI-DEMS-SAMIC, 75049 Paris Cedex 01, France, Centre for Economic Performance, and CEPR (e-mail: claire.lelarge@banque-france.fr); Van Reenen: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02139, CEPR, and NBER (email: vanreene@mit.edu).

Endogenous depreciation is an important element of the model, as it has been shown to produce a significant negative effect of energy prices on output. I show that the amplifying effect of endogenous depreciation is determined by the choice of the functional form and calibration strategy for the energy cost function. My estimates of the energy cost function allow to conclude that the energy price shock has only a moderate effect on output in this model, while endogenous depreciation mitigates rather than amplifies the effect of the energy price shock.","[Kormilitsina, Anna] Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA",Southern Methodist University,"Kormilitsina, A (通讯作者)，Southern Methodist Univ, Dept Econ, Dallas, TX 75275 USA.",annak@smu.edu,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,2,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We estimate a dynamic model of international multi-product firms that set prices in different currencies while facing price adjustment costs. We find that large price adjustment costs are not needed to rationalize the substantial degree of price inertia we observe in the data. Intuitively, since GDP, wages and exchange rates exhibit such a large degree of auto correlation, small adjustment costs can explain very persistent prices. Also, accounting for country-specific price sensitivity, wages, GDP and exchange rates, the price adjustment costs should differ substantially across producers and markets to match the data.

Each agent receives a private signal about the underlying state of the world, observes the past actions in a neighborhood of individuals, and chooses her action attempting to match the true state. In contrast to the most existing literature that assumes an exogenous observation structure, observation in this paper is endogenous. More specifically, each agent must pay a cost to make any observation and can strategically choose the set of actions to observe. I show that when private beliefs are strong relative to cost, observation becomes fully informative if and only if the size of the observed actions extends to infinity.

A dilemma for energy conserving homeowners,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Price premium; Energy efficient housing; Single-family houses; Energy saving potential; Building attributes; Energy performance certificate,RESIDENTIAL ENERGY; PERFORMANCE; PRICES; IMPACT,"In this paper the issue of market capitalization of energy efficient buildings is addressed by considering single-family housing in Sweden and through analyzing as to what extent the market price for a house is influenced by its energy performance. Are Swedish homeowners doing well by doing good? We make use of information provided by the Swedish energy performance certificates for single-family homes matched with data on the corresponding transaction prices, household characteristics and attributes of the neighborhood. The resulting database, covering about 77,000 individual observations, is used to analyze the relationship between the price of a house and its energy performance by means of a hedonic model. Unlike most other studies the energy performance is decomposed into energy consumption and several other variables characterizing the energy system. The main question addressed is if there is a price premium for energy efficient housing in Sweden. Our results differ from earlier studies and indicate no price premium related to the energy consumption but substantial premiums for housing attributes that improve the energy efficiency. A likely explanation is that prospective buyers of new homes base their expectations about future energy consumption on those attributes rather than on the energy consumption of the previous owner.

We find that behavior in conflict depends on whether one is harmed by actions perpetrated by the out-group, but not on one's own influence on the outcome of the out-group. The perceived target of threat dramatically alters decisions to participate in conflict. When people perceive their group to be under threat, they are mobilized to do what is good for the group and contribute to the conflict. On the other hand, if people perceive to be personally under threat, they are driven to do what is good for themselves and withhold their contribution. The first phenomenon is attributed to group identity, possibly combined with a concern for social welfare. The second phenomenon is attributed to a novel victim effect. Another social motive-reciprocity-is ruled out by the data. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this article, the impact of the commodity boom of the 2000s on Latin American and Caribbean economies is studied by analyzing four categories of commodity exports (agricultural raw materials, fuel, food, ore and minerals) as well as manufactured exports. Latin American and Caribbean economies had higher growth during the 2000s than in the period before the commodities boom. This study examines whether the higher growth was explained by the commodity boom, and if so, which of the different export commodities accounted for this higher growth. The findings should be relevant to understanding the effects on economic growth of a possible bust in commodity prices. The results show that ore and mineral exports, fuel exports and food exports generally had a negative effect on GDP per capita growth but ore and mineral exports had a positive effect on LAC countries during the boom. During the boom period, agricultural exports had negative effects, especially for LAC countries. Fuel exports had a positive effect on LAC and non-LAC countries during the boom. Manufacturing exports in general had a positive effect on economic growth, but in the boom period this effect almost disappeared for the LAC countries.","[Kristjanpoller, Werner; Salazar, Rodolfo I.] Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile; [Olson, Josephine E.] Univ Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Universidad Tecnica Federico Santa Maria; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Kristjanpoller, W (通讯作者)，Univ Tecn Federico Santa Maria, Valparaiso, Chile.",werner.kristjanpoller@usm.cl,"Salazar, Rodolfo/JXX-5768-2024; Kristjanpoller, Werner/V-1239-2019","Kristjanpoller, Werner/0000-0002-5878-072X",,,,,31,9,12,2,12,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

The literature generally suggests the use of an investment subsidy rather than a reduced tax rate. However, this study shows that, depending on the degree of present-biasedness, it may be more advantageous for the government to set a lower tax rate. The government, in fact, when selecting the instrument to be used for speeding up investment, trades off the immediate and certain cost of a subsidy against the random tax revenues accruing from the investment. Hence, from the short-sighted perspective of current government, a lower tax rate may appear optimal as long as the consideration given to the earnings of future governments is small and/or the current government's duration is short.","[Di Corato, Luca] Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden",Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences,"Di Corato, L (通讯作者)，Swedish Univ Agr Sci, Dept Econ, Box 7013, S-75007 Uppsala, Sweden.",luca.di.corato@slu.se,,"Di Corato, Luca/0000-0002-1023-9504",,,,,13,6,6,2,24,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

This paper explores whether and how import competition affects productivity dispersion within 425 four-digit manufacturing industries in China. Using a number of comprehensive micro-level datasets over the period of 2000-2006, we find that import penetration reduces the productivity dispersion in general and the main channel is through the competition-induced dynamic resource allocation within industries by driving the least efficient firms out of the market. The trade-induced productivity truncation is more evident for imports under the ordinary trade regime and for final imported goods and intermediate goods imported by the same industries.

We develop out-of-sample forecasts of the US dollar exchange rate using US and global data on price level, output, and interest rates, and money supply data for the US, China, and the rest of the world for the period 1996-2013. Monetary model forecasts significantly outperform a random walk forecast in terms of mean squared forecast error in the long run. A monetary error correction model with sticky prices performs best. Rolling sample analysis indicates changes over time in the influence of Chinese money supply in forecasting the US dollar. The expectation is that rapid money growth in China would increase the demand for dollars thus raising the value of the dollar, yet our forecasts are to the contrary for the mid 2000s. This is consistent with anticipation of renminbi appreciation under China's managed exchange rate, which made holding renminbi more attractive. With the break from a dollar peg in 2005 and subsequent currency appreciation, the distortion was alleviated and the forecast direction for the dollar became as expected. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In our setup, depositors choose sequentially between withdrawing or keeping their funds deposited in a common bank. Depositors may observe previous decisions depending on the information structure. Theoretically, the last depositor in the sequence of decisions has a dominant strategy and should always keep the funds deposited, regardless of what she observes (if anything). Recognizing the dominant strategy, however, is not always straightforward. If there exists strategic uncertainty (e.g., if the last depositor has no information regarding the decisions of predecessors), then the identification of the dominant strategy is more difficult than in a situation with no strategic uncertainty (e.g., the last depositor is informed about all previous decisions). We find that cognitive abilities, as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT), predict withdrawals in the presence of strategic uncertainty (participants with stronger abilities tend to identify the dominant strategy more easily) but that the CRT does not predict behavior when strategic uncertainty is absent.

The issue matters for the connection between fiscal policy and economic growth. Yet family transfers have mostly been narrowly cast as altruistic. I show that an alternative motive the demonstration effect, whereby parents transfer to mold preferences of children can generate vastly different results: family transfers are positive under dynamic inefficiency. These transfers are instrumental to depress capital accumulation so as to approach the Golden Rule capital stock. Intuitively, family transfers from youth to old age reduce capital accumulation. However, family transfers are nil under dynamic efficiency. Unlike public debt, both capital accumulation and welfare are not worsened. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This program was largely financed by off-balance-sheet companies known as local financing vehicles that both borrowed and spent on behalf of local governments. These companies have continued to grow since the stimulus program concluded at the end of 2010; their spending has accounted for roughly 10 percent of GDP each year, with an increasing share used for what are essentially commercial projects. And their spending has likely been responsible for an increase of 5 percentage points in the aggregate investment rate and for part of the decline of 7 to 8 percentage points in the current account surplus since 2008. We argue that local governments have used their new access to financial resources to facilitate favored businesses' access to capital, which potentially worsens the overall efficiency of capital allocation. The long-run effect of off balance-sheet spending by local governments may be a permanent decline in the growth rate of aggregate productivity and GDP.","[Bai, Chong-En] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Hsieh, Chang-Tai] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Song, Zheng (Michael)] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; University of Chicago; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Bai, CE (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,9,95,99,12,40,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Also contributing to the importance of tradability is the recent demutualization of most exchanges during the 1990s, which turned them into for-profit organizations. In fact, large issues of shares or bonds allow economies of scale, and generate experience in listing practices and trading operations, thereby enhancing the profitability of those commercially oriented stock exchanges. Thus, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are now much less attractive to these organizations, as compared to large enterprises (LEs), due to their inherent lack of liquidity and to the economies of scale.

Based on this analysis, we estimated the economic impact of China's growth slowdown and hypothetical economic transformation on Japan, the USA and Germany using the world input-output database. We compared the following three scenarios for China's final demand in 2020 and economic growth from 2015 to 2020: (i) an optimistic scenario (GDP growth rate = 6.2%, investment/GDP = 0.501); (ii) a slowdown scenario (GDP growth rate = 4%, investment/GDP = 0.501); and (iii) a structural reform scenario (GDP growth rate = 6.2%, investment/GDP = 0.3). Our analysis suggests that Japan and Germany would suffer more from structural reforms in China than from a slowdown in growth.

Our model features a classic problem in economics where an agent uses his market power to inefficiently screen a privately informed counterparty. Paradoxically, involving moderately informed intermediaries also endowed with market power can improve trade efficiency. Long intermediation chains in which each trader's information set is similar to those of his direct counterparties limit traders' incentives to post prices that reduce trade volume and jeopardize gains to trade.","[Glode, Vincent; Opp, Christian] Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,Suite 2300, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Glode, V (通讯作者)，Univ Penn, Wharton Sch, 3620 Locust Walk,Suite 2300, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",vglode@wharton.upenn.edu; opp@wharton.upenn.edu,,,Cynthia and Bennett Golub Endowed Faculty Scholar award,Cynthia and Bennett Golub Endowed Faculty Scholar award,"Glode: The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Locust Walk, Suite 2300, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (e-mail: vglode@wharton.upenn.edu); Opp: The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, 3620 Locust Walk, Suite 2300, Philadelphia, PA 19104 (e-mail: opp@wharton.upenn.edu).

Coal to gas switching has been triggered by the recent shale gas revolution, which the entire U.S. has experienced, not the RGGI region alone. If RGGI as a cap-and-trade carbon program did not work effectively, the rate of fuel switching would have been similar to that of other U.S. states. To estimate the effects of RGGI implementation in terms of the fuel switching, we use the synthetic control method for comparative case studies. Results provide a strong evidence that coal to gas switching has been actually accelerated by RGGI implementation. RGGI increases gas share in electricity generation in the RGGI region by roughly 10-15% point higher than the synthetic RGGI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Honore's work on ownership, especially his analysis of eleven standard incidents of the full liberal concept of ownership. It confirms Honore's insight that these standard incidents can be divided among two or more persons, and thus there are different types of property rights which are variants and alternatives to the liberal type of property rights. This article also confirms that the Chinese land system is a real alternative to the full liberal concept of ownership. The current Chinese land system is alleged to be unclear and insecure because it is not the kind of private ownership that neoliberals champion. In the tradition of the bundle of rights theory, it is helpful to use Honore's concept of ownership, rather than Harold Demsetz's type of property rights, to understand the current Chinese system.","[Meng, Gaofeng] Univ Glasgow, Sch Law, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Glasgow,"Meng, GF (通讯作者)，Univ Glasgow, Sch Law, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland.",,,"meng, gaofeng/0000-0002-4454-1840",,,,,136,3,3,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Specifically, we study (full) implementation with complete information when players are at least rational and at most k-rational, where k >= 2. We show that the set of implementable social choice functions (SCFs) is independent of the upper bound k. In independent domain of preferences (IDP) environments, we obtain a revelation principle: An SCF is implementable if and only if it is implementable by its associated direct mechanism. Two conditions characterize such SCFs: Strategy-proofness and strong non-bossiness. For non-IDP environments, we provide a characterization and simple necessary and sufficient conditions. We also analyze the case when rationality is at least mutual knowledge. There is a significant gap in implementation when rationality is mutual knowledge and when it is not. However, it does not make a significant difference whether rationality is mutual knowledge or common knowledge. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Controlling for various socio-economic characteristics, we explore whether risk aversion heterogeneity is a function of wealth heterogeneity. In contrast to most studies, we find evidence of very high risk aversion amongst the majority of households of poor households but vastly lower risk aversion amongst the high percentiles in the wealth distribution. Applying a first differences model across three survey waves spanning 2002 to 2010, we find that risk tolerance increases significantly with wealth. Risk tolerance is positively associated with mortgage payments, but rental payments have no relationship. In addition, we found no evidence that holding a university education has any discernible impact on risk aversion. Lastly, we present some preliminary findings as to the impact of financial advice on observed risk aversion. Financial advice is found to accentuating risk aversion, particularly amongst the wealthiest households. The findings have potential implications for the distribution of wealth in Australia that has received renewed interest recently.","[Tsigos, Stamatios; Daly, Kevin] Univ Western Australia, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia",University of Western Australia,"Daly, K (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, Sch Business, Locked Bag 1797, Penrith, NSW 1797, Australia.",k.daly@uws.edu.au,,,"Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)","Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government)","This paper uses unit record data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey.

The paper describes a form of leadership, which I call 'concerted unilateralism', that enables countries to pursue their own objectives, in a way which they would not have been able to do if they were acting on their own, and enables them to achieve a higher level of welfare. I contrast such leadership this with a form of authoritarian leadership in which the leader imposes obligations on other countries which are to the disadvantage of those countries. I argue that China could provide leadership of the first kind, by making use of the G20 Mutual Assessment Process, or G20MAP. In the short term, China might do this by consolidating the '2-in-5' action plan, which Australia instituted within the G20MAP when it was Australia was President of the G20. In the longer term, China might do this by ensuring that there is convergence between the G20MAP and China's own One-Belt-One-Road strategy for international engagement in trade and finance.

We show that this spillover effect is significant and time-varying, and underlies a fallacy of composition observed in late 20th century U.S. data: stock returns and productivity growth are correlated positively in firm-level data but negatively in aggregate data. This seeming fallacy of composition reflects Schumpeterian creative destruction: a few technology winners' stocks rise with their rising productivity while many technology losers' stocks fall with their declining productivity. Thus, most individual firms' stock returns correlate negatively with aggregate productivity growth. This implies that technological innovation need not be a blessing for all firms and as a result, for investors holding the market. Our findings also provide a firm-level technology innovation-based explanation of prior findings that the market return correlates negatively with aggregate earnings.","[Chun, Hyunbae] Sogang Univ, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Jung-Wook] Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea; [Morck, Randall] Univ Alberta, Alberta Sch Business, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Morck, Randall] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Sogang University; Seoul National University (SNU); University of Alberta; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Kim, JW (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Coll Business Adm, Seoul, South Korea.",jwkim87@snu.ac.kr,"Morck, Randall/AAD-9048-2019","Morck, Randall/0000-0001-7412-0222",National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013 S1 A3 A2053312]; Institute of Finance and Banking (Seoul National University); Institute of Management Research (Seoul National University); SSHRC; Bank of Canada,National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); Institute of Finance and Banking (Seoul National University); Institute of Management Research (Seoul National University); SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Bank of Canada,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013 S1 A3 A2053312]; Institute of Finance and Banking (Seoul National University); Institute of Management Research (Seoul National University).

US-China and EU-China examples,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sectoral agreements; Emission trading; China; Electricity sector; Climate policy; Carbon leakage,SCHEME; ETS; ALLOCATION,"Recent multilateral climate negotiations have underlined the importance of international cooperation and the need for support from developed to developing countries to address climate change. This raises the question of whether carbon market linkages could be used as a cooperation mechanism. Policy discussions surrounding such linkages have indicated that, should they operate, a limit would be set on the amount of carbon permits that could be imported by developed regions from developing countries. This paper analyzes the impact of limited carbon trading between an ETS in the EU or the US and a carbon market covering Chinese electricity and energy intensive sectors using a global economy-wide model. We find that the limit results in different carbon prices between China and Europe or the US. Although the impact on low-carbon technologies in China is moderate, gldbalemission reductions are deeper than in the absence of international trading due to reduced carbon leakage. If China captures the rents associated with limited permit trading, we show that it is possible to find a limit threshold that makes both regions better off relative to carbon markets operating in isolation.

It implements a decomposition analysis that breaks the variation in the skilled-wage bill ratio down into employment and wage movements and further disentangles these movements into shifts between or within sectors, and within sectors, between, or within firms. The study provides a methodological framework which consistently combines the industry-level analysis with the firm-level one, and which simultaneously takes account of changes in skill intensity and the wage gap. The results suggest that most of the changes are reported within firms, where one observes a skill-upgrading effect not followed by a price adjustment. The increase in the relative employment of skilled workers and the decrease in the wage gap between high-skilled and low skilled workers can be substantially attributed to changes in exporters and importers and in more productive firms. Finally, the paper further accounts for changes in the hourly wage premium and skill intensity, and it shows that the annual wage gap is induced by a substantial fall in the hourly wage premium and by an increase in the numbers of hours worked by the skilled factor.","[Iodice, Irene; Tomasi, Chiara] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Tomasi, Chiara] Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy",University of Trento; Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna,"Tomasi, C (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.;Tomasi, C (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, LEM, Pisa, Italy.",chiara.tomasi@unitn.it,,"Tomasi, Chiara/0000-0002-1962-7351",European Unions Horizon research and innovation programme [649186]; University of Trento,European Unions Horizon research and innovation programme(European Union (EU)); University of Trento,"This paper is produced as part of ISIGrowth project on Innovation-fuelled, Sustainable, Inclusive Growth that has received funding from the European Unions Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 649186 ISIGrowth.

In addition to those well-documented domestic business cycle fluctuations (e.g., the volatility and cyclicality of output, consumption, investment, labor hours, and labor productivity) and international business cycle properties (e.g., the countercyclical net export and the comovement puzzle), this paper focuses on two additional stylized facts in the industrialized countries: the procyclical trade openness (the GDP fraction of trade volume) and the countercyclical government size (the GDP fraction of government spending). Using a parsimonious dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, we show that the model's predictions under productivity shocks are not consistent with these facts. Instead, a demand-shock-driven model replicates the above facts while matching other domestic and international business cycle properties. An estimated version of the model confirms the quantitatively important impacts of demand shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the R&D tax credit in its first decade,JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,R&D; Tax credits; Business tax,TAXABLE INCOME; ELASTICITY; INTENSITY; PANEL,"This paper examines the impact of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit between 1981-1991 using confidential IRS data from corporate tax returns. The empirical analysis makes two key advances on previous work. First, it implements a new instrumental variables (IV) strategy based on tax changes that directly addresses the simultaneity of R&D spending and marginal credit rates. Second, the analysis makes use of new restricted access IRS corporate return data describing R&D expenditures. Estimates imply that a10% reduction in the user cost of R&D leads the average firm to increase its research intensity-the ratio of R&D spending to sales-by 19.8% in the short-run. Long-run estimates imply that the average firm faces adjustment costs and increases spending over time, though small and young firms show evidence of reversing initial increases. Analysis of the components of qualified research shows that wages and supplies account for the bulk of the increase in research spending. Elasticities of qualified and total research intensities from a smaller sample suggest firms respond to user cost changes largely by increasing their qualified spending, meaning that the type of R&D the federal credit deems qualified research is an important margin on which the credit affects firm behavior.

One way to neutralize the existence of binding liquidity constraints is simply by supplying additional labor, instead of reducing consumption. We estimate whether resorting to additional labor supply as a smoothing consumption device is at work by using the Italian Survey of Households Income and Wealth (SHIW). The longitudinal dimension of the SHIW dataset allows us to control for individual unobserved heterogeneity. We also use an IV strategy to address the endogeneity of our measure for credit constraints in labor supply equations due to time varying factors. Our results show that liquidity constraints increase the intensity in the supply of men's labor. Constrained men work, on average, 4 hours more than their unconstrained counterpart. Self-employed workers turn out to be more sensitive to binding liquidity constraints, possibly because they are more flexible in adjusting the intensity of their labor supply. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This 'triple coincidence' of GDP area, decision-making unit and currency area is an elegant simplification but misleads when financial flows are important in their own right. First, the neglect of gross flows, when only net flows are considered, can lead to misdiagnoses of financial vulnerability. Second, inattention to the effects of international currencies may lead to erroneous conclusions on exchange rate adjustment. Third, sectoral differences between corporate and official sector positions can distort welfare conclusions on the consequences of currency depreciation, as macroeconomic risks may be underestimated.

As a result of the strategic interdependencies among legislators, a trade-off arises between politicians' human capital and voters' ability to exert electoral control.

EMS leads to different results from previous studies in which market structure is exogenous. In the short run, a higher nominal interest rate reduces the growth rates of innovation, output, and consumption and decreases firm size through reduction in labor supply. In the long run, a higher nominal interest rate reduces the equilibrium number of firms but has no steady-state effect on economic growth and firm size because of EMS. Although monetary policy has no long-run growth effect, increasing the nominal interest rate permanently reduces the levels of output, consumption, and employment. Taking transition dynamics into account, we find that welfare is decreasing in the nominal interest rate and the Friedman rule is optimal in this economy.","[Chu, Angus C.] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England; [Ji, Lei] OFCE Sci Po, Sophia Antipolis, France; [Ji, Lei] SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France",University of Liverpool; SKEMA Business School,"Ji, L (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, Sophia Antipolis, France.;Ji, L (通讯作者)，SKEMA Business Sch, Sophia Antipolis, France.",lei.ji@skema.edu,"Chu, Angus/GNH-3700-2022",,,,,,48,29,31,0,9,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Because more lucrative markets attract more entry, firms appear to favor the presence of more rivals. Thus unobserved heterogeneity across geographical markets creates an endogeneity problem and poses a methodological challenge in the estimation of dynamic games, which we address by combining the procedures proposed by Kasahara and Shimotsu (2009), Arcidiacono and Miller (2011), and Bajari, Benkard, and Levin (2007). The results suggest that the omission of unobserved market heterogeneity attenuates the estimates of competition, and the trade-off between cannibalization and preemption is an important factor behind the evolution of market structure.","[Igami, Mitsuru] Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Yang, Nathan] McGill Univ, Desautels Fac Management, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Yale University; McGill University,"Igami, M (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Econ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",mitsuru.igami@yale.edu; nathan.cc.yang@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,21,25,1,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We do this by estimating how the moral hazard cost and the consumption smoothing benefit of UI vary with labour market conditions, which we identify using variation in the interaction of UI benefit levels with the unemployment rate within U.S. states over time. We find that the moral hazard cost is procyclical, greater when the unemployment rate is relatively low. By contrast, we do not find evidence that the consumption smoothing benefit varies with the unemployment rate.

Relative to informal lenders, the ME has a cost advantage and an informational disadvantage regarding borrower risk. Borrowers differ along another dimension: landholding, which is observable to all lenders. MFI entry is shown to induce selection effects (across risk and landownership dimensions) in shifts of borrowers from informal lenders to the MFI, which could raise informal interest rates, as observed in many LDCs. The model is consistent with evidence from Bangladesh and West Bengal, in contrast to hypotheses based on cream-skimming, scale-diseconomy-inducing, collusion-facilitating or crowding-in effects of MFIs on informal credit. The model implies that MFI entry is Pareto improving for borrowers, irrespective of effects on informal interest rates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The average human capital of a country, by contrast, influences its relative economic prosperity irrespective of trade-openness.","[Prettner, Klaus] Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, Argentinierstr 8-4-105-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Strulik, Holger] Univ Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany",Technische Universitat Wien; University of Gottingen,"Prettner, K (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Inst Math Methods Econ, Argentinierstr 8-4-105-3, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",klaus.prettner@econ.tuwien.ac.at,,"Prettner, Klaus/0000-0002-8971-8750; Strulik, Holger/0000-0002-5615-2412",,,,,29,13,13,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

However, the geopolitical, historical, and socio-economic context of the Arab transition was different in many respects from that of the former Soviet bloc countries 20 years earlier. These differences became even more obvious five years later, in early 2016, when most Arab transition attempts ended either in a new wave of authoritarianism, or protracted bloody conflicts. Nonetheless, there are some common lessons to be learnt from the history of both transitions. They concern interrelations between the political and economic transition, the role of institutional checks and balances and the rule of law, the speed of reforms, the dangers of ethnic and sectarian conflicts, and the role of external support.","[Dabrowski, Marek] CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland; [Dabrowski, Marek] Higher Sch Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，CASE Ctr Social & Econ Res, Warsaw, Poland.;Dabrowski, M (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Moscow, Russia.",marek.dabrowski@case-research.eu,"Dabrowski, Marek/AAA-3661-2021","Dabrowski, Marek/0000-0002-7960-8734",,,,,40,2,2,0,4,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We construct a real-time dataset of macro-economic and fiscal variables for a panel of OECD countries for the period 1989-2013. We find that two global factors - the global monetary and fiscal policy stances - explain more than 60 percent of the variance in the long-term interest rates. Under our frame work, we find that the importance of domestic variables in explaining long-term interest rates is weakened.

We propose a new method allowing for the decomposition of historical changes in income distribution and redistribution measures into: (i) the immediate effect of tax-transfer policy reforms in the absence of behavioral responses; (ii) the effect of labor supply responses induced by these reforms; and (iii) a third component allowing us to explore the effect of changes in the distribution of a wide range of determinants, including the effect of employment changes not induced by policy reforms. The application of the decomposition to Australia reveals that the direct effect of tax-transfer policy reforms accounts for half of the observed increase in income inequality between 1999 and 2008, while the increased dispersion of wages and capital incomes also played an important role.","[Herault, Nicolas; Azpitarte, Francisco] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Azpitarte, Francisco] Brotherhood St Laurence, Fitzroy, Vic, Australia",University of Melbourne,"Herault, N (通讯作者)，Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia.",nherault@unimelb.edu.au,"Herault, Nicolas/K-7080-2012; Azpitarte, Francisco/F-2170-2016","Herault, Nicolas/0000-0003-2080-0390; Azpitarte, Francisco/0000-0002-2688-6933","Faculty Research Grant from the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne; Brotherhood of St Laurence; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion [ECO2013-46516-C4-2-R, ECO2010-21668-C03-03]; Xunta de Galicia [10SEC300023PR]","Faculty Research Grant from the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne; Brotherhood of St Laurence; Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(Instituto de Salud Carlos IIISpanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia)","We acknowledge support from a Faculty Research Grant from the Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Melbourne.

The variation amounts to 50% more for the high-skill workers compared with their low-skill counterparts. Moreover, owing to the presence of segmented labour market, the patterns of city size-wage premium and city size-wage inequality premium are notably different for the migrants, who receive a much lesser wage than the citizens and do not experience wage variation owing to their skill heterogeneity.","[Pan, Liqun] Xiamen Univ, Xiamen, Peoples R China; [Mukhopadhaya, Pundarik] Macquarie Univ, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Li, Jing] Xiamen Univ, Ctr Macroecon Res, Xiamen, Peoples R China",Xiamen University; Macquarie University; Xiamen University,"Mukhopadhaya, P (通讯作者)，Macquarie Univ, Dept Econ, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia.",pundarik.mukhopadhaya@mq.edu.au,"Pan, Liqun/JVP-1507-2024; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; liu, jiajia/IUN-0901-2023; Mukhopadhaya, Pundarik/J-9074-2019; LI, Jing/HNB-5575-2023; Li, Jing/GYU-5036-2022; zhu, yujie/KBC-4009-2024; he, he/JPL-3505-2023","Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Mukhopadhaya, Pundarik/0000-0002-7052-4606;",National Science Foundation of China [71503222],National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),We thank two anonymous referees for their constructive comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

This paper provides a theoretical framework for a pure gift effect on reciprocity impulses and experimental evidence that such an effect exists: that is, a gift receiver will favor an actual gift giver over an intended gift giver, even if the intended gift giver incurred the same costs and signaled the same intention to give. This result contrasts with the predictions of existing theories on social preferences. We also show that the pure gift effect is present even when it leads to a less efficient outcome, or when the gift is given without the expectation of future returns. Our findings suggest that when reciprocating a gift becomes socially inefficient, it may be more advantageous to guard against gift receiving or to keep donations secret than to try to control the intent to give.

Heckman, John Eric Humphries, and Tim Kautz make a powerful case for noncognitive skills-or what they conceptualize as character-as an explanation of educational achievement and other important outcomes in life. They do so while exposing the myth of the GED, arguing that the GED harms its intended beneficiaries by failing to instill the character skills that predict adult success. Childhood interventions to build personal character, especially self-control, are emphasized. The Myth of Achievement Tests is a major contribution, but I integrate relevant research on crime and social control across the life course that motivates a more dynamic conceptualization of character. I also review evidence on the environment as a source of both cognitive and noncognitive skills, including exposure to concentrated deprivation, violence, and lead toxicity. Moreover, I review evidence suggesting that social reactions to character shape life chances in ways not reducible to individual propensities, such as changes in criminal-justice policy that created large cohort differentials in incarceration for the same underlying behaviors. Social context and the character of American society itself are thus central to fostering individual character-not just skills but the desire to conform. It follows that self-control and social control need to be better unified theoretically and in designing interventions.","[Sampson, Robert J.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Sampson, RJ (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Sampson, Robert J./AAB-7369-2020",,,,,,73,20,26,0,23,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Given very benign liquidity conditions in the US, the prevailing common US dollar peg has contributed to growing macroeconomic and financial instability in the region. This has sparked demands to embark on an independent monetary integration process in East Asia. The paper shows that, however, neither the Japanese yen nor the Chinese yuan can challenge the US dollar as anchor currency in the region. Large fluctuations of the Japanese yen against the US dollar have undermined the potential of the Japanese yen to become a regional anchor currency. Exchange rate stability of the Chinese yuan against the US dollar has enhanced intra-regional exchange rate stability and growth, stressing the potential of the Chinese yuan to emerge as a regional anchor currency. Yet, it is shown that underdeveloped Chinese capital markets and financial repression originating in US low interest rate policies constitute an insurmountable impediment for the Chinese yuan to gain anchor currency status in East Asia. Empirical estimations provide evidence in favor of positive growth effects of the exchange rate stability against the US dollar in East Asia.","[Schnabl, Gunther] Univ Leipzig, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Spantig, Kristina] Deutsch Gesell Int Zusammenarbeit, Friedrich Ebert Allee 36, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Leipzig University,"Schnabl, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Grimmaische Str 12, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",schnabl@wifa.uni-leipzig.de; kristina.spantig@giz.de,,,,,,,54,3,3,0,13,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

The positive or negative growth effects of a country's regulatory framework are amplified by economic integration, which makes factors and producers more mobile and enables them to avoid burdensome regulation. Therefore, these two potential determinants of growth might be interlinked. So far there is very little empirical evidence on the impact of the regulatory framework on growth in an integrated economy. We deal with the most common problems in estimating growth equations by using internal instruments to identify a relationship between regulation and growth in the presence of international trade and find evidence that both regulation and trade have a significant positive influence on growth, with the effect of regulation being especially pronounced for countries that have worse regulatory quality and for middle-income countries.

I show how a particular set of shared ethical values led to the adoption of constitutional rules governing the organization.

J,"Thévenon, O",,,,"Thevenon, Olivier",,,Do 'institutional complementarities' foster female labour force participation?,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,FAMILY POLICIES; OECD COUNTRIES; GENDER,"We analyse how female labour force participation responds to policies supporting the work-life balance, and do so using country-level data for 18 OECD countries from 1980 to 2007. Included is an original analysis of 'complementarities' between different policy measures, as well as of potential variations in their influence across different family policy regimes. The results highlight that expanded childcare service coverage affects women's labour market participation, which is greater in countries where support for working mothers is higher overall. But the influence of each single policy measure varies across regimes. Interactions between policy measures and the context in which they are implemented are important factors to consider since they can, for instance, either foster the positive impact of one measure or lessen the adverse effect of another.","[Thevenon, Olivier] OECD Directorate Employment & Social Affairs, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Thevenon, Olivier] INED, Strasbourg, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Thévenon, O (通讯作者)，OECD Directorate Employment & Social Affairs, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75775 Paris 16, France.;Thévenon, O (通讯作者)，INED, Strasbourg, France.",Olivier.thevenon@oecd.org,,,European Commission,European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"Willem Adema, Lucie Davoine, Nuria Diez-Guardia, Monika Queisser, Margarita Estevez-Abe and seminar attendants at the OECD, OFCE, INED, NY 2014 conference of the Work and Family Research Network, Collegio Carlo Alberto are acknowledged for providing valuable comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

These generally came in the wake of financial crises and large-scale default of public debts. Although the constraints were imposed in order to minimize the likelihood that such outcomes would occur in the future, little work has been undertaken to analyze whether they were successful in achieving that goal. Therefore, this current study attempts to do so by empirically investigating how procedural safeguards and outright prohibitions on debt accumulation, along with hard budget constraints, and tax limits impacted the likelihood of default. This is done by evaluating municipal defaults that centered on the Panic of 1893. Overall, the results suggest that outright prohibitions on debt accumulation and hard budget constraints actually reduced the likelihood of municipal default across states, while tax limits and procedural safeguards increased that likelihood.","[Dove, John A.] Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, 137N Bibb Graves Hall, Troy, AL 36082 USA",Troy University System; Troy University,"Dove, JA (通讯作者)，Troy Univ, Manuel H Johnson Ctr Polit Econ, 137N Bibb Graves Hall, Troy, AL 36082 USA.",jadove@troy.edu,,,,,,,69,11,11,0,4,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1435-6104,1435-8131,,ECON GOV,Econ.

Consistent with the previous literature, we found that volatility is much higher on the natural gas and crude oil storage report announcement days, on Mondays and during winters. We also confirmed that high volatility is associated with divergence of storage levels and temperatures from seasonal norms. The asymmetric impact of storage levels on volatility across different seasons is empirically investigated and documented. The mainstream finding in the literature that lower storage levels result in higher volatility is valid only during winter. At other times, it is actually higher storage levels causing higher volatility. Also, time to maturity effect is present only in winters.

In this paper we test this hypothesis using data on Japanese banks' loan portfolios over the period 1996-2013. Using various similarity measures, we find that banks have in fact become less similar over time. This finding would suggest that concerns over a more homogeneous banking system are not necessarily based on facts. However, we also find that the Japanese banking system has become increasingly concentrated, and that the largest banks in fact have become more similar over time. We need theoretical frameworks that allow to disentangle the interplay between diversity and concentration and their impact on systemic risk. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

I show that while under common law appellate judges' biases offset one another at the cost of legal uncertainty, under civil law the legislator chooses a certain legal rule that is biased only when he favors special interests, i.e., when preferences are sufficiently heterogeneous and/or political institutions are sufficiently inefficient. Thus, common law can produce better outcomes only under this scenario. To test this prediction, I construct a novel continuous measure of legal traditions for 49 transplants, many of which reformed the transplanted institutions, and I devise an instrumental variables approach dealing with the endogeneity of both legal and political institutions. The evidence I obtain is robust across several strategies, confirms the model implications, and stresses the relevance of distinguishing between proxies measuring only the technological efficiency of the law and those picking up also the citizenry's satisfaction with its cultural content.

We use a small stylized nonlinear two-country macroeconomic model of a monetary union for analyzing the interactions between two fiscal (governments: core and periphery) and one monetary (central bank) policy makers, assuming different objective functions of these decision makers. Using the OPTGAME algorithm, we calculate numerical solutions for cooperative (Pareto optimal) and non-cooperative games (feedback Nash). We show how the policy makers react to adverse demand shocks. We investigate the consequences of three scenarios: decentralized fiscal policies controlled by independent governments (the present situation), centralized fiscal policy (a fiscal union) with an independent central bank (pure fiscal union), and a fully centralized monetary and fiscal union. For the latter two scenarios, we demonstrate the importance of different assumptions about the joint objective function corresponding to different weights for the two governments in the design of the common fiscal policy. We show that a fiscal union with weights corresponding to the number of states in each of the blocs gives better results than non-cooperative policy making. When one bloc dominates the fiscal union, decentralized policies yield lower overall losses than the pure fiscal union and the monetary and fiscal union.","[Neck, Reinhard; Blueschke, Dmitri] Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Neck, R (通讯作者)，Alpen Adria Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria.",Reinhard.Neck@uni-klu.ac.at,,"Blueschke, Dmitri/0000-0002-5493-1893",University of Klagenfurt,University of Klagenfurt,Open access funding provided by University of Klagenfurt.,,4,1,1,0,4,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2016,43.0,2,,,SI,,333,347,,10.1007/s10663-016-9326-6,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK6UV,,"hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375061900007,0

This paper shows the ranking of industries by workforce skill differs between developed and developing countries and develops a multi-sector assignment model to understand the causes and consequences of this fact. Heterogeneous agents leverage their ability through their span of control over an homogeneous input. In equilibrium, higher skill agents sort into sectors where the cost per efficiency unit of input is lower. Consequently, skill allocation is endogenous to country-sector specific variation in input productivity and costs and when the ranking of sectors by effective input costs differs across countries there is an assignment reversal. Assignment reversals between North and South have novel implications for how trade affects wages because they imply the Stolper-Samuelson theorem does not hold. Instead, each country has a comparative advantage in its high skill sector and output trade integration causes the relative wage of high skill workers, and wage inequality within the high skill sector, to increase in both countries.

We assume that the Southern government fully respects the principle of non-discrimination and hence treats both imitations, i.e., imitation of Northern innovation and imitation of domestic innovation, equally. For a given state of the economy, we explicitly and uniquely establish an optimal degree of intellectual property rights (IPR) protection for the South. Then, we find that there is a complementary relationship between optimal IPR protection and the innovation subsidy policy, which implies that they form an effective policy mix, hence offering a useful insight for avoiding ineffective policy conflicts widely occurred in real-world economies.","[Dai, Darong] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Shen, Kunrong] Nanjing Univ, Dept Econ, Nanjing 210093, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Nanjing University,"Dai, DR (通讯作者)，Texas A&M Univ, Dept Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA.",dai496@tamu.edu,,,,,,,28,8,8,0,49,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Participants were subjected to different experimental conditions where the role played by anonymity differed. As expected, anonymity does play an important role in the decision to pay taxes. In addition, we found that a negative non-monetary incentive increases tax compliance more effectively than a positive non-monetary incentive. We also found that the effect of these non-monetary incentives is mitigated when too much information is made available. Results show that, when evasion is made public, tax fraudsters are willing to pay in order to keep their dishonest behaviour undisclosed and to avoid public shame. Interestingly we found a misalignment on the impact of stigmatization, namely that the judgement of an individual's evasion is perceived, by the individual, more harshly than a judgement made by the said individual regarding evasion carried out by other parties.

Drawing on a novel congregation-level panel dataset, we examine whether religious giving is driven by preferences for racial group affinity, that is, loyalty to one's own racial group. To address endogeneity concerns, we combine a fixed effects estimation framework with an instrumental variable approach. We find robust evidence consistent with the racial group affinity motive: a decrease in the percent of whites in the local community is ceteris paribus associated with a decrease in the total giving receipts collected by predominantly white congregations. The magnitude of this effect does not vary with the extent of racial residential segregation in the community. The effect, however, is driven by the congregations in urban (as opposed to rural) communities. We offer a possible explanation for this result.","[Grajzl, Peter; Guse, A.

International trade facilitates technology diffusion by providing importing countries access to technical knowledge that they can potentially internalize. Previous studies of the effect of trade on technology diffusion typically only consider the impact of direct (bilateral) trade on indirect measures of technology (e.g., total factor productivity). We contend that the analysis of trade's impact on technology diffusion would be more accurately assessed by using direct measures of specific technologies (e.g., intensity levels) and by allowing for the influence of both the direct and indirect effects of trade in the analysis. The latter is accomplished by modeling the international trade system as a weighted network, which quantifies both direct and indirect trade linkages. Combining trade data with data on the adoption of specific technologies, we find that the network effects of trade play a significant role in technology diffusion. In most cases, countries that are better-connected on the trade network have higher technology intensities. Further support for the importance of trade is provided by the finding that for outdated technologies, better-connected countries have lower technology intensities because of their adoption of newer, substitute technologies.","[Ferrier, Gary D.; Reyes, Javier] Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Univ Arkansas 1, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA; [Zhu, Zhen] IMT Lucca, Lucca, Italy; [Zhu, Zhen] IMT Inst Adv Studies, LIME Lab, Piazza S Ponziano, I-55100 Lucca, Italy",University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca; IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca,"Ferrier, GD; Reyes, J (通讯作者)，Univ Arkansas, Dept Econ, Sam M Walton Coll Business, Univ Arkansas 1, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA.;Zhu, Z (通讯作者)，IMT Lucca, Lucca, Italy.;Zhu, Z (通讯作者)，IMT Inst Adv Studies, LIME Lab, Piazza S Ponziano, I-55100 Lucca, Italy.",gferrier@walton.uark.edu; reyes@uark.edu; zhen.zhu@imtlucca.it,"Zhu, Zhen/AAN-9861-2020; Reyes, José Antonio Reyes/GXZ-6957-2022; Reyes, Juan/JAN-9859-2023","Zhu, Zhen/0000-0003-0258-1454; Ferrier, Gary/0000-0001-7301-7928",,,,,55,32,34,8,51,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In a model with endogenous matching and random consumption preferences, we find multiple monetary equilibria including one in which bitcoin coexists with official currency. We then identify the conditions under which government transactions policy might deter the use of bitcoin. We show that such a policy becomes more difficult if some users strictly prefer bitcoin because they can avoid other users holding the official currency in the matching process.

Indeed, since the aftermath of the credit crunch and the global financial crisis (2008-2009), the former have been severely criticized, while the latter are increasingly considered as an alternative form of banking. From a panel sample of twenty major banks (ten conventional banks and ten Islamic banks) located in various developed and emerging countries over the period April 2006- February 2013, the present paper examines whether or not there are significant differences between the two banking systems. Our sample enables us to compare these international banking systems, taking the crisis impact and new regulations and supervisory rules into account. To this effect, we carried out econometric analyses of univariate and multivariate panel data, which pointed to two interesting findings. First, there are only a few significant differences between IBs and CBs in terms of financial risk. Second, PVAR (Panel Vector Autoregressive) estimates and the analysis of Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) indicate weak interactions between IBs and CBs, while panel causality tests reject the causality hypothesis from IBs to CBs.","[Jawadi, Fredj] Univ Evry Val dEssone, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France; [Cheffou, Abdoulkarim Idi] EDC Paris Business Sch, Paris, France; [Jawadi, Nabila] IPAG LAB, Paris Nice, IPAG Business Sch, Evry, France",Universite Paris Saclay; IPAG Business School,"Jawadi, F (通讯作者)，Univ Evry Val dEssone, 2 Rue Facteur Cheval, F-91025 Evry, France.",fredj.jawadi@univ-evry.fr,,"JAWADI, Fredj/0000-0003-3655-8391",,,,,24,17,17,0,21,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The Bubble Game can be played with any number of students, as long as this number is strictly greater than one. Students sequentially trade an asset which is publicly known to have a fundamental value of zero. If there is no cap on asset prices, speculative bubbles can arise at the Nash equilibrium because no trader is ever sure to be last in the market sequence. Otherwise, the Nash equilibrium involves no trade. Bubbles usually occur with or without a cap on prices. Traders who are less likely to be last and have less steps of reasoning to perform to reach equilibrium are in general more likely to speculate.","[Moinas, Sophie; Pouget, Sebastien] Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, IAE CRM IDEI, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France",Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Pouget, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toulouse Capitole, Toulouse Sch Econ, IAE CRM IDEI, 21 Allee Brienne, F-31000 Toulouse, France.",sophie.moinas@ut-capitole.fr; sebastien.pouget@ut-capitole.fr,,"Moinas, Sophie/0000-0002-6187-3396",,,,,17,6,6,2,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

This paper re-examines this relationship using new value-added trade data for 63 advanced and emerging economies during 1995-2013. In a panel framework, we identify a significantly positive impact of bilateral (value-added) trade intensity on business cycle synchronization controlling for global common shocks, country-pair heterogeneity and other covariates that is absent when gross trade data are used. There is also some evidence that the impact of value-added trade on synchronization increases with the degree of (value-added) intraindustry trade. We provide a theoretical rationale for the role of value-added trade for synchronization using a simple international business cycle model that features cross-country input linkages in production.

Firms provide goods that are too fuzzy compared to first-best, though entry serves to correct this inefficiency for certain types of goods.

(2011). The creation story in dispute is the French Revolution and the subsequent French occupation of a very small portion of Germany. We show that the four institutional reforms claimed to have spurred German industrialization have been incorrectly dated. These corrections nullify any explanatory power of the ACJR econometric model. Moreover, even with the corrected vintages, their identification strategy is undermined by a flawed explanatory' variable - years of reform'. We show that this variable simply enters their model as a year trend and explains nothing except the passage of time. We develop a fixed-effects model to capture the overlooked role of coal production that began in several regions shortly after 1840. This model offers a credible account of German industrialization and urbanization. Most economic change is, after all, continuous.

Does this make it optimal to impose capital controls or should policymakers rely on domestic macroprudential regulation in their quest for greater financial stability? This paper shows that it is desirable to employ both instruments to mitigate contractionary exchange rate depreciations: Macroprudential regulation reduces the amount and riskiness of financial liabilities, no matter whether they are financed by domestic or foreign lenders; capital controls increase the aggregate net worth of the economy by reducing net inflows. Both types of policy measures make the economy more stable and reduce the incidence and severity of crises. They should be set higher the greater an economy's debt burden and the higher domestic inequality. In a calibration based on the East Asian crisis countries, we find that it is optimal to impose both capital controls and macroprudential regulation that amount to a 2% tax on debt flows or equivalent quantity regulations. In advanced countries where the risk of contractionary exchange rate depreciations is more limited, the role for capital controls subsides. However, macroprudential regulation remains essential to mitigate booms and busts in asset prices. (C) 2016 International Monetary Fund. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It does so by systematizing existing insights, especially those provided by Richard Schlatter in his book, Private Property: A History of An Idea (1951). The analysis shows that Hardin's widely quoted paper is not the founding essay that attacked the commons. Also, it demonstrates that there is no property rights approach in political economy but several property rights approaches not only between heterodox and orthodox political economy but also within heterodox perspectives. The evidence is clearly that not much has changed in the debates about the commons except, perhaps, the geographical emphasis and the identity of the dramatis personae fanning the attacks on the commons, but not the economic interests supporting the decimation and dissipation of the commons.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, POB 123, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",Franklin.Obeng-Odoom@uts.edu.au,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,49,15,15,1,12,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

Departing from the standard model of public good provision, we assume that an agent's utility has two terms: (a) 'ego'-utility derived from the agent's consumption of public and private goods, and (b) a social utility which is the sum of utility spillovers from other agents with whom the agent has social relationships. We establish conditions for the existence of a unique interior Nash equilibrium and describe the equilibrium in terms of network characteristics. We show that social network always has a positive effect on the provision of the public good. We also find that, in networks with small world-like modular structures, 'bridging' ties connecting distant parts of social network play an important role inducing an agent's contribution to public good. Assumptions and results of the model are discussed in relation to the role of social capital in community-level development projects and to the effect of innovation networks on firms' R&D investments.","[Sanditov, Bulat] Inst Mines Telecom, TELECOM Ecole Management, 9 Rue Charles Fourier, F-91011 Evry, France; [Arora, Saurabh] Univ Sussex, Sci Policy Res Unit, Brighton, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Sanditov, B (通讯作者)，Inst Mines Telecom, TELECOM Ecole Management, 9 Rue Charles Fourier, F-91011 Evry, France.",Bulat.Sanditov@telecom-em.eu,"Sanditov, Bulat/KBC-4037-2024","Sanditov, Bulat/0000-0001-5397-6195",,,,,35,4,5,1,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Academic dishonesty not only undermines the purpose of education and the assessment process but also threatens the creditability of academic records. We propose a framework for analysing students' behaviour with respect to academic policies and honour codes. We draw an analogy between law enforcement and academic integrity enforcement and highlight similarities and differences. The proposed framework captures major determinants of academic dishonesty reported in the literature, namely detection probability, punishment severity, class average and record of academic deviance. The framework models both students' development of nonacademic skills to improve their grades and teaching assistants' development of detection skills, which both affect the detection probability. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimality of escalating penalties is conditional on the offenders and academic policy enforcers learning. Use-case scenarios are presented to facilitate the implementation of our results in classrooms.","[Awad, Mohamad Khattar; Alazemi, Hamed M.

Using event study methodology and regression analyses, we examine a set of 122 oil and gas related stocks listed in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for 35 announcements. Our results indicate that CFTC announcements, depending on their content, can affect the stock returns of oil and gas companies. In particular, this is found to hold true during the period of high-volatility in oil prices, i.e., the period following Lehman Brothers failure. During this period, oil and gas related stock returns respond positively to most regulatory announcements, showing that the CFTC's regulatory interventions are perceived positively by the stock market.

Together with the daily and seasonal peak hours on the demand side, the changing markets put pressure on increased flexibility to handle and sustain balance in the grid systems. This paper focuses on the demand side and analyzes preferences related to demand management of Swedish households' energy use. In a web-based choice experiment respondents were faced with three hypothetical electricity contracts. The choices of preferred contracts revealed preferences for attributes related to external control of heating, household electricity and information dissemination (integrity). The results show that people put a substantial value on not being controlled, illustrated by compensations up to thousands of SEK for accepting a contract characterized by external control of energy use in various dimensions. In addition, the results show that household composition, age, gender and income play a role for the perceived discomfort from the external control and information dissemination.

This pattern obtains if the spread (the financial friction) is more sensitive to fiscal policy during recessions than during expansions, a feature that is present in the data.

Models emphasizing that taxpayers make strategic, financially motivated compliance decisions seemingly assume an overly restrictive view of human nature. Law abidance may be more accurately explained by social norms, a concept that has gained growing importance as research attempts to understand the tax compliance puzzle. This study analyzes the influence of psychic stress generated by the possibility of breaking social norms in the tax compliance context. We measure psychic stress using heart rate variability (HRV), which captures the psychobiological or neural equivalents of psychic stress that may arise from the contemplation of real or imagined actions, producing immediate physiologic discomfort. The results of our laboratory experiments provide empirical evidence of a positive correlation between psychic stress and tax compliance, thus underscoring the importance of moral sentiments for tax compliance. We also identify three distinct types of individuals who differ in their levels of psychic stress, tax morale, and tax compliance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Still, sovereign debt crises are also of a systemic nature, clustered around panics in the financial center, such as the European Sovereign Debt Crisis in the aftermath of the US Subprime Crisis in 2008. Crises in the financial centers are rare disasters and, thus, their effects on the periphery can only be captured by examining long episodes. In this paper, we examine sovereign defaults from 1820 to the Great Depression, with a focus on Latin America. We find that 63% of the crises are of a systemic nature. These crises are different. Both the international collapse of liquidity and the growth slowdown in the financial centers are at their core. These global shocks trigger longer default spells and larger losses for investors.","[Kaminsky, Graciela Laura; Vega-Garcia, Pablo] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA",George Washington University,"Kaminsky, GL; Vega-García, P (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20052 USA.",graciela@gwu.edu; pvega@gwu.edu,,,"National Science Foundation [1023681]; Institute for New Economic Thinking [INO14-00009]; Institute of International Economic Policy; Elliott School at GWU; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences [1023681] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Institute for New Economic Thinking; Institute of International Economic Policy; Elliott School at GWU; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Graciela Kaminsky gratefully acknowledges support from the National Science Foundation (Award No 1023681), the Institute for New Economic Thinking (Grant No INO14-00009), and the Institute of International Economic Policy and the Elliott School at GWU.

This paper demonstrates that the results are more uniform than previously understood once a consistent metric is used to provide easy comparability across studies. This paper uses the percent of the decline in record sales that is due to file-sharing as a metric to translate the results of the literature into a common framework and then summarizes those results. What has not been previously noted is that the estimates from most studies imply that the impact of file-sharing was sufficient to have caused the entire decline in record sales that occurred from the advent of Napster up to about 2005. A smaller number of studies using post-2005 data indicate that the shift to digital formats may also have contributed to the sales decline that continued after 2005.","[Liebowitz, Stan J.] Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Mail Stn SM31,800 Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas,"Liebowitz, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Sch Management, Mail Stn SM31,800 Campbell Rd, Richardson, TX 75080 USA.",liebowit@utdallas.edu,"Liebowitz, Stan J/B-4135-2010",,Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation,Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation,"I would like to thank Steve Margolis, Joel Waldfogel and Alejandro Zentner for their input and the Center for the Analysis of Property Rights and Innovation for financial support.",,27,28,33,1,24,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

Two new development banks have been established: the New Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructural Investment Bank (AIIB). However, what conceptual framework will they formulate? This paper addresses infrastructural financing issues from the angle of structural transformation as a strategy for global development. Based on the new structural economics (Lin, , ) we stress the real' side of transforming natural resources to productive assets using the resource financed infrastructure. As one of the innovative instruments, this approach could, first, combine two otherwise isolated supply chains, resource extraction and infrastructure building, and, thereby, bring developmental results many years ahead of what other conventional approaches could. Second, this could serve as one of the least-cost' options for developing countries, and benefit borrowers disproportionately due to its feature of non-recourse' loans. Finally, in a low-yield environment, the rate of return from investing in bottleneck-releasing infrastructure could be attractive to many investors. Future prospects of development financing, including the one belt one road' initiative are discussed.","[Lin, Justin Yifu; Wang, Yan] Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University,"Wang, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China.",yanwang2@gwu.edu,"Liu, Zhiyu/JNR-8043-2023","Liu, Zhiyu/0000-0001-8351-1268",,,,,46,6,6,3,61,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

Existing scholarship has suggested that insecurity and competition over political and economic resources as well as increased perceptions of threat from the out-group tend to increase the salience of ethnic identities. Most of the work on ethnicity, however, is either experimental and deals with how people respond once identity has already been primed, is based on self-reported measures of identity, or driven by election results. In contrast, here we examine events in Ukraine from late 2013 (the beginning of the Euromaidan protests) through the end of 2014 to see if particular moments of heightened political tension led to increased identification as either Russian or Ukrainian among Ukrainian citizens. In tackling this question, we use a novel methodological approach by testing the hypothesis that those who prefer to use Ukrainian to communicate on Twitter will use Ukrainian (at the expense of Russian) following moments of heightened political awareness and those who prefer to use Russian will do the opposite. Interestingly, our primary finding in is a negative result: we do not find evidence that key political events in the Ukrainian crisis led to a reversion to the language of choice at the aggregate level, which is interesting given how much ink has been spilt on the question of the extent to which Euromaidan reflected an underlying Ukrainian vs. Russian conflict. However, we unexpectedly find that both those who prefer Russian and those who prefer Ukrainian begin using Russian with a greater frequency following the annexation of Crimea, thus contributing a whole new set of puzzles - and a method for exploring these puzzles- that can serve as a basis for future research.

Applying the mean group (MG), pooled mean group (PMG), and dynamic fixed effect (DFE) estimation, we examine a China province-level data over the period from 1995 to 2011. Our estimates indicate that rapid urbanization increases carbon dioxide emissions both in the short-run and in the long-run. However, the lower magnitude of the environmental impact of urbanization in the short-run than that in the long-run indicates that the process of urbanization would have a long-lasting impact on the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, our results suggest that the impact of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions would usually take some time to materialize fully, and would be useful to policymakers who seek to coordinate economic development and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.

The wage differentials between the two groups are found to be higher at the top end than at the bottom part of the wage distribution in both 2002 and 2007. We decompose the distributional wage differentials between the two groups into a composition effect explained by differences in productivity characteristics, and a discrimination effect attributable to unequal returns to those characteristics. We find that the discrimination against migrant workers increases with the percentile of wage distribution in both 2002 and 2007. We also show that the discrimination against rural migrants has intensified during 2002-2007 throughout the wage distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

To overcome these limitations, we develop the extended hesitant fuzzy sets (EHFSs) in this paper. As an extension of HFSs, EHFSs have close relationships with existing fuzzy sets including intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), fuzzy multisets (FMSs), type-2 fuzzy sets (T2FSs), dual hesitant fuzzy sets (DHFSs), and especially HFSs. We propose a concept of extended hesitant fuzzy elements (EHFEs), then study the basic operations and the desirable properties of EHFEs in detail. Some extended hesitant distance measures are developed to illustrate their advantages comparing with the existing hesitant distance measures.

Trade-off theory claims that there is an optimal (target) capital structure and firms try to achieve that optimal (target) point. Whereas pecking order theory argues that there is no optimal (target) capital structure but the firms follow a specific pattern of financing. Using the two competing theoretic frameworks, this study applies Fisher-type panel unit root test to an unbalanced panel data of 13 115 firm-year observations of nonfinancial firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange Pakistan spread over 38 years (1973-2010). Overall panel test results, for short-term, long-term, as well as total leverage support trade-off financing behaviour while individual firm results do not. Individual firm results show that only 16% of the firms have short-term target, 25% of the firms have long-term target and 12% of the firms have total target leverage ratio. Further, industry results explain that most of the industries do have target leverage ratios and classification of data into profitable and lossmaking firm-year observations explains that profitable firms clearly follow trade-off financing behaviour while the results for lossmaking firms do not support trade-off financing behaviour. Our study indicates that it is important for the government to ensure policies to develop well-balanced financial markets and to improve accountability systems.","[Ahsan, Tanveer; Man, Wang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Accounting, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Qureshi, Muhammad Azeem] Oslo & Akershus Univ, Coll Appl Sci, Oslo Business Sch, Oslo, Norway",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),"Qureshi, MA (通讯作者)，Oslo & Akershus Univ, Coll Appl Sci, Oslo Business Sch, Oslo, Norway.",Muhammad-Azeem.Qureshi@hioa.no,"Ahsan, Tanveer/K-3044-2019","Ahsan, Tanveer/0000-0002-4332-8298",,,,,29,16,17,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

If so, then the current assumption of mainstream theory of consumption about the constant marginal propensity to consume could no longer be considered realistic and it will be necessary to take the element of relative income as a new key determinant of general consumption function. The aim of this work is to identify, describe and prove an influence of relative income on the marginal propensity to consume using data from Czech Republic and thus to prove the correctness of Duesenberry's relative income hypothesis. To achieve this goal, we use a panel regression, which results clearly confirm the validity of the initial hypothesis about the existence of functional dependence of the marginal propensity to consume on the relative income and thus it fully supports the idea of interdependent concept of utility and consumption.

For example, the share of people over 65 years old of EU Member States was 18,5 per cent in 2014 (Eurostat, 2015). Moreover the predictions indicate that this trend will follow next years. The changes of population structure significantly influence the society and governmental systems. The definition of this period of life is complicated because there is no strict lower age limit and quality of life really depends on the individual attitudes. Obviously the aging is connected with the personal changes: psychological, physical, social or health changes. These changes can impact on their everyday activities in the positive, but also in the negative ways. From another point of view, the aging can bring new possibilities for entrepreneurs and different industries. This paper focuses on the leisure industry and marketing communication.

To remain effective over time, institutions need to adapt to changes in the environment or the society the institution is meant to regulate. Douglas North (1994) referred to this property as adaptive efficiency and suggested the need for a model of how institutions change to remain effective. This essay contributes to a theory of adaptive efficiency by relating it to the burgeoning literature in robust system design. It reviews five models of institutional change, paying particular attention to each model's ability to explain institutional adaptation. It isolates three common structural features of a robust, adaptive institutional system: diversity, modularity, and redundancy. It illustrates the theory with a brief application to federal systems, and closes by describing some open research questions relating to institutional adaptive efficiency.","[Bednar, Jenna] Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Bednar, J (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Dept Polit Sci, Ann Arbor, MI 48104 USA.",,,,,,,,0,10,11,1,1,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,167,184,,,,,,18,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200010,0

Using a sample of firms privatized in developing and industrialized countries, we find a negative relation between the likelihood of observing a golden share and labor protection. However, we find that this relation does not hold in the post-financial crisis period, suggesting that the recent crisis is associated with an increase in government control. Furthermore, we show that privatized firms in countries with strong labor protection are penalized with a higher cost of equity. Overall, our results underline the importance of labor protection for an important government control mechanism, namely golden shares, as well as for equity financing costs of privatized firms.

We derive a sufficient statistics formula for optimal UI that is expressed in terms of observable variables and can therefore be used in applied work. Recent research has shown that unemployed households pay less per unit of consumption than employed households. This finding has two counteracting effects on the optimal level of UI. On the one hand, consumption smoothing benefits identified from expenditure data overestimate the true marginal benefits of UI. On the other hand, UI benefits become more valuable because they buy more consumption when unemployed. In an optimal design, which effect dominates depends on the curvature of the utility function. We show that for relative risk aversion larger than one the first effect dominates, leading to lower levels of optimal UI. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Fourth, the model's mechanism and assumptions are corroborated by institutional details, disaggregated data, and banking time series, all of which are distinctive Chinese characteristics. We argue that a preferential credit policy for promoting heavy industries accounts for the unusual cyclical patterns, as well as the post-1990s economic transition featured by the persistently rising investment rate, the declining labor income share, and a growing foreign surplus.

While in some countries the decline comes evenly from employment and hours per worker, in others it comes mostly from hours per worker, or predominantly from employment. This paper studies why labor taxes have different relative effects on employment and hours per worker. We show that different hour-shaping mechanisms are one of the underlying reasons. In the mechanism when hours per worker are bargained by matched job-worker pairs, a higher labor income tax would reduce both employment and hours per worker. As the worker's hour-bargaining share is larger, hours per worker are decreased by more and employment is decreased by less. In the mechanism when hours per worker are determined exclusively by the household, this goes to the case when the worker has a one-hundred percent hour bargaining power. In this situation, when the leisure utility is linear in hours, the effect on employment is zero and all negative effects are on hours per worker. At the other extreme, in the mechanism when hours per worker are effectively regulated, a higher labor tax only reduces employment with a zero effect on hours.

The evidence reveals that not only is the geographical proximity important for the success of the transaction, but that also takeovers can occur across distant locations if the target firm has a long history of its activity that can be monitored by the acquiring companies. We have also tested if there are NUTS regions characteristics that can influence the decision-making, but the results were inconclusive.","[Ciobanu, Radu] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Ciobanu, R (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, Bucharest, Romania.",radu_ciobanu_86@yahoo.com,"Ciobanu, Radu/B-8581-2012; CIOBANU, Radu/L-3245-2019","CIOBANU, Radu/0000-0002-2842-5604",,,,,35,3,3,1,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We document the pattern of dollarisation in SSA economies over the last decade and assess the determinants of dollarisation in SSA compared with the rest of the world. In contrast to other regions, SSA has experienced an increase in dollarisation over the last 10 years, despite examples of successful de-dollarisation, such as Angola, Mozambique and Zambia. Traditional factors such as the optimal portfolio choice arguments contribute only little, while market development contributes most to explaining the variation of dollarisation in SSA. While these factors can account for a significant fraction of the dollarisation in SSA, there is still a non-negligible portion of dollarisation in SSA that is yet to be explained, suggesting that there is some unique feature, specific to SSA, which is not fully captured by traditional explanatory variables. Despite an improved macroeconomic environment, dollarisation remains elevated, likely due to the region's volatile history. This indicates that dollarisation should decline going forward provided that the recently gained stability is preserved.","[Corrales, Juan-Sebastian; Yehoue, Etienne] IMF, African Dept, Washington, DC USA; [Imam, Patrick A.] IMF, Monetary & Capital Markets, Washington, DC USA; [Weber, Sebastian] IMF, Res Dept, Washington, DC USA",International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund; International Monetary Fund,"Imam, PA (通讯作者)，IMF, Monetary & Capital Markets, Washington, DC USA.",pimam@imf.org,,"Yehoue, Etienne B./0009-0009-1887-9440",,,,,21,10,11,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The volatility of LOP deviations is found to be increasing both on the distance separating two locations and on the degree of price stickiness. Sticky prices are also found to be systematically related to the persistence of LOP deviations: Half-lives of LOP deviations are systematically larger for goods with stickier prices. These observations are shown to accord well with the predictions of a dynamic general equilibrium model featuring real market segmentation and Calvo pricing. I also find evidence of remarkably fast convergence to the LOP (average half-lives of LOP deviations are in the order of 3-6 weeks) and show that previously reported convergence estimates may be afflicted by a positive temporal aggregation bias.

The analysis focuses on the specific pattern of technical progress in determining the dynamics of the TFP. This analysis cannot be done with Cobb-Douglas technology, but requires the employment of a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function that allows distinguishing between the direction and the bias of technical progress. We employ a CES specification embodying both labor-and capital-augmenting technical change, with a sigma less than 1. We obtain three main results. (1) There seems to have been a structural break around the mid-1990s in the direction and bias of technological change; (2) The first half of the sample features a labor-augmenting technical change and a capital bias; and (3) In the second part of the sample, both these characteristics seem to disappear, and the evolution of factor endowments assumes a key role. This fact may be seen as one of the potential causes of the stagnation in Italian productivity.","[Federici, Daniela] Univ Cassino & Southern Lazio, Dept Econ & Law, Cassino, Italy; [Saltari, Enrico] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy",University of Cassino; Sapienza University Rome,"Saltari, E (通讯作者)，Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Econ & Law, Rome, Italy.",enrico.saltari@uniroma1.it,,"Federici, Daniela/0000-0002-6369-6370",,,,,20,2,2,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Evidence from Malawi,JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Informal health providers; Government bans; Child mortality,NEONATAL DEATHS; STILLBIRTHS; MORTALITY; QUALITY; BIRTH; SEX; ACCESS; RECALL; INDIA,"Informal health providers ranging from drug vendors to traditional healers account for a large fraction of health care provision in developing countries. They are, however, largely unlicensed and unregulated leading to concern that they provide ineffective and, in some cases, even harmful care. A new and controversial policy tool that has been proposed to alter household health seeking behavior is an outright ban on these informal providers. The theoretical effects of such a ban are ambiguous. In this paper, we study the effect of a ban on informal (traditional) birth attendants imposed by the Malawi government in 2007. To measure the effect of the ban, we use a difference-in-difference strategy exploiting variation across time and space in the intensity of exposure to the ban. Our most conservative estimates suggest that the ban decreased use of traditional attendants by about 15 percentage points. Approximately three quarters of this decline can be attributed to an increase in use of the formal sector and the remainder is accounted for by an increase in relative/friend-attended births. Despite the rather large shift from the informal to the formal sector, we do not find any evidence of a statistically significant reduction in newborn mortality on average. The results are robust to a triple difference specification using young children as a control group. We examine several explanations for this result and find evidence consistent with quality of formal care acting as a constraint on improvements in newborn health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The attractiveness of the Vankovka also supports excellent accessibility by foot or by public transport, in relation to its location between the main railway and bus stations, and with a direct link to the historic city center.","[Kunc, Josef; Dvorak, Zdenek] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Kunc, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",kunc@econ.muni.cz; dvorak.zdenek@mail.muni.cz,"Kunc, Josef/C-4309-2014",,,,,,34,2,2,2,11,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,556,564,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-71,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500072,0

We are specifically interested in how previous research investigated the capacity of remittances to further globalization and growth. Remittances are progressively correlated with possible gross domestic product (GDP) in recipient economies, being determined by both altruism and investment reasons. Financial advancement in the recipient economy is adversely related to remittances (they assist in mitigating credit constraints). Remittances can have a relevant function in moderating the consequences of macroeconomic instability in developing economies. Migrant remittances may be considerably determined by circumstances within some area of the economy and boost particularly steadily as a reaction to negative exogenous shocks. The empirical investigation described in this paper points out that migrant remittances hinder the kinds of policy settings that would enhance the welfare of all people over the long run and influence considerably the macroeconomic soundness in recipient economies. This research makes conceptual and methodological contributions to the macroeconomic drivers of remittances, the impact of business cycle variations and financial advancement on remittances, and the beneficial effect of remittances on poverty mitigation and growth.","[Lazaroiu, George] Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Str Ion Ghica 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania; [Popescu, Gheorghe H.] Dimitrie Cantemir Christian Univ, Fac Banking & Finance, Splaiul Unirii 176, Bucharest 030134, Romania; [Nica, Elvira] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Fac Adm & Publ Management, Piata Romana 6, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Spiru Haret University; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Lazaroiu, G (通讯作者)，Spiru Haret Univ, Fac Sociohuman Sci, Str Ion Ghica 13, Bucharest 030045, Romania.",phd_lazaroiu@yahoo.com; popescu_ucdc@yahoo.com; popescu_elvira@yahoo.com,"Lazaroiu, George/AAX-2926-2021; Lazaroiu, George/A-2262-2015; Nica, Elvira/ADG-5173-2022","Nica, Elvira/0000-0002-7383-2161",,,,,25,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1163,+,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800144,0

We analyze this strategy using a game theoretic approach. The main argument against focusing police resources on hot spots is that it would simply displace criminal activity from one area to another. We provide new insights on the nature of the displacement effect with useful implications for the empirical analysis of crime-reduction effects of police reallocation.

Design/methodology/approach - The framework of Koopman et al. (2014) is adopted to calculate the industry-level vertical specialization indices, VS and VS1. Findings - VS1 is a dominant type of vertical specialization in the key exporting industries of Korea. The increasing net vertical trades (VS1-VS) verifies the upward trends in the locations of slicing up the value chain in the industries empirically. Research limitations/implications - The net vertical trade (VS1-VS) of each industry is an important indicator of the location of slicing up the value chain in the environment of the international production network. Originality/value - The industry-level calculations of VS and VS1 are necessary in order to remedy the aggregation bias from the country-level calculation of VS and VS1 functioning in the opposite direction.","[Lee, Chang-Soo] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea; [Song, Backhoon] Sungshin Womens Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University; Sungshin Women's University,"Lee, CS (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Studies, Yongin, South Korea.",chslee@khu.ac.kr,,,,,,,15,0,0,2,12,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

The employment structure of a given country can tell you quite a lot about its economy. The article analyses impact of economic globalization on changes in the employment structure in the Czech and Slovak Republic according to main sectors of economy and in selected sections after 1993. In the 1990s, the structural changes in Czechoslovakia were induced not only by the decline in industrial production in low performing state owned enterprise, but also by the decline in production in cooperatives and state owned farms. The decline in production was accompanied by the dismissal of employees from both productive sectors of economy. The most significant changes are experienced in so called structurally affected regions, whose production prior to 1989 concentrated on coal mining, metallurgy and heavy machinery. The acquired data show evidence that spatial units are continuously diverging from specialisation to diversification. This diversification process leads to more stable structure of employment, which is currently being affected only to a very limited degree.","[Liskova, Zuzana Dvorakova; Skodova Parmova, Dagmar] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Dvorak, Petr] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Fisheries & Protect Waters, Inst Aquaculture & Protect Waters, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic; [Klufova, Renata] Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Appl Math & Informat, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic",University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice; University of South Bohemia Ceske Budejovice,"Lísková, ZD (通讯作者)，Univ South Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Management, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",zu.li@seznam.cz; dvorakp@frov.jcu.cz; klufova@ef.jcu.cz; parmova@ef.jcu.cz,"Liskova, Zuzana Dvorakova/U-4358-2019; Parmová, Dagmar Škodová/D-8937-2016; Dvořáková Líšková, Zuzana/G-3160-2019; Klufová, Renata/G-3132-2019","Parmová, Dagmar Škodová/0000-0001-8302-2632;",,,,,15,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,417,424,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800052,0

Agglomeration developing process has several stages. Although it starts to grow spontaneously, it should be regulated. There are specialized zones for business, rest and leisure in modern agglomerations, they are usually far from each other, however they should have transport links not longer than one hour. In these circumstances transport system development has a particular meaning. Although a general population mobility level is high, passenger flows have different intensity in various directions and daytime. Transport should serve all these flows, providing high speed and comfort. Such an intensive passenger flow can be maintained successfully only by balanced and well coordinated development of all kind of public transport. Multimodal transportation is a new kind of transport service which is now developing quickly and successfully, according to the global experience analysis. This service has a new level of quality. All the advantages and disadvantages of city public and private transport are taken into account while new transport system is under design. In Western Europe transport service schemes provides not only all kind of public transport but also some opportunities for private ones like car or bicycle.

The econometric estimation establishes that labor market frictions substantially improve the empirical fit of the model. The effect of the interaction between labor and financial frictions on aggregate fluctuations depends on the nature of the shock. For monetary policy, technology, and entrepreneurial wealth shocks, labor market frictions amplify the effect of financial frictions, because robust changes in hiring lead to persistent movements in employment and return on capital that reinforce the original effect of financial frictions. For cost-push, labor supply, marginal efficiency of investment, and preference shocks, labor market frictions dampen the effect of financial frictions by reducing the real cost of repaying existing debt, which lowers the external finance premium.","[Mumtaz, Haroon] Queen Mary Univ, London, England; [Zanetti, Francesco] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Oxford,"Zanetti, F (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",francesco.zanetti@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,53,24,26,2,20,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

An increase in income inequality and the current account deficit and a consolidation of the government budget lead to a decrease in the saving rate of the household sector. Such a process is unsustainable because it leads to an increase in the debt-to-income ratio of the households and its maintenance depends on some kind of asset bubble.

As such it is contrasted with power, which is an unnatural restriction on human liberty. By contrast, Marx discusses competition as a coercive mechanism. Historically, competition develops with the development of market relations and what today appears as 'human nature' is part of this process. Thus it is within competition and not outside of it that Marx explains the coercive nature of capitalism. His critique shows that competition and power appear to be antithetical because market relations are based on individual freedom. However class relations are another essential aspect of capitalism. By neglecting these relations, neoclassical economists (including those of a 'radical' inspiration) implicitly espouse the ruling class's viewpoint, which they simply translate into rigorous mathematical terms. In this sense they are the modern expression of what Marx called the 'vulgar political economy'.","[Palermo, Giulio] Univ Brescia, I-25121 Brescia, Italy",University of Brescia,"Palermo, G (通讯作者)，Univ Brescia, Dept Econ, Via S Faustino 74-B, I-25122 Brescia, Italy.",palermo@eco.unibs.it,,,,,,,70,8,8,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Unlike the previous studies, the regimes and thresholds are endogenously determined by sequential model selection. A nonlinear asymmetric pattern is discovered in the short-run price transmission from crude oil to retail gasoline, via both the commodity and financial markets. For medium movements in both oil prices, increases demonstrate a significantly stronger impact on retail gasoline prices than decreases, However, asymmetry is detected for neither large nor small oil price movements. Nonlinear asymmetric transmission via the refinery markets is excluded. Nevertheless, the long-run speed towards equilibrium does not exhibit asymmetry between any paired regimes. We discuss the economic interpretations and implications of the detected nonlinear asymmetry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Firms are initially inactive, and they differ only in the opportunity costs of using their assets (e.g., owing to different redeployment or resale values). After characterizing the unique Markov perfect equilibrium of the entry and exit game under demand uncertainty, we challenge the result that the threat of preemption can partially or even totally dissipate a first mover advantage. When post-entry profits can be negative, the preemption threat of a firm may become weaker because its rival may force it out of the market after entering. As a result, there may be little or no dissipation of the first mover advantage when post-investment profits are not assumed to be always positive. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It also attempts to identify other critical variables for improving tourismbalances and further suggests that the certain characteristics of participating nation's patterns of medal wins at the Games should be better understood to contribute to attracting more tourists. Design/methodology/approach - For the quantitative analyses of the relationship between tourism balance and the Games, Newey-West Hac estimation is used to correct autoregression for seven host countries of the Winter Olympic Games in last 24 years. For the analyses of characteristics of specialization in medal wins, conventional revealed comparative advantage model is used and tobit estimation method is applied. Findings - This research confirms the role of hosting the Winter Games in improving tourism balance and increasing the number of inbound tourists. The findings from analyses on country specialization in sports largely coincide with the existing literature, however, in addition to confirming the well-established significance of key variables determining country performance like population and GDP, this study also discloses the role of other variables like team size and population density. Originality/value - Major contributions of this paper are two-fold: it analyzes the Winter Olympic Games which was rarely tackled; and relates hosting the mega-sport events with the service trade account. As the host country of the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, the Republic of Korea has great potential to overcome that chronic deficit by attracting more inbound tourists. This study indicates how country characteristics of specialization can be used to enhance effectiveness of promotion strategy to attract a large number of foreign tourists to the PyeongChang Winter Games and consequently improve tourism balance.","[Sul, Sooyoung] Kyonggi Univ, Dept Sports Management, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Kyonggi University,"Sul, S (通讯作者)，Kyonggi Univ, Dept Sports Management, Suwon, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",sooyoung815@hanmail.net,,,,,,,30,2,2,1,28,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND",1229-828X,,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Overall, the effect of immigrants is relatively larger among small-and medium-sized enterprises and is smaller among large-sized enterprises. There are, however, considerable differences, both in the magnitude and in nature of the observed effects of immigrants on manufactured and non-manufactured goods exporters of comparable size categories. Similarly, heterogeneity is found in the effects of immigrants on the numbers of small-, medium-, and large-sized exporters across home country cohorts that are grouped by World Bank income classifications and by broad regional classifications of destination markets.

The econometric analysis focuses on the selection to temporary migration and the estimation of wage premium to return, along with the decomposition of the returnee-stayer wage gap using the Oaxaca-Blinder approach and an investigation of wage premium dynamics over time after return. The results generally show higher returns from temporary labour migration for young people relative to older people, and among youth, the share of the unexplained fraction of the wage premium is also higher.

However the need for credit risk measurement is here since people started borrowing any goods they needed. The most common subject of debt is money and the lender is a bank. When the bank lends some amount of money to a debtor, the debtor is obliged to return the full amount plus some compensation for borrowing the money. There always exists a danger that the debtor will fail to fulfill this obligation and the lender will lose some of his money, so he should be aware of the risk. Therefore he needs to estimate the probability distribution of the credit loss for the entire portfolio of loans. Although the corporate credit risk literature contains of the corporate bonds credit risk change modelling, there is fewer analysis of the credit risk for portfolios of consumer loans. Using of a stochastic process based on a transition probability - Markov chain is one of the approaches to this problem. The aim of our paper is to divide portfolio of loans into groups (classes) according to the time delay in payment, to calculate the probability of a default for each group using the fundamental matrix of the Markov chain, and to appoint present value of future bad debts.","[Vojtekova, Maria; Blazekova, Olga] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Vojtekova, M (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 8215-1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",maria.vojtekova@fpedas.uniza.sk; olga.blazekova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Blazekova, Olga/Q-5607-2016; Vojtekova, Maria/P-4623-2016","Blazekova, Olga/0000-0003-2394-2351; Vojtekova, Maria/0000-0001-9040-0443",project VEGA [1/0696/16],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper is an output of the science project VEGA 1/0696/16.,,16,1,1,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2401,2408,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800298,0

While the existing literature has already established the negative impact of terrorist actions on international tourism in a particular region, this paper aims to determine whether ETA's final ceasefire and definitive dissolution had a positive impact on domestic tourism in Basque Country. To that end, a directed gravity model is estimated over a panel data-set of 699 domestic tourist flows between the Spanish regions from 2008 to 2013. Results suggest that the negative impact on visitor flows was localized in the Basque Country. Also, regardless of a permanent ceasefire announced in 2010, only the 2011 'definitive cessation of violence' had an immediate significant impact on the number of visitors to the Basque Country. These results complement the scarce literature on post-conflict tourism analysis and may have implications for regional authorities in affected regions in their efforts to rebuild their destination brands.","[Voltes-Dorta, Augusto] Univ Edinburgh, Management Sci & Business Econ Grp, Sch Business, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland; [Luis Jimenez, Juan; Suarez-Aleman, Ancor] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",University of Edinburgh; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Jiménez, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Dept Anal Econ Aplicado, Fac Econ Empresa & Turismo, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain.",juanluis.jimenez@ulpgc.es,"Suárez-Alemán, Ancor/R-9307-2016","Jimenez Gonzalez, Juan Luis/0000-0002-3808-2588",,,,,58,12,12,1,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

This research examines monopsony power using Lau's Hessian identity relationships based on the empirical properties of duality theory. Lau's Hessian identity shows the Hessian matrices are equal under pure competition using an unrestricted profit function, restricted profit function and production function approach. We examine how market power changes in the monopsony case using Lau's Hessian identity relationships. Results show that there is a difference between the unrestricted and restricted profit function results under monopsony power. The important implication is that if an input or output is potentially in a market subject to market power, that input or output should be modelled as a fixed input or output to correctly recover the underlying technology.","[Yamaura, Koichi] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Int Environm & Agr Sci, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan; [Featherstone, Allen M.] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA",Tokyo University of Agriculture & Technology; Kansas State University,"Yamaura, K (通讯作者)，Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Int Environm & Agr Sci, Fuchu, Tokyo, Japan.",kyamaura@cc.tuat.ac.jp,"YAMAURA, KOICHI/B-9213-2015","YAMAURA, KOICHI/0000-0002-8364-2660",,,,,13,2,2,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The border tax adjustment, a tax levied on imports to reproduce domestic taxation on similar goods, is advocated to prevent such compliance failures as well as to support unilateral pollution regulations by mitigating firms' competitiveness losses and carbon leakages. The paper investigates whether this trade instrument can constitute a decentralized solution to achieve the first-best in a noncooperative framework. It develops a two-country two-firm reciprocal-market model of trade with global pollution and country heterogeneity. Countries' interactions are studied following a noncooperative game theory approach, for two scenarios defined by the possibility to implement a border tax adjustment to sanction unilateral deviation from the cooperative situation. The paper predicts first that this opportunity modifies the countries' choices of strategies toward more compliance; second that among the strategic and effective dimensions of the border tax adjustment, only the former allows to achieve the first-best; finally that the border tax adjustment fosters countries' participation in the cooperative international environmental agreement.","[Anoulies, Lisa] Univ Paris 11, Univ Paris Saclay, RITM, Paris, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Anouliès, L (通讯作者)，Univ Paris 11, Univ Paris Saclay, RITM, Paris, France.",lisa.anoulies@u-psud.fr,,,,,,,27,7,7,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Policies by modern governments increasingly recognise the benefits of supporting R&D investment. Government funding has, however, become an increasingly scarce resource in times of financial crisis and economic austerity. Hence, it is important that available funds are used and targeted effectively. This paper offers the first systematic review and critical discussion of what the R&D literature has to say currently about the effectiveness of major public R&D policies in increasing private R&D investment. Public policies are considered within three categories, R&D tax credits and direct subsidies, support of the university research system and the formation of high-skilled human capital, and support of formal R&D cooperations across a variety of institutions. Crucially, the large body of more recent literature observes a shift away from the earlier findings that public subsidies often crowd-out private R&D to finding that subsidies typically stimulate private R&D. Tax credits are also much more unanimously than previously found to have positive effects. University research, high-skilled human capital, and R&D cooperation also typically increase private R&D. Recent work indicates that accounting for non-linearities is one area of research that may refine existing results.","Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",Aston University,"Becker, B (通讯作者)，Aston Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",,,"Becker, Bettina/0000-0002-7435-7374",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/K006614/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,126,235,250,18,254,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

However, little is known about the factors that are linked to obesity for Indigenous Australians. The purpose of this paper is to enhance this understanding by examining the role of behavioural characteristics, demographics and socioeconomic status in explaining Indigenous Australians' obesity rates. This study finds that the key factors that impact on the probability of being obese relate to Indigenous Australians' wealth, engagement in physical activity and diet. The factors associated with obesity also vary for Indigenous men and women and for the Indigenous population living in remote and non-remote communities. The results identify potential target groups for policy aimed at reducing the prevalence of obesity for Indigenous Australians.","[Birch, Elisa] Univ Western Australia, Crawley, WA 6009 USA",University of Western Australia,"Birch, E (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, UWA Business Sch, Mail Bag M251,35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, WA 6009 USA.",elisa.birch@uwa.edu.au,,,Australian Research Council; University of Western Australia,Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University of Western Australia,The author thanks John Pawley and David Marshall for research assistance and Anu Rammohan and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

In this paper we estimate the price elasticity of demand for coal in China using a panel of province-level data for 1998-2012. We find that provincial coal demand has become increasingly price elastic As of 2012 we estimate that this elasticity was in the range -0.3 to -0.7 in point estimate terms when responses over two years are considered. The results imply that China's coal market is becoming more suited to price-based approaches to reducing emissions. The elimination of coal consumption subsidies could reduce national coal use and related emissions by around 2%.

We have developed an analytical equilibrium model to quantify the effect of deploying demand response on social welfare and energy trade. The novelty of this research is that it demonstrates the existence of an optimal area for the price signal in which demand response enhances social welfare. This optimal area is negatively correlated to the degree of competitiveness of generation technologies and the market size of the system. In particular, it should be noted that the value of unserved energy or energy reduction which the producers could lose from such a demand response scheme would limit its effectiveness. This constraint is even greater if energy trade between countries is limited. Finally, we have demonstrated scope for more aggressive demand response, when only considering the impact in terms of consumer surplus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Yet 'care' receives scant analysis; it is portrayed as a spillover effect or externality in the form of interdependent utility functions. In this context care can only be conceived as either acts of altruism or as social capital. Both conceptions are subject to considerable problems stemming from mainstream health economics' reliance on a reductionist social model built around instrumental rationality and consequentialism. Subsequently, this implies a disregard for moral rules and duties and the compassionate aspects of behaviour. Care as an externality is a second-order concern relative to self-interested utility maximization, and is therefore crowded out by the parameters of the standard model. We outline an alternative relational approach to conceptualising care based on the social embeddedness of the individual that emphasises the ethical properties of care. The deontological dimension of care suggests that standard health economics is likely to undervalue the importance of care and caring in medicine.","[Davis, John B.] Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA; [Davis, John B.] Univ Amsterdam, Fac Econ, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [McMaster, Robert] Univ Glasgow, Dept Management, Glasgow, Lanark, Scotland",Marquette University; University of Amsterdam; University of Glasgow,"Davis, JB (通讯作者)，Marquette Univ, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53233 USA.",john.davis@mu.edu; Robert.McMaster@glasgow.ac.uk,,,,,,,75,10,10,0,14,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

To fill this gap we consider two markets North and South and two firms owned by investors from the North, and show that firms have excess capacity. We consider two types of EDI: vertical and horizontal. Examples can be found in industries such as textiles and toys for the former and in automobile industry for the later. We find that investment in capacity encourages vertical FDI but restricts horizontal FDI. Therefore, investment in capacity has an opposite effect on the different types of FDI and so it should be borne in mind by governments when deciding policies affecting FDI. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

When this strategy is profitable for the patent holder, it is welfare enhancing if and only if the entry cost is high, or the efficiency edge of the technology is significant.

In one of the sectors plants differ in their productivity, produce differentiated goods, and generate emissions that can be reduced using an abatement technology. An emission reduction policy causes resource reallocation among plants and across sectors in two ways: a static way due to the dispersion of productivity and a dynamic way due to entry and exit. The model shows that the static distributional effect favors the emission tax, while the dynamic distributional effect favors the emission standard. Calibrated to Canadian data, the model shows that the dynamic effect dominates the static one and hence the emission standard dominates the emission tax in terms of welfare. This is the case not only in the baseline model, but also in a model with a large variation of parameter values for productivity dispersion, market power, and abatement efficiency.

This paper develops a financial CGE model with interaction between real and financial side of the Chinese economy and applies the model to study oil price shocks and monetary policy responses. Unlike macro models in the current literature, the financial CGE model can be implemented to look into industrial details of effects of oil shocks, the responding interest rate and reserve ratio policy. We then identify the optimal monetary policies aiming at each inflation target. We found that when tolerance for inflation is high, it is best to implement interest rate policy alone. On the other hand, when tolerance for inflation is low and the government is more focused on social stability and household welfare, reserve ratio policy should also be implemented in addition to interest rate policy. In a scenario where world oil price increases by 100% and the inflation rate is to be targeted at below 2%, the monetary authority should raise the interest rate and reserve ratio by 2.5 percentage points and 3.0 percentage points, respectively.

We obtain three main results. First, the model suggests that pessimism/underconfidence is not a powerful driver of credit cycles. Instead, it supports the conclusion that it is euphoria during large upswings that leads to the next crunch.

This paper posits the hypothesis that altruism or love in a relationship is endogenous to the actions of the partners and studies how this influences allocations and efficiency in a bargaining model of household decision-making. The main results are that agents treat their partner in a kinder way than without endogenously evolving love, this leads to more equitable allocations in household decision making and greater intertemporal efficiency. There are two mechanisms at work: agents treat their partner nicely to avoid retribution by a less loving partner in the future; and they treat the partner nicely so that the kind reciprocal behavior raises their own love towards the partner, which lets them enjoy higher utility. As to love, two interpretations emerge: love is a commitment device by which couples can implement Pareto superior allocations; and love is an investment good in the sense that costly nice behavior towards the partner today may ensure higher levels of trust and efficiency in the future.","[Si, Man] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Si, M (通讯作者)，Univ Edinburgh, Sch Econ, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland.",man.si.11.1985@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,1,1,1,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The empirical results confirm that better-quality political and economic institutions can have positive effects on economic growth. All in all, the evidence from nonlinear model reveals that the quality of political institutions that ensure stable government, less expropriation, and low external conflict are the core dimensions of an institutional matrix because they influence the growth effects of economic institutions, confirming the hierarchy of institutions hypothesis. The study also finds that when political and economic institutions are accounted for, institutions that prevent internal conflict and tensions arising from ethnic and religious conflicts do not have significant (positive) impacts on growth. Thus, institutional reforms to upgrade the quality of both political and economic institutions are crucial for development in OIC countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In a previous study, two of us (Underwood, Friesner and Cross 2014) presented criteria for sustainable community economic development, a three-fold test to comparatively assess economic development policies: ecological holism, community centeredness, and institutional legitimacy. Applying this test generates an iterative, evolutionary process of economic development. Absent from these criteria is the concept of intention, as policy options are not given, but rather designed by self-interested groups to manipulate interpretations of these test criteria in advancement of their vested interests outcomes which can be juxtaposed to the interests of community. Here, we integrate two additional principles: economic diversity and solidarity. Economic diversity emphasizes living wages in numerous industries to stabilize exogenous economic shocks. Solidarity, as a unit of socio-economic interdependence, stresses commonality of wellbeing within communities. Integrating solidarity and economic diversity into the criteria for sustainable community economic development improves policy design and outcomes that sustain the environment, while also providing living wage employment for community members.","[Underwood, Daniel A.] Peninsula Coll, Econ & Environm Sci, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA; [Underwood, Daniel A.] Univ Washington, Sch Environm & Forest Sci, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Hackney, Donald D.] Gonzaga Univ, Sch Business Adm, Spokane, WA USA; [Friesner, Dan] N Dakota State Univ, Pharm Practice, Fargo, ND USA; [Friesner, Dan] Washington State Univ, Sch Econ Sci, Pullman, WA 99164 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Gonzaga University; North Dakota State University Fargo; Washington State University,"Underwood, DA (通讯作者)，Peninsula Coll, Econ & Environm Sci, Port Angeles, WA 98362 USA.",,"Friesner, Daniel/AAK-2377-2020",,,,,,35,5,8,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

Employing standard event-study methodology for a sample of 1,648 M&As from 1997 to 2013, we find that announcements of mergers and acquisitions generate a 5.17 percent average abnormal return for target firms' stocks within a three-day symmetric event window. Furthermore, cross-sectional regressions explaining the variation in abnormal returns indicate that the relative size and the percentage share of the target firm sought, as well as cash-paid M&As, are also positively related to abnormal returns, while M&As in heavily regulated industries, and in which the acquirers are private equity funds, have lower abnormal returns. Finally, abnormal returns have increased in the post-2008 crisis period. We compare our evidence with related studies on developed markets and explain the differences.

Instead of the continuous limit order book market design that is currently predominant, we argue that financial exchanges should use frequent batch auctions: uniform price double auctions conducted, for example, every tenth of a second. That is, time should be treated as discrete instead of continuous, and orders should be processed in a batch auction instead of serially. Our argument has three parts. First, we use millisecond-level direct-feed data from exchanges to document a series of stylized facts about how the continuous market works at high-frequency time horizons: (i) correlations completely break down; which (ii) leads to obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities; and (iii) competition has not affected the size or frequency of the arbitrage opportunities, it has only raised the bar for how fast one has to be to capture them. Second, we introduce a simple theory model which is motivated by and helps explain the empirical facts. The key insight is that obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, like those observed in the data, are built into the market design-continuous-time serial-processing implies that even symmetrically observed public information creates arbitrage rents. These rents harm liquidity provision and induce a never-ending socially wasteful arms race for speed. Last, we show that frequent batch auctions directly address the flaws of the continuous limit order book. Discrete time reduces the value of tiny speed advantages, and the auction transforms competition on speed into competition on price. Consequently, frequent batch auctions eliminate the mechanical arbitrage rents, enhance liquidity for investors, and stop the high-frequency trading arms race.","Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; Univ Maryland, College Pk, MD USA",University of Chicago; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Budish, E (通讯作者)，Chicago Booth, 5807 S Woodlawn Ave, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",eric.budish@chicagobooth.edu,"Cramton, Peter/ABG-7651-2021","Cramton, Peter/0000-0001-8621-1092",,,,,85,271,307,5,81,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Most respondents in our sample show preference and variance stability consistent with rational pre-existent and well formed preferences. Nearly all of the remainder exhibit both learning and fatigue effects.

Their purpose is to help us understand the external reality that they model. In economics, particularly in econometrics, models make use of random elements, so as to provide quantitatively for phenomena that we cannot or do not wish to model explicitly. By varying the realizations of the random elements in a simulation, it is possible to study counterfactual outcomes, which are necessary for any discussion of causality. The bootstrap is virtual reality within an outer reality. The principle of the bootstrap is that, if its virtual reality mimics as closely as possible the reality that contains it, it can be used to study aspects of that outer reality. The idea of bootstrap iteration is explored, and a discrete model discussed that allows investigators to perform iteration to any desired level.","[Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] McGill Univ, CIREQ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada; [Davidson, Russell] AMSE GREQAM, Marseille, France",McGill University; Universite de Montreal; McGill University,"Davidson, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Dept Econ, Montreal, PQ H3A 2T5, Canada.",russell.davidson@mcgill.ca,,,"Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)","Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University); Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC)(Fonds de recherche du Quebec (FRQ)Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC))","The work on which the address was based was supported by the Canada Research Chair program (Chair in Economics, McGill University) and the Fonds de recherche du Quebec - Societe et culture (FRQSC).",,21,2,2,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

We propose to test financial contagion using an econometric procedure where we first estimate the preference parameters of the consumption-based asset pricing model (C-CAPM) to measure the equilibrium risk premia in different countries and then we consider the difference between empirical and equilibrium risk premia to test cross-country disequilibrium episodes due to contagion. Disequilibrium in financial markets is modeled by the multivariate DCC-GARCH model including a deterministic crisis variable. Our approach allows to identify the disequilibria generated by increases in volatility that is not explained by fundamentals but is endogenous to financial markets and to evaluate the existence of contagion effects defined by exogenous shifts in cross-country return correlations during crisis periods.

Weather insurance has the potential to provide large welfare gains, equivalent to a permanent increase in consumption of almost 17%. Moreover, it can allow for the adoption of riskier but more productive seeds, further enhancing welfare. The interplay with other uninsured risks, the presence of liquidity constraints, basis risk, and loading factor on the insurance premium may account for the low take-up that is often empirically observed.","[de Nicola, Francesca] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"de Nicola, F (通讯作者)，World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",fdenicola@worldbank.org,,,,,,,31,19,20,0,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

We find that pupils in the academic track give more and choose the equal split more often than pupils in the vocational track in the DG, but there are no robust track differences in the PGG. Selection into tracks results in differences in IQ, in personality and in socio-economic background, but these differences appear insufficient to account for the DG differences. A propensity-score-matching econometric model, based on a rich set of individual characteristics, provides evidence that the DG behavior of pupils with similar endowments is directly affected by the distinct track environments. We conclude that the existence of a treatment effect of tracks on other-regarding behavior in the DG of pupils is likely. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The identification strategy relies on combining information on initial regional labor and product market structure with the exogenous tariff reduction schedule over four three-year periods. We add to the literature on local labor market effects of trade policies by distinguishing between tariffs for output markets and for intermediate inputs, and finding that poverty reduced especially in districts with a greater sector exposure to input tariff liberalization. Among the potential channels behind this effect, we show that low-skilled work participation and middle-skilled wages were more responsive to reductions in import tariffs on intermediate goods than to reductions in import tariffs on final outputs. These results point towards increasing firm competitiveness as a driving factor behind the beneficial poverty effects. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The paper shows that municipalities owning a capital share in a gas distribution network operator experience a reduction in the hazard of awarding. The paper provides additional tests to support the causal interpretation of the findings. First, the credibility of competitive procedures is tested. Second, the presence of a contemporaneous dependence structure in the data is taken into account to address the imitation effect among the municipalities served by the same operator.

The model suggests a strong complementarity between intra-industry and inter-industry trade. The pattern of inter-industry vs intra-industry trade is analyzed using the Grubel-Lloyd index.

By using the data on the bankruptcy of firms after the Great Tohoku Earthquake, we examine the impact of the damage to lender banks on the firms' probability of bankruptcy. To extract the impact of purely exogenous financial shocks on bankruptcy, we focus on firms located outside the earthquake-affected area but that transact with banks located inside the area. Our findings somewhat counterintuitively suggest that a damaged bank reduces the probability of bankruptcy and weakens the natural selection of firms. We further examine the impact of the injection of public capital into damaged banks and obtain some evidence that the injection reduces the probability of the bankruptcy of their borrowers and weakens the natural selection.

The experiment varies the amount of wage inequality and the political process used to determine tax rates. We find that higher inequality leads to higher tax rates; the effect is significant and large in magnitude. The tax rates and labor supply functions are both quantitatively close to the theory. The result is robust to the political institution. The theoretical model of Meltzer-Richard is extended to incorporate social preferences in the form of altruism and inequity aversion, which are found to have negligible effects in the data.

Wages of Asian women are compared with non-Asians. Both ordinary least squares and instrumental variables estimates of the effects of intermarriage on the wages of Asian women are negative and significant. Non-Asian women earn a wage premium that becomes insignificant when controls for selection into marriage are introduced. One possible explanation for the intermarriage penalty for Asians is an income effect of having a high-earning native husband. Intermarriage penalties rise with husband's education. Assimilation patterns of intermarried Asians indicate that they have lower initial wages, market hours, and employment, but exhibit faster rates of growth over their years of stay. The results are robust across Asian subgroups and husband's ethnicity.

The behavioral model takes the view that agents have limited cognitive abilities. As a result, it is rational to use simple forecasting rules and to subject the use of these rules to a fitness test. Agents are then driven to select the rule that performs best. The behavioral model produces endogenous and self-fulfilling movements of optimism and pessimism (animal spirits). Our main result is that the existence of banks intensifies these movements, creating a greater scope for booms and busts. Thus, banks do not create but amplify animal spirits. We find that increases in the equity ratios of banks tend to reduce the importance of animal spirits over the business cycle. The other policy conclusion we derive from our results is that the central bank has an important responsibility for stabilising output: output stabilization is an instrument to tame the animal spirits. This has the effect of improving the trade-off between inflation and output volatility. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In the states with the line-item veto, the tax level jumps at the point where the government switches from divided to unified. With a regression discontinuity design, we show that this jump can be interpreted as a causal effect. We propose a simple model to account for this nonlinear relationship. The sequential nature of the budget bargaining game, that is, the legislature proposes and the governor cuts with the line-item veto, implies that the tax level is determined by the overlap between the supporters of the governor and the supporters of the legislative majority. Changes in the size of the overlap determine the tax level.","[De Magalhaes, Leandro] Univ Bristol, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England; [Ferrero, Lucas] Univ Nacl Nordeste, RA-3400 Corrientes, Argentina",University of Bristol,"De Magalhaes, L (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, 8 Woodland Rd, Bristol BS8 1TN, Avon, England.",leandro.demagalhaes@bristol.ac.uk,,"De Magalhaes, Leandro/0000-0002-1860-9899",,,,,38,1,1,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-4038,2325-8012,,SOUTH ECON J,South.

Yet, theory traditionally assumes that the fate of non-selected goods does not influence consumers' preferences. Results from a framed field experiment involving the private choice of wine show that consumer preferences can dramatically shift for items under the threat of imminent destruction.

The present paper tries to fill this research gap in the context of India and China. By applying the Hiemstra and Jones (1994) nonlinear Granger causality test to the VAR residuals, the study finds a significant bi-directional nonlinear Granger causality between oil prices and exchange rates in both countries. The findings suggest that the nonlinearity of oil price influences the exchange rate irrespective of the exchange rate regimes. Further, to check robustness, the persistence in the variance of oil price and exchange rate is taken into account using a GARCH (1, 1) model. While the results consistently hold in the case of India, with respect to China, a unidirectional causality runs from exchange rate to oil price. However, the oil price in China does not Granger cause exchange rate. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In-store observations focused on collecting data on baseline prices. The price promotion leaflets enabled the assessment of the promotional activity of the observed retailers. The interviews were used to check the validity of the research results. By grouping the analysed 11 retail chains along baseline price levels and price promotion activities, three different types of pricing strategies were identified. A relationship was found between the three pricing strategies and the performance indicators of the included chains. An important finding is that retail chains with a medium price level and low promotional activity were the least successful, while retailers with a low price level and high promotional activity achieved the best performance.","Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Eotvos Lorand University,"Berezvai, Z (通讯作者)，Eotvos Lorand Univ, Dept Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",bzombor@caesar.elte.hu,"Berezvai, Zombor/ABE-3178-2021","Berezvai, Zombor/0000-0001-7807-2977",,,,,28,1,2,0,12,AKADEMIAI KIADO RT,BUDAPEST,"PRIELLE K U 19, PO BOX 245,, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

To refine our basic understanding of this role, this paper proposes a methodological extension of the recently developed causality-in-variance procedure and considers the case of Lebanon and Jordan. These two heavy importers of oil are interesting in the sense that they are located in a region with a large number of rich oil-exporting countries, so their stock markets are tied to oil-exporters by way of foreign investors. The conditional mean and variance of returns are modeled within an ARMAX-GARCH framework that accommodates three salient features of the data, namely: autocorrelation, day-of-the-week effects, and movements in international markets. For comparison purposes, the stock markets of Morocco and Tunisia are also included in the study. Empirical analyses highlight the dynamic effects of the global financial crisis on the volatility spillovers between oil and the stock markets of oil-importing countries and provide more insights into the seemingly contradictory effects of being oil-importers while having investors from oil-exporting countries. The main results indicate that the volatility spillover is much more apparent from the world oil market to the stock market of Jordan than the other way around, whereas oil volatility is not a good predictor of Lebanese stock market volatility. Finally, policy/practical implications and conclusions for future research are drawn. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A benevolent and fully rational government chooses taxes on labor income and state-contingent bonds to finance public spending, considering that private agents form their expectations through a learning algorithm. Facing a trade-off between distortionary taxes and distorted expectations, the Ramsey planner chooses the policy that minimizes the total cost of distortions. The analysis produces two main results. First, the government will use fiscal variables to manipulate expectations, reducing taxes and issuing debt at times of pessimism and doing the opposite at times of optimism. This speeds up learning. Second, the expectation-dependent fiscal plan is also history-dependent, and it prescribes taxes that are not as smooth and more persistent than under rational expectations. These findings are robust to alternative learning algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Instead of imposing a menu cost, we assume that more precise decisions are more costly. In equilibrium, firms optimally make some errors in price-setting, thus economizing on managerial time. Both the time cost of choice, and the resulting risk of errors, give firms an incentive to leave their prices unchanged until they perceive a sufficiently costly deviation from the optimal price. We show that this error-prone control cost framework helps explain many puzzling observations from microdata. However, on the macroeconomic side, pricing errors do little to explain the real effects of monetary shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Indebted college graduates have lower net worth, less home equity, and compromised ability to accumulate assets, as compared to their peers with the same level of education but no student debt. They may also experience poorer educational outcomes, with independent effects on earning power and, then, later wealth accumulation. Especially given the relationship between initial household wealth and children's later educational outcomes, these findings about the post-college financial outcomes of indebted students and graduates raise the specter of ongoing, sustained, and cross-generational perpetuation of societal divides. In the United States, higher education is valued not just as a good in itself, but also as a means to the end of greater economic security and the primary lever for economic mobility. Evaluating student loans through this lens underscores the long-term, volatile, and often hidden effects of student loan dependence and raises the stakes for consideration of alternative approaches to higher education finance.","[Elliott, William; Lewis, Melinda] Univ Kansas, Sch Social Welf, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Elliott, W (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Sch Social Welf, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",welliott@ku.edu,,,Kaufmann Foundation,Kaufmann Foundation,This paper could not have been completed without the generous support of the Kaufmann Foundation.,,87,39,68,2,62,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We propose a merit-pay hypothesis, that higher-ability workers will reduce their effort if they are not paid more than coworkers with lower ability, but not vice versa.

This paper uses the labour supply effect of EMA to infer the magnitude of the transfer response made by the parent, and so test for the presence of an 'effectively altruistic' head-of-household, who redistributes resources among household members so as to maximise overall welfare. Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, anEMApayment of 30 pound per week is found to reduce teenagers' labour supply by 3 h per week and probability of employment by 13 % points from a base of 43 %. We conclude that parents withdraw cash and in-kind transfers from their children to a value of between 22 and 86 % of what the child receives in EMA. This means we reject the hypothesis of an effectively altruistic head-of-household, and argue that making this cash transfer directly to the child produces higher child welfare than if the equivalent transfer were made to parents.","Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England",University of Essex,"Holford, A (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Inst Social & Econ Res, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",ajholf@essex.ac.uk,,"Holford, Angus/0000-0003-2019-4845","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I025499/1]; ESRC [ES/L009153/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/L009153/1, 1014054] Funding Source: researchfish",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This work was carried out during integrated M.Sc. and Ph.D. studies at the Institute for Social and Economic Research, University of Essex.

Similar findings are obtained in the bivariate model using sectoral, industry-level, seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted data. In models with aggregate data, shocks that immediately raise the price level eventually cause output to fall while shocks that affect price with a lag immediately raise output and eventually cause the price level to rise. These responses combined with the variance decompositions suggest the short-run aggregate supply curve is nearly horizontal and the aggregate demand curve is essentially vertical. A statistical model that identifies shocks that don't affect prices for at least two months is also developed. In general, shocks with the slowest effect on prices explain most, if not all, of the short-run output variance. Our robust findings reject theories in which prices adjust rapidly to clear markets. However, the evidence that output and price are nearly orthogonal for a substantial amount of time is difficult to reconcile with standard models of sticky price adjustment. We also find that the vast majority of the long-horizon variance of aggregate output is explained by shocks that raise output and the price level. That finding provides support for theories of aggregate demand non-neutrality in which a positive movement in aggregate demand permanently increases the level of output.","[Keating, John W.] Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Kanyama, Isaac K.] Univ Johannesburg, Dept Econ & Econometr, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Kansas; University of Johannesburg,"Keating, JW (通讯作者)，Univ Kansas, Dept Econ, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,4,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The core idea is to adapt the binary-lottery incentive scheme, so that an individual payoff is a probability to see one's preferred social allocation implemented. For a large class of social preference models, the method induces payoffs in the game that are in line with subjects' (social) preferences. We test the method in several popular experimental games, contrasting behaviors with and without our methodology. Our results suggest that a substantial part of the difference between predictions based on selfishness and observed behaviors seems driven by such preferences, since our method does induce more selfish behaviors.

This study proposes to use the RS estimator in the CARR model (called henceforth the CARRS model) instead of using the range. The results of the CARES models with and without volatility breaks are compared with the results of the GARCH models with and without volatility breaks. We also compare the forecasting performance of CARRS models with the forecasting performance of EGARCH, TGARCH and FIGARCH models based on error statistics and regression approach. The findings indicate that the CARRS model with volatility breaks effectively captures the dynamics of volatility and provides better out-of-sample forecasts when compared with GARCH, EGARCH, TGARCH and FIGARCH models. We also devise a trading strategy to examine the economic significance of the proposed framework which indicates that the investor can make substantial gains (approximately 6%-10%) in return for most of cases based on volatility forecasts of CARES model with volatility breaks.

However, few studies have demonstrated the role of Google search data in analyzing trader positions and energy price volatility. This paper uses the Google search volume index (GSVI) to measure investor attention, and investigate the relationships among the GSVI, different trader positions, and crude oil prices from January 2004 to June 2014. The empirical results present some new evidences. First, the GSVI measures investor attention from noncommercial and nonreporting traders, rather than commercial traders. Second, the feedback loop between GSVI and crude oil price is verified. Third, the GSVI improves the forecast accuracy of crude oil price in recursive one-week-ahead forecasts. This paper contributes to existing literature by incorporating open source Internet-based data into the analysis and prediction of crude oil prices, as well as other prices in financial markets in the Big Data Era.

Although MOOCs are an interesting experiment with a role to play in the future of higher education, they are a surprisingly small part of the online higher education scene. We believe that online education, at least online education that begins to take full advantage of the interactivity offered by the web, is still in its infancy. We begin by sketching out the several faces of online learning-asynchronous, partially asynchronous, the flipped classroom, and others-as well as how the use of online education differs across the spectrum of higher education. We consider how the growth of online education will affect cost and convenience, student learning, and the role of faculty and administrators. We argue that spread of online education through higher education is likely to be slower than many commenters expect. We hope that online education will bring substantial benefits. But less-attractive outcomes are also possible if, for instance, legislators use the existence of online education as an excuse for sharp cuts in higher education budgets that lead to lower-quality education for many students, at the same time that richer, more selective schools are using online education as one more weapon in the arms race dynamic that is driving costs higher.","[McPherson, Michael S.] Spencer Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [McPherson, Michael S.] Macalester Coll, St Paul, MN 55105 USA; [Bacow, Lawrence S.] Harvard Univ, Harvard Kennedy Sch, Ctr Publ Leadership, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Bacow, Lawrence S.] Tufts Univ, Medford, MA USA; [Bacow, Lawrence S.] Ithaka S&R, New York, NY USA",Macalester College; Harvard University; Tufts University,"McPherson, MS (通讯作者)，Spencer Fdn, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",mmcpherson@spencer.org; lawrence_bacow@hks.harvard.edu,,,,,,,41,47,109,2,41,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

When investments are indivisible, aggregate capital is determined by the number of firms that invest. I develop a method to derive the closed-form distribution of the number of investing firms when each firm's initial capital level varies stochastically. This method shows that idiosyncratic shocks may lead to nonvanishing aggregate fluctuations when the number of firms tends to infinity. I incorporate this mechanism in a dynamic general equilibrium model with indivisible investment and predetermined goods prices. The model features no aggregate exogenous shocks, and the fluctuation is driven by idiosyncratic productivity shocks. Numerical simulations show that the model generates aggregate fluctuations comparable to the business cycles in magnitude and correlation structure under standard calibration.","Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Innovat Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan",Hitotsubashi University,"Nirei, M (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Innovat Res, Kunitachi, Tokyo, Japan.",nirei@iir.hit-u.ac.jp,,,JSPS KAKENHI [21730154]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [21730154] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","I am grateful to the co-editor Gadi Barlevy and three anonymous referees for their very helpful suggestions.

It is found, first, that from 2000 to 2012, the import commodity structure in China underwent structural change. Shares of non-agricultural primary products and high-technology products increased significantly, whereas shares of low-medium-technology products and medium-high-technology products declined. Second, from 2000 to 2006, the overall technology level of China's imports declined, but then increased from 2007 to 2012. Therefore, the Chinese Government should increase the share of high-technology and extra-high-technology products in total imports to stimulate structural transformation in manufacturing industries to make full use of foreign advanced technology and to prevent stepping into a low-end import commodity structure.","[Wei, Hao; Zhao, Chunming] Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China",Beijing Normal University,"Zhao, CM (通讯作者)，Beijing Normal Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Beijing 100875, Peoples R China.",weihao9989@163.com; cmzhao@bnu.edu.cn,,,National Social Science Foundation [14ZDA082]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71473020]; Social Science Foundation of Education Ministry of China [14YJA790058]; Beijing Social Science Foundation [15JGA005],National Social Science Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Social Science Foundation of Education Ministry of China; Beijing Social Science Foundation,"Hao Wei, Professor, School of Economics and Business Administration, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

The model has incorporated not only the uncertainties of oil price and investment cost but also the uncertainties of exchange rate and investment environment. These unique features have enabled our model to be best equipped to evaluate the value of oil overseas investment projects of three oil field sizes (large, medium, small) and under different resource tax systems (royalty tax and production sharing contracts). In our empirical setting, we have selected China as an investor country and Indonesia as an investee country as a case study. Our results show that, although production sharing contract (PSC) is convertible to that of resource royalty system, given the flexibility in PSC, it can to great extent increase the bargaining power of investee country. As there is an important tradeoff between oil resource investee country and overseas oil investor, in medium and small sized oil investment negotiation the oil company should try to increase the cost oil limit in production sharing contract and avoid the term of a windfall profits tax to reduce the investment risk of overseas oil fields.

We examine the role played by two factors related to traditional Chinese culture and ethics: whether (i) guanxi, relational closeness between the actors and (ii) the ability of the actors to observe each other's identity after the repayment decision (identifiability or mianzi concerns) affect the borrowers' decisions to make the promised repayments and ultimately the consequent aggregate realized social benefits. Using a two-by-two factorial design, we conduct four experimental treatments in China and also perform the identifiability treatment in New Zealand as a cultural control. We find that in China both manipulations were positively and significantly related to the probability of a repayment promise being kept. Moreover, these two factors were substitutes for each other. In New Zealand, there was no significant identifiability effect on promise keeping.

As part of this, existing restrictions on foreign ownership structure and mandatory export and technology transfer requirements imposed on foreign firms have been lifted in a number of industries. Against this background we identify the causal effects of foreign acquisitions on export market entry and technology take-off and evaluate whether the level of foreign ownership plays a role in stimulating these changes. Using doubly robust propensity score reweighted bivariate probit regressions to control for the selection bias associated with firm level foreign acquisition incidences, we uncover strong but heterogeneous positive effects on export activity for all types of foreign ownership structure.

We mainly consider fiscal impulses identified by (a) changes in the structural primary balance, complemented by evidence from (b) the IMF narrative shocks developed by Devries et al. (2011) and (c) a VAR-based measure of unanticipated policy announcements. Aggregate fiscal multipliers are estimated in the region of 0.5, although we find considerable variation depending on the fiscal mix, the degree of openness and the state of the economy. During episodes of recession, tax hikes become significantly more costly in terms of output than expenditure cuts. This appears to be related to increases in the share of hand-to-mouth consumers, proxied by the unemployment rate. Fiscal effects are generally more muted in open economies and during periods of positive growth. Country-specific features in Greece lead to significantly higher estimates, possibly in excess of unity in 2011, reflecting predominantly sizeable revenue effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I further exploit the coincidence of individual MPs' ability to sign legally binding share contracts with novel share offerings by overseas companies to measure the effect of overseas share investment on their political attitudes. I show that overseas shareholding pushed moderates lacking prior mercantile interests to support reform. I interpret the effect of financial assetholding as allowing new investors to exploit emerging economic opportunities overseas, aligning their interests with traders.

The objective is to compare the effects of subsidizing permanent job creation with that of reducing the severance cost gap between permanent contracts (PCs) and temporary contracts (TCs) as a strategy to reduce labour market duality between PCs and TCs. The 2006 and 2012 Spanish labour market reforms are used as a benchmark. The results point to fact that subsidizing permanent job creation may not be the best option from a fiscal point of view to reduce labour market segmentation between PCs and TCs. In particular, the results of introducing the subsidized entrepreneurs' permanent contract (EPC) in the 2012 labour market reform may have involved substantial deadweight effects. In fact, the reduction of the severance cost gap to a number close to 15 days of wages per year of service (p.y.o.s.) may generate the same effects, provided dismissals for objective reasons are effectively made easier to justify and firms make use of that option instead of agreeing to an indemnity closer to the amount paid for unfair dismissals. Finally, the model also shows the relevance of designing appropriate penalties for those firms that do not comply with the obligations that subsidies involve.","Univ Pablo de Olavide, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Osuna, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Ctra Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",vosupad@upo.es,"Osuna, Victoria/D-2512-2014",,,,,,18,0,0,0,5,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,JUL 7,2015,9.0,,,,,,,,201517,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-17,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CM3JV,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000357579100001,0

In particular, it produces (i) a drop in industrial production, consumer sentiment, equity prices, long-term rates and consumer credit; (ii) a rise in the unemployment rate. These effects are nearly identical to those generated by a shock to a standard policy-related uncertainty indicator.

The recent experience of the Agency for Strategic Initiatives (ASI) in Russia provides a valuable example of establishing a new government agency to advance economic deregulation in an environment where the political appetite for reform is limited. In our view, ASI has been the most successful institutional innovation to emerge in Russia since the 2008-09 financial crisis. Rather than engage in the traditional tussle over budget funds and benefits, ASI's mandate has been to organise a strategic dialogue with the private sector and build consensus within the government. We consider ASI's institutional set-up in light of the good practice principles adopted under Russia's new industrial policy'. Our findings suggest other middle-income economies may find ASI's experience applicable when designing institutions to support a deregulation reform agenda. While the crisis in Ukraine has triggered a fundamental shift in Russia's development path that is likely to make ASI's deregulation efforts largely irrelevant, the agency's practical experience remains pertinent to the broader discussion of institutional arrangements to promote deregulation.","[Freinkman, Lev; Yakovlev, Andrei] Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ NRU HSE, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Yakovlev, A (通讯作者)，Natl Res Univ Higher Sch Econ NRU HSE, Moscow, Russia.",ayakovlev@hse.ru,"Yakovlev, Andrei/H-8166-2013; Yakovlev, Andrei/JXL-6362-2024; Freinkman, Lev/J-8285-2019","Yakovlev, Andrei/0000-0003-2273-0971; Yakovlev, Andrei/0000-0003-2273-0971; Freinkman, Lev/0000-0001-8225-6058",HSE Programme of Fundamental Research,HSE Programme of Fundamental Research,"This article was prepared as part of a research project supported by the HSE 2014 Programme of Fundamental Research.

We study the implications of this for trust and trustworthiness in an evolutionary model where social preferences are endogenous. Trustworthy individuals are more optimistic than opportunists and are accordingly less afraid to engage in market-based exchanges, where they may be vulnerable to cheating. Depending on the distribution of social preferences in the population, the material benefits from greater participation may compensate for the costs of being trustworthy. By providing an explicit account of how individuals form and revise their beliefs, we are able to show the existence of a polymorphic equilibrium where both trustworthiness and opportunism coexist in the population. We also analyze the effect of enforcement, distinguishing between its role as deterrence of future misbehavior and as retribution for past misbehavior. We show that enforcement aimed at deterring opportunistic behavior has ambiguous effects on social preferences. It may favor the spreading of trustworthiness (crowding in), but the opposite (crowding out) may also occur. By contrast, crowding out never occur when punishment is merely intended as retribution.

The model suggests that the strength of the entrepreneur's incentive to shirk is countercyclical and that endogenous shirking adds volatility to the economy by increasing the persistence and volatility of TFP. This increase in persistence and volatility is driven by the variation in the number of successfully completed projects, compounded by the effect of the incentive to shirk on access to credit; changes in factor employment play only a minor role.","[Atolia, Manoj; Marquis, Milton] Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA; [Einarsson, Tor] Univ Iceland, IS-101 Reykjavik, Iceland",State University System of Florida; Florida State University; University of Iceland,"Atolia, M (通讯作者)，Florida State Univ, Tallahassee, FL 32306 USA.",,"Atolia, Manoj/AAJ-7691-2020",,,,,,18,0,0,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0013-0427,1468-0335,,ECONOMICA,Economica,JUL,2015,82.0,327,,,,,486,507,,10.1111/ecca.12122,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CK6YD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356374000004,0

In many of the models, a group of people in a social network, each holding a numerical opinion, arrive at a shared opinion through repeated averaging with their neighbors in the network. Motivated by the observation that in reality consensus is rarely reached, we study a related sociological model in which individuals' intrinsic beliefs counterbalance the averaging process and yield a diversity of opinions. We interpret the repeated averaging process as best-response dynamics in an underlying game with natural payoffs and its limit as an equilibrium. This allows us to study the cost of disagreement by comparing between the cost at equilibrium and the social optimum. We also consider a natural network design problem in this setting: which links can we add to the underlying network to reduce the cost at equilibrium? (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Reduced oil import dependence may initially reduce a country's general trade deficit under certain conditions. The analysis probes the nature of this relationship and whether it holds equally to oil-importing and oil-exporting countries, after controlling for other exogenous drivers. We find that net oil exports are a significant factor in explaining current account surpluses but that net oil imports often do not influence current account deficits. Among all oil importers the one exception applies to relatively rich countries, where higher oil imports appear to contribute to greater current account deficits. One explanation for these trends is that oil exporters and wealthier oil importers may view oil income gains and losses as temporary income sources that influence their savings patterns.

Using this new concept, the present study further develops the theoretical and empirical research on Russia's global trade network as generated by value-added chains. Based on the global and local equilibrium conditions of a global input-output model, we prove the fundamental theorem on the relationship between gross trade balances in value-added and gross terms, namely that the sum total of a country's trade balances with other countries in value-added equals that in gross terms. In other words, the sum total of the differentials between a country's trade balances with other countries in both value-added and gross terms equals zero. Within this general identity condition, a bilateral value-added trade balance can be less than or greater than its corresponding gross trade balance, depending on intercountry sector-technical relations and sectoral value-added ratios. We also show the equivalence theorem between TiVA and the factor (value-added) content of trade proposed by Trefler. We employ a modified version of aggregated World Input-Output Data (WIOD) with eight countries/regions (BRIC, EU, United States, Japan, and the rest of the world [ROW]) and twenty sectors for 2005 and 2010. Modifications are performed to correct an underestimation of Russian oil and gas trade flows and the value-added ratios in the original data, which is essential to rightly understand Russia's value chains with the EU and other countries.","[Kuboniwa, Masaaki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Tokyo, Japan; [Kuboniwa, Masaaki] IPC, Palmerston North, New Zealand",Hitotsubashi University,"Kuboniwa, M (通讯作者)，2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 186863, Japan.",kuboniwa@ier.hit-u.ac.jp,,,IDE-JETRO; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Overseas Cooperation Foundation Grant; [24330085]; [15H01959]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01959] Funding Source: KAKEN,"IDE-JETRO; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Overseas Cooperation Foundation Grant; ; ; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This study was supported by the IDE-JETRO, the JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B), number 24330085 and (A), number 15H01959, and the Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Overseas Cooperation Foundation Grant.

Every good, capital asset, and knowledge is mobile and induces more competition. Innovation in commodities is a complex process that requires more cooperation. To innovate in the knowledge economy, firms nowadays must establish win-win situations for individuals in creating networks. These networks are useful for firms in order to come up with innovative strategies. The building of networks enables the interactions between agents, the environment, and institutions. The interdependence of agents and institutions is not new to evolutionary theory (Commons 1931; Veblen 1898). However, I argue that institutions must be more flexible than ever before in order to help agents adapt to the modern knowledge economy. On the basis of the role of meso-networks, I propose new long-run specialization and short-run competitiveness that will promote greater efficiency and equality around the world in relation to firms and countries exporting industrial goods into world markets. Within the innovative networks, I analyze the role of two different actors: (i) the economic leader who has a long-run strategy and (ii) the go-between leader who knows how to diffuse useful information to actors to help them innovate in new products, services, or processes.","[Baulant, Camille] Univ Angers, Int Econ, Angers, France; [Baulant, Camille] GRANEM Lab, Master Degree Business Intelligence & Competit St, Angers, France",Universite d'Angers; Universite d'Angers,"Baulant, C (通讯作者)，Univ Angers, Int Econ, Angers, France.",,,,,,,,35,4,5,1,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

As a consequence, (i) large (and distortionary) government debt accumulation occurs, and (ii) banning illiquid assets could improve individuals' welfare.

It cannot, however, be analysed as an isolated event separate from the series of crises that has characterized the capitalist system. Indeed, even though the current crisis shows some specific characteristics, its main causes are similar to those that triggered previous crises. In this study, we argue that we are experiencing a generalized economic crisis, as opposed to a financial crisis whose impact is felt on the real side via the traditional Keynesian transmission mechanism. As such, we identify the development of a number of both real and financial factors, whose combination should be recognized by any astute observer as a recipe for financial turmoil and recessions. In particular, we consider two parallel and ongoing practices that have transformed the entrepreneurial capitalist system and rendered it much more fragile and prone to crisis: (i) the financial deregulations-cum-innovations since the late 1970s have fundamentally changed the basic role of banks and financial institutions and created the possibility for financiers to (artificially) increase their wealth independently of the real production sector thus resulting in financial bubbles; and (ii) at the same time, prolonged austerity measures in most advanced capitalist economies have kept the productive capacity of these economies below full employment and therefore directly contributed to engineering recessions. We conclude that there is a need to rethink not only the type of economic policies in place but also the economic model.","[Bougrine, Hassan; Rochon, Louis-Philippe] Laurentian Univ, Greater Sudbury, ON, Canada",Laurentian University,"Bougrine, H (通讯作者)，Laurentian Univ, Greater Sudbury, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,32,1,1,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

In particular, we examine pricing below marginal cost by the public firm, the optimal degree of privatization, and the relationship between privatization and foreign ownership restrictions. When market structure is exogenous, partial privatization of the public firm improves welfare by reducing public sector losses. Surprisingly, even at the optimal level of privatization, the public firm's price lies strictly below marginal cost, resulting in losses. Our analysis also reveals a potential conflict between privatization and investment liberalization (i.e., relaxing restrictions on foreign ownership) in the short run. With endogenous market structure (i.e., free entry of foreign firms), partial privatization improves welfare through an additional channel: more foreign varieties. Furthermore, at the optimal level of privatization, the public firm's price lies strictly above marginal cost and earns positive profits.","[Ghosh, Arghya] Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Mitra, Manipushpak] Indian Stat Inst, ERU, Kolkata 700108, India; [Saha, Bibhas] Univ E Anglia, Sch Econ, Norwich NR4 7TJ, Norfolk, England",University of New South Wales Sydney; Indian Statistical Institute; Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata; University of East Anglia,"Ghosh, A (通讯作者)，Univ New S Wales, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",a.ghosh@unsw.edu.au; mmitra@isical.ac.in; b.saha@uea.ac.uk,"Mitra, Manipushpak/AAE-2993-2020","Ghosh, Arghya/0000-0002-6655-5434; Mitra, Manipushpak/0000-0003-2081-6173",Australian Research Council (ARC),Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council),"Ghosh and Mitra are thankful to University of New South Wales (UNSW) and Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), respectively, for hospitality and support during numerous visits.

Japan's ULC are relatively stable or declining in most industries, while Korea's ULC show an upward trend in many industries, with the electrical and optical equipment industry being a major exception. China's ULC are declining in most industries. Evaluating ULC on a foreign currencies basis, Japan's ULC increased rapidly during the period of yen appreciation, suggesting that Japan's cost reduction efforts were more than offset by the appreciation of the yen. The results of our empirical analysis suggest that both increases in ULC and appreciation of the home currency reduce exports by raising the home country's relative prices. The negative impact of ULC is largest for China, while it is negligible for Japan. However, the negative impact of nominal effective exchange rates is largest for Japan. Moreover, the negative impact of ULC tends to be larger for machinery-related industries, suggesting that cost competitiveness is particularly important in these industries.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Tama Ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan; [Shimizu, Junko] Gakushuin Univ, Fac Econ, Toshima Ku, Tokyo 1718588, Japan",Gakushuin University,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Sch Econ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",keiko-i@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517; SHIMIZU, JUNKO/0000-0002-6222-8540","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [24330101, 23243050]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23243050] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We thank Kiyotaka Sato, Robert Stehrer, Johannes Poschl, and other participants of the CESSA-wiiw Joint International Workshop for their helpful comments.

While some countries implemented various mixes of monetary and/or fiscal stimuli, others have seen austerity. Our paper explores whether the strategic interaction between the central bank and government can shed some light on this diversity, and what lessons about the institutional design of the two policies can be learnt from it. This is done by mapping a reduced-form New Keynesian model into a generalised game-theoretic framework with deterministic and stochastic revisions of policy actions. Our focus is on the short-term policy interaction regarding stabilisation of an adverse shock (rather than long-term issues related to fiscal sustainability and unpleasant monetarist arithmetic). Particular attention is paid to the effect of institutional and structural features such as inflation targeting, monetary and fiscal implementation lags, and the policies' leadership.","[Libich, Jan; Dat Thanh Nguyen] La Trobe Univ, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia",La Trobe University,"Libich, J (通讯作者)，La Trobe Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Melbourne, Vic 3086, Australia.",j.libich@latrobe.edu.au,"Libich, Jan/ABD-4410-2020; Nguyen, Dat Thanh/HZJ-3407-2023; Libich, Jan/JWO-5802-2024","Libich, Jan/0000-0002-2991-2228; Nguyen, Dat Thanh/0000-0002-6868-3253;","European Social Fund [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0296]; Czech Science Foundation [GA402/10/1046, GACR 13-20613S]; Neuron Foundation",European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)); Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Neuron Foundation,"We would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for valuable comments.

Discontinuities and changes in the design and implementation of wage subsidies under the Swedish New Start Jobs-policy allow us to study effects of both subsidy rate and subsidy duration. We find that wage subsidies have substantial effect on job-finding rates for those eligible. The effect is stronger for larger subsidies and more than doubles as the length of the subsidy doubles. Although employment drops as subsidies expire, the probability of being employed remains higher for workers finding subsidized employment also after the expiry of the employment subsidies.

The Spanish case is relevant as an example of front-loaded fiscal adjustment that has led to a large GDP fall, where (unlike the cases of Greece, Ireland and Portugal) the authorities were able to choose the composition of the adjustment measures. The empirical methodology is based on a computable general equilibrium model. All the simulated policies lead to a decrease in the levels of output and employment, and to a higher unemployment rate. The greatest contractionary effects appear in the case of an increase in the income tax, followed by spending cuts, especially in public education; in contrast, the contractionary effect is weaker for indirect tax increases. While income distribution for labour worsens with spending cuts, it slightly improves with tax increases.","[Bajo-Rubio, Oscar] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain; [Gomez-Plana, Antonio G.] Univ Publ Navarra, Dept Econ, Pamplona 31006, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad Publica de Navarra,"Bajo-Rubio, O (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Derecho & Ciencias Sociales, Dept Econ, E-13071 Ciudad Real, Spain.",oscar.bajo@uclm.es; agomezgp@unavarra.es,"Bajo-Rubio, Oscar/K-3811-2014; Gomez Gomez-Plana, Antonio/K-3039-2017; Gomez Gomez-Plana, Antonio/JBR-9987-2023","Bajo-Rubio, Oscar/0000-0003-2728-312X; Gomez Gomez-Plana, Antonio/0000-0003-3241-4358;","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-29314-C02-02, ECO2011-24304]",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government),"Oscar Bajo-Rubio (corresponding author): Department of Economics, Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha, Facultad de Derecho y Ciencias Sociales, 13071 Ciudad Real (Spain); email oscar.bajo@uclm.es.

Compared to nonreferred applicants, referred applicants are more likely to be hired and more likely to accept offers, even though referrals and nonreferrals have similar skill characteristics. Referred workers tend to have similar productivity compared to nonreferred workers on most measures, but referred workers have lower accident rates in trucking and produce more patents in high-tech. Referred workers are substantially less likely to quit and earn slightly higher wages than nonreferred workers. In call centers and trucking, the two industries for which we can calculate worker-level profits, referred workers yield substantially higher profits per worker than nonreferred workers. These profit differences are driven by lower turnover and lower recruiting costs for referrals.","[Burks, Stephen V.] Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA; Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Morris; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Toronto,"Burks, SV (通讯作者)，Univ Minnesota, Morris, MN 56267 USA.",,"Burks, Stephen/IRZ-4493-2023; Cowgill, Bo/Q-2760-2015; Cowgill, Bo/ABE-4537-2020","Cowgill, Bo/0000-0002-2525-2306; Burks, Stephen/0000-0003-4524-2954",Kauffman Foundation; National Science Foundation; MacArthur Foundation; Sloan Foundation; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada; Trucking Industry Program at Georgia Tech; University of Minnesota Morris,Kauffman Foundation; National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); MacArthur Foundation; Sloan Foundation(Alfred P.

This is not only important in order to understand how the possibility of insurance augments mitigation and saving decisions, but it also improves our understanding of how insurance should be provided. Since there are no studies as of now that rely on such an integrated approach, we extend the literature along two lines. Firstly, we develop a neoclassical growth framework with endogenous extreme events and an insurance sector. Secondly, we introduce a simulation method that allows us to explicitly take these extreme events into account and which yields additional numerical insights. In doing so we can fully characterize and quantify the impact of different insurance policies for mitigation and economic growth decisions. Our analytical results and computational experiments show that (i) transparency of the insurance sector is the decisive requisite for abatement activities, implying substantial policy opportunities; (ii) a decentralized economy will under-invest in abatement without adequate policy interventions; (iii) precautionary beliefs on the frequency of extreme events lead to more sustainability; (iv) a social security system which prices insurance fairly is preferable to an insurance industry which provides insurance with an overhead.

While first-movers in matching pennies choose an action at random, senders in the sender-receiver game tell the truth more often than they lie. Since second-order beliefs are uncorrelated with actions in both games, excessive truth-telling is unlikely to be driven by guilt aversion or preferences for truth-telling that are based on second-order beliefs; preferences for truth-telling per-se, on the other hand, cannot be rejected.

Arts goods in particular share characteristics with credence, inspection, and experience goods. Accordingly, art collectors rely on the experience and the reputation of art galleries when investing in artwork. Some qualitative sociological studies have found that only a few very successful galleries represent the bulk of the most visible and most successful artists (e.g., Crane in The transformation of the avant-garde: the New York art world, 1940-1985. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1989; Currid in The Warhol economy: How fashion, art and music drive New York City. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2007). This paper investigates the success of art galleries in a dynamic model, which elaborates different statistical processes that allow us to analyze the development of different types of success distributions in the market for art galleries. Instead of applying standard economic analysis only, we employ methods from statistical physics to construct a model of gallery investment and competition. Our model entails information, competition, and innovation effects. Subsequently, art market data are used to test which version of the model fits best. We find that the lognormal distribution provides the best fit and conclude that the data generating process is compatible with the version of the model, which entails an inhomogeneous geometric Brownian motion. Hence, the success of art galleries depends strongly on information and innovation effects, but is hardly affected by competition effects. We argue that the superstar effect in the case of art galleries can be understood as an appropriation of search and entrance costs, which emerge whenever consumption requires special knowledge and social inclusion.","[Prinz, Aloys] Univ Munster, Inst Publ Econ, D-48143 Munster, Germany; [Piening, Jan; Ehrmann, Thomas] Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, D-48149 Munster, Germany",University of Munster; University of Munster,"Piening, J (通讯作者)，Univ Munster, Inst Strateg Management, Leonardo Campus 18, D-48149 Munster, Germany.",piening@ism.uni-muenster.de,,,,,,,72,13,16,2,55,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

In this paper we investigate the economic implications of water policy imposing source- and region-specific restrictions on water withdrawals taking the Mexican economy as a case study. We use an inter-regional input-output model of Mexico's hydro-economic regions to allocate production subject to the availability of water and other factors of production. Water sustainability requires a reduction of 7.5 km(3)/yr of groundwater withdrawals, which is compensated by an increase of 3.4 km(3)/yr of surface water, an expansion onto an additional 1.4 million hectares of rainfed land, and modifications in subnational patterns of food trade. This framework for evaluating scenarios describing sustainability-oriented water policies is readily applicable to other regions.","[Lopez-Morales, Carlos A.] Inst Tecnol Estudios Super Monterrey, Inst Global Sostenibilidad, Tlalpan, Mexico; [Duchin, Faye] Rensselaer Polytech Inst, Dept Econ, Troy, NY USA",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,"López-Morales, CA (通讯作者)，Inst Tecnol Estudios Super Monterrey, Inst Global Sostenibilidad, Tlalpan, Mexico.",caustica@gmail.com,"López-Morales, Carlos A/AAM-6293-2020","Lopez Morales, Carlos Andres/0000-0001-9296-7136",Mexico's Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia; U.S. National Science Foundation under EaSM [1049181]; U.S. National Science Foundation under CNH [1115025]; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology [1115025] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences [1049181] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,Mexico's Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia(Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologia (CONACyT)); U.S. National Science Foundation under EaSM; U.S. National Science Foundation under CNH; Direct For Biological Sciences; Division Of Environmental Biology(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Emerging Frontiers; Direct For Biological Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)),Carlos A.

We find that the regulations exert short-run effects on pharmaceutical price indexes, reducing them by less than 0.5 percentage points. The effects can be slightly reinforced if the price regulations were to be applied to more medicines. The price regulations fail to reduce household health expenditures and the average profitability of the pharmaceutical industry. Moreover, firms on the break-even point are worse off after the implementation. Finally, although these regulations have no significant effects on the prices of medicinal substitutes or complements, they increase the importation of expensive medicines. These findings are also consistent with consumer perceptions of the pharmaceutical policies, based on the household survey data conducted in 2008.","[Wu, Binzhen; Qiao, Xue] Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qiong] Cent Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Central University of Finance & Economics,"Qiao, X (通讯作者)，Tsinghua Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.",qiaoxue@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn,"Wu, Binzhen/JQI-5598-2023","Qiao, Xue/0000-0002-4070-9095","Kobayashi Solid Research Fund of China's Economy at Tsinghua University; National Science Foundation of China [70903042, 71373136, 70903043, 71473141]; Natural Social Science Foundation of China [10zd007]; Ministry of Education research fund [12YJC90269]",Kobayashi Solid Research Fund of China's Economy at Tsinghua University; National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Social Science Foundation of China; Ministry of Education research fund,"This work was supported by Kobayashi Solid Research Fund of China's Economy at Tsinghua University and the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 70903042], [grant number 71373136]; the Natural Social Science Foundation of China research fund [grant number 10zd & 007]; the Ministry of Education research fund [grant number 12YJC90269]; the National Science Foundation of China [grant number 70903043], [grant number 71473141].",,26,12,14,3,55,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

Using Spanish administrative data for the period 2000-2011, we estimate multi-spell duration models that disentangle unobserved heterogeneity from true duration dependence. Our findings suggest that immigrants are more sensitive to changes in economic conditions both in terms of unemployment and employment hazards. The effect of the business cycle is not constant but decreases with duration at a higher rate among immigrants. We provide evidence that the higher job separation rates and lower capital-labor complementarity of immigrants are mechanisms that are possibly compatible with these results. We also find evidence of a disincentive effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration, which is stronger for immigrants, but only at the beginning of the unemployment spell, especially under good economic conditions. Finally, unemployment benefits increase job match quality only for native workers with temporary contracts.

While the model provided largely nests other contributions in the literature, here the focus is on including direct payments from consumers to content providers. With this additional price it is demonstrated that the type of net neutrality regulation (i.e., weak versus strong net neutrality) matters for such regulations to have real effects. In addition, we provide support for the notion that strong net neutrality may stimulate content provider investment while the model concludes that there is unlikely to be any negative impact from such regulation on ISP investment. Counter to many claims, it is argued here that ISP competition may not be a substitute for net neutrality regulation in bringing about these effects.","[Gans, Joshua S.] Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Gans, Joshua S.] NBER, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Gans, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Rotman Sch Management, Toronto, ON, Canada.",joshua.gans@gmail.com,,,,,,,17,33,37,0,41,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

I develop a global VAR model in which all euro area economies are included individually while, at the same time, their common monetary policy is modelled as a function of euro area aggregate output growth and inflation. The results suggest that the transmission of monetary policy across euro area economies displays asymmetries, and that, in line with economic theory, these are driven by differences in economies' structural characteristics. In particular, euro area economies in which a higher share of aggregate output is accounted for by sectors servicing interest rate sensitive demand exhibit a stronger transmission of monetary policy to real activity. Similarly, even though the evidence is less conclusive, euro area economies which feature more real wage and/or fewer unemployment rigidities also appear to display a stronger transmission of monetary policy to real activity.

With such additional constraints, the optimal contract is static and, unlike with only ex ante participation constraints, does not elicit the agent's information sequentially. This holds whenever differences in ex ante and ex post outside options are below a positive upper bound. Welfare effects of mandatory withdrawal rights are ambiguous.

We determine that during the entire period, earnings inequality was substantially higher in the informal sector. Informality increases earnings polarization, widening both tails of the earnings distribution. Nonetheless, inequality has declined in both formal and informal sectors. In the formal sector, changes in the distribution of monthly earnings between 2000 and 2010 were primarily generated by changes in the distribution of hourly earnings. In the informal sector, reduction of variation in monthly earnings went through two channels: declining differences in hourly rates and considerable compositional shifts within the informal sector. The results point to the importance of distributional analysis of earnings gaps and explicit accounting for the sector choice.","Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Labor Market Studies, Moscow, Russia",HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics),"Lukiyanova, A (通讯作者)，Higher Sch Econ, Ctr Labor Market Studies, Moscow, Russia.",alukyanova@hse.ru,"Lukyanova, Anna/AAS-9103-2021; Lukiyanova, Anna/J-9596-2015","Lukiyanova, Anna/0000-0003-0917-7438",,,,,42,12,14,1,20,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0967-0750,1468-0351,,ECON TRANSIT,Econ.

In these cases, anchors result from publicly observable and aggregated decisions of other market participants. However, experimental studies have neglected this social dimension by focusing on neutral, experimenter-provided anchors in purely individualistic settings. We present a novel experimental design with a socially derived anchor, monetary incentives for unbiased decisions and feedback on performance to more accurately implement market conditions. Despite these factors, we find robust effects for the socially derived anchor, an increased bias for higher cognitive load, and only weak learning effects. A comparison to a neutral anchor shows that the social context increases biased behavior. Further, we find that this increase is not driven by differences in perceived relevance of anchor values. Our results support the assumption that anchoring remains a valid explanation for systematically biased decisions within market contexts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Theoretically, these three financial intermediaries should demonstrate differences in various business attributes. However, we observe fewer than expected differences between conventional and Islamic banks. We report that Islamic banks have superior asset quality and financial stability than conventional banks. However, certain similarities are present in their respective business models. On the contrary, NBFIs demonstrate differences in business dynamics, with high fee based income and non-deposit funding, as compared to conventional banks. Due to higher business risk and variance in profitability, we find that NBFIs are financially more fragile, irrespective of their stronger capitalization, as compared to commercial banks.

We employ a system of simultaneous equations and dynamic panel estimators to control for endogeneity of visits to NPs. Results indicate that patients who visited an NP are significantly less likely to visit PCPs and to receive prescribed medication, medical check-up, and diagnosis from PCPs. Findings were robust to other specification and passed a falsification test.

However, recognising that a central bank's audience is heterogeneous is advantageous for both modelling purposes and effective central bank communication. This paper focuses on the general public, for whom gathering and processing information are costly. The general public makes rational decisions that limit the time and resources they allocate to the task. As a result, aggregate inflation expectations of the public can be described as 'sticky' in that the spread of information about inflation through the economy is not instantaneous. Following Carroll (2003, 2006), epidemiological models are adopted to model the inflation expectations of the general public in South Africa and to estimate the speed at which they update their inflation expectations (information stickiness). Agent based models are then used to verify these estimates of information stickiness. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper argues that these are short-run elasticities. Long-run elasticities, which may differ from short-run elasticities, are policy relevant. This paper develops a dynamic industry equilibrium model of labor demand. The model makes two points. First, long-run regressions have been misinterpreted because even if the short- and long-run employment elasticities differ, standard methods would not detect a difference using US variation. Second, the model offers a reconciliation of the small estimated short-run employment effects with the commonly found pass-through of minimum wage increases to product prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

(1986), this study considers a model of tax compliance in which the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) services as well as audits taxpayers as in the real world. Taxpayers are uncertain about whether their incomes are eligible for deduction/exemption, and may seek advice from the taxpayer service provided by the IRS to mitigate the uncertainty. We show: (1) while the society's preferred quality of taxpayer service is likely to be sufficiently high, the IRS's preferred quality of taxpayer service is only at an intermediate level; and (2) the conflict between the society and the IRS tends to be intensified as the cost of tax audits becomes lower. Evidence in support of our results is addressed. We also extend our model to addressing the issue of corruption in tax administration and to considering a dynamic model.

We focus on China's household registration (hukou) system, which favors urban residents and discriminates against rural residents in resource allocation. Our results show that making individuals' hukou identity salient significantly reduces the performance of rural migrant students, relative to their local urban counterparts, on an incentivized cognitive task, and consequently significantly lowers their relative ranking in the earnings distribution under the piece rate regime. However, the impact of hukou identity salience is insignificant in the tournament regime, suggesting that its negative effect on migrant students' performance may be mitigated when competition is introduced. The results demonstrate the impact of institutionally imposed social identity on individuals' economic performance, and potentially on inequality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We first ask: do voters benefit from attracting a pool of challengers with more moderate ideologies? When voters and politicians are patient, moderating the ideology distribution of centrist and moderate politicians (those close to the median voter) reduces voter welfare by reducing an extreme incumbent's incentives to compromise. We then ask: do voters benefit from informative signals about a challenger's true ideology? We prove that giving voters informative, but sufficiently noisy, signals always harm voters, because they make it harder for incumbents to secure re-election. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Instrumental variable methods are required to deal with endogeneity of the tax rate and taxable income in a non-linear tax structure. However, in the New Zealand context, the standard' regression instrument is found to be unable to accommodate the substantial observed exogenous (non-tax-induced) changes in taxable income. Two new tax rate instruments are proposed, which use information on taxable income dynamics, for a panel of taxpayers over a period that involves no tax changes, to derive taxpayers' counterfactual post-reform incomes and tax rates expected in the absence of reform. The two instruments respectively measure, for each taxpayer, the tax rate associated with expected mean income, and the expected tax rate associated with the individual's expected conditional distribution of income. Applying these instruments to the 2001 New Zealand tax changes yields plausible estimates of the elasticity of taxable income around 0.5-0.7. Elasticities are found to be substantially higher for taxpayers with non-wage-and-salary income compared with wage and salary only taxpayers. Results also confirm that non-wage-and-salary income was especially responsive to the tax changes.","[Carey, Simon; Creedy, John] NZ Treasury, Wellington, New Zealand; [Carey, Simon; Creedy, John] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Gemmell, Norman] Victoria Univ Wellington, Victoria Business Sch, Wellington, New Zealand; [Teng, Josh] Inland Revenue, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington; Victoria University Wellington,"Gemmell, N (通讯作者)，Victoria Business Sch, POB 600, Wellington 6140, New Zealand.",norman.gemmell@vuw.ac.n,,,Royal Society of New Zealand from Cross Departmental Research Pool from Government,Royal Society of New Zealand from Cross Departmental Research Pool from Government(Royal Society of New Zealand),"We are grateful to the Royal Society of New Zealand for funding support from the Cross Departmental Research Pool from Government.

The growth rate of the endowment is a first-order Gaussian autoregression, while the stochastic volatility innovations can be drawn from any distribution for which the moment-generating function exists. The solution is useful in allowing comparisons among numerical methods used to approximate the nontrivial closed form. The closed-form solution reveals that, when using perturbation methods around the deterministic steady state, the approximate solution needs to be sixth-order accurate in order for the parameter capturing the conditional standard deviation of the stochastic volatility process to be present.

Heterogeneity and information in public good provision,EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public goods; Group composition; Cooperation; Social preference types; Heterogeneity,COOPERATION; PREFERENCES; RECIPROCITY,"Previous research demonstrates that individuals vary in their social preferences. Less well-understood is how group composition affects the behavior of different social preference types. Does one bad apple really spoil the bunch? This paper exogenously identifies experimental participants' social preferences, then systematically assigns individuals to homogeneous or heterogeneous groups to examine the impact of 'bad apples' on cooperation and efficiency. Consistent with previous research, we find that groups with more selfish types achieve lower levels of efficiency. We identify two mechanisms for the effect. First, the selfish players contribute less. Second, selfish players induce lower contributions from the conditional cooperators, and this effect increases in the number of selfish players. These results are not sensitive to information about the distribution of types in the group.","[de Oliveira, Angela C.

A Bayesian MCMC method is proposed to deal with a switching Taylor rule robust to zero lower bound and heteroscedasticity. The posterior results from Markov-switching Taylor rule indicate that, first, there is strong evidence for an active regime in which the Fed responses to output gap aggressively. Second, the movements in the posterior probability of the active regime is highly correlated with credit spreads. I then use a switching Taylor rule with transition probabilities connected to credit spreads to show that the positive correlation is strongly supported by data, implying that the Fed responses to output gap more strongly when the credit spreads rise.

We construct a new environmental production possibility set by combining the super-efficiency and sequential data envelopment analysis (DEA) models to avoid discriminating power problem and technical regress when evaluating efficiency by DDF. Then, it is used in a meta-frontier framework to reflect the technology heterogeneities across east, central and west China. The results indicate that eastern China achieved the highest progress inefficiency relative to the metafrontier, followed by western and the central China. By focusing on technology gaps, we offer some suggestions for the different groups based on group-frontier and meta-frontier analyses. The inefficiency can be attributed to managerial failure for eastern and western China, and technological differences for central China. The convergence analysis shows that energy and CO2 emission governance will produce negative effects on economic growth, and it is suitable and acceptable to introduce rigorous environmental measures in eastern China.

Based on a qualitative approach, we find that the drivers of the first institutional change in Brazil's electricity sector were related to market protection and domestic industrial support. For the second institutional change, economic recession (country at state of bankruptcy, debt crisis, and high inflation rates) and reliability of utility services were the driving factors.

One might anticipate that by inducing specialization, trade limits the potential for convergence in energy productivity. Conversely, by inducing competition and knowledge diffusion, trade may spur sectors to greater energy productivity. Unlike most previous work on convergence, we explain productivity dynamics from cross-country interactions at a detailed sector level and apply a spatial panel data approach to explicitly account for trade-flow related spatial effects in the convergence analysis. Our study confirms the existence of convergence in manufacturing energy productivity, caused by efficiency improvements in lagging countries, while undermined by increasing international differences in sector structure. Further, we find that trade flows explain 30 to 40% of the unobserved variation in energy productivity. Trade continues to explain the unobserved variation in energy productivity even after accounting for geographic proximity. Last, we find that those countries and sectors with higher dependence on trade both have higher energy productivity growth and a higher rate of convergence, further implying that trade can enhance energy productivity. Thus, unlike concerns that trade may spur a 'race to the bottom', we find that promoting trade may help stimulate energy efficiency improvements across countries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Assuming a price sensitive demand function with a random intercept, we provide comparative statics and economic interpretations for three models of demand (arithmetic Brownian, geometric Brownian, and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross). Committed capacity, that is, the installed capacity plus the investment in the pipeline, must never drop below the best predictor of future demand, minus two biases. The discounting bias takes into account the fact that investment is paid upfront for future use; the precautionary bias multiplies a type of risk aversion index by the local volatility. Relying on the analytical forms, we discuss in detail the economic effects. For example, the impact of volatility on the optimal investment is negligible in some cases.

Our approach exploits the timing of the National Congress of the Communist Party, which is a 5-yearly meeting where national economic policies are debated. Because economic growth is a key policy objective and given that the Chinese fiscal system is highly decentralized, the recurring National Congress may encourage a systematic pattern of spending by provincial governments to foster growth. We find that per capita GDP growth is associated with the timing of the National Congress, and exploiting instrumental variables that convey this timing information, we also find that growth has a statistically significant effect on the urbanization rate.

The pollution haven hypothesis (PER) predicts the spatial distribution of industries to be dependent on the differences in regulations with 'dirtier' firms locating to countries with less stringent regulations. However, the post NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) experience seems to fly in the face of the hypothesis. Given a likely free trade agreement between China and Korea in the near future, it is important to understand the likely implication of such an agreement. Should we expect outcomes in line with the hypothesis or more in line with the NAFTA experience? We propose a model which bridges the gap between previous models and empirical findings by explaining the spatial distribution of firms based on the directly observable and tangible factors such as trade costs, regulation compliance costs and potential market size rather than on the existence of transboundary pollution. The existence of a spatial equilibrium is highlighted as a key factor in identifying the PHH: This discerns the China-Korea case from the NAFTA experience.","[Hwang, Seok-joon] Kyungpook Natl Univ, Sch Econ & Trade, Taegu 702701, South Korea; [Pak, Myong-sop] Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKKU Business Sch, Seoul, South Korea",Kyungpook National University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Pak, MS (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, SKKU Business Sch, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul, South Korea.",sxh219@knu.ac.kr; mspak@skku.edu; sshin11@skku.edu,"Hwang, Seok-Joon/R-6225-2019",,National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2055150],National Research Foundation of Korea - Korean Government(National Research Foundation of KoreaKorean Government),This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2013S1A3A2055150).

We focus on the consequence of default on loans when the value of the collateral falls below the value of the debt it secures. We analyze the impulse response functions of the price and production of the durable good and show that there is an asymmetry between the response of the price and investment of the durable good to a positive and a negative income shock arising from default on the collateralized loans. We show that this asymmetry can be seen in the data on housing prices and construction and is attributable to the default on mortgages in periods of decreasing prices which acts as a turbo mechanism magnifying the decline in investment.

Convergence occurs until the developing country reaches a bottleneck, then convergence stops unless the institution is improved. After the reform, convergence resumes until a new bottleneck is encountered, which triggers another reform, and so on. Using recursive methods, I show analytically that, in a perfect international credit market, each reform occurs when the new growth bottleneck just becomes binding; the reform size changes monotonically over time; there are finite reforms and convergence is unceasing until the last constraint binds, so a permanent GDP gap may exist The model also implies that a politically more powerful government should adopt more gradual reforms. In an imperfect credit market, convergence can be delayed and an initially richer economy can be more likely to adopt insufficient reforms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

That is, conditional volatility and correlation of financial returns tend to rise more after negative return shocks than after positive ones of the same size. This paper extends the literature by investigating whether investors could gain significant economic benefits from incorporating the feature into mixed-asset portfolio diversifications. We carry out the investigation for a portfolio consisting of US stock, REITs, and the risk-free asset, and find that covariance asymmetry is indeed a value-added feature for mixed-asset diversifications. This conclusion is robust to different portfolio performance metrics and asset allocation periods. More importantly, we demonstrate that the value added by modeling covariance asymmetry is unlikely to be offset by transaction costs. This leads credence to the implementability of a portfolio strategy which embeds the feature of covariance asymmetry. Our findings have important implications for fund managers and their clientele.

Using data from the Lending Club, which is one of the popular online P2P lending houses, this article explores the P2P loan characteristics, evaluates their credit risk and measures loan performances. We find that credit grade, debt-to-income ratio, FICO score and revolving line utilization play an important role in loan defaults. Loans with lower credit grade and longer duration are associated with high mortality rate. The result is consistent with the Cox Proportional Hazard test which suggests that the hazard rate or the likelihood of the loan default increases with the credit risk of the borrowers. Finally, we find that higher interest rates charged on the high-risk borrowers are not enough to compensate for higher probability of the loan default.

This technique, which interprets explosiveness in the price series as evidence of the existence of a bubble, provides a method for identifying not only bubble behaviour but also a dating mechanism. Statistically significant bubble characteristics are identified in both series. For the Republic of Ireland, a prolonged period of explosiveness is detected ranging from 1996Q2 to 2007Q2.

A major goal of free trade is to develop trade between its signatories. The gravity model is used to analyze the bilateral trade data against the variables of the relative size of the pair of countries involved in trade, distance, common border and language and dummies for each of the FTAs. This article focuses on the studying of the influence of the FTAs in the Mediterranean countries in which we integrate the role of the regional dummy EU-15, Economic and Monetary Union (eurozone), the Arab Maghreb Union and AGADIR Agreement (FTA between Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco) in trade flows. In addition, this work aims to detect the impact of the global financial crisis on export flows between the FTAs in the Mediterranean region.

By considering reforms affecting specific areas of the financial sector, we find that the banking sector reforms and domestic finance reforms are more likely to occur when fiscal adjustments are put in place. Interestingly, while banking sector reforms are mainly prompted during periods of tax-driven consolidations, spending cuts driven consolidation packages seem to propel the implementation of domestic finance reforms. Finally, we show that higher inflation, lower degree of trade openness, a deterioration of financial conditions and, to some extent, a fall in the degree of competitiveness enhance the probability of financial reforms.","[Agnello, Luca] Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy; [Castro, Vitor] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3004512 Coimbra, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor; Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Castro, Vitor; Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ Minho, Econ Policies Res Unit NIPE, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Jalles, Joao Tovar] OECD, Econ Dept, F-75775 Paris 16, France; [Sousa, Ricardo M.] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, LSE Alumni Assoc, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of Palermo; Universidade de Coimbra; Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Minho; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Agnello, L (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, Dept Econ Business & Stat SEAS, I-90128 Palermo, Italy.",luca.agnello01@unipa.it,"Castro, Vítor/P-4837-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/N-9015-2019; Jalles, Joao Tovar/AAA-9923-2019; Sousa, Ricardo/F-8013-2010","Castro, Vítor/0000-0002-6426-6663; Jalles, Joao Tovar/0000-0002-7171-5076; Sousa, Ricardo/0000-0002-8279-5753",Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268],Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE; National Funds through the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,Castro and Sousa also acknowledge that this work has been financed by the Operational Programme for Competitiveness Factors - COMPETE and by National Funds through the FCT - Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology within the remit of the project 'FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-037268 (PEst-C/EGE/UI3182/2013)'.,,33,9,9,2,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

A supply chain with multiple suppliers, multiple products, multiple plants, multiple transportation alternatives and multiple customers is taken into account for this purpose. The problem is to specify a number and capacity level of plants, allocation of customers demand, and selection and order allocation of suppliers. A scenario approach is considered to deal effectively with the uncertainty of demand and cost parameters. The formulation is a robust multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MOMILP), in the context of which two conflicting objectives is taken into account simultaneously: (1) minimizing the total costs of a supply chain including raw material costs, transportation costs and establishment costs of plants, and (2) minimizing the total deterioration rate occurred by transportation alternatives. Then, the problem can be reduced to a linear one. Finally, by applying the LP-metric method, the model is solved as a single objective mixed-integer programming model. An experiment study corroborates that this procedure can be proposed to design an effective supply chain.","[Arabzad, S.

The recent literature suggests that this relationship might be non-linear. Low levels of innovation will not affect economic growth; yet, when a certain threshold is reached, innovation significantly promotes economic growth. Using panel data information for 147 countries from 2006 to 2012, we employ threshold regressions a la Hansen (1999) to test the hypothesis of a non-linear relationship between innovation and growth. We find evidence that the relationship between innovation and growth is not linear and that only high levels of innovation increase economic growth.

Our findings on the accuracy of short-term interest rate forecasts are, however, mixed. Further results reveal that Blue Chip is more (less) accurate in predicting country risk premiums associated with short-term (long-term) interest rates. Such evidence is reasonable since the short-term country risk premiums contain only the perceived default risk, while the long-term risk premiums, in addition, can contain the perceived inflation and exchange rate differentials.","[Baghestani, Hamid; Arzaghi, Mohammad; Kaya, Ilker] Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates",American University of Sharjah,"Kaya, I (通讯作者)，Amer Univ Sharjah, Sch Business Adm, Dept Econ, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates.",ikaya@aus.edu,"kaya, ilker/S-7910-2019","kaya, ilker/0000-0002-8666-8794; Baghestani, Hamid/0000-0003-4568-1682",,,,,28,12,12,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

One possible explanation for this increased level of integration is that increased liquefied natural gas trade has increased the opportunity for price arbitrage by decreasing transport costs. If this explanation is true, then the natural gas market should become relatively more integrated because countries separated by large distances would be more willing to trade with each other. We employ a gravity model to test whether trade in liquefied natural gas has helped to de-regionalize the total natural gas market, using trade in the compressed natural gas market as a comparison benchmark. The results indicate that liquefied natural gas is indeed a global commodity, whereas the compressed natural gas markets are more regional.

Innovatively, we obtain the returns to capital implied by this model: these are consistent with the Lucas paradox, which we explain after accounting for cross-country differences in the cost of capital goods. Our findings are also consistent with Ventura's hypothesis that the growth of small open economies can be promoted by beating the curse of diminishing returns indeed we find no decrease in the return to capital at any given capital-labor ratio despite capital accumulation by most countries within a cone of diversification.","[Batista, Catia] Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Econ, Nova Sch Business & Econ, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal; [Potin, Jacques] NERA Econ Consulting, Paris, France; [Potin, Jacques] ESSEC Paris Business Sch, Dept Econ, Paris, France",Universidade Nova de Lisboa; ESSEC Business School,"Batista, C (通讯作者)，Univ Nova Lisboa, Fac Econ, Nova Sch Business & Econ, Campus Campolide, P-1099032 Lisbon, Portugal.",catia.batista@novasbe.pt,,"Batista, Catia/0000-0001-9057-0397",George Webb Medley Fund at the University of Oxford; Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund at Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at Nova University of Lisbon,George Webb Medley Fund at the University of Oxford; Arts and Social Sciences Benefactions Fund at Trinity College Dublin; Nova Forum at Nova University of Lisbon,"We would like to thank the editor, Tiago Cavalcanti, an anonymous referee, as well as Gino Cateau, Marcos Chamon, Nicolas Coeurdacier, Julian Di Giovanni, Sebnem Kalemli-Ozcan, Laurence Lescourret, Beata Javorcik, Patricia Langohr, Peter Neary, Radu Vranceanu, Adrian Wood and participants at a number of seminars and conferences for their comments on this and earlier versions.

Evidence from India,JOURNAL OF POLICY MODELING,,,English,Article,,,,,,Indian Inflation; Food Prices; Unobserved Component Model; Forecasting; Monetary Policy,CORE INFLATION; BEVERIDGE-NELSON,"This paper seeks to answer two questions in the context of the Indian economy. First, are all movements in food and energy prices transitory? Second, is there a significant relationship between permanent and transitory shocks to different components of the aggregate price level? Using monthly price data for India and a multivariate correlated unobserved component model based on Morley et al. ((2003). The Review of Economics and Statistics, 85(2): 235) and Bradley et al. (forthcoming), we find that both food and energy prices have significant permanent components. Further, we find a significant feedback effect between permanent components of food prices and manufacturing good prices. These findings suggest that neglecting food and energy prices may render the core inflation measure based solely on manufacturing prices a biased measure of long run inflation. Finally, using a forecasting experiment, we show that a measure of the trend inflation that explicitly accounts for long run price movements in food and energy prices provides a superior forecast of future inflation when compared with alternative measures of the trend inflation.

Although the effects of structural variables are deeply analysed, a lesser attention has been paid to the impact of financial variables. Drawing on standard empirical current account models and with a large sample of industrial and developing countries, we report a significant deterioration in the current account balance in case of an increase in the credit growth. Moreover, we find that this link is substantially stronger for the developing ones motivating a closer examination. Therefore, we further advance our analysis and show that credit growth causes a stronger impact on the current account balance for lower levels of financial depth. In other words, at the early stages of financial development, acceleration in the credit growth might cause a larger deterioration in the current account balance; thus, it might be suggested that monetary policy and macro-prudential measures aimed at preventing financial excess might be more effective to reduce the external imbalances at the early stages of financial deepening.","[Ekinci, M.

This paper investigates this issue for the local movie theater industry in the U.S., one not previously studied in this regard. In small U.S. metropolitan areas, there is considerable variation in the nature of MMC among theater chains (large and small), which allows us to examine whether MMC among firms has an impact on movie pricing in these smaller markets. Data on movie pricing, market structure, and income and population characteristics are obtained for 118 multi-screen first-run movie theaters in 79 small metropolitan areas - those with under 250,000 people - which are not part of larger consolidated metropolitan areas.

We propose a methodology, inspired by statistical physics, that characterizes a model through its phase diagram in the space of parameters. Our first motivation is to understand the large macro-economic fluctuations observed in the Mark I ABM devised by Delli Gatti and collaborators. In this regard, our major finding is the generic existence of a phase transition between a good economy where unemployment is low, and a bad economy where unemployment is high. We then introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show that this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is generically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of firing of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping point, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such that the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified as the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several natural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold, limiting the firms maximum level of debt-to-sales ratio. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in particular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the unemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce simple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the good phase) or deflation (in the bad phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the model essentially unchanged. We have also explored the effect of simple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang crises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to model macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to reach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.

To deal with potential simultaneity between sovereign credit ratings and output volatility, a system (3SLS) approach is undertaken, and our findings remain robust. By weakening the volatility dampening effects of ratings changes, it is found that the global financial crisis (GFC) has enhanced macroeconomic volatility. One of the channels via which sovereign rating changes affect growth volatility is the financial markets' repricing of sovereign default risk that is reflected in sovereign credit default swap (CDS) spreads and its volatility.","[Hassan, Gazi Mainul] Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand; [Wu, Eliza] Univ Technol Sydney, Finance Discipline Grp, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Waikato; University of Technology Sydney,"Hassan, GM (通讯作者)，Univ Waikato, Waikato Management Sch, Dept Econ, Hamilton, New Zealand.",gmhassan@waikato.ac.nz,"Hassan, Gazi/AAI-3282-2020; Wu, Eliza/M-7823-2013","Hassan, Gazi/0000-0003-3861-8191; Wu, Eliza/0000-0003-3937-8660",,,,,31,7,8,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

This paper, by replacing their helicopter drops assumption with an open market operations assumption, shows that the two rules of fixing the money growth rate and targeting the time path of the price level work equally well.

The decrease in price manipulation found in this work is due to pre-closing information disclosure, not the behaviour of investors shifting to an earlier time. Further, if a stock price rises or falls by more than 3.5% in the simulation in the last minute during the closing session, trading of the stock will be suspended for two minutes from 13:31 to reduce volatility. However, this trading mechanism (suspended-closing) does not seem to have achieved the intended goals of the authorities, as it has not been able to significantly reduce closing-price volatility and price manipulation.","MingDao Univ, Dept Finance, Changhua 52345, Taiwan",Mingdao University,"Hsieh, TY (通讯作者)，MingDao Univ, Dept Finance, Changhua 52345, Taiwan.",tyhsieh@mail2000.com.tw,,,Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [MOST 103-2410-H-451-002],"Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",The financial support is from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan [Project No. MOST 103-2410-H-451-002].,,33,2,2,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Norms such as patrilocality and concern for women's purity help explain the male-skewed sex ratio in India and China and low female employment in India, the Middle East, and North Africa, for example.

Since the selection effect reallocates resources toward the more productive firms, this process can be hindered by rigidity in domestic labour market institutions. Based on the selection effect by Melitz (2003), this article empirically examines how rigidity in labour market institutions affects the consequence of trade on aggregate productivity. Findings from panel dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) estimators suggest that a high degree of labour market rigidity in an open economy reduces Total Factor Productivity (TFP). In particular, in the case of extremely high labour market rigidity but low foreign R&D capital stocks, openness to trade can cause a country to experience decreasing TFP.","Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea",Samsung,"Kang, Y (通讯作者)，Samsung Econ Res Inst, Seoul, South Korea.",youngho.nomad@gmail.com,,,,,,,34,6,6,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using semi-parametric hedonic regressions with and without instrumental variables, we find no evidence of positive externalities, although the results with instrumental variables are somewhat imprecise.

The event triggering the recession has the workings of a redistribution shock: a small sector of the economy - borrowers who use their home as collateral - defaults on their loans. When banks hold little equity in excess of regulatory requirements, the losses require them to react immediately, either by recapitalizing or by deleveraging. By deleveraging, banks transform the initial shock into a credit crunch, and, to the extent that some firms depend on bank credit, amplify and propagate the shock to the real economy. I find that redistribution and other financial shocks that affect leveraged sectors accounts for twothirds of output collapse during the Great Recession.

Two issues that are getting much attention are about whether Korea should implement mandatory testing of slaughtered domestic cattle for BSE and whether consumers are willing to pay a tax for the programme. No study, however, has examined consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) a tax for a BSE testing programme. We conducted a contingent valuation (CV) study using a double-bounded dichotomous choice approach to estimate Korean consumers' valuation for a mandatory BSE testing programme on slaughtered domestic cattle that are 21 months or older. Our results show that the sample-population adjusted mean estimate of WTP a tax per year is 4482 KRW (US $4.01) per household. This suggests that Korean consumers have a strong preference for a mandatory testing of domestic cattle for BSE. This study also found that Korean consumers' WTP for the programme is greater than estimated implementation costs of the programme. These results imply that implementing a mandatory BSE testing programme in Korea could confer positive consumer welfare.","[Lee, Sang Hyeon] Texas A&M Univ, Dept Agr Econ, College Stn, TX 77843 USA; [Lee, Ji Yong] Kansas State Univ, Dept Agr Econ, Manhattan, KS 66506 USA; [Han, Doo Bong; Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea; [Nayga, Rodolfo M., Jr.] Univ Arkansas, Dept Agr Econ & Agribusiness, Fayetteville, AR 72701 USA",Texas A&M University System; Texas A&M University College Station; Kansas State University; Korea University; University of Arkansas System; University of Arkansas Fayetteville,"Han, DB (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Food & Resource Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",han@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Sang Hyeon/0000-0003-1610-9994",,,,,30,6,7,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To circumvent the low availability of data, widely applicable new methods for estimating productivity and elasticity of substitution were developed based on the normalized constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function. One is an extended version of the Solow residual calculation, and the other is a direct estimation of the time-varying parameter normalized CES production function. The application of the methods to the Soviet data showed a decreasing trend in productivity growth and a low elasticity of substitution of approximately 0.25. The results neither reject nor support the extensive growth hypothesis because of uncertainty in the interpretation of the low elasticity of substitution. The results suggest that it is reasonable to assert that both deteriorating productivity growth and low elasticity of substitution caused the Soviet economic slowdown. Further empirical studies on productivity and elasticity of substitution in the Soviet and other economies are necessary to fully understand relations between productivity growth, elasticity of substitution and economic development.","Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Social Sci, Hodogaya Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Nakamura, Y (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Int Social Sci, Hodogaya Ku, Tokiwadai 79-4, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2408501, Japan.",y-nkmr@ynu.ac.jp,"NAKAMURA, Yasushi/P-3643-2014","NAKAMURA, Yasushi/0000-0002-0026-8715","JSPS KAKENHI [2453092, 15H01959]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01959] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",This work was financially supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Numbers 2453092 and 15H01959.,,30,9,10,2,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Aside from the perception of its importance towards the management of higher education institutions, there is also an ongoing discussion regarding the challenge posed by the dissemination of information and the necessity to encourage society's understanding and critical awareness on knowledge management for this segment, particularly in what concerns public organizations. In order to manage various tasks and fulfill the duty of accountability, there is a fundamental question at the outset: what is the importance of creating a common framework of indicators to make up the universities' intellectual capital report? To answer this question, this study seeks to analyse, through literature, the importance of creating a basic framework of indicators for the universities' intellectual capital reports. Regarding methodology the descriptive-exploratory method was used, by conducting a comprehensive literature review in Scopus, Web of Science and Emerald data. Following and in order to contribute towards a discussion on the indicators' generic framework a content analysis of the management reports is suggested. The article presents some conclusions: firstly, knowledge is related to the university's purpose and strategy, bringing into play the relevance of the particular characteristics of each organization. Additionally, knowledge management is a difficult task in any organization, since controlling a subjective, transferable, sedimented, perishable and spontaneous entity may require an overly broad view of a complex process that appears to have long term returns rather than a clear short-term one. This article's second conclusion is that knowledge is identified in a university as the biggest inducer towards generating resources for the entity and it is also the institution's major output. Besides these two aspects, the university's knowledge dissemination in a society contributes towards building or elevating its image, not only as a facilitator, but also as a producer of knowledge development.","[Silva, Telma; Ferreira, Augusta] Univ Aveiro, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro,"Silva, T (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, P-3800 Aveiro, Portugal.",telmachaves@ua.pt,"da Conceição Santos Ferreira, Augusta/C-5961-2018","da Conceição Santos Ferreira, Augusta/0000-0003-1659-3309",,,,,15,0,0,0,3,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,450,453,,,,,,4,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600052,0

Using net per capita FDI inflows and the United Nations Development Program's Human Development Index as the principal variables, our analyses confirm the positive and strongly significant relationship between net FDI inflows and welfare improvement in North Africa, although we do find significant differences among the countries in the region. This relationship holds even after we control for government size, country indebtedness, macroeconomic instability, infrastructural development, institutional quality, political risk, openness to trade, education and financial market development. Hence, at the aggregate level, FDI contributes to economic growth in North Africa, in turn generating additional revenues for governments and populations in the region through fiscal policies and jobs creation. We also found that FDI received by countries in the region are mainly concentrated in very few industries (particularly extractive petroleum, services and tourism, construction and utilities); relatively fewer of these investments are directed towards the nonextractive primary industries, which are pro-poor sectors and highly labour intensive, or the manufacturing sector, with a high potential for spillover effects in the economy. This lack of diversification of FDI received in the region's economies in part explains the differences observed in the link between FDI and welfare in these countries. It is therefore essential for governments in the region to continue investing in social infrastructures while improving the quality of their institutions and their governance; doing so will probably help avoid the type of unrest we have witnessed recently.","Univ Laval, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada",Laval University,"Soumaré, I (通讯作者)，Univ Laval, Fac Business Adm, Dept Finance Insurance & Real Estate, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada.",issouf.soumare@fsa.ulaval.ca,,,Regional Department North of the African Development Bank,Regional Department North of the African Development Bank,I wish to acknowledge the financial support received from the Regional Department North of the African Development Bank.,,19,32,32,1,47,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find that an increase in financial stress leads to tighter credit conditions and lower economic activity in all five countries. The estimated impact on the real economy displays an initial rapid decline followed by a gradual dissipation. In Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the central banks tend to reduce policy interest rates (IRs) when financial stress increases, although there is substantial cross-country variation in the magnitude and time dynamics. The lower policy IRs are found to have little significant effects in lowering financial stress, but are still effective in stimulating economic activity through other channels. These findings imply that easing monetary policy is likely necessary but insufficient to address growth slowdowns associated with financial stress. Monetary easing should instead be complemented with other policy measures which are targeted at restoring financial stress to normal levels.","[Tng, Boon Hwa] Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia; [Kwek, Kian Teng] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya,"Tng, BH (通讯作者)，Bank Negara Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur 50480, Malaysia.",boonhwa@bnm.gov.my,"KWEK, Kian Teng/B-8820-2010",,,,,,47,16,16,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It tests rationality under the possibility of an asymmetric loss function. The results indicate less evidence of asymmetry for a horizon of 1 month but considerable evidence of asymmetry for a horizon of 3 months. However, the shapes of the distributions formed by estimated asymmetry parameters of sub-samples for each forecaster are symmetric, regardless of the forecast horizons, which implies that these forecasters do not herd or antiherd. In fact, the results of our empirical herding test show that forecasters neither herd nor antiherd, which is in sharp contrast to recent findings on antiherding for foreign exchange rates in emerging market economies. Our findings provide consistent evidence for a recent suggestion that antiherding might result in the rejection of rationality, even under asymmetric loss functions. Our findings also suggest that central bank transparency might be associated with herding behaviours.","[Tsuchiya, Y.; Kato, T.] Tokyo Univ Sci, Kuki, Saitama 3468512, Japan",Tokyo University of Science,"Tsuchiya, Y (通讯作者)，Tokyo Univ Sci, 500 Shimokiyoku, Kuki, Saitama 3468512, Japan.",ytsuchiya@rs.tus.ac.jp,"Tsuchiya, Yoichi/HNR-4850-2023","Tsuchiya, Yoichi/0000-0003-2485-3959",,,,,29,3,3,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In those models, instead of allowing for all subsets of the set of players to form, it is assumed that the set of feasible coalitions is a subset of the power set of the set of players. In this paper, we consider such sets of feasible coalitions that follow from a permission structure on the set of players, in which players need permission to cooperate with other players. We assume the permission structure to be an oriented tree. This means that there is one player at the top of the permission structure, and for every other player, there is a unique directed path from the top player to this player. We introduce a new solution for these games based on the idea of the Average Tree value for cycle-free communication graph games.

In the simplest form of the constant relative risk aversion utility function, the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) and risk aversion have an inverse relationship. However, there is no empirical evidence that suggests this inverse relationship holds. We examine the relationship between risk aversion and IES using household consumption data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey during 1996-2010. Multiple risk domains are selected to represent risk preference, and for each domain, we consider some households to be more risk averse than others. We separately estimate IES for the more risk-averse and less risk-averse households. We find that the IES estimates are generally smaller for the more risk-averse households than for the less risk-averse households and that the difference is statistically significant in the majority of the financial domains. This finding supports the inverse relationship between the two parameters, although considerable heterogeneity is found across domains.","[Yagihashi, Takeshi; Du, Juan] Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA",Old Dominion University,"Du, J (通讯作者)，Old Dominion Univ, Dept Econ, Norfolk, VA 23529 USA.",jdu@odu.edu,"Yagihashi, Takeshi/AAF-1254-2020","Yagihashi, Takeshi/0000-0001-9916-6008",,,,,41,2,4,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

During a systemic crisis, bailouts relax balance sheet constraints and mitigate the severity of the recession. Ex ante, the anticipation of such bailouts leads to an increase in risk-taking, making the economy more vulnerable to a financial crisis. We find that moral hazard effects are limited if bailouts are systemic and broad-based. If bailouts are idiosyncratic and targeted, however, this makes the economy significantly more exposed to financial crises.","[Bianchi, Javier] Fed Reserve Rank Minneapolis, 90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA",,"Bianchi, J (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Rank Minneapolis, 90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA.",Javier.Bianchi@mpls.frb.org,,,,,,,61,56,76,1,71,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

In these games, we use an exogenous network to restrict both monitoring and the set of feasible punishment flows. In addition to two baseline structures (the Complete network and the Circle network), we examine a novel Asymmetric network in which both punishment responsibility and exposure differ across players. Average contributions are significantly lower in the Asymmetric network, driven entirely by the under-monitored player who faces only one potential punisher. We formulate and examine the hypothesis that asymmetry among a player's potential punishment targets may lead to discriminatory patterns of punishment. In particular, players might wish to punish targets for whom they are solely responsible discriminately more than targets for whom they share responsibility. The experimental data do not support this hypothesis, although they do suggest a compelling explanation as to why. Specifically, we find that the under monitored player in the network retaliates against previous punishment significantly more often than others in the group, which deters their only potential punisher from issuing stronger sanctions. Thus, an additional complication of asymmetry in the network is that it may lead to more instances of anti-social retaliation, inhibiting the effectiveness of the decentralized punishment institution.

This framework is based on the premise that successful rent management depends on political and institutional arrangements to produce incentives and pressures for technical upgrading and innovation. This is because, while rents are created for a variety of purposes, rent outcomes whether growth-enhancing or growth-reducing depend on a set of political, institutional, and market conditions that take place formally and informally. Therefore, the key objective of the DRMA framework is to understand how a country's politics, institutions, and industries are configured to incentivize and compel industrial upgrading. Thus, DRMA enables a broader and more complex understanding of the various factors at play in the process of development. I provide an illustrative application of the DRMA framework using the Vietnamese experience of adopting third-generation technology in the telecommunications industry.","[Christine Ngoc Ngo] Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA",University of Denver,"Ngo, CN (通讯作者)，Univ Denver, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80208 USA.",,,,,,,,49,7,7,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We examine a scenario in which the UK has no free trade agreement with the EU, focusing on four key shocks: a permanent reduction in the size of the UK's export market share in EU member countries, an increase in tariffs, a permanent reduction in inward FDI flows and the repatriation of the UK's projected net contributions to the EU budget. We calibrate the size of the shocks on a synthesis of the academic evidence. We explain how each of these four shocks is implemented in NiGEM, as well as examining the key mechanisms by which they are propagated through the model. The export market share channel is the main mechanism by which leaving the EU leads to declines in GDP and consumption relative to the long-run baseline, accounting for a long-run decline in GDP of 2.1% relative to the baseline value, out of a total projected reduction in GDP relative to the baseline of 2.7%.

Experimental evidence,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Patent assertion entities; Financial intermediation; Inventors; Experiments,,"Recent work suggests that Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs)-or patent trolls-are a new form of financial intermediary. According to this view, individual patent holders are unable to contract with large manufacturers because they lack the financial resources necessary to litigate against infringement. Since individual patent holders are heterogeneous in their constraints and preferences, the market function of PAEs should depend on their specific demands. We conducted an experiment in which subjects from a population of interest were each assigned patents that were infringed by large manufacturers in a hypothetical scenario. We relaxed the financial constraints of some patent holders and evaluated whether this randomized intervention subsequently reduced the demand for PAEs relative to costly litigation. Our results indicate that PAEs served an intermediary function for two groups in our sample: subjects who identified as inventors rather than entrepreneurs, and subjects who were relatively more sensitive to financial losses.

The demand for durables, characterized by increasing returns of scale to a price reduction, is led by the hazard rate. While the effect of inventories on pricing of non-durables is widely recognized, the management and marketing literature typically overlooks this effect in regard to horizontally competing firms for durables. In this paper we show that the pricing trajectory of durables may significantly alter when inventory dynamics are accounted for. In particular, the price may hike upwards before dropping; gradually grow; or even stay at the same level over the entire product life while it would only decline if inventories and related costs are disregarded. Furthermore, the well-known, optimal pricing strategy of following the pattern of sales does not necessarily confirm even for symmetric equilibria when the competing firms have either an inventory surplus or shortage.

This is important because incorporating such interactions in choice models can be an effective way to account for systematic taste variation or observable preference heterogeneityacross individuals. Using simulated data sets to mimic a well-known phenomenon of selective attention to design attributes, we tested our proposed approach in a banking service context. Our proposed approach was successful in detecting the attribute by covariate interactions implied by the data generation process and outperformed a model with all covariate interactions. The proposed method contributes to the choice modelling literature by providing one of the tricks of trade to model observed preference heterogeneity. The simplicity of this approach has advantages for both academics and practitioners in marketing, transportation, healthcare and other fields that use choice modelling. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

UPC has the same undominated perfect equilibria as standard provision point (PPM) and proportional rebate (PR) mechanisms, and UPA a somewhat broader set. However, our mechanisms' different marginal penalty structures may facilitate equilibrium selection and lead to higher contributions and more frequent provision. Through laboratory experiments, using both homogeneous (symmetric) and heterogeneous induced values, we show our mechanisms improve upon PR and PPM: UPC generates higher aggregate contributions than PR and PPM, leading to higher provision rates than PPM; UPA attracts much higher contributions, although it provides less frequently. This ranking emerges because high offers are more common (especially among high value people in the heterogeneous environment) in the uniform price mechanisms, where higher offers only increase the payment when needed for provision.

However, the age at which children enter day care and therefore the overall time spent in day care varies substantially. We investigate the potential impact of later day care entry on the social and emotional behaviour of children, one important aspect of non-cognitive skills. Based on the English sample of the Millennium Cohort Study, we analyse how later entries are associated with children's development at the age of 5 and 7 years, using propensity score techniques. We find clear evidence of significant associations at the age of 7 years: Later day care entry appears to increase children's peer problems and to reduce prosocial behaviour. We find hardly any associations with the emotional development of children. Children with low-educated mothers and those from families with a household income below the poverty line are most strongly affected, which provides support for a social gradient in how earlier day care entry impacts non-cognitive skills.

These settings are characterized by (i) the existence of adverse efficient opt-out types, whose participation does not change the efficient allocation and who, when they opt out, are the worst type other agents can face, and (ii) non-existence of the marginal core, and its multivaluedness with a positive probability. We also examine the optimal allocation of property rights within a given class that satisfies (i), such as simple property rights, liability rules, and dual-chooser rules. We characterize property rights that minimize the expected subsidy required to implement efficiency. With two agents, simple property rights that are optimal in this way maximize the expected surplus at the status quo allocation, but this no longer holds with more agents. We also study second-best budget-balanced bargaining under a liability rule. The optimal second-best liability rule may differ from, but is often close to, the expectation of the victim's harm, which would be optimal if there were no bargaining. However, liability rules that are close to a simple property right result in a lower expected surplus than the simple property right they are near.","[Segal, Ilya] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Whinston, Michael D.] MIT, Dept Econ, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Whinston, Michael D.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Stanford University; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Segal, I (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",isegal@stanford.edu; whinston@mit.edu,,,National Science Foundation [SES-0961693]; Toulouse Network for Information Technology,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Toulouse Network for Information Technology,"This paper was presented as the Alfred Marshall Lecture at the Meetings of the European Economic Association in Mannheim, August 2015.

Yet little is known about how disease forecasts influence the responsiveness to public health interventions. This paper couples an optimal stopping model and rational disease prevention with a stochastic compartmental epidemiological model of disease spread to develop a framework for evaluating the timing of public health interventions in response to rational but unpredictable epidemics. Optimal behavior by a public health agency is characterized by a pair of critical prevalence thresholds that trigger implementation and suspension of a public prevention program. Unlike existing economic thresholds for disease prevention, our decision thresholds account for time-varying probabilities of different levels of infection, prevention by private individuals, and the likelihood of crossing epidemiological thresholds that determine disease persistence.

Teacher evaluations have been conducted by trained external evaluators who scored teachers on a detailed rubric containing 75 classroom practices. These practices reflect pedagogical, didactical and classroom organization competences considered crucial for effective teaching. Conditional on previous year test scores and several pupil and classroom characteristics the score on this rubric significantly predicts pupil performance gains on standardized tests in math, reading and spelling. Estimated test score gains are in the order of 0.4 standard deviations in math and spelling and 0.25 standard deviations in reading if a pupil is assigned a teacher from the top quartile instead of the bottom quartile of the distribution of the evaluation rubric. The observation rubric particularly seems to have potential to identify weak teachers. These observations may stimulate targeted teacher improvement plans and personnel decisions.","[van der Steeg, Marc; Gerritsen, Sander] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands; [van der Steeg, Marc] Dutch Minist Educ Sci & Culture, The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"van der Steeg, M (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands.;van der Steeg, M (通讯作者)，Dutch Minist Educ Sci & Culture, The Hague, Netherlands.",marc.vandersteeg@minocw.nl,,,,,,,34,0,4,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2016,164.0,4,,,SI,,419,443,,10.1007/s10645-016-9280-5,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,ED1GV,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388594000004,0

We argue that the current debate in economics about the income-happiness paradox has paid too little attention to the theoretical foundation of the expected positive relation between income and happiness, seeking an empirical resolution through better data and more elaborate estimating equations instead. We return to the history of economics and revisit the contributions of Irving Fisher and Kenneth Boulding for the missing economic theory that underlies the income-happiness paradox. According to both Fisher and Boulding, consumer capital is the ultimate source of welfare, whereby consumer capital is defined as an accumulated stock of tangible and intangible instruments that yield a stream of services over their useful life. In the view of Fisher and Boulding, it is the utilization of this capital stock that renders happiness to individuals. Moreover, income that pays for the goods of consumption can be a bad, reflecting the cost of maintaining the consumer capital stock. Therefore, Fisher and Boulding's insights bring a new perspective to the Easterlin paradox, showing that the empirical finding that rising income contributes only little, if anything, to levels of happiness has been overemphasized at the expense of the theoretically more relevant relation between consumer capital and happiness, and the exact role of income therein.","[van Hoorn, Andre] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Sent, Esther-Mirjam] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen; Radboud University Nijmegen,"van Hoorn, A (通讯作者)，Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Management Res, Dept Econ, Nijmegen, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,88,2,2,2,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We consider a dynamic Mirrleesian economy in which agents are privately informed about idiosyncratic labor productivity shocks. Agents sign privately observable insurance contracts with multiple firms (i.e., they are non-exclusive). Contracts specify both labor and savings requirements. Finns have no restriction on the contracts they can offer and interact strategically. In equilibrium, contrary to the case with exclusive contracts, a standard Euler equation holds, and the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure is equated to the worker's marginal productivity. Also, each agent receives zero net present value of transfers. These conditions imply the equilibrium allocation is equivalent to a standard incomplete markets model. To sustain this equilibrium, more than one firm must be active and must also offer latent contracts to deter deviations to more profitable contingent contracts. In this environment, the non-observability of contracts removes the possibility of additional insurance beyond self-insurance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To detect the long-term relationship we use the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound testing approach, while for the short-term effects, Granger causality models are employed. The results show that, in the long term, there is no linkage between exchange rate volatility and international trade activities except for Turkey, and even in this case, the magnitude of the effect of volatility is quite small. In the short term, however, a significant causal relationship from volatility to import/export demand is detected for Indonesia and Mexico.

This article answers the question whether the high school curriculum has the potential to affect students' dropout decision. Focusing on the curriculum is also motivated by the manifold curriculum reforms or reform initiatives worldwide. Using a quasi-experimental evaluation design, we identify the effects of a curriculum reform on students' probability to drop out of high school in the short run, i.e. for the first three cohorts graduating under the new curriculum requirements. The reform increased the curriculum requirements in high school, for instance, by reducing the freedom of choice in course selection.

When the risk aversion coefficient exceeds the inverse of the intertemporal substitution elasticity, then an exogenous rise in a country's output volatility triggers a wealth transfer to that country, to compensate for the greater riskiness of the country's output stream. This risk sharing transfer raises the country's consumption, lowers its trade balance and appreciates its real exchange rate. In the recursive preferences framework here, volatility shocks account for a non-negligible share of the fluctuations of net exports, net foreign assets and the real exchange rate. These shocks help to explain the high empirical volatility of the real exchange rate and the disconnect between relative consumption and the real exchange rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Based on our model, we postulate that the demand value of such information rises with wealth and exposure and declines with the athlete's appetite for risk. We use survey data from a sample of backcountry skiers to empirically test these predictions. The high degree of self-control over exposure makes these athletes a wellsuited population to study the demand value of safety information. Caution is warranted in the empirical analysis as unobserved factors may jointly affect the athlete's perceived risk and his willingnessto pay for obtaining safety information. We use a recursive twostage estimation approach to account for endogeneity concerns. The empirical results are supportive of our theoretical predictions and suggest that variations in athletes' demand for safety information can be explained by personal beliefs about risk exposure and deliberate risk taking.

Simulations show that both trade and financial openness can lead to improvements in both income growth and equality once an economy crosses a critical threshold in capital intensity and in the use of imported intermediate goods in the production process.

We focus on allocation mechanisms that are dominant-strategy incentive compatible when agents' types are private information. Inefficiency of an allocation mechanism may come from two sources: misallocation of the indivisible good and an imbalanced budget. Unfortunately, as Green and Laffont (1979) demonstrate, no allocation mechanism can always overcome both kinds of inefficiency. We identify allocation mechanisms that maximize the expected total utilities of agents, and characterize optimal mechanisms for a large class of agents' type distributions. For strongly regular type distributions, we show that the optimal mechanisms must be budget-balanced: they are either fixed-price mechanisms or option mechanisms. The result may not hold for other type distributions. For certain type distributions, we show that optimal mechanisms are hybrids of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms and budget balanced mechanisms.

This paper deals with the risk management of savings accounts, a bank product defined as a non-maturing account with embedded option that bears a relatively attractive rate of return. We focus on the interest rate risk of savings accounts. By constructing the replicating portfolio and simulating market rates and client rates, we show that under the severest scenario, some banks in the Czech Republic might face a significant capital shortage in next two years if market rates start to increase dramatically from recent low levels. We conclude that savings accounts are riskier liabilities than current accounts and term deposits for banks. Moreover, we propose imposing stricter regulation and supervision on these bank products since they might increase systemic risk of the Czech banking sector in coming years.","[Dzmuranova, Hana] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Teply, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Dept Banking & Insurance, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dzmuránová, H (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",hanadzmuranova@gmail.com; petr.teply@vse.cz,"Teply, Petr/E-9785-2018; Dzmuranova, Hana/T-2606-2017","Dzmuranova, Hana/0000-0003-2601-1755",Czech Science Foundation (Project GACR) [16-21506S]; Grant Agency of Charles University in Prague (Project GAUK) [165215]; University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE) [IP 100040],Czech Science Foundation (Project GACR); Grant Agency of Charles University in Prague (Project GAUK); University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE),"This research was supported by the Czech Science Foundation (Project GACR No. 16-21506S), the Grant Agency of Charles University in Prague (Project GAUK No. 165215) and University of Economics in Prague (Project VSE No. IP 100040).",,32,6,6,2,21,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

A growing literature examines their impact based on aggregate fiscal performance. So far, no evidence exists on how fiscal rules influence deficit expectations of fiscal policy makers. In the context of the German debt brake, we study this expectation dimension. In a first step, we introduce a dynamic model in an environment characterized by lagged implementation of a new rule, which in turn characterizes the setup of the German debt brake and raises credibility issues. In a second step, we analyze a unique survey of members of all 16 German state parliaments and show that the debt brake's credibility is far from perfect. The heterogeneity of compliance expectations in the survey corresponds to our theoretical predictions regarding states' initial fiscal conditions, specific state fiscal rules, and bailout perceptions. In addition, there is a robust asymmetry in compliance expectations between insiders and outsiders (both for in-state vs. out-of-state politicians and the incumbent government vs. opposition dimension), which we attribute to overconfidence rather than noisy information.

As such, it can affect weight outcomes through healthy food-access cost and availability, which in turn shape eating styles and habits. This article evaluates the impact of food environment on weight outcomes through a stochastic frontier approach (SFA) that comprehensively includes various components of the food environment. The model is estimated using body mass indexes (BMIs) as the dependent variable and demographics and food environment data from New England counties as explanatory variables. Empirical results indicate that supercentres and limited service restaurants are positively associated with weight gain, while full service restaurants are negatively associated with BMIs. In metropolitan counties, the presence of full and limited service restaurants has a significant impact on BMIs; in non-metropolitan counties, these establishments do not, except in those adjacent to metropolitan areas. Empirical results also validate SFA is a more appropriate specification than the standard linear model. In addition, SFA allows us to rank counties and identify targets for effective policy interventions. An ordered logit model of weight status is estimated with the same explanatory variables, confirming that the directions of the effects of the food environment components are similar.","[Li, Xun] Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Lopez, Rigoberto A.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Agr & Resource Econ, Storrs, CT USA",Wuhan University; University of Connecticut,"Li, X (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",li.xun@whu.edu.cn,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The model accounts for imperfect access to world capital markets and a variety of externalities associated with public infrastructure, including utility benefits, a direct complementarity effect with private investment, and reduced distribution costs. However, public capital is also subject to congestion and absorption constraints, with the latter affecting the efficiency of infrastructure investment. The optimal windfall allocation rule between spending today and asset accumulation is determined so as to minimize a social loss function defined in terms of the volatility of private consumption and either the nonresource primary fiscal balance or a more general index of macroeconomic stability, which accounts for the volatility of the real exchange rate.

A problem with this approach is that determining boundaries in a particular fashion also determines the nature of the group in a way that is often prejudicial for analysis ultimately affecting the way transition and class mobility behavior is evaluated. Here a semi-parametric technique for class categorization without resort to arbitrarily specified frontiers is proposed and the convergence of classes and mobility between them is studied in the context of the size distribution of per capita GDP of nations. Category membership is partially determined by the commonality of observed behavior of category members: partial in the sense that only the probability of category membership in each category is determined for each country. Such an approach does not inhibit the size of classes or the nature of transitions between them. A study of the world distribution over the 40 years preceding 2010 reveals substantial changes in class sizes and mobility patterns between them which are very different from those observed in a fixed class size analysis.,"[Anderson, Gordon] Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pittau, Maria Grazia; Zelli, Roberto] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Stat Sci, Rome, Italy",University of Toronto; Sapienza University Rome,"Anderson, G (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Dept Econ, Toronto, ON, Canada.",anderson@chass.utoronto.ca; grazia.pittau@uniroma1.it; roberto.zelli@uniroma1.it,,"ZELLI, Roberto/0000-0002-1967-3470",SSHRC; University of Toronto; Sapienza research grants,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); University of Toronto(University of Toronto); Sapienza research grants,"We would like to thank the journal's editor and three anonymous referees for helpful comments.

The participants in our experiment have to choose repeatedly between two, three or four experimental funds. The time series of fund returns are exogenously generated prior to the experiment and participants are paid for each period according to the return of the fund they choose. For most cases participants' decisions can be successfully described by a discrete choice switching model, often applied in heterogeneous agent models, provided that a predisposition toward one of the funds is included. The estimated intensity of choice parameter of the discrete choice model depends on the structure of the fund returns. In particular, it increases with correlation between past and future returns. This suggests human subjects do not myopically chase past returns, but are more likely to do so when past returns are more predictive of future returns, a feature that is absent in the standard heterogeneous agent models.

A continuous spatial model illustrates this trade-off in a framework where a small gap between flight operating times raises congestion while also shortening a connecting passenger's layover time. When the passenger's cost per unit of layover time rises, the monopoly airline chooses to narrow the gap between its flights, yielding shorter layovers but more congestion. A discrete spatial model, where flights congest one another only if they operate in the same discrete period, makes this layover-cost effect discontinuous: the monopoly carrier concentrates (deconcentrates) its flights when this cost is high (low) relative to the costs of congestion. When fringe carriers are present, however, the hub carrier always concentrates its flights, either partially or fully. But the presence of a second hub carrier leads to an equilibrium mirroring the monopoly outcome: the carriers concentrate their flights in different periods when the layover cost is high and deconcentrate them otherwise. The paper also presents a welfare analysis, showing that movement from the equilibrium to the social optimum typically requires greater carrier separation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, in our analysis we use a shadow short rate?a quantitative measure of overall conventional and unconventional monetary policy that is estimated from the term structure of interest rates. Our results suggest that the operation of monetary policy at the zero lower bound of interest rates alters the transmission of shocks. In particular, we find a limited response of exchange rates during the first episode of unconventional monetary policy in Japan but a significant impact since 2006.","[Claus, Edda] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Claus, Edda] Wilfrid Laurier Univ, CAMA, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada; [Claus, Iris] Int Monetary Fund, Reserve Bank Bldg,Tower 7 Pratt St, Suva, Fiji; [Claus, Iris] Univ Waikato, Int Monetary Fund, Pacific Financial Tech Assistance Ctr, Reserve Bank Bldg,Tower 7 Pratt St, Suva, Fiji; [Krippner, Leo] Reserve Bank New Zealand, 2 Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand; [Krippner, Leo] Reserve Bank New Zealand, CAMA, 2 Terrace, Wellington 6011, New Zealand",Wilfrid Laurier University; Wilfrid Laurier University; Reserve Bank of New Zealand; Reserve Bank of New Zealand,"Claus, E (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.;Claus, E (通讯作者)，Wilfrid Laurier Univ, CAMA, Dept Econ, Sch Business & Econ, 75 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3C5, Canada.",eclaus@wlu.ca; iclaus@imf.org; leo.krippner@rbnz.govt.nz,,"Claus, Edda/0000-0003-0189-9102",,,,,24,10,10,0,24,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142-1209 USA",1535-3516,1536-0083,,ASIAN ECON PAP,Asian Econ.

Product differentiation and the possibility of losses from trade under Cournot oligopoly with free entry,ECONOMICS LETTERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Gains from trade; Trade liberalisation; Free entry; Cournot oligopoly; Product variety,INTERNATIONAL-TRADE; COMPETITION; POLICY; MODEL,"In a free-entry Cournot oligopoly model with a quadratic utility function that yields differentiated products, it is shown that there are losses from trade when the trade cost is close to the prohibitive level. Although the total number of varieties increases, there is a reduction in consumer surplus. This occurs because trade leads to an increase in imported varieties where consumer surplus is low due to the high trade cost and a decrease in domestically-produced varieties where consumer surplus is high. This result is in contrast with results from the free-entry Cournot oligopoly models with homogeneous products of Brander and Krugman (1983) and Venables (1985); the monopolistic competition models such as Krugman (1980) and Venables (1987), and heterogeneous firm models such as Melitz (2003) and Melitz and Ottaviano (2008).

The quantile causality test is useful for a comprehensive understanding of the causal relationship between two returns. The test reveals several noteworthy results. First, although WTI returns are not closely related to Asian countries, some financial markets such as Nikkei and Hang Seng Granger-cause WTI returns. Second, the significance of causality from one market to another derives only from lower and upper levels of quantiles except for the case of causality from Nikkei to WTI returns. Third, all stock index returns Granger-cause Dubai crude oil returns over almost all quantile levels except for Shanghai returns. Fourth, Dubai crude oil returns Granger-cause all Asian stock index returns except for S&P 500 returns. Finally, the results indicate asymmetric causality from Dubai crude oil returns to Shanghai returns and KOSPI returns to Dubai crude oil returns. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We set up a two-stage game with three competing importers, where first, two of the countries decide on whether to initiate war against each other, and subsequently, all three countries select their import tariffs. We show that PTAs produce both a peace-creation effect and a peace-diversion effect, whereby they reduce the likelihood of conflict between member countries (peace creation), but render the eruption of war between member and non-member countries more likely (peace diversion). This paper is the first to identify and explicitly model the peace-diversion effect of PTAs, and is also the only one in this literature to endogenize countries' terms of trade. We use data from the Correlates of War project to empirically test these predictions, and after controlling for endogeneity, we find robust evidence of both peace creation and peace diversion in relation to PTA establishment.

When price controls exist, the existence of competitive equilibria is no longer guaranteed; hence, we investigate the nature of non-price competition and how markets might evolve in its presence. We develop a quality competition model based on matching theory. Equilibria of the quality competition model always exist in such price-constrained markets; moreover, they naturally correspond to competitive equilibria when competitive equilibria exist. Additionally, we characterize the set of equilibria of the quality competition model in the presence of price restrictions. In a series of experiments, we find that market outcomes closely conform to the predictions of the model. In particular, price controls induce non price competition between agents both in theory and in the experimental environment; market behaviors result in allocations close to the predictions of the model.

J,"Sarin, N; Summers, LH",,,,"Sarin, Natasha; Summers, Lawrence H.",,,Understanding Bank Risk through Market Measures,BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Since the financial crisis, there have been major changes in the regulation of large banks directed at reducing their risk. Measures of regulatory capital have substantially increased; leverage ratios have been reduced; and stress-testing has sought to further assure safety by raising levels of capital and reducing risk-taking. Standard financial theories predict that such changes would lead to substantial declines in financial market measures of risk. For major banks in the United States and around the world and for midsized banks in the United States, we test this proposition using information on stock price volatility, option-based estimates of future volatility, beta, credit default swaps, price earnings ratios, and preferred stock yields. To our surprise, we find that financial market information does not bear out the predictions of financial theory. Measures of volatility and risk premiums today are no lower and perhaps somewhat higher than they were prior to the financial crisis. We examine a number of possible explanations for our findings. While financial markets underestimated risk prior to the crisis and regulatory measures of capital are flawed, we believe that the most important explanation for our findings is the dramatic decline in the franchise value of major banks. We highlight that the ratio of the market value of common equity to assets on both a risk-adjusted and risk-unadjusted basis has declined significantly from the precrisis period to the current period for most major banks. As a consequence, banks are more vulnerable to adverse shocks. We argue for taking a dynamic view of capital that recognizes future profits as a source of capital, and urge approaches to financial regulation supervision that will reliably force rapid capital replenishment in difficult times something that did not take place in the United States in 2008 and is not taking place in Europe today.","[Sarin, Natasha; Summers, Lawrence H.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University,"Sarin, N (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,5,34,38,0,12,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

In a given year about half of all firm-good-country combinations are recorded only once or twice for trade with EU-countries, and this is the case for more than 60 percent of all firm-good-country combinations in trade with non-EU countries. The frequency of recorded transactions tends to decline with an increase in the number of transactions per year. This is in accordance with the presence of per-shipment fixed costs that provide an incentive for trading firms to engage in cross-border transactions infrequently. Empirical models show that for Germany the frequency of transactions at the firm-good-country level tends to decrease with an increase in per-shipment costs when unobserved firm and goods characteristics are controlled for.","[Wagner, Joachim] Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Luneburg, Germany; [Wagner, Joachim] KTH Stockholm, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden",Leuphana University Luneburg; Royal Institute of Technology,"Wagner, J (通讯作者)，Leuphana Univ Lueneburg, Luneburg, Germany.;Wagner, J (通讯作者)，KTH Stockholm, CESIS, Stockholm, Sweden.",wagner@leuphana.de,"Wagner, Joachim/D-8156-2012; Wagner, Joachim/AAF-4949-2020","Wagner, Joachim/0000-0001-6058-4536;",,,,,9,0,0,0,6,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,AUG 30,2016,10.0,,,,,,,,2016-21,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-21,0.0,,,38,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DV7NG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383122500001,0

In this paper we focus on the extent to which key human values and beliefs are shared in society, which captures a dimension of diversity not previously discussed. We assess the importance of value diversity by focusing on its role in fostering generalized trust within societies. We find that value diversity, in particular with regard to political ideological values concerning income redistribution and the role of the government in influencing markets, is important for understanding the international variation in trust, with high diversity being associated with lower levels of trust. This relationship is robust to controlling for various other determinants of trust, including other dimensions of diversity, and holds at various levels of aggregation.

In a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium set-up, heterogeneous banks give rise to an interbank market where government bonds are used as collateral. Government borrowing under limited commitment is costly ex ante as bank funding conditions tighten when the quality of collateral drops. These spillovers, by impeding interbank intermediation, lower the penalty from defaulting due to an interbank freeze during a recession and propagate aggregate shocks to the macroeconomy. The model is calibrated using Greek data and is capable of reproducing stylized facts from the European sovereign debt crisis. In an application, we show that the ECB's non-standard financing operations mitigate the adverse feedback mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, a forward-looking consumer can buy in advance, and thereby mostly undo the impact of the restriction. I study whether time inconsistent consumer preferences can provide a justification for restrictions on alcohol sales time. I estimate a demand model, which allows a fraction of consumers to be time inconsistent, using scanner data of beer purchases and other shopping behavior. According to the estimation results, 16% of regular beer buyers, or only 3% of all consumers, behave as if they are time inconsistent. I find that in terms of consumer welfare, the sales restriction may be welfare improving, but is worse than increasing taxes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Amongst other benefits, the use of such data enables a more precise understanding of the differing attitudes and responses of individual agents such as households to financial shocks. However, some difficulties can arise with the use, in particular, of survey data in this regard. In this paper we calculate measurement error in the house prices recalled by a representative sample of mortgaged Irish households and illustrate the degree of attenuation bias consequently introduced into estimates of housing wealth effects, when recall as opposed to actual house prices are used. Our results suggest that estimates of the housing wealth effect, based on survey data, may be considerably smaller than what is actually the case; amongst other issues, this has significant implications for the perceived contribution of housing market developments to the overall economy.","[McCarthy, Yvonne] Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Dept, POB 11517, Dublin 1, Ireland; [McQuinn, Kieran] ESRI, Whitaker Sq, Dublin 2, Ireland",European Central Bank; Central Bank of Ireland; Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"McCarthy, Y (通讯作者)，Cent Bank Ireland, Financial Stabil Dept, POB 11517, Dublin 1, Ireland.",yvonne.mccarthy@centralbank.ie; kieran.mcquinn@esri.ie,"McQuinn, Kieran/JCE-1122-2023","McQuinn, Kieran/0000-0003-0246-8179",,,,,28,2,2,0,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2016,69.0,3,,,,,492,517,,,,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DY7JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385304700004,0

We show that political leaders who prefer presidentialism may be supported by their own coalition if they fear losing agenda-setting power to another group.

Using a combination of theory and experiments, we examine the effectiveness of renegotiation at solving this problem. Our findings demonstrate that renegotiation is rarely successful at solving the problem of sellers misestimating costs. The primary effect of allowing renegotiation is that it advantages sellers who possess a credible commitment of default should they have underbid the project.

When trading ceases in equilibrium as a response to an adverse shock to asset quality, a government can resurrect trading by buying up lemons which involves a financial loss. The optimal policy is centred around an announcement effect where trading starts already before the intervention for two reasons. First, delaying the intervention allows selling pressure to build up thereby improving the average quality of assets for sale. Secondly, intervening at a higher price increases the return from buying an asset of unknown quality. It is optimal to intervene immediately at the lowest price when the market is sufficiently important. For less important markets, when the shock to quality and search frictions are small, it is optimal to rely on the announcement effect. Here delaying the intervention and fostering the effect by intervening at the highest price tend to be complements.","[Chiu, Jonathan] Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Chiu, Jonathan] Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand; [Koeppl, Thorsten V.] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON K7L 3N6, Canada",Bank of Canada; Victoria University Wellington; Queens University - Canada,"Chiu, J (通讯作者)，Bank Canada, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Chiu, J (通讯作者)，Victoria Univ Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,"Chiu, Jonathan/0000-0002-3276-5927",,,,,30,34,37,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

We are motivated by an apparent shift away from the use of joint liability by microfinance institutions, combined with recent evidence that a) converting joint liability groups to individual-liability groups did not affect repayment rates, and b) an intervention that increased social capital in individual liability borrowing groups led to improved repayment performance. First, we show that individual lending with or without groups may constitute a welfare improvement over joint liability, so long as borrowers have sufficient social capital to sustain mutual insurance. Second, we explore how the lender's lower transaction costs in group lending can encourage insurance by reducing the amount borrowers have to pay to bail one another out. Third, we discuss how group meetings might encourage insurance, either by increasing the incentive to invest in social capital, or because the time spent in meetings can facilitate setting up insurance arrangements. Finally, we perform a simple simulation exercise, evaluating quantitatively the welfare impacts of alternative forms of lending and how they relate to social capital. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The global food price shocks of the 2000s had a much bigger impact on domestic inflation in emerging and developing economies than in advanced economies. This could reflect the smaller share of food in the consumption baskets in advanced economies. We also provide evidence that inflation expectations are more anchored in advanced than in emerging economies, which could also explain the smaller impact on inflation from global food price shocks.","[Furceri, Davide; Loungani, Prakash] IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Furceri, Davide] Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy; [Loungani, Prakash] OCP Policy Ctr, Rabat, Morocco; [Simon, John] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wachter, Susan M.] Univ Penn, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",International Monetary Fund; University of Palermo; Reserve Bank of Australia; University of Pennsylvania,"Furceri, D (通讯作者)，IMF, Washington, DC 20431 USA.;Furceri, D (通讯作者)，Univ Palermo, I-90133 Palermo, Italy.",wachter@wharton.upenn.edu; ploungani@imf.org; simonj@rba.gov.au; wachter@wharton.upenn.edu,"Wachter, Susan/AAW-2226-2020",,,,,,19,17,17,2,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

To this end, prices were used with data of different time frequencies, different periods for calculating moving averages and different time ranges. In global terms, the differences between the yield of these active strategies and those of a passive nature are statistically significant.

We show that government investment can improve an economy's external competitiveness and stimulate private investment. If governments can finance this investment by reducing consumption that, is not complementary to private consumption, then this is ex-ante budget-neutral, provides a small, but persistent stimulus without a deterioration in competitiveness, and leads to lower debt in the medium run. We also examine the cross-border transmission channels of government expenditure shocks in a monetary union when government consumption is complementary to private and public investment is productive. While both assumptions enhance cross-border spillovers, a direct import content is required to generate spillovers similar to those found in the empirical literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

As their jurisdiction often overlaps, victims can choose which judicial system to refer to, which may lead to contradictions between rules and inconsistencies in judgements. In this article, we construct a model representing a dual judicial system and we show that this overlap encourages rent-seeking and bribery and yields to high rates of petty crimes and civil disputes.

A production process can be coordinated ex ante, by letting agents stick to a prespecified plan of action. Alternatively, agents may adapt to task-specific shocks, in which case tasks must be coordinated ex post, using communication. When attention is scarce, an optimal organization coordinates only a few tasks ex post. Those tasks are higher performing, more adaptive to the environment, and influential. Hence, scarce attention requires setting priorities, not just local optimization.

This paper investigates, under controlled conditions, the presence and direction of a possible group size effect in pure public good provision by large heterogeneous groups. Employing subjects drawn from the general population and introducing Internet-based procedures to study this question, we collected experimental evidence from 1110 subjects playing a linear public goods game in groups of 10, 40, and 100 members. We find a positive and significant group size effect: Increasing group size by a factor of 10 (4) increased efficiency by 10 (6) percent. The effect arose at the intensive margin and with repetition. Those who contributed contributed more in larger groups. Larger and smaller groups had similar initial contribution levels, but cooperation rates declined more slowly in the larger groups. Free-riding was invariant to group size, despite subjects' persistent beliefs of a negative group size effect at the extensive margin. Further econometric examination of the data supports these findings and provides starting points for future theoretical and experimental research on the group size effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We build a quantitative theory of fertility, labor supply, and human capital accumulation decisions to measure gender differences in human capital investments over the life cycle. We assume that there are no gender differences in the human capital technology and calibrate this technology using wage-age profiles of men. The calibration of females assumes that children involves a forced reduction in hours of work that falls on females rather than on males and that there is an exogenous gender gap in hours of work. We find that our theory accounts for all of the increase in the gender wage gap over the life cycle in the NLSY79 data. The impact of children on the labor supply of females accounts for 56% and 45% of the increase in the gender wage gap over the life cycle among non-college and college females, while the rest is due to the exogenous gender differences in hours of work.

However, this objective needs to be balanced against another-maintaining its share in key markets and maximizing long-term revenue-given the massive size of Saudi Arabia's reserves. The trade-off between these two objectives tends to change over time, depending on market conditions, the nature of the shock, and the behaviour of other producers; Saudi Arabia's oil policy is hence not constant. We argue that the advent of US shale has made the calculus of the trade-off more uncertain, complicating Saudi Arabia's output decision. Using a simple game, we show that, under uncertainty, it is always safer for the Kingdom to assume that the shale oil supply is highly elastic, and thus decide not to cut output. But as Saudi Arabia learns more about this new source of supply, its policy could adapt accordingly. The fact that Saudi Arabia's oil policy could change as the trade-off between revenue maximization and market share evolves, and as new information to the market arrives, will keep the market second guessing and will continue to shape market expectations and to influence market outcomes.","[Fattouh, Bassam; Poudineh, Rahmatallah; Sen, Anupama] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England; [Fattouh, Bassam] SOAS, Dept Financial & Management Studies, Oxford, England",University of Oxford,"Fattouh, B; Poudineh, R; Sen, A (通讯作者)，Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England.;Fattouh, B (通讯作者)，SOAS, Dept Financial & Management Studies, Oxford, England.",bassam.fattouh@oxfordenergy.org; rahmat.poudineh@oxfordenergy.org; anupama.sen@oxfordenergy.org,,"Poudineh, Rahmatallah/0000-0003-1894-5187",,,,,32,14,18,0,16,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

In so doing, new analytical expressions for the elasticity of tax revenue to tax rates are derived taking into account global and schedular income taxes in the presence of non-standard allowances. Based on these new analytical elasticities the implicit Laffer curve is characterised and explored in detail. Calculations are performed for the individual taxpayer and the aggregate population. When applied to microdata, the model permits us to locate individually the position of every taxpayer on the entire range of the Laffer curve as well as to characterise the representative aggregate Laffer curve. The utility of the model to forecast revenue is illustrated by applying it to Spanish personal income tax. The model confirms that the Laffer curve is essentially an intrinsic individual matter although a virtual aggregate Laffer curve for the whole population can be inferred. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These scores reflect nontrivial decisions about how to measure and scale student achievement, with important implications for secondary analyses. For example, the scores computed in several major testing regimes, including the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), depend not only on the examinees' responses to test items, but also on their background characteristics, including race and gender. As a consequence, if a black and white student respond identically to questions on the NAEP assessment, the reported ability for the black student will be lower than for the white student-reflecting the lower average performance of black students. This can bias many secondary analyses. Other assessments use different measurement models. This paper aims to familiarize applied economists with the construction and properties of common cognitive score measures and the implications for research using these measures.","[Jacob, Brian] Univ Michigan, Educ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jacob, Brian] Univ Michigan, Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Jacob, Brian] Univ Michigan, Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA; [Rothstein, Jesse] Univ Calif Berkeley, Publ Policy & Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Rothstein, Jesse] Univ Calif Berkeley, IRLE, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Jacob, Brian; Rothstein, Jesse] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Jacob, B (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Educ Policy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Jacob, B (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Econ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Jacob, B (通讯作者)，Univ Michigan, Educ, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.;Jacob, B (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",bajacob@umich.edu; rothstein@berkeley.edu,,"Rothstein, Jesse/0000-0001-6140-0858",,,,,40,42,58,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

The effectiveness of fiscal stimulus depends on the duration and the expected duration of the zero-lower-bound regime. Most studies fix this duration and therefore suffer from a bias. In this paper, we propose a way to estimate the government spending multiplier that allows this duration to be endogenously determined. Specifically, we incorporate into the Smets and Wouters (2007) model a monetary policy reaction function that follows a two-state Markov-switching process, and use data to pin down the transitional probability from one policy regime to the other. We then estimate the model and compute the fiscal multiplier using a data set that spans 1985:2-2015:3. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The model predicts that the participation rate should increase with the player's observed strength, and the total awarded prize amount. Furthermore, under certain conditions self-selection implies that participants with high observed strength levels have smaller expected strength-shocks than those with low levels. Consequently, the latter should play better than predicted and the former worse (given their observed strength). These predictions are confronted with data from a large and high-prize chess tournament held in the USA. This tournament is divided into different sections, with players being able to play in the section to which their current chess rating (observed strength) belongs. As predicted, we find that within each section the participation probability increases with chess rating and prize amounts, and players with a relatively low (resp. high) rating are indeed the ones who have a better (resp. worse) relative performance.

With that purpose in mind, we obtain the time-varying correlation by cDCC modeling using ARX-APARCH filtered returns. The analysis shows that the rating changes do not have a significant effect on the correlations in general. After testing for robustness, we reveal that an upgrade to an investment grade level for a country is more likely to positively diversify it from others in the region instead of creating a common positive regional investment environment. Results have important implications for investors and policymakers.","[Sensoy, Ahmet] Borsa Istanbul, Res & Business Dev Dept, Istanbul, Turkey",Borsa Istanbul; Ministry of Finance - Turkey,"Sensoy, A (通讯作者)，Borsa Istanbul, Res & Business Dev Dept, Istanbul, Turkey.",ahmet.sensoy@borsaistanbul.com,"Sensoy, Ahmet/ABV-1043-2022","Sensoy, Ahmet/0000-0001-7967-5171",,,,,33,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Taking theater to be a social practice, this analysis of a corpus of plays created between 1990 and 2013 focuses on their presentation of events, the response of the public, the social changes advocated on stage and the actual effects. Theater allows not only for passing historical information and comparing the divergent opinions of Germans and Czech but also for lifting the issue to a higher level, such as the history of humanity. By intentionally recreating events on stage, theater can present novel thoughts about how to contextualize narratives about the German past.","[Spalova, Barbora] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci Sociales, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Spalová, B (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci Sociales, Inst Sociol, Prague, Czech Republic.",b.spalova@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,4,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.
