Here a technique based on mixture models is proposed for surmounting these problems by determining the number of classes in a population and estimating the probability that an agent belongs to a particular class. All of the familiar statistics for describing the classes remain available and the possibility of studying the correlates of class membership is raised. As a substantive illustration we analyze household income in Urban China in the last decade of the 20th Century. Four income groups are classified and the progress of those poor, lower middle, upper middle and rich classes are related to household and regional characteristics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our preferred specifications show that older adult smokers respond modestly to tax increases: a $1.00 (131.6%) tax increase leads to a 3.8-5.2% reduction in cigarettes smoked per day (implied tax elasticity=-0.03 to -0.04). We identify heterogeneity in tax elasticity across demographic groups as defined by sex, race/ethnicity, education, and marital status and by smoking intensity and level of addictive stock.

While bilateral negotiations take place through a sequence of offers and counteroffers, the bargaining order is exogenously given. We solve for the conditions under which (a) the buyer prefers to negotiate with the lower-valuation seller first and (b) efficient (inefficient) outcomes emerge for the two bargaining orders. We find that the buyer prefers to negotiate with the lower-valuation seller first whenever the players are relatively impatient or the sellers are sufficiently heterogeneous. We show that there exists a unique efficient outcome when the buyer negotiates first with the lower-valuation seller and the sellers are sufficiently heterogeneous; however, significant delay in reaching agreements may arise when they are not. In case the buyer bargains with the higher-valuation seller first, an inefficient outcome is shown to exist even when players are extremely impatient. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Five years after the interventions were discontinued, we remeasured the quality of care of the doctors.

This heterogeneity breaks down the separation of the relationship between providers and the health insurer and the relationship between consumers and the insurer. Both experimental and market evidence for a high degree of heterogeneity are presented. Given heterogeneity, a uniform policy fails to effectively control moral hazard, while incentives for risk selection created by community rating cannot be neutralized through risk adjustment. Consumer heterogeneity spills over into relationships with providers, such that a uniform contract with providers also cannot be optimal. The decisive condition for ensuring optimality of provider payment is to replace community rating (which violates the principle of marginal cost pricing) with risk rating of contributions combined with sub-sidization targeted at high risks with low incomes.","[Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; [Frech, H.

We introduce maximum irreversible matchings and consider almost stable matchings (Abraham et al., 2006) and maximum stable matchings (Tan 1990, 1991b). These solution concepts are all core consistent. We find that almost stable matchings are incompatible with the other two concepts. Hence, to solve the roommate problem we propose matchings that lie at the intersection of the maximum irreversible matchings and maximum stable matchings, which we call Q-stable matchings. We construct an efficient algorithm for computing one element of this set for any roommate problem. We also show that the outcome of our algorithm always belongs to an absorbing set (Inarra et al., 2013). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: This retrospective analysis included all patients with T3 MMR-P stage II colon cancer (Clalit Health Services members) with Recurrence Score results (time frame January 2011 to May 2012). Treatment recommendations pretesting were compared with the treatments received. Changes were categorized as decreased (to observation alone/removing oxaliplatin from the therapy) or increased (from observation alone/adding oxaliplatin to the therapy) intensity. Results: The analysis included 269 patients; 58%, 32%, and 10% of the values were in the low (<30), intermediate (30-40), and high (>= 41) score groups, respectively. In 102 patients (38%), treatment changed post-testing (decreased/increased intensity 76/26 patients). The overall impact was decreased chemotherapy use (45.0% to 27.9%; P < 0.001). Treatment changes occurred in all score groups, but more frequently in the high (change rate 63.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 42.3%-80.6%) than in the intermediate (30.6%; 95% CI 21.0%-41.5%) and low (37.6%; 95% CI 30.0%-45.7%) score groups. The direction of the change was consistent with the assay result, with increased intensity more common in higher score values and decreased intensity more common in lower score values. Conclusions: Testing significantly affected adjuvant treatment in T3 MMR-P stage II colon cancer in clinical practice. The study is limited by its design, which compared treatment recommendations pretesting to actual treatments received post -testing, lack of a control group, and non-assessment of confounding factors that may have affected treatment decisions.

All conditions tested, it was concluded that preliminary cost per hectare of grape mechanical harvesting is lower than the cost per hectare of manual harvesting and vineyard areas plausible mechanical harvesting exceeding 41.92 ha, justify the use of the collection system grape mechanics.","[Domingues, Fabricio] Miolo Wine Grp Vitivinicultura LTDA, Est Municipal Livratnento Passo Cruz S-N, BR-97573970 Santana Livratnento, RS, Brazil; [del Aquila, Juan Saavedra] Univ Fed Pampa UNIPAMPA, Campus Dom Pedrito Curso Bacharelado Enol, BR-96450000 Dom Pedrito, RS, Brazil; [Domingues, Fabricio] Miolo Wine Grp Vitivinicultura LTDA, Est Municipal Livratnento Passo Cruz S-N, BR-97573970 Santana Do Livratnento, RS, Brazil; [del Aquila, Juan Saavedra] Univ Fed Pampa UNIPAMPA, Curso Bacharelado Enol, Campus Dom Pedrito,Rua Vinte & Abril 80, BR-96450000 Dom Pedrito, RS, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Pampa; Universidade Federal do Pampa,"Domingues, F (通讯作者)，Miolo Wine Grp Vitivinicultura LTDA, Est Municipal Livratnento Passo Cruz S-N, BR-97573970 Santana Livratnento, RS, Brazil.;Domingues, F (通讯作者)，Miolo Wine Grp Vitivinicultura LTDA, Est Municipal Livratnento Passo Cruz S-N, BR-97573970 Santana Do Livratnento, RS, Brazil.",Fabricio.domingues@miolo.com.br; juanaguila@unipampa.edu.br,,,,,,,9,4,5,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1023.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701023,0.0,,,2,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700023,0

The existence of speculators serves to constrain the feasible set of prices that can result from producers' output game in each period. Absent speculation, producers play a repeated Cournot game with random demand. With speculative inventories possible, the game becomes a dynamic one in which speculative stocks are a state variable which firms can control via their influence on price. We employ collocation methods to find the unknown expected price and value functions required for computation of equilibrium quantities. We demonstrate that strategic considerations result in an incentive to sell to speculators that is non-monotonic in the number of producers: speculation has the largest effect on equilibrium prices and welfare for market structures intermediate between monopoly and perfect competition. Using a computed example, we demonstrate that the effect of speculative storage on the average price level can be substantial, even though the effects on social welfare can be ambiguous.","[Mitraille, Sebastien] Univ Toulouse, Toulouse Business Sch, 20 Bd Lascrosses, F-31000 Toulouse, France; [Thille, Henry] Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada",Universite Federale Toulouse Midi-Pyrenees (ComUE); Universite de Toulouse; TBS Education; University of Guelph,"Thille, H (通讯作者)，Univ Guelph, Dept Econ & Finance, 50 Stone Rd East, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.",s.mitraille@tbs-education.fr; hthille@uoguelph.ca,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,0,BIRKHAUSER BOSTON,CAMBRIDGE,"675 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139-2333 USA",,,978-3-319-28014-1; 978-3-319-28012-7,ANN INT SOC DYN GAME,,,2016,14.0,,,,,,229,248,,10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_11,0.0,,,20,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6CK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389946800011,0

The aim of this work was the collection of scientific studies performed in humans to assess critically the health-promoting effects of raisins, as a part of the normal/Mediterranean diet. In most cases, the beneficial effects of raisins have been assessed in intervention studies focused on cardiovascular area, diabetes and oral health, where a decrease in postprandial glycemia and insulinemia both in diabetic and healthy subjects has been observed. The positive effects were generally evident after a short-term consumption of about 70 g/die of raisins in comparison to a similar quantity of snacks or glucose solution. Surprisingly, some positive findings were shown in oral health. On these bases several findings support the suitability of raisins as a source of healthy compounds for human diet, but limits in the data published till now clearly support the need of new specifically designed trials.","[Restani, Patrizia; Frigerio, Gianfranco; Colombo, Francesca] Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Farmacol & Biomol, Via Balzaretti 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [de Sousa, Luis Peres] Inst Politecn Beja, Rua Pedro Soares,Apartado 6155, P-7800295 Beja, Portugal; [Altindisli, Ahmet] Ege Univ, Dept Agr, TR-15100 Izmir, Turkey; [Pastor, Raul Francisco] Univ Buenos Aires, Hosp Clin Jose de San Martin, Cuarta Catedra Med Interna, Av Cordoba 2351, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Milan; Instituto Politecnico de Beja; Ege University; University of Buenos Aires,"Restani, P (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, Dipartimento Sci Farmacol & Biomol, Via Balzaretti 9, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",,"Colombo, Francesca/HNR-9027-2023; Frigerio, Gianfranco/GSN-3033-2022","Frigerio, Gianfranco/0000-0002-3538-1443; Colombo, Francesca/0000-0002-8099-0192",,,,,19,9,9,0,4,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,4005.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160704005,0.0,,,6,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700113,0

Depending on the model's parameters, the stopping time for thinning grapes is reached sooner or later. After the stopping time, grape quantity evolves solely according to natural decay.

Objective: The objective was to summarize the evidence base on SSI health utility values reported in patient-level studies and decision models. Methods: A systematic review of SSI utility values reported in patient-level and decision modeling studies was carried out. Studies in which utility values for SSI were either invoked (e.g., model-based economic evaluations) or elicited (e.g., valuation exercises), or at least one non-preference-based instrument was administered to patients with SSI after open surgery were included. Mapping algorithms were used, where appropriate, to calculate utilities from primary data. Results were summarized narratively, and the quality of the utility values used in the included modeling studies was assessed. Results: Of 6552 records identified in the database search, 28 studies were included in the review: 19 model-based economic evaluations and 9 patient-level studies. SSI utility decrements ranged from 0.04 to 0.48, of which 19 ranged from 0.1 to 0.3. SSI utility decrements could be calculated for three patient-level studies, and their values ranged from 0.05 (7 days postoperatively) to 0.124 (1 year postoperatively). In most modeling studies, SSI utilities were informed by authors' assumptions or by secondary sources. Conclusions: SSI may substantially affect patients' health utility and needs to be considered when modeling decision problems in surgery. The evidence base for SSI utilities is of questionable quality and skewed toward orthopedic surgery.

Our objective was to evaluate hypothetical interventions seeking to improve retention-in-care (RIC) for HIV infected patients in East Africa, asking whether they could offer favorable value compared to earlier ART initiation. Methods: We used a micro-simulation model to analyze two RIC focused strategies within an East African HIV treatment program-risk reduction, defined as intervention(s) that decrease the risk of attrition from care; and outreach, defined as interventions that find patients and relink them with care. We compared this to earlier ART treatment as a measure of the potential health benefits forgone (e.g., opportunity cost). Results: Reducing attrition by 40% at an average cost of $10 per person remains a less efficient use of resources compared to ensuring full access to ART (cost- effectiveness ratio $1300 vs $3700) for ART eligible patients. An outreach intervention had limited clinical benefit in our simulation. If intervention costs are <$10 per person, however, an intervention able to achieve a 40% (or greater) reduction in attrition may be a cost-effective next implementation option following implementation of earlier ART treatment. Conclusions: Our results suggest that programs should consider retention focused programs once they have already achieved high degrees of ART coverage among eligible patients. It is important that decision makers understand the epidemiology and associated outcomes of those patients who are classified as lost to follow up in their systems prior to implementation in order to achieve the highest value.","[Kessler, Jason; Nucifora, Kimberly; Li, Lingfeng; Uhler, Lauren; Braithwaite, Scott] NYU, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth, 550 First Ave,VZ30,6th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA",New York University,"Kessler, J (通讯作者)，NYU, Sch Med, Dept Populat Hlth, 550 First Ave,VZ30,6th Floor, New York, NY 10016 USA.",Jason.Kessler@nyumc.org,,"Braithwaite, Ronald Scott/0000-0001-7067-3655",NIAAA [1R01AA017385-01]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [1R01 AI099970-01],NIAAA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)); National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID)),This study was supported by the NIAAA (grant no. 1R01AA017385-01) (computer simulation of HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant no. 1R01 AI099970-01) (implementation science to optimize HIV prevention in East Africa).,,56,11,12,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,946,955,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.09.2940,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686778.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500002,0

The University of Birmingham and Brunel University, acting as a consortium, was commissioned to act as an External Assessment Centre (EAC) for NICE, independently appraising the submission. This article is an overview of the original evidence submitted, the EAC's findings and the final NICE guidance issued. The sponsor submitted a simple cost analysis to estimate the costs of using Debrisoft (R) to debride wounds compared with saline and gauze, hydrogel and larvae. Separate analyses were conducted for applications in home and applications in a clinic setting. The analysis took an UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. It incorporated the costs of the technologies and supplementary technologies (such as dressings) and the costs of their application by a district nurse. The sponsor concluded that Debrisoft (R) was cost saving relative to the comparators. The EAC made amendments to the sponsor analysis to correct for errors and to reflect alternative assumptions. Debrisoft (R) remained cost saving in most analyses and savings ranged from 77 pound to 222 pound per patient compared with hydrogel, from 97 pound to 347 pound compared with saline and gauze, and from 180 pound to 484 pound compared with larvae depending on the assumptions included in the analysis and whether debridement took place in a home or clinic setting. All analyses were severely limited by the available data on effectiveness, in particular a lack of comparative studies and that the effectiveness data for the comparators came from studies reporting different clinical endpoints compared with Debrisoft (R). The Medical Technologies Advisory Committee made a positive recommendation for adoption of Debrisoft (R) and this has been published as a NICE medical technology guidance (MTG17).","[Meads, Catherine; Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Lovato, Eleonora] IMS Hlth, London N1 9JY, England",Brunel University,"Meads, C (通讯作者)，Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England.",catherine.meads@brunel.ac.uk,,"Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Meads, Catherine/0000-0002-2368-0665",,,,,44,12,14,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Small quantities of cannabis can be bought in cannabis shops. We investigate how the distance to the nearest cannabis shop affects the age of onset of cannabis use. We use a mixed proportional hazard rate framework to take account of observable as well as unobservable characteristics that influence the uptake of cannabis. We find that distance matters. Individuals who grow up within 20km of a cannabis shop have a lower age of onset.

It proposes a nonparametric method to estimate labor supply with nonconvex piecewise-linear budget sets. Different from previous literature such as Blomquist and Newey (2002) and Soest, Das, and Gong (2002), our method focuses on a nonparametric specification of an indirect utility function. We find that working with the indirect utility function is very useful in simultaneously addressing the labor supply problems with nonconvex budget sets, unobserved heterogeneity, labor nonparticipation, and measurement errors in working hours that previous literature was unable to account for. Further, two methods are developed to calculate exact welfare effects due to reforms of a nonlinear tax system. This paper also includes applications to the 1986 tax reform and 2001 Bush tax cut.

This paper uses household scanner data to propose an ex-ante evaluation and comparison of these two policy options for the fromage blanc and dessert yogurt market. In most markets, labelling is voluntary and firms display fat labels only on the FOP of low-fat products to target consumers who do not want to eat fat. We here separately identify consumer preferences for fat and for FOP fat labels by exploiting an exogenous difference in legal labelling requirements between these two product categories. Estimates of demand curves are combined with a supply model of oligopolistic price competition to simulate policies. We find that a feasible ad valorem fat tax dominates a mandatory FOP-label policy from an economic perspective, but both are equally effective in reducing average fat purchases.

Methods: A health economic model was developed on the basis of results from a systematic literature review and meta analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of MIS compared with OS for lumbar spinal fusion. The analysis was conducted from a health care payer perspective. Parameters included in the model were surgery, blood loss, duration of hospitalization, postoperative complications, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Cost-effectiveness was determined by the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained. Results: MIS was the dominant strategy compared with OS (i.e., yielding both cost savings and improved HRQOL). Cost savings were driven mainly by shorter length of hospital stay, reduced blood loss, and fewer complications such as surgical site infection. The total cost saving per procedure was 973 for Italy and 1666 for the United Kingdom, with an improvement of 0.04 quality-adjusted life-year over 2 years in HROOL. One-way sensitivity analyses and predefined scenario(s) analyses confirmed the robustness of the model. Conclusions: MIS is a less expensive and a more effective treatment compared with OS for spinal lumbar fusion in both Italy and the United Kingdom. Lower downstream costs and increased HRQOL in the MIS group compensate for potential higher upfront costs of MIS implants and surgery equipment.","[Vertuani, Simona; Nilsson, Jonas] OptumInsight, Stockholm, Sweden; [Borgman, Benny] Spine & Biol Medtron Int Trading SARL, Tolochenaz, Switzerland; [Buseghin, Giorgio] Medtron Italy, Hlth Econ & Reimbursement, Milan, Italy; [Leonard, Catherine] Medtron Ltd UK, Watford, England; [Assietti, Roberto] AO Fatebenefratelli & Oftalm, Div Neurosurg, Milan, Italy; [Quraishi, Nasir A.] Ctr Spinal Studies & Surg, Nottingham, England",Optum,"Vertuani, S (通讯作者)，Klarabergsviadukten 90 D, S-11164 Stockholm, Sweden.",simona.vertuani@optum.com,,,Medtronic International,Medtronic International(Medtronic),This study was sponsored by Medtronic International.,,32,38,40,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP,2015,18.0,6.0,,,,,810,816,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CU4EN,26409608.0,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000363479800010,0

We propose a very general and fully analytical option pricing framework, encompassing a wide class of discrete time models featuring multiple-component structure in both volatility and leverage, and a flexible pricing kernel with multiple risk premia. Although the proposed framework is general enough to include either GARCH-type volatility, Realized Volatility or a combination of the two, in this paper we focus on realized volatility option pricing models by extending the Heterogeneous Autoregressive Gamma (HARG) model of Corsi et al. (2013) to incorporate heterogeneous leverage structures with multiple components, while preserving closed-form solutions for option prices. Applying our analytically tractable asymmetric HARG model to a large sample of S&P 500 index options, we demonstrate its superior ability to price out-of-the-money options compared to existing benchmarks.

Methods: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomized controlled trial of 75 children aged 4 to 13 years who presented with a burn to the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. Participants were randomized to either the Ditto intervention (n = 35) or standard practice (n = 40) to measure the effect of the intervention on days taken for burns to re-epithelialize. Direct medical, direct nonmedical, and indirect cost data during burn re-epithelialization were extracted from the randomized controlled trial data and combined with scar management cost data obtained retrospectively from medical charts. Nonparametric bootstrapping was used to estimate statistical uncertainty in cost and effect differences and cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: On average, the Ditto intervention reduced the time to re-epithelialize by 3 days at AD$194 less cost for each patient compared with standard practice. The incremental cost-effectiveness plane showed that 78% of the simulated results were within the more effective and less costly quadrant and 22% were in the more effective and more costly quadrant, suggesting a 78% probability that the Ditto intervention dominates standard practice (i.e., cost saving). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$120, there is a 95% probability that the Ditto intervention is cost-effective (or cost-saving) against standard care. Conclusions: This economic evaluation showed the Ditto intervention to be highly cost-effective against standard practice at a minimal cost for the significant benefits gained, supporting the implementation of the Ditto intervention during burn wound care.

The spatial aspect can be interpreted quite generally, in either a geographical sense, or employing notions of economic distance, or when parametric modelling arises in part from a common factor or other structure. In the former case, observations may be regularly-spaced across one or more dimensions, as is typical with much spatio-temporal data, or irregularly-spaced across all dimensions; both isotropic models and non-isotropic models can be considered, and a wide variety of correlation structures. In the second case, models involving spatial weight matrices are covered, such as spatial autoregressive models. The setting is sufficiently general to potentially cover other parametric structures such as certain factor models, and vector-valued observations, and here our preliminary asymptotic theory for parameter estimates is of some independent value. The test statistic is based on a Gaussian pseudo-likelihood ratio, and is shown to have an asymptotic standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis that one of the two models is correct; this limit theory rests strongly on a central limit theorem for the Gaussian pseudo-maximum likelihood parameter estimates. A small Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included. (C) 2015 The Authors.

This paper focuses on a situation where the model does not admit such additive errors so that the popular method of GHK or logit estimation is not applicable. This paper proposes a new method of simulated likelihood that is free from simulation bias for each finite number of simulations, and yet flexible enough to accommodate various model specifications beyond those of additive normal or logit errors. The method begins with the likelihood function involving simulated frequencies and finds a transform of the likelihood function that identifies the true parameter for each finite simulation number. The transform is explicit, containing no unknowns that demand an additional step of estimation. The estimator achieves the efficiency of MLE when the simulation number increases fast enough. This paper presents and discusses results from Monte Carlo simulation studies of the new method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Those methods rely on various factor models which all are particular cases of the Generalized Dynamic Factor Model (GDFM) introduced in Forniet al. (2000). That paper, however, rests on Brillinger's dynamic principal components. The corresponding estimators are two-sided filters whose performance at the end of the observation period or for forecasting purposes is rather poor. No such problem arises with estimators based on standard principal components, which have been dominant in this literature. On the other hand, those estimators require the assumption that the space spanned by the factors has finite dimension. In the present paper, we argue that such an assumption is extremely restrictive and potentially quite harmful. Elaborating upon recent results by Anderson and Deistler (2008a, b) on singular stationary processes with rational spectrum, we obtain one-sided representations for the GDFM without assuming finite dimension of the factor space. Construction of the corresponding estimators is also briefly outlined. In a companion paper, we establish consistency and rates for such estimators, and provide Monte Carlo results further motivating our approach.

From a service value perspective, this study extends the theoretical model to explore the personalization privacy paradox on the intention to adopt IT-enabled personalization based on social contract theory and rational choice theory.

Because of the fundamental link between health insurance and employment in the U.S., such policies may effect the labor supply decisions of young adults. Although the interaction between labor supply and health insurance has been extensively studied for other subpopulations, little is known about the role of health insurance in the labor supply decisions of young adults. I use the variation from the implementation and changes in state policies that expanded dependent health insurance coverage to examine how young adults adjusted their labor supply when they were able to be covered as a dependent on their parent's plan. I find that these state mandates led to a decrease in labor supply on the intensive margin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Will the game companies continuously be benefitted from the increasing of hardcore garners? In this paper, we address these questions by an empirical study using data collected from a game company. The result indicates the increasing of hardcore garners in the game would bring positive effect to the company, but harm it when the number exceeds a certain threshold.

Scenarios and respective policy interventions take into account that sustainable futures of Zakynthos island have to be explored both at the: macro-level, seeking the development of an environmentally responsible, spatially balanced tourist sector; and the micro-level, seeking an environmentally responsible tourist infrastructure deployment.","[Kapsaski, E.; Panagiotopoulou, M.; Stratigea, A.] Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Heroon Polytech 9,Zographou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece",National Technical University of Athens,"Stratigea, A (通讯作者)，Natl Tech Univ Athens, Dept Geog & Reg Planning, Sch Rural & Surveying Engn, Heroon Polytech 9,Zographou Campus, Athens 15780, Greece.",venia_kaps@hotmail.com; mapanagiot@yahoo.gr; stratige@central.ntua.gr,"STRATIGEA, ANASTASIA/AAN-4046-2021","Panagiotopoulou, Maria/0000-0003-4016-5486; STRATIGEA, ANASTASIA/0000-0002-8354-1317",,,,,17,0,0,0,0,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-15859-4; 978-3-319-15858-7,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,352,371,,10.1007/978-3-319-15859-4_30,0.0,,,20,"Business; Cultural Studies; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Cultural Studies; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF1CF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380358000029,0

Then the anchor point was found in the upper-left corner of the resistor. Band areas were extracted according to the anchor point. In situations where band areas were found, proposed algorithm recognized defects in terms of the number of band contours and the times from black to white in each pixel-width line. Depending on the above results, PLC controls the motion of the relay, implementing the classification of qualified resistors and defective resistors. The system was tested to detect defects in different surroundings and showed a success rate of more than 95%.

Its content in plants depends on its content in the soil. Its adequate intake may decide about the health, production and reproduction of the livestock. One of the possible ways to enrich feed ration of this element may be the foliar application. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of foliar application of selenium in different forms and doses on the antioxidant glutathione content in the forage of perennial ryegrass. In the experiment, perennial ryegrass (Ahoj variety) was included. The experiment took place in climabox. For foliar application, the solutions of selenium at the doses of 2; 4 and 20 mg.m(-2) of Se were used. As a source of selenium, selenite sodium or selenate was applied. After the application, the samples of green mass of each group were sampled at a regular 14 day intervals (14th day, 28th day and 42nd day after the application). The determinations of GSH and GSSG were performed by HPLC-ED. The foliar application of selenate and selenite increased the content of glutathione (GSH and GSSG) in aboveground mass of perennial ryegrass. The increase (P<0.05) of GSH content after foliar application of selenate was observed after all doses of selenium throughout the experiment. Between the doses there were no differences (P<0.05). The application of selenate caused the increase of GSSG (P< 0.05), but it was evident especially in the first 28 days after application. After application of selenite the content of GSH increased (P< 0.05). It was observed after application of the doses 4 and 20 mg.m(-2) in every term of sampling. The application of selenite increased (P< 0.05) the content of GSSG. It increased after each used dose and term of sampling except 42nd day, when it decreased on the level of the control group. Due to the increase of both forms of glutathione can be assumed that the application of selenium on plants acts as a stress factor.","[Klusonova, Iva; Skladanka, Jiri; Hodulikova, Lucia] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Skarpa, Petr] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agrochem Soil Sci Microbiol & Plant Nutr, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Adam, Vojtech] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Klusonova, I (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Anim Nutr & Forage Prod, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",iva.klusonova@mendelu.cz,"Skladanka, Jiri/I-6115-2018; Caslavova, Iva/P-9401-2018; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Skarpa, Petr/K-7785-2018","Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Skarpa, Petr/0000-0003-3189-1726; Skladanka, Jiri/0000-0002-7179-7606; Caslavova, Iva/0000-0002-0330-3942",,,,,27,3,3,0,7,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,131,136,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100024,0

Monuments are one of the elements of cultural heritage that were constructed to help maintain memory by stating historical events of important turning points either in history or in culture. They are pieces of art which express cultural opinions, values, ideas and religious beliefs political ideas, practices, traditions and institutions of a social group. They are signs of people and their culture and history. There can be two ways to approach a monument: (a) as viewer, (b) as tourist. In both cases, people usually remain at superficial level without seeking the deeper meaning and symbolism of cultural elements. An inter-cultural approach of a monument can take place at three levels: (1) cognitive, (2) sentimental, (3) Action.

Measurement properties of these instruments have not yet been directly compared. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the test-retest reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of the three-level EQ-513 (EQ-5D-3L), ICECAP-O, and ASCOT in frail older adults living at home. Methods: Cross-sectional data and longitudinal data were used. Parameters for reliability (the intraclass correlation coefficient) and agreement (standard error of measurement) were used to assess test-retest reliability after 1 week. We formulated hypotheses about correlations with other measures and tested these to assess construct validity and responsiveness (longitudinal validity). Results: The reliability parameters for all three scales were considered good (intraclass correlation coefficient values above 0.70). Standard error of measurement values were less than 10% of the scale. Hypotheses regarding construct validity were in general accepted; the EQ-5D-3L was more strongly associated with physical limitations than were ICECAP-O and ASCOT and less strongly with instruments measuring aspects beyond health. Longitudinally, as hypothesized, mental health was most strongly associated with ICECAP-O, and self-perceived QOL, mastery, and client-centeredness of home care most strongly with ASCOT. Conclusions: Our findings support the adoption of ICECAP-O and AscoT as outcome measures in economic evaluations of care interventions for older adults that have a broader aim than health-related QOL because they are at least as reliable as the EQ-5D-3L and are associated with aspects of QOL broader than health.

Three organic acids (EDTA, DTPA, NTA) were used as zinc carriers. 24 female rats were employed in this study. The rats were divided into 5 groups: 6 received intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL 40 mM Zn-EDTA (group E), 6 received intraperitoneal injection of 2 mL 40 mM Zn-DTPA (group D), 6 rats received intraperitoneal injection of 40 mM 2 mL Zn-NTA (group N), 3 rats received 2 mL of normal saline (group K4-6) and 3 rats (group K1-3 for control) were intact. On the day after injection all rats were sacrificed and peritoneal lavages were performed and cell viability analysis was done. The macrophages were divided in two morphologically different groups group of smaller monocytes-like macrophages (ML) with kidney-shaped nuclei and pseudopodia on their surface, and a group of macrophages with spherical nuclei and many vacuoles in the cytoplasm (vacuolized macrophages, VM). Apoptosis of ML macrophages of the peritoneum in rats administrated with Zn-DTPA was almost similar to apoptosis of cells in intact animals. This means that properties of this chelate are very close to homeostasis of rats' abdominal cavity. The apoptosis significantly increased in group E compared to K1-3. There was a significant difference between groups K1-3 and K4-6. As for necrosis the values for K1-3 and Zn-DTPA are again very close. The most damage of cells was caused by Zn-EDTA chelate. Apoptosis of vacuolized macrophages was significantly higher in groups K4-6, E and N. Necrosis of vacuolized macrophages was significantly higher in groups K4-6 and N. The Zn-DTPA chelate looks to be the mildest carrier for Zn into the organism. The present study showed that the zinc-organics acid chelates are not toxic or irritating tissues after being injected into rat's abdomen. The Zn-DTPA had the smallest influence to the peritoneal macrophages.","[Vavrova, Eva; Sladek, Zbysek] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Morphol Physiol & Anim Genet, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Kopel, Pavel; Kominkova, Marketa; Adam, Vojtech] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Vavrova, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Morphol Physiol & Anim Genet, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",eva.vavrova.umfgz@mendelu.cz,"Sládek, Zbyšek/J-2703-2018; Kominkova, Marketa/D-2297-2013; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012","Sládek, Zbyšek/0000-0002-9268-4811; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544",,,,,11,0,0,0,3,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,600,603,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100113,0

The heavy metal mobility has been evaluated by the BCR Sequential Extraction Procedure. The Index of Geoaccumulation (I-geo) reported that the study area rang among uncontaminated or moderately contaminated by heavy metals. According to the Coefficient of Industrial Pollution (CIP) the soils are medium contaminated. The BCR method proved that lead and zinc are the most mobile elements under reducible conditions in the natural background soils, otherwise in the soils of excepted contaminated site, heavy metals have been mostly held in residual fraction.

We find that the sign and magnitude of the forecast news are both associated with management forecast bias. Specifically, the probability of issuing an optimistic forecast is greater for bad news than for good news and is increasing in the magnitude of the forecast news. We also find that mandatory management forecasts are less likely to be optimistically biased than voluntary management forecasts. Moreover, when regressing management forecast bias on the forecast news using mandatory management forecasts and voluntary management forecasts respectively, we find that the positive association between management forecast bias and the magnitude of the forecast news is only significant under the mandatory disclosure regime. The results indicate that managers are more sensitive to forecast news under the mandatory disclosure regime.

More and more firms prefer external heterogeneity resources to remedy resource endowment and capability structural defects. The study focuses on the questions of whether or not the boundary-spanning search (BSS) affects the organizational ambidexterity capacity (OAC) and how it is influenced. Based on the sampling investigation of 338 firms in China, we use structural equation model to explore influential mechanisms of BSS behaviors on the OAC. The main results are shown as following: First, the BSS behavior of firms can be divided into two dimensions--organizational and technological boundary spanning--which can be further divided into 1) technology-driven and market-driven BSS, 2) generic technology-oriented and product technology-oriented BSS. Secondly, the different dimensions have variant influences on OAC. Technology-driven and generic technology-oriented BSS have positive influences on exploratory capabilities, while market-driven, generic technology-oriented and product technology-oriented BSS have positive influence on exploitative capabilities. Thirdly, the research breaks through the theoretical assumption of the OAC and finds that the OAC is not absolutely exclusive; the exploratory capabilities have significant positive impact on exploitative capabilities. The conclusions expand the perspective and dimension of organization search theory, which enrich the empirical studies about organizational ambidexterity in the context of emerging economy.","[Xiao Ding-ding; Yu Xiao-ming; Zhai Meng] Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China; [Zhu Gui-long] South China Univ Technol, Sch Business Adm, Guangzhou 510640, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Shandong Normal University; South China University of Technology,"Xiao, DD (通讯作者)，Shandong Normal Univ, Sch Management Sci & Engn, Jinan 250014, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71233003, 71403153]; Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China [12JZD042]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)","Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China(71233003, 71403153), the Key Projects of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Ministry of Education of China (12JZD042)",,38,0,0,2,11,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1609,1617,,,,,,9,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600215,0

Yet, the process of achieving it lags behind the economic development in most fast growing Asian economies. Facing the new worldwide changes in public administration, governance reform is of vital importance for building transparent, accountable and participative governments to achieve good governance. Government's responsiveness to group events and appeals of group victims can reflect its transparency, accountability and effectiveness and indicate the status quo of its governance to some extent. China and Turkey are not exceptional as two fast growing Asian economies representing quite different nations respectively in the establishment of Strategic Partnership in 2010 at the national level. While Turkey is the only Middle East Islamic nation becoming successful in modernization and secularization, China is the world's most influential socialist nation striving for successful modernization. Thus, it is essential for their governance reform issues, challenges, and solutions to be studied in theory and practice. Furthermore, the comparative study can be made between China and Turkey regarding building good governance. Taking the group events of 2007 Xiamen PX Project in China and the 2013 Gezi Park in Turkey as two examples, Sino-Turkey status quo of governance reform is explored from the perspectives of reform motives, dilemmas and achievements. Through comparative analysis, conclusions are made about Sino-Turkey experiences, lessons and preferences in achieving good governance for both China and Turkey.","[Zhao Shu-rong; Zhang Meng-meng] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Zhao, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,23,0,0,0,1,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,723,732,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600096,0

That is the Prevention Question,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,flu shot; prevention; quasi-hyperbolic discounting; risk aversion; information; public health,TIME PREFERENCE; INFLUENZA; FUTURE; HEALTH,"Invoking Yaari's dual theory, we develop a model of individual vaccination decisions that incorporates quasi-hyperbolic discounting, risk aversion, and information. We test the resulting hypotheses for the flu season 2010/2011 using a representative German data set. We find a significant impact of time preferences on immunization decisions. The impact of the discount factor is significantly negative for exponential discounters. While present-biased individuals' demand for vaccination is not statistically different from the one of exponential discounters, future-biased individuals have a significantly higher probability to vaccinate. Stratification by gender reveals that these effects are entirely driven by men. That is, time preferences have no explanatory power for the vaccination decisions of women. This also applies to risk aversion, where more risk aversion implies a significantly higher probability to vaccinate for men but not women. All information measures turn out significant. Well-informed individuals have a much higher propensity to vaccinate than poorly informed individuals. If policy makers aim at improving immunization rates, then our results suggest that public policy should concentrate on providing easily accessible and concise information on the flu and the flu shot. Our results on time preferences and risk preferences imply a rather inactive role for public policy.

There has been a 41% reduction in the under-five mortality rate worldwide from 1990 to 2011 and an acceleration in the rate of reduction since 2000. This paper explores why this has occurred, and results for all developing countries indicate that it is not clue to more healthcare or public health interventions but is driven by a coincidental burst of economic growth. Although the MDGs are considered to have played an important part in securing progress against poverty, hunger and disease, there is very little evidence to back this viewpoint up. A thorough analysis of the successes and failures of the MDGs is therefore necessary before embarking on a new round of global goals.

The process involved integrating patients and caregivers of people with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, advocates, clinicians, and the sponsor in conceptualizing and developing a benefit-risk survey on the basis of phase III trial results. Methods: Our community-engagement process for the development of a stated-preference survey included a set of five guiding principles with a foundation in the principles of community-engaged research. Engagement efforts were carried out through an informal network of three committees. Members of the leadership, stakeholder, and review committees comprised patients, caregivers, clinicians, advocacy leadership, and industry representatives. Results: Committee members participated in 15 hours of formal engagement including interviews and conference calls that ranged from 45 to 90 minutes, plus additional less-formal ad hoc communication. Committees comprised 20 individuals across three committees including adults with DMD (n = 6), parents of children with DMD (n = 6), clinicians (n = 3), members of research and advocacy organizations (n = 4), and an industry representative (n = 1). Community engagement informed attribute selection, survey length, word choice, and eligibility criteria. Challenges in the process included managing diverse stakeholder perspectives, time requirements, and the inherent tension between outcomes used in clinical trials versus attributes that correspond to patient- and family-relevant outcomes. Conclusions: We demonstrated how community engagement can successfully influence study design to support the design of a relevant survey instrument that is ethical, acceptable, meaningful to the community, and enhances patient-centered benefit-risk assessment for regulatory decision making.","[Hollin, Ilene L.; Hanson, Caroline; Bridges, John F.

We modify standard epistemic assumptions of static incomplete information games to allow partial signal-awareness. That is, players can be unaware of some of the signals available to others. When learning to play, players form conjectures that underrepresent the sophistication of others' strategy profile. The resulting solution concept is equilibrium with partial signal-awareness (EPSA). We illustrate EPSA by various examples and prove an existence result and an equivalence result between it and Bayesian Nash equilibrium. We then compare EPSA and analogy-based expectation equilibrium (ABEE) (Jehiel and Roessler, 2008) and prove an equivalence result between them for analogy-based expectation games that satisfy the condition of comparative-informativeness. We also discuss how they differ. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Among other things, it allows one to recover the underlying structural function from certain conditional quantiles of observables. Nevertheless, monotonicity is a strong assumption and in some economic applications unlikely to hold, e.g., random coefficient models. Its failure can have substantive adverse consequences, in particular inconsistency of any estimator that is based on it. Having a test for this hypothesis is hence desirable. This paper provides such a test for cross-section data. We show how to exploit an exclusion restriction together With a conditional independence assumption, which in the binary treatment literature is commonly called unconfoundedness, to construct a test. Our statistic is asymptotically normal under local alternatives and consistent against global alternatives. Monte Carlo experiments show that a suitable bootstrap procedure yields tests with reasonable level behavior and useful power. We apply our test to study the role of unobserved ability in determining Black-White wage differences and to study whether Engel curves are monotonically driven by a scalar unobservable.

In this paper, we study a more general framework with d different genders due to Knuth (1976). The genders are ordered in a directed cycle and agents only have preferences over agents of the subsequent gender. Agents are then matched into families, which contain exactly one agent of each gender. We show that there, always exists a stable matching if there are at most d+1 agents per gender, thereby generalizing and extending previous results. The proof is constructive and computationally efficient.

Public health interventions tend to operate in dynamically complex systems. Modeling public health interventions requires broader considerations than clinical ones. Inappropriately simple models may lead to poor validity and credibility, resulting in suboptimal allocation of resources. Objective: This article presents the first conceptual modeling framework for public health economic evaluation. Methods: The framework presented here was informed by literature reviews of the key challenges in public health economic modeling and existing conceptual modeling frameworks; qualitative research to understand the experiences of modelers when developing public health economic models; and piloting a draft version of the framework. Results: The conceptual modeling framework comprises four key principles of good practice and a proposed methodology. The key principles are that 1) a systems approach to modeling should be taken; 2) a documented understanding of the problem is imperative before and alongside developing and justifying the model structure; 3) strong communication with stakeholders and members of the team throughout model development is essential; and 4) a systematic consideration of the determinants of health is central to identifying the key impacts of public health interventions. The methodology consists of four phases: phase A, aligning the framework with the decision-making process; phase B, identifying relevant stakeholders; phase C, understanding the problem; and phase D, developing and justifying the model structure. Key areas for further research involve evaluation of the framework in diverse case studies and the development of methods for modeling individual and social behavior. Conclusions: This approach could improve the quality of Public Health economic models, supporting efficient allocation of scarce resources.","[Squires, Hazel; Chilcott, James; Akehurst, Ronald; Burr, Jennifer] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Akehurst, Ronald] Bresmed, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Kelly, Michael P.] Univ Cambridge, Inst Publ Hlth, Primary Care Unit, Cambridge, England",University of Sheffield; University of Cambridge,"Squires, H (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",h.squires@sheffield.ac.uk,"Squires, Hazel/GSO-3900-2022","Chilcott, James/0000-0003-1231-7817; Burr, Jennifer/0000-0003-3053-3994; Squires, Hazel/0000-0002-2776-4014",National Institute for Health Research; National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2010-03-111] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2010-03-111] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR),National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),This work has been developed under the terms of a doctoral research training fellowship issued by the National Institute for Health Research.,,45,45,50,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,588,601,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.011,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565276.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600013,0

The first-best solution for a number-dampened total social welfare function, including Millian and Benthamite utilitarianism as two extreme cases, identifies the optimal age structure, which generally fails in laissez-faire economies. As individuals do not internalize the effect of longevity on life-cycle income, they over-invest in health. Additionally, they choose a non-optimal number of offspring. A calibration exercise for 80 countries emphasizes that the over-aging of populations crucially depends on social preferences and on observed age structures. Interestingly, it appears that, unlike taxes on health expenditures, taxes or subsidies on children to decentralize the first-best solution are sensitive to social preferences. Still, with the introduction of sufficiently large positive externalities of health expenditures or of individuals who do not fully internalize the effect of health efforts on longevity, taxes might become subsidies on health efforts to avoid an under investment in longevity.

Methods: Patients diagnosed with NVAF and physicians treating such patients completed 12 discrete choice questions comparing NVAF therapies that varied across five attributes: stroke risk, major bleeding risk, convenience (no regular blood testing/dietary restrictions), dosing frequency, and patients' out-ofpocket cost. We used a logistic regression to estimate the willingness to -pay (WTP) value for each attribute. Results: The 200 physicians surveyed were willing to trade off $38 (95% confidence interval [CI] $22 to $54] in monthly out-of-pocket cost for a 1% (absolute) decrease in stroke risk, $14 (95% CI $8 to $21) for a 1% decrease in major bleeding risk, and $34 (95% CI $9 to $60) for more convenience. The WTP value among 201 patients surveyed was $30 (95% CI $18 to $42) for reduced stroke risk, $16 (95% CI $9 to $24) for reduced bleeding risk, and -$52 (95% CI -$96 to -6) for convenience. The WTP value for convenience among patients using warfarin was $9 (95% CI $1 to $18) for more convenience, whereas patients not currently on warfarin had a WTP value of -$90 (95% CI -$290 to -$79). Both physicians' and patients' WTP value for once-daily dosing was not significantly different from zero. On the basis of survey results, 85.0% of the physicians preferred novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to warfarin. NOACs (73.0%) were preferred among patients using warfarin, but warfarin (78.2%) was preferred among patients not currently using warfarin. Among NOACs, both patients and physicians preferred apixaban. Conclusions: Both physicians and patients currently using warfarin preferred NOACs to warfarin. Patients not currently using warfarin preferred warfarin over NOACs because of an apparent preference for regular blood testing/dietary restrictions.","[Shafrin, Jason; MacEwan, Joanna P.; Campinha-Bacote, Avrita] Precis Hlth Econ, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Bruno, Amanda; Shah, Manan] Bristol Myers Squibb Co, Plainsboro, NJ USA; [Trocio, Jeffrey; Tan, Wilson] Pfizer Inc, New York, NY USA; [Romley, John A.] Univ So Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA",Bristol-Myers Squibb; Pfizer; University of Southern California,"Shafrin, J (通讯作者)，11100 Santa Monica Blvd,Suite 500, Los Angeles, CA 90025 USA.",Jason.shafrin@precisionhealtheconomics.com,"Shafrin, Jason/AAI-7041-2020","Shafrin, Jason/0000-0001-8444-5979",Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS); Pfizer Inc.

Endogenous borrowing is controlled for in a dynamic regression-discontinuity design creating a quasi-experimental environment for causal inferences. There is causal relationship running from formal microcredit to improved child health in the short term, while past borrowing behaviour has no protracted impact on subsequent child health outcomes. Moreover, formal microcredit appears to be a complement to health insurance in improving child health through two mechanismsit enhances affordability for out-of-pocket health care expenditure and helps buffer consumption against adverse health shocks and financial risk incurred by current health insurance arrangements. Government efforts in expanding health insurance for rural households would be more likely to achieve its optimal goals of improving child health outcomes if combined with sufficient access to formal microcredit.

They are frequently derived from generic preference-based measures of health. However, such generic measures may not capture health attributes of relevance to specific conditions. In such cases, a condition-specific preference-based measure (CSPBM) may be more appropriate. Objective This systematic review aimed to identify all published accounts of developing CSPBMs to describe and appraise the methods used. Method We undertook a systematic search (of Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EconLit, ASSIA and the Health Management Information Consortium database) to identify published accounts of CSPBM development up to July 2015. Studies were reviewed to investigate the methods used to design classification systems, estimate HSUVs, and validate the measures. Results A total of 86 publications were identified, describing 51 CSPBMs. Around two-thirds of these were QALY measures; the remainder were designed for clinical decision making only. Classification systems for 33 CSPBMs were derived from existing instruments; 18 were developed de novo. HSUVs for 34 instruments were estimated using a 'composite' approach, involving statistical modelling; the remainder used a 'decomposed' approach based on multi-attribute utility theory. Half of the papers that described the estimation of HSUVs did not report validating their measures. Conclusion Various methods have been used at all stages of CSPBM development. The choice between developing a classification system de novo or from an existing instrument may depend on the availability of a suitable existing measure, while the choice between a decomposed or composite approach appears to be determined primarily by the purpose for which the instrument is designed. The validation of CSPBMs remains an area for further development.","[Goodwin, Elizabeth; Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, Room 1-06,St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England; [Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Collaborat Leadership Appl Hlth Res & Care South, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Goodwin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, Room 1-06,St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England.",e.goodwin@exeter.ac.uk,,"Goodwin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1351-9170",The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland [928/10]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust,The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust,"This study formed part of a PhD studentship funded by The Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (Grant Reference Number 928/10).

The Sherlock 3CG (R) Tip Confirmation System (TCS) allows magnetic tracking of the PICC tip during insertion and confirmation of the final location using ECG, meaning that most patients will not require a chest X-ray or fluoroscopy. The Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS was evaluated in 2014 by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as part of the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme. The company (C.R. Bard Ltd) identified four abstracts, one paper pending publication and questionnaire data from NHS users of the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS. None of the evidence included a comparator arm. Placement accuracy of PICCs using the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS where a chest X-ray was also used ranged from 79.5 to 100 %. The company reported that 9 out of 16 NHS centres that used the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS were no longer using chest X-rays to routinely confirm PICC tip location. The evidence did not report the need for catheter repositioning, re-insertion, staff time savings, treatment delays, length of stay, quality of life outcomes or complications. The company's model found that the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS was cost saving by GBP25.67 per patient compared to blind bedside PICC insertion. The External Assessment Centre (EAC) adapted the company's model to test alternative assumptions for nurse time, theatre cost, malposition rate and reinsertion method, and found that the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS was cost incurring by GBP9.37 per patient compared to blind bedside PICC insertion. The use of the Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS in the UK NHS compared to blind PICC insertion using a confirmatory chest X-ray appears to hover around being cost neutral. Staff time and accuracy were key drivers in the model: evidence for these is sparse and the reality will vary in different situations. If evidence became available for outcomes after the initial insertion, such as replacement, complications and adverse events, the cost implications may change. The direction of this potential change is not known. NICE published guidance MTG24 in March 2015 recommending that the case for adoption of Sherlock 3CG (R) TCS was supported by the evidence.","[Dale, Megan; Carolan-Rees, Grace] Cedar Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales; [Higgins, Ailish] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Manchester, Lancs, England",National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Dale, M (通讯作者)，Cedar Cardiff & Vale Univ Hlth Board, Cardiff, S Glam, Wales.",megan.dale@wales.nhs.uk,"Carolan-Rees, Grace/H-6169-2012; Dale, Megan/JJF-1160-2023; Dale, Megan/AAL-5557-2021","Dale, Megan/0000-0001-7229-5109; Carolan-Rees, Grace/0000-0003-1787-2123",,,,,21,33,38,0,11,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This region presents a humid and hot summer, ideal climatic conditions for the development of a number of diseases. To control such diseases and problems brought about by other organisms, growers apply pesticides on the grapevines which may leave residues in grapes. However, in general, grapes produced by organic system have lower yield, but there is a lack of research data on this subject. Thus, an experiment was carried out over three years in order to compare the yield components and the physicochemical composition of the must of Isabel grapes conducted in both production systems. When the grapes were ripe, variables related to yield components were evaluated, such as the number of clusters/vine, yield/vine and weight/cluster. Then the grapes were sampled and taken to the laboratory where they were crushed and the musts were centrifuged and analyzed. The 3-year data mean were submitted to correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis. The results show that conventional grapevines produced 2.18 times more than organic.

Recent value sets derived for the EQ-5D-5L instrument have described the upper anchor as full health, whereas older valuation studies for the EQ-5D used best health state in the descriptive system (11111). It is unclear whether this change could have led to differences in the values obtained. The objective of this study was to assess differences in time trade-off (TTO) valuations using two different comparators (full health and 11111). Methods: Preferences for EQ-5D-5L health states were elicited from a broadly representative sample of the UK general public. TTO data were collected by using computer-assisted personal interviews. Respondents were randomly allocated to one of two arms, each using a different comparator health state. Respondents completed 10 or 11 TTO valuations and a series of follow-up questions examining their interpretations of the term full health. Results: Interviews with 443 respondents were completed in 2014. The differences in mean values across arms are mostly small and nonsignificant. The two arms produced data of similar quality. There is evidence of interviewer effects. Health state 11111 was given a value of 1 by 98.2% of the respondents who valued it. Conclusions: EQ-5D-5L values elicited by using the composite TTO approach are not greatly affected by the use of full health or 11111 as the comparator health state.

We first propose nonparametric estimates of marginal pricing kernels, conditional on the VIX and the slope of the variance swap term structure. Our estimates highlight the state-dependence nature of the pricing kernels. In particular, conditioning on volatility factors, the pricing kernel of market returns exhibit a downward sloping shape up to the extreme end of the right tail. Moreover, the volatility pricing kernel features a striking U-shape, implying that investors have high marginal utility in both high and low volatility states. This finding on the volatility pricing kernel presents a new empirical challenge to both existing equilibrium and reduced-form asset pricing models of volatility risk. Finally, using a full-fledged parametric model, we recover the joint pricing kernel, which is not otherwise identifiable. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the causal impact of e-cigarette access on conventional cigarette use by adolescents. Regression analyses consider how state bans on e-cigarette sales to minors influence smoking rates among 12 to 17 year olds. Such bans yield a statistically significant 0.9 percentage point increase in recent smoking in this age group, relative to states without such bans. Results are robust to multiple specifications as well as several falsification and placebo checks. This effect is both consistent with e-cigarette access reducing smoking among minors, and large: banning electronic cigarette sales to minors counteracts 70 percent of the downward pre-trend in teen cigarette smoking for a given two-year period.

This is due partly to the ignorance of modelers, and more to the ability of existing statistical tests to detect specification errors. In practice, models are often calibrated by minimizing a loss function of the differences between the modeled and actual observations. Under this approach, it is challenging to disentangle model error from estimation error in the residual series. To circumvent the difficulty, we study an alternative way of estimating the model by exact calibration. Unlike the error minimization approach, all information about dynamic misspecifications is channeled to the parameter estimation residuals under exact calibration. In the context of option pricing, we illustrate that standard time series tests are powerful in detecting various kinds of dynamic misspecifications. Compared to the error minimization approach, exact calibration yields more reasonable model comparison result, and delivers more accurate hedging performance that is robust to both gradual and abrupt structural shifts of state variables.

We therefore evaluate the impact of smoking bans and cigarette prices on subjective well-being by analyzing data for 40 European countries and regions between 1990 and 2011. We exploit the staggered introduction of bans and apply an imputation strategy to study the effect of anti-smoking policies on people with different propensities to smoke. We find that higher cigarette prices reduce the life satisfaction of likely smokers. Overall, smoking bans are barely related to subjective well-being, but increase the life satisfaction of smokers who would like to quit smoking. The latter finding is consistent with cue-triggered models of addiction and the idea of bans as self-control devices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We consider the problem of estimating the (drift) parameters indexing the drift term of a threshold diffusion process with continuous-time observations. Maximum likelihood estimation of the drift parameters requires prior knowledge of the functional form of the diffusion term, which is, however, often unavailable. We propose a quasi-likelihood approach for estimating the drift parameters of a two-regime threshold diffusion process that does not require prior knowledge about the functional form of the diffusion term. We show that, under mild regularity conditions, the quasi-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters are consistent. Moreover, the estimator of the threshold parameter is super consistent and weakly converges to some non-Gaussian continuous distribution. Also, the estimators of the autoregressive parameters in the drift term are jointly asymptotically normal with distribution the same as that when the threshold parameter is known. The empirical properties of the quasi-likelihood estimator are studied by simulation. We apply the threshold model to estimate the term structure of a long time series of US interest rates. The proposed approach and asymptotic results can be readily lifted to the case of a multi-regime threshold diffusion process. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Two surveys were conducted with a sample of carers (n = 202) and a sample of noncarers (n = 200). individuals in both groups were asked three questions in which they had to state the minimum monetary compensation they would require (W'I'A) if they had to look after a person described in a hypothetical scenario for one extra hour per day. Furthermore, carers were asked for the compensation they would demand if they had to be in charge of their actual care recipient for one extra hour per day. Results: No significant differences were found between the distributions of carers' and noncarers' WIA values. Overall, respondents' valuations were sensitive to and consistent with their preferences over the tasks to be carried out in the extra hour of informal care. On average, carers required a lower monetary compensation for one extra hour taking care of their loved one (mean/median WTA values (sic)5.2/(sic)4.5) than if they had to devote that time to look after the hypothetical care recipient (mean/median WIA values (sic)64/(sic)5.5). More than half of the carers stated the same value under the two caring situations, which suggests that carers' WIA values were influenced by their own experience providing informal care. Conclusions: Our results show that it is feasible to derive a monetary valuation for informal care from the preferences of noncarers.","[Garrido-Garcia, Silvia; Sanchez-Martinez, Fernando-Ignacio; Abellan-Perpinan, Jose-Maria] Univ Murcia, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Appl Econ, Murcia, Spain; [van Exel, Job] Erasmus Univ, Inst Hlth Policy & Management iBMG, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Murcia; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC,"Garrido-García, S (通讯作者)，Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Espinardo S-N, Murcia 30100, Spain.",silviagg@um.es,"van Exel, Job/E-6191-2013; Perpiñan, Jose Maria Abellan/B-8166-2009; PERPIÑAN, JOSE MARIA ABELLAN/AAB-6483-2019; Sánchez-Martínez, Fernando I./AAA-4438-2019","van Exel, Job/0000-0002-4178-1777; Sánchez-Martínez, Fernando I./0000-0002-2288-4391",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2010-22041-CO202]; Seneca Foundation [15375/PHCS/10],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Seneca Foundation(Fundacion Seneca),The Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (grant no.

To this end, it employs a new panel data set of 275 regions in 29 countries over the period 1999-2010. The results suggest that unemployment does have a significantly positive influence on suicides. In line with economic theory, this influence varies among gender and age groups. Men of working age are particularly sensitive, while old-age suicide mortality (older than 65years old) hardly responds to unemployment. Moreover, real economic growth negatively affects the suicide rates of working-age men. The results withstand several robustness checks, such as sample variations, and after controlling for serial and spatial autocorrelation.

The main difficulty to quantify its effect is to find suitable proxies to measure medical technological innovation. This paper's main contribution is the use of data on approved medical devices and drugs to proxy for medical technology. The effects of these variables on total real per capita health spending are estimated using a panel model for 18 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries covering the period 1981-2012. The results confirm the substantial cost-increasing effect of medical technology, which accounts for almost 50% of the explained historical growth of spending. Despite the overall net positive effect of technology, the effect of two subgroups of approvals on expenditure is significantly negative. These subgroups can be thought of as representing incremental medical innovation', whereas the positive effects are related to radically innovative pharmaceutical products and devices. A separate time series model was estimated for the USA because the FDA approval data in fact only apply to the USA, while they serve as proxies for the other OECD countries. Our empirical model includes an indicator of obesity, and estimations confirm the substantial contribution of this lifestyle variable to health spending growth in the countries studied.

The paper studies test procedures that are robust in the sense that their asymptotic null distributions are invariant to the persistence of the predictor, that is, the limiting distribution is the same irrespective of whether the regressors are stationary or (nearly) integrated. Existing procedures are often conservative (e.g. tests based on Bonferroni bounds), are based on highly restrictive assumptions (such as homoskedasticity or assuming an AR(1) process for the regressor) or fail to have power against alternatives in a 1/T neighborhood of the null hypothesis. We first propose a refinement of the variable addition method with improved asymptotic power approaching the optimal rate. Second, inference based on instrumental variables may further improve the (local) power of the test and even achieve local power under the optimal 1/T rate. We give high-level conditions under which the suggested variable addition and instrumental variable procedures are valid no matter whether the predictor is stationary, near-integrated or integrated, or exhibits time-varying volatility. All test statistics possess a standard limiting distribution. Monte Carlo experiments suggest that tests based on simple combinations of instruments perform most promising relative to existing tests. An application to quarterly US stock returns illustrates the need for robust inference. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because stock market indices are leading indicators of economic performance, this research contributes to our understanding of the macroeconomic determinants of health. Existing studies typically rely on the unemployment rate to proxy for economic performance, but this measure captures only one of many channels through which the economic environment may influence individual health decisions. We find that large, negative monthly DJIA returns, decreases in the level of the DJIA, and stock market crashes are widely associated with worsening self-reported mental health and more cigarette smoking, binge drinking, and fatal car accidents involving alcohol. These results are consistent with predictions from rational addiction models and have implications for research on the association between consumption and stock prices.

Objective: To examine the potential effectiveness of a television (TV) campaign to increase seasonal influenza vaccination among the elderly. Methods: We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, defined as incremental cost per additionally vaccinated Medicare individual) of a hypothetical nationwide TV campaign for influenza vaccination compared with no campaign. We measured the effectiveness of the nationwide TV campaign (advertised once a week at prime time for 30 seconds) during a 17-week influenza vaccination season among four racial/ethnic elderly groups (N=39 million): non Hispanic white (W), non-Hispanic African American (AA), English-speaking Hispanic (EH), and Spanish-speaking Hispanic (SH). Results: The hypothetical campaign cost was $5,960,000 (in 2012 US dollars). The estimated campaign effectiveness ranged from -1.1% (the SH group) to 1.42% (the W group), leading to an increased disparity in influenza vaccination among non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic African American (W-AA) groups (0.6 percentage points), W-EH groups (0.1 percentage points), and W-SH groups (1.5 percentage points). The estimated ICER was $23.54 (95% confidence interval $14.21-$39.37) per additionally vaccinated Medicare elderly in a probabilistic analysis. Race/ethnicity-specific ICERs were lowest among the EH group ($22.27), followed by the W group ($22.47) and the AA group ($30.55). The nationwide TV campaign was concluded to be reasonably cost-effective compared with a benchmark intervention (with ICER $44.39 per vaccinated individual) of a school-located vaccination program. Break-even analyses estimated the maximum acceptable campaign cost to be $14,870,000, which was comparable to the benchmark ICER. Conclusions: The results could justify public expenditures on the implementation of a future nationwide TV campaign, which should include multilingual campaigns, for promoting seasonal influenza vaccination. 2015 (C) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).","[Kim, Minchul] Univ Illinois, Coll Med Peoria, Dept Med, Ctr Outcomes Res, Peoria, IL USA; [Yoo, Byung-Kwang] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Yoo, BK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, One Shields Ave Med Sci 1C, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",byoo@ucdavis.edu,"YOO, BYUNG KWANG/AAU-2366-2021",,,,,,53,12,12,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL,2015,18.0,5.0,,,,,622,630,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.03.1794,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CP7VR,26297090.0,"Green Published, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000360097700011,0

It is shown that direct risk selection - using measures unrelated to the benefit package like selective advertising or 'losing' applications of high risk individuals - nevertheless has an influence on the distortions of the benefit package caused by indirect risk selection. Direct risk selection (DRS) may either increase or decrease these distortions, depending on the type of equilibrium (pooling or separating), the type of DRS (positive or negative)-and the type of cost for DRS (individual-specific or not). Regulators who succeed in reducing DRS by, e.g., banning excessive advertising or implementing fines for 'losing' applications, may therefore (imintendedly) mitigate or exacerbate the distortions of the benefit package caused by indirect risk selection. It is shown that the interaction of direct and indirect risk selection also alters the formula for optimal risk adjustment. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has a long history of developing the content of evidence, the agency now pivots to close that gap by focusing on evidence dissemination and implementation. Achieving better health outcomes requires both the generation of new patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) knowledge and the appropriate and timely implementation of that knowledge into practice. The Affordable Care Act provided funds to support both types of PCOR efforts, with AHRQ building on years of experience to advance research dissemination and implementation. This article describes the work the AHRQ has done, is doing, and will do in the future. To communicate PCOR evidence findings, AHRQ is currently synthesizing research findings into convincing collections of evidence that can be best taken up by clinicians, patients and caregivers, and policymakers. The future direction for AHRQ is to improve the context for evidence and practice improvement, thereby creating an environment receptive to PCOR. Toward this goal, AHRQ is actively engaging partners, such as professional societies and insurers, to make evidence central to decision making. In addition, AHRQ recently launched two programs that seek to both understand and encourage the use of evidence in clinical practice. Throughout these efforts, AHRQ will continually assess needs and adapt initiatives to ensure that PCOR translates into improved patient-centered health outcomes.","[Borden, William B.] George Washington Univ, Washington, DC 20037 USA; [Chiang, Yen-Pin] Patient Centered Outcomes Res Inst, Washington, DC USA; [Kronick, Richard] Agcy Healthcare Res & Qual, Rockville, MD USA",George Washington University; Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality,"Borden, WB (通讯作者)，George Washington Univ, 2150 Penn Ave,NW Suite 10-409, Washington, DC 20037 USA.",wborden@mfa.gwu.edu,,,,,,,10,15,15,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,355,357,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.010,0.0,,,3,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091588.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600001,0

Methods: Respondents, ages 18 years and older, were recruited from a nationally representative panel between August 2012 and February 2013 to complete an online survey. The survey included a series of paired comparisons that asked respondents to choose between child health and functional status outcomes, which were described using the National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a 14-item descriptive system of child health outcomes. Using respondent choices regarding an unnamed 7- or 10-year-old child, generalized linear model analyses estimated the value of child health and functional status on a quality-adjusted life-year scale. Results: Across the domains of health and functional status, repeated or chronic physical pain, feeling anxious or depressed, and behavioral problems (such as acting out, fighting, bullying, or arguing) were most valuable, as indicated by adult respondents' preference of other health problems to avoid outcomes along these domains. Discussion: These findings may inform comparative effectiveness research, health technology assessments, clinical practice guidelines, and public resource allocation decisions by enhancing understanding of the value adults place on the health and functional status of children. Conclusions: Improved measurement of public priorities can promote national child health by drawing attention to what adults value most and complementing conventional measures of public health surveillance.","[Craig, Benjamin M.] H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, Tampa, FL 33612 USA; [Craig, Benjamin M.] Univ S Florida, Tampa, FL USA; [Brown, Derek S.] Washington Univ, Inst Publ Hlth, Brown Sch, St Louis, MO USA; [Reeve, Bryce B.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Lineberger Comprehens Canc Ctr, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Reeve, Bryce B.] Univ N Carolina, UNC Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA",H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; Washington University (WUSTL); University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Craig, BM (通讯作者)，H Lee Moffitt Canc Ctr & Res Inst, MRC CANCONT, 12902 Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 USA.",benjamin.craig@moffitt.org,"Reeve, Bryce/AAE-7657-2019; Brown, Derek/J-3035-2013","Craig, Benjamin Matthew/0000-0003-1121-1316; Brown, Derek/0000-0001-9908-9882","NCI NIH HHS [1R01CA160104, R01 CA160104] Funding Source: Medline",NCI NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Cancer Institute (NCI)),,,53,9,9,0,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,449,456,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.012,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091599.0,"Green Accepted, hybrid, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600012,0

We propose four different ways of coping with the individual effects so as to estimate the parameters. Like models with autoregressive dynamics, ours nests 1(1) behaviour, but unlike the nonstandard asymptotics in the autoregressive case, estimates of the fractional parameter can be asymptotically normal. For three of the estimates, establishing this property is made difficult due to bias caused by the individual effects, or by the consequences of eliminating them, which appears in the central limit theorem except under stringent conditions on the growth of the cross-sectional size N relative to the time series length T, though in case of two estimates these can be relaxed by bias correction, where the biases depend only on the parameters describing autocorrelation. For the fourth estimate, there is no bias problem, and no restrictions on N. Implications for hypothesis testing and interval estimation are discussed, with central limit theorems for feasibly bias-corrected estimates included. A Monte Carlo study of finite-sample performance is included. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsyclNFO were searched. The methodological quality of the articles was assessed using the COnsensus-based Standards for selection of health Measurement INstruments checklist. For each PROM, extracted evidence of content validity, construct validity, internal consistency, test retest reliability, proxy reliability, responsiveness, and precision was judged against standardized reference criteria. Results: We found no evidence for 14 PROMs. For the remaining 21 PROMs, 90 studies were identified. The methodological quality of most studies was fair. Quality was generally rated higher in more recent studies. Not reporting how missing data were handled was the most common reason for downgrading the quality. None of the 21 PROMs has had all psychometric properties evaluated; data on construct validity and internal consistency were most frequently reported. Conclusions: Overall, consistent positive findings for at least five psychometric properties were found for Child Health and Illness Profile, Healthy Pathways, KIDSCREEN, and Multi-dimensional Student Life Satisfaction Scale. None of the PROMs had been evaluated for responsiveness to detect change in general populations. Further welldesigned studies with transparent reporting of methods and results are required.","[Janssens, Astrid; Rogers, Morwenna; Coon, Jo Thompson; Allen, Karen; Green, Colin; Logan, Stuart; Morris, Christopher] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Jenkinson, Crispin] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England; [Tennant, Alan] Univ Leeds, Dept Rehabil Med, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Exeter; University of Oxford; University of Leeds,"Janssens, A (通讯作者)，Univ Exeter, Inst Hlth Res, PenCRU, Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",a.janssens@exeter.ac.uk,"Janssens, Astrid/I-1227-2019; Coon, Jo Thompson/C-7923-2017","Janssens, Astrid/0000-0001-8419-0937; Tennant, Alan/0000-0002-0728-2130; Logan, Stuart/0000-0002-9279-261X; Morris, Christopher/0000-0002-9916-507X; Rogers, Morwenna/0000-0002-6039-238X; Thompson Coon, Jo/0000-0002-5161-0234",National Institute for Health Research Library [10/2002/16]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme [10/2002/16]; NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC); charity Cerebra; National Institute for Health Research [10/2002/16] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Library; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services and Delivery Research programme(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC); charity Cerebra; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This article is part of a report published by the National Institute for Health Research Library (Project 10/2002/16).

Methods: The study consisted of two steps. First, we reviewed cost-utility analyses (CUAs) related to diabetes published through the end of 2012, using the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (w.cearegistry. c)r.O. We used logistic regression to examine factors independently associated with favorable cost-effective ratios. Second, we used the Humedica electronic medical records to estimate potential savings and health benefits gained by shifting patients currently receiving low-value services to high-value alternatives. Results: We identified 196 diabetes CUAs, of which 55% examined pharmaceuticals. Most (70%) diabetes CUAs focused on treatment rather than prevention. Most used a health care payer perspective and were industrysponsored. Of the 497 published cost utility ratios, 82% examined an intervention recommended by diabetes guidelines. Approximately 73% of the interventions were cost-saving or below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Logistic regression analysis showed that higher quality CUAs, CUAs conducted from the US perspective, surgical interventions, and guideline-recommended interventions were more likely to report favorable ratios. Of the 7907 eligible patients with diabetes in our sample, up to 7117 could in principle be shifted to cost-saving treatments, reducing costs by $12.5 million and gaining more than 1938 quality-adjusted life-years over a lifetime. Conclusions: Most diabetes interventions evaluated by CUAs are recommended by practice guidelines and may provide good value for money. Our results indicate that patients with diabetes and the health care system could potentially benefit from shifting to the greater use of high-value services.","[Zhong, Yue; Lin, Pei-Jung; Cohen, Joshua T.; Neumann, Peter J.] Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, Boston, MA 02111 USA; [Winn, Aaron N.] Univ N Carolina, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Chapel Hill, NC USA",Tufts Medical Center; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Zhong, Y (通讯作者)，Tufts Med Ctr, Inst Clin Res & Hlth Policy Studies, Ctr Evaluat Value & Risk Hlth, 800 Washington St,Box 63, Boston, MA 02111 USA.",yzhong@tuftsmedicalcenter.org,,"Winn, Aaron/0000-0003-2906-3913; Cohen, Joshua/0000-0003-1737-0991",West Health Institute,West Health Institute,"The West Health Institute provided funding for this study.

The estimator is a bivariate tensor-product B-spline. To enforce no-arbitrage constraints across strikes and expiry dates, we establish sufficient no-arbitrage conditions on the control net of the B-spline surface. The conditions are linear and therefore allow for an implementation of the estimator by means of standard quadratic programming techniques. The consistency of the estimator is proved. By means of simulations, we explore the statistical efficiency benefits that are associated with estimating option price surfaces and state-price densities under the full set of no-arbitrage constraints. We estimate a call-option price surface, families of first-order strike derivatives, and state-price densities for S&P 500 option data. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

During this period the composition and quantity of the biogas, conductivity, redox potential, pH, dry matter and total organic carbon in the processed material has been monitored. Determination of dry matter and total organic carbon proved to be unsuitable operating parameters for the diagnosis of biogas plants due to complicated sampling. The quantity of generated biogas, content methane in the biogas, conductivity, redox potential and pH of processed material are parameters which could provide descriptive information about process of anaerobic digestion and which can be useful for operational diagnostics of biogas plants. These parameters are closely related. For example development of redox potential correlates directly with the methane content in the biogas. And change of pH is in inverse proportion to development of redox potential. The conductivity during anaerobic fermentation gradually rose while the pH decreased. On the other hand determination of dry matter and total organic carbon proved to be unsuitable operating parameters for the diagnosis of biogas plants due to complicated sampling.","[Dokulilova, Tereza; Gersl, Milan; Sotnar, Martin] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Technol, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Dokulilova, T (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Agr Food & Environm Technol, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xdokuli3@mendelu.cz,"Geršl, Milan/L-2134-2018; Šotnar, Martin/K-7783-2018; Hammerschmiedt, Tereza/W-5891-2018","Geršl, Milan/0000-0002-7721-3309; Hammerschmiedt, Tereza/0000-0003-1621-2019",,,,,7,0,0,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,507,512,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100096,0

Then a forecast of China's trade amount is made using the regression results. The study shows: If trading partners' GDP increases by 1%, China's total trade amount and export will increase by 0.587% and 1.378% respectively. If China's trade facilitation gets improved by1%, China's total trade amount, import and export will increase by 4.602%, 4.977% and 3.069% respectively. If other conditions remain unchanged and the agreement is implemented from 2016, in 2020 China's trade amount will be benefited by an additional 30.79%'s growth. The improvement of trade facilitation imposed by Agreement can not only produce trade creation effect by reducing trade costs and promoting economic development, but also impose reform to China's port, custom and trade system, which will bring new reform bonus to China.","[Hong Jie] China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China",China University of Political Science & Law,"Hong, J (通讯作者)，China Univ Polit Sci & Law, Sch Business, Beijing 102249, Peoples R China.",,,,National Social Science Foundation of China [12BJL060]; Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China [11YJA790043],"National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences); Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China)",Supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (12BJL060) and the Humanities and Social Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China(11YJA790043),,30,0,0,0,2,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,911,918,,,,,,8,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600121,0

A good online marketing strategy should be developed to focus on consumer's emotional psychology and bring pleasurable experience. This study explores the relationship between emotions and online marketing strategies on the KDR (prior-Knowledge, existed-Data, further-Response) hybrid modeling framework. We propose an artificial psychology emotion model collaborating emotional experiences with rational cognitive factors affecting consumer's online shopping behavior building upon previous research, and create a set of testing process to capture and measure both shopping behavior and emotional experience data of respondents.

Numerous literatures have been reported on the evacuation routing plans, but few papers have focused on the risk of such plans caused by the dynamic development of disasters. In this paper, using some reasonable assumptions as to disaster spread and damage, we applied the dynamic network flow method to establish a multi-source-multi-destination (MSMD) large-scale evacuation model, based on which the influence of evacuation priority and the general pattern of disaster spread were comprehensively considered. Using a kind of dynamic parallel processing heuristic algorithm, the optimal evacuation planning was solved and compared to previous work. As a result of these analyses, we further proposed a concept of route travelling efficiency risk (RTE risk), and established its quantitative assessment framework based on the utility theory. The value of RTE risk calculated from the framework of each road link at a different moment after the disaster occurs can effectively reflect the dynamic change in appropriateness for travelling of the evacuation road network in a disaster environment, considering both efficiency and risk.","[Wang Jing-hong; Zhi You-ran] Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Urban Construct & Safety Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban & Ind Safety, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang Jing-hong; Sun Jin-hua] Univ Sci & Technol China, State Key Lab Fire Sci, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China","Nanjing Tech University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS","Wang, JH (通讯作者)，Nanjing Tech Univ, Coll Urban Construct & Safety Engn, Jiangsu Key Lab Urban & Ind Safety, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,"SUN, JIN/GPX-9641-2022",,"National Natural Science Foundations of China [91024025, 21406115, 2014M551580]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20140950, 14KJB620001]; Postdoctoral Research Funding Plan of Jiangsu Province [1302052B]; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",National Natural Science Foundations of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province); Postdoctoral Research Funding Plan of Jiangsu Province; Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundations of China (91024025, 21406115, 2014M551580), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20140950, 14KJB620001), the Postdoctoral Research Funding Plan of Jiangsu Province (1302052B), the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions",,29,0,0,2,3,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,334,344,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600046,0

Apart from Kupiec (1995) and Christoffersen's (1998) methods, three quality measures are proposed to evaluate different VaR models. The GEV results are compared with three other conventional VaR approaches; the GARCH model, RiskMetrics, and historical simulation. The coverage tests showed that historical simulation with 250 historical data and the GEV model based on a 5-day block statistically provide equivalent significance in daily VaR forecasting, but the violation rate of the GEV model is more accurate than the other models.

Combining the reasons of peasants' lands lost and interests damaged, directly to the cause of land-lost peasants to explain the peasants' interests damaged, then have the point of view-the reasons causing peasants' land lost also cause the peasants' interests damaged. (2)The middle stage of the research: the design and practice of land-lost peasants resettlement mode and guarantee mechanism. (3)The late stage of research: research on the land-lost peasants' urbanization. If the land-lost peasants can not enjoy the same living conditions and development space after they going into city, the experience of urbanization was fail.

While there is a large amount of financial literature on the contribution of venture capital to the performance of entrepreneurial firms, there are relatively few empirical studies that identify VC firms' heterogeneous effect on the performance of entrepreneurial firms. This article selects the Chinese listed companies dated from 2009 to 2012 on the ChiNext board as the research samples and explore whether VC-backed firms in China generally outperform their non VC-backed counterparts, and if so, further exploring the effect of VC firms' heterogeneity on entrepreneurial firms' performance, with the focus on the factors of VC firms' capital background, reputation and investment approaches. Our analysis shows that VC-backed firms outperform non VC-backed firms in the aspect of growth ability. Furthermore, we find different types of VC and investment approaches also affect the performance of the venture firms differently. Ventures backed by foreign VC firms perform better in the profitability, compared to those backed by domestic VC firms. Firms backed by syndicated investment perform better in the profitability, compared to those backed by non-syndicated investment. Firms backed by staged VC investment perform better in the growth ability, compared to those backed by VC investment with non-staged financing approach. Thus we get the conclusion that foreign VC firms, VC firms with syndicated investment approach or staged financing approach can add more value to the investee companies.","[Yang Xi; Wang Su-sheng] Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Huang Jie-min] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology,"Yang, X (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Shenzhen Grad Sch, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,32,0,0,0,8,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,747,757,,,,,,11,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600099,0

This raises the question of whether patients discharged to hospital-based SNFs have better outcomes. In unadjusted comparisons, hospital-based SNF patients have much lower Medicare utilization in the 180 days following discharge relative to freestanding SNF patients. We solved the problem of differential selection into hospital-based and freestanding SNFs by using differential distance from home to the nearest hospital with a SNF relative to the distance from home to the nearest hospital without a SNF as an instrument. We found that hospital-based SNF patients spent roughly 5 more days in the community and 6 fewer days in the SNF in the 180 days following,their original hospital discharge with no significant effect on mortality or hospital readmission.

This is mainly because the number of covariates exceeds the sample size. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel alternative by introducing the Correlated Predictors Screening (CPS) method to control for predictors that are highly correlated with the target covariate. Accordingly, the classical ordinary least squares approach can be employed to estimate the regression coefficient associated with the target covariate. In addition, we demonstrate that the resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal even if the random errors are heteroscedastic. This enables us to apply the z-test to assess the significance of each covariate. Based on the p-value obtained from testing the significance of each covariate, we further conduct multiple hypothesis testing by controlling the false discovery rate at the nominal level. Then, we show that the multiple hypothesis testing achieves consistent model selection. Simulation studies and empirical examples are presented to illustrate the finite sample performance and the usefulness of the proposed method, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A consistency result is derived to support the method. Moreover, a two-step estimator is constructed for the functional coefficients, and under certain conditions, we show that this estimator can be oracle efficient in the sense that its limiting distribution is the same regardless of whether or not the spatial weights are known. Both simulated and real data examples are used to illustrate our theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Tarbush, B",,,,"Tarbush, Bassel",,,Counterfactuals in agreeing to disagree type results,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,KNOWLEDGE,"Moses and Nachum (1990) identified conceptual flaws (later echoed by Samet, 2010) in Bacharach's (1985) generalization of Aumann's (1976) seminal agreeing to disagree result by demonstrating that the crucial assumptions of like-mindedness and the Sure-Thing Principle are not meaningfully expressible in standard partitional information structures. This paper presents a new agreement theorem couched in counterfactual information structures that resolves these conceptual flaws. The new version of the Sure Thing Principle introduced here, which accounts for beliefs at counterfactual states, is also shown to sit well with the intuition of the original version proposed by Savage (1972).

However, there is a growing awareness that active patient and public participation can improve decision making, increase acceptance of decisions, and improve adherence to treatments. The assessment of risk versus benefit requires not only information on clinical outcomes but also value judgments about which outcomes are important and whether the potential benefits outweigh the harms. There are a number of mechanisms for capturing the input of patients, and regulatory bodies within the European Union are participating in several initiatives. These can include patients directly participating in the regulatory decision-making process or using information derived from patients in empirical studies as part of the evidence considered. One promising method that is being explored is the elicitation of patient preferences. Preferences, in this context, refer to the individual's evaluation of health outcomes and can be understood as statements regarding the relative desirability of a range of treatment options, treatment characteristics, and health states. Several methods for preference measurement have been proposed, and pilot studies have been undertaken to use patient preference information in regulatory decision making. This article describes how preferences are currently being considered in the benefit-risk assessment context, and shows how different methods of preference elicitation are used to support decision making within the European context.","[Muehlbacher, Axel C.; Juhnke, Christin] Hsch Neubrandenburg, Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany; [Beyer, Andrea R.] Univ Groningen, Univ Med Ctr Groningen, Dept Epidemiol, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands; [Garner, Sarah] Natl Inst Hlth & Care Excellence, Sci Policy & Res, London, England",University of Groningen; National Institute for Health & Care Excellence,"Mühlbacher, AC (通讯作者)，Hsch Neubrandenburg, Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Brodaer Str 2, D-17033 Neubrandenburg, Germany.",muehlbacher@hs-nb.de,"Mühlbacher, Axel/AAZ-6577-2020; Juhnke, Christin/AAT-1479-2021","Mühlbacher, Axel/0000-0003-4402-9211; Juhnke, Christin/0000-0002-3949-0612",,,,,55,72,76,1,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,SEP-OCT,2016,19.0,6.0,,,,,734,740,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.04.006,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DZ5VS,27712699.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385930500008,0
J,"Yadav, S",,,,"Yadav, Sonal",,,Selecting winners with partially honest jurors,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NASH IMPLEMENTATION,"We consider the effect of partially honest jurors (along the lines of Dutta and Sen (2012)) in a model of juror decisions developed in Amoros (2013). We analyse the problem of choosing the w contestants who will win a competition within a group of n > w competitors. All jurors know who the w best contestants are. All the jurors commonly observe who the w best contestants are, but they may be biased (in favour of or against some contestants). We assume that some of these jurors are partially honest. A partially honest individual has a strict preference for revealing the true state over lying when truth-telling does not lead to a worse outcome (according to preferences in the true state) than that which obtains when lying. The socially optimal rule is to always select the w best contestants, in every possible state of the world. We first look at the many person implementation, when the jury consists of at least two partially honest jurors, whose identity is not known to the planner. We find that the socially optimal rule is Nash implementable if for each pair of contestants, there are two jurors who treat the pair in an unbiased manner and one of these jurors is partially honest. However it is not necessary for the planner to know the identity of the jurors who are fair over a given pair. The result shows that the presence of partially honest jurors expands the scope of implementation. We also analyse the problem, when there are only two jurors and consider cases both with and without the assumption of partial honesty. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

US regulators currently rely primarily on studies of fatal injuries, raising questions about whether different values might be appropriate for risks associated with fatal illnesses. Our review suggests that, despite the substantial expansion of the research base in recent years, few US studies of illness-related risks meet criteria for quality, and those that do yield similar values to studies of injury-related risks. Given this result, combining the findings of these few studies with the findings of the more robust literature on injury-related risks appears to provide a reasonable range of estimates for application in regulatory analysis. Our review yields estimates ranging from about $4.2 million to $13.7 million with a mid-point of $9.0 million (2013 dollars). Although the studies we identify differ from those that underlie the values currently used by Federal agencies, the resulting estimates are remarkably similar, suggesting that there is substantial consensus emerging on the values applicable to the general US population.

First, the underlying properties of permutation tests when comparing parameter vectors from two distributions P and Q are developed. Although an exact level a test can be constructed by a permutation test when the fundamental assumption of identical underlying distributions holds, permutation tests have often been misused. Indeed, permutation tests have frequently been applied in cases where the underlying distributions need not be identical under the null hypothesis. In such cases, permutation tests fail to control the Type 1 error, even asymptotically. However, we provide valid procedures in the sense that even when the assumption of identical distributions fails, one can establish the asymptotic validity of permutation tests in general while retaining the exactness property when all the observations are i.i.d. In the multivariate testing problem for testing the global null hypothesis of equality of parameter vectors, a modified Hotelling's T-2-statistic as well as tests based on the maximum of studentized absolute differences are considered. In the latter case, a bootstrap prepivoting test statistic is constructed, which leads to a bootstrapping after permuting algorithm. Then, these tests are applied as a basis for testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously by invoking the closure method to control the Familywise Error Rate. Lastly, Monte Carlo simulation studies and an empirical example are presented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such geographic variations are often seen as an indicator for inefficiency. With its homogeneous health care system, low co-payments and uniform prices, Germany is a particularly suited example to analyse regional variations. We use data for the year 2011 on expenditure, utilization of health services and state of health in Germany's statutory health insurance system. This data, which originate from a variety of administrative sources and cover about 90% of the population, are enriched with a wealth of socio-economic variables, data on pollutants, prices and individual preferences. State of health and demography explains 55% of the differences as measured by the standard deviation while all control variables account for a total of 72% of the differences at county level. With other measures of variation, we can account for an even greater proportion. A higher proportion of variation than usually supposed can thus be explained. Whilst this study cannot quantify inefficiencies, our results contradict the thesis that regional variations reflect inefficiency.

We compare two long-run social optima: on the one hand, the average utilitarian optimum, where the long-run average well-being is maximized, and, on the other hand, the ex post egalitarian optimum, where the realized well-being of the worst-off at the stationary equilibrium is maximized. It is shown that the ex post egalitarian optimum involves, under weak conditions, a higher level of pollution in comparison with the utilitarian optimum. This result is robust to introducing health expenditures in the survival function. Finally, we examine the decentralization of those two social optima, and we compare the associated optimal taxes on capital income aimed at internalizing the pollution externality.

To address this gap, the Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Consortium's Asthma Working Group has developed a patient-reported asthma daily symptom diary (ADSD) for use in clinical research to assess outcomes and support medical product labeling claims in adults and adolescents with asthma. Objectives: To summarize the qualitative research conducted to inform the initial development of the ADSD and to provide evidence for content validity of the instrument in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration's PRO Guidance. Methods: Research informing the initial development and confirming the content validity of the ADSD is summarized. This comprised a review of published qualitative research, semi-structured concept elicitation interviews (n = 55), and cognitive interviews (n = 65) with a diverse and representative sample of adults and adolescents with a clinician-confirmed diagnosis of asthma in the United States to understand the asthma symptom experience and to assess the relevance and understanding of the newly developed ADSD. Results: From the qualitative literature review and concept elicitation interviews, eight core asthma symptoms emerged. These were broadly categorized as breathing symptoms (difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and wheezing), chest symptoms (chest tightness, chest pain, and pressure/weight on chest), and cough symptoms (cough and the presence of mucus/ phlegm). Conceptual saturation was achieved and differences in the experience of participants according to socio-demographic or clinical characteristics were not observed. Subsequent testing of the ADSD confirmed participant relevance and understanding. Conclusions: The ADSD is a new patient-reported asthma symptom diary developed in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration's PRO Guidance. Evidence to date supports the content validity of the instrument. Item performance, reliability, and construct validity will be assessed in future quantitative research.","[Gater, Adam; Bonner, Nicola; Hall, Rebecca; Marshall, Chris; Staunton, Hannah] Adelphi Values Ltd, Adelphi Mill, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Nelsen, Linda] GlaxoSmithKline, King Of Prussia, PA USA; [Fleming, Sarah] Janssen Global Serv LLC, Titusville, NJ USA; [Lundy, J.

Existing dynamic Wishart models are extended to countably infinite mixture models of Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions. In addition to mixture models with constant weights we propose models with time-varying weights to capture time dependence in the unknown distribution. Each of our models can be combined with returns to provide a coherent joint model of returns and RCOV. The extensive forecast results show the new models provide very significant improvements in density forecasts for RCOV and returns and competitive point forecasts of RCOV. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The econometric analysis is conducted using a Bayesian econometric framework. We estimate the treatment effects for different counterfactuals and find significant evidence of endogeneity in plan choice and the presence of both adverse and advantageous selections in the supplemental insurance market. The average incentive effect is estimated to be $757 (2004 value) or 41% increase per person per year for the elderly enrolled in supplemental plans with drug coverage against the Medicare fee-for-service counterfactual and is $350 or 21% against the supplemental plans without drug coverage counterfactual. The incentive effect varies by different sources of drug coverage: highest for employer-sponsored insurance plans, followed by Medigap and managed medicare plans.

In this paper we study whether the foaming properties of the sparkling wines produced from the base wines obtained by sequential inoculation with T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae remains better than those of their controls produced from base wines fermented only with S. cerevisiae. The obtained results confirmed that sequential inoculation in the production of the base wine originated sparkling wines with significantly higher maximum heights of foam than conventional inoculation, probably because autolysis of the T. delbrueckii cells in the base wine released higher amounts of proteins, especially of the low molecular weight fraction.","[Medina-Trujillo, Laura; Gonzalez-Royo, Elena; Fort, Francesca; Miquel Canals, Joan; Zamora, Fernando] Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Enol Tarragona, Dept Bioquim & Biotecnol, C Marcelli Domingo S-N, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain; [Sieczkowski, Nathalie; IIeras, Jose] Lallemand BIO SL, C Galiieu 303,1a Planta, Barcelona 08028, Spain",Universitat Rovira i Virgili,"Medina-Trujillo, L (通讯作者)，Univ Rovira & Virgili, Fac Enol Tarragona, Dept Bioquim & Biotecnol, C Marcelli Domingo S-N, E-43007 Tarragona, Spain.",,"Canals, Joan-Miquel/B-7911-2011; Zamora, Fernando/K-9661-2014","Canals, Joan-Miquel/0000-0003-1989-2574;",,,,,16,3,3,0,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,2024.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160702024,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,gold,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700068,0

The agents are Choquet expected utility maximizers. Whenever each agent's information partition is composed of unambiguous events in the sense of Nehring (1999), then the agents cannot disagree on the common knowledge decisions, whether these decisions are conditional capacities or conditional Choquet expectations. Conversely, an agreement on conditional Choquet expectations, but not on conditional capacities, implies that each agent's private information must consist of Nehring-unambiguous events. These results indicate that under ambiguity - contrary to the standard Bayesian framework - asymmetric information matters, and it can explain differences in common knowledge decisions due to the ambiguous nature of the agents' private information.

Our study aims to set the foundation for a theoretical framework of the costs related to torture. It examines existing challenges and proposes some solutions. Our proposed framework targets policy makers, human rights activists, professionals working in programmes, centres and rehabilitation projects, judges and lawyers, survivors of torture and their families and anyone involved in the prevention and fight against this practice and its consequences. We adopted a methodology previously used in studies investigating the challenges in measuring and valuing productivity costs in health disorders. We identify and discuss conceptual, methodological, political and ethical challenges that studies on the economic and social costs of torture pose and propose alternatives in terms of possible solutions to these challenges. The economic dimension of torture is rarely debated and integrated in research, policies and programmes. Several challenges such as epistemological, methodological, ethical or political ones have often been presented as obstacles to cost studies of torture and as an excuse for not investigating this dimension.

Information processing can be costly, for example, due to limited attention. We show that the preference of the individual is completely characterized by a preference for early resolution of uncertainty, which becomes indifference when facing degenerate choices. When information acquisition is no longer part of the decision process, the individual is indifferent to the timing of resolution of uncertainty and she behaves according to the subjective learning model of Dillenberger et al.

The proposed alternative provides a unified method of smoothing; easier computation is a byproduct in the maximum score case. Depending on input parameter choice and smoothness, the convergence rate of our estimator varies between (3)root n and (almost) root n and its limit distribution varies from Chernoff to normal. We provide a bias reduction method and an inference procedure which automatically adapts to the correct convergence rate and limit distribution. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It extends the research of Nakanishi (2000) and Oladi (2005) for the tariff retaliation game in which countries take into account subsequent retaliations that may occur after their own retaliation. We show that when countries are sufficiently farsighted, all farsighted stable sets of the tariff game of Nakanishi (2000) are singletons, which are Pareto efficient and strictly individually rational tariff combinations. These results hold regardless of whether coalitional deviations are allowed or not. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Policymakers have focused on the possible link between the two, leading to ACA provisions to increase insurer competition. However, while market power may enable insurers to include higher profit margins in their premiums, it may also result in stronger bargaining leverage with hospitals to negotiate lower payment rates to partially offset these higher premiums. We empirically examine the relationship between employer-sponsored fully-insured health insurance premiums and the level of concentration in local insurer and hospital markets using the nationally-representative 2006-2011 KFF/HRET Employer Health Benefits Survey. We exploit a unique feature of employer-sponsored insurance, in which self-insured employers purchase only administrative services from managed care organizations, to disentangle these different effects on insurer concentration by constructing one concentration measure representing fully-insured plans' transactions with employers and the other concentration measure representing insurers' bargaining with hospitals. As expected, we find that premiums are indeed higher for plans sold in markets with higher levels of concentration relevant to insurer transactions with employers, lower for plans in markets with higher levels of insurer concentration relevant to insurer bargaining with hospitals, and higher for plans in markets with higher levels of hospital market concentration.

As the link function is unspecified, the models under investigation become unidentifiable. In this paper, we derive an identification condition for the generalised varying-coefficient models, which is much weaker and more reasonable than that given by Kuruwita et al. (2011) whose model can be seen as a special case of our modelling framework. Under the identification condition, we introduce a nonparametric iterative procedure to estimate the functional coefficient with its direction and norm as well as the unspecified link function, and then establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting nonparametric estimators. Furthermore, a weighted least squares based algorithm is provided to implement the iterative estimation procedure. The simulation studies and empirical application show that our estimation methodology works quite well in both small and median sample cases. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In collaboration with the Government of the Ningxia province, we examined the impact of two key features of the reform on health care utilisation using panel household data. The first policy change was a redesign of the rural insurance benefit package, with an emphasis on reorientating incentives away from inpatient towards outpatient care. The second policy change involved a shift from a fee-for-service payment method to a capitation budget with pay-for-performance amongst primary care providers. We find that the insurance intervention, in isolation, led to a 47% increase in the use of outpatient care at village clinics and greater intensity of treatment (e.g. injections). By contrast, the two interventions in combination showed no effect on health care use over and above that generated by the redesign of the insurance benefit package.

Prior research covering the early years of the program showed that the program effectively expanded coverage while a more recent paper of the early effects of the program found that improved access from the program led to a reduction in infant mortality. Objective We expand and update previous analyses of the effects of the 30 Baht program on access and out-of-pocket payments. Data and Methods We analyze national survey and governmental budgeting data through 2011 to examine trends in health care financing, coverage and access, including out-of-pocket payments. Results By 2011, only 1.64 % of the population remained uninsured in Thailand (down from 2.61 % in 2009). While government funding increased 75 % between 2005 and 2010, budgetary requests by health care providers exceeded approved amounts in many years. The 30 Baht program beneficiaries paid zero out-of-pocket payments for both outpatient and inpatient care. Inpatient and outpatient contact rates across all insurance categories fell slightly over time. Conclusions Overall, the statistical results suggest that the program is continuing to achieve its goals after 10 years of operation. Insurance coverage is now virtually universal, access has been more or less maintained, government funding has continued to grow, though at rates below requested levels and 30 Baht patients are still guaranteed access to care with limited or no out-of-pocket costs. Important issues going forward are the ability of the government to sustain continued funding increases while minimizing cost sharing.","[Damrongplasit, Kannika] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Bangkok 10330, Thailand; [Melnick, Glenn] Univ So Calif, Price Sch Publ Policy, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA; [Melnick, Glenn] RAND Corp, Santa Monica, CA 90407 USA",Chulalongkorn University; University of Southern California; RAND Corporation,"Damrongplasit, K (通讯作者)，Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Econ, Phayathai Rd, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.",Kannika.D@chula.ac.th,"Damrongplasit, Kannika/AFT-1055-2022","Damrongplasit, Kannika/0000-0001-9434-6114",,,,,16,14,15,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We distinguish and classify the institutional responses to the need for LTC financing as ex ante (occurring prior to when the need arises, such as insurance) and ex post (occurring after the need arises, such as public sector and family financing). Then, we examine country-specific data to ascertain whether the two types of financing are complements or substitutes. Finally, we examine exploratory cross-national data on public expenditure determinants, specifically economic, demographic and social determinants. We show that although both ex ante and ex post mechanisms exist in all countries with advanced industrial economies and despite the fact that instruments are different across countries, ex ante and ex post instruments are largely substitutes for each other. Expenditure estimates to date indicate that the public financing of LTC is highly sensitive to a country's income, ageing of the population and the availability of informal caregiving.

We distinguish countries with and without universal insurance, because insurance undermines patients' price sensitivity, potentially leading to prices above second-best efficient levels. In countries with universal insurance, if each payer unilaterally sets an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold based on its citizens' willingness-to-pay for health; manufacturers price to that ICER threshold; and payers limit reimbursement to patients for whom a drug is cost-effective at that price and ICER, then the resulting price levels and use within each country and price differentials across countries are roughly consistent with second-best static and dynamic efficiency. These value-based prices are expected to differ cross-nationally with per capita income and be broadly consistent with Ramsey optimal prices. Countries without comprehensive insurance avoid its distorting effects on prices but also lack financial protection and affordability for the poor. Improving pricing efficiency in these self-pay countries includes improving regulation and consumer information about product quality and enabling firms to price discriminate within and between countries.

(2009)) as a quadruple M = {Lambda, X, F, R}, where Lambda and X represent the parameter and actions spaces, respectively, F is a correspondence defining the feasible actions and R is a real-valued function which measures the degree of rationality of the feasible actions. We recall that structural stability means the continuity of the equilibrium set with respect to small perturbations of the parameters and that robustness to bounded rationality holds if small deviations from rationality imply small changes in the equilibrium set. In this paper we extend to a model (M) over bar = {(Lambda) over bar, (X) over bar, (F) over bar, (R) over bar}, where (Lambda) over bar is defined as the set of all compact subsets of A, (X) over bar = X, (F) over bar and (R) over bar are the feasibility and rationality correspondences which extend F and R, respectively. (M) over bar is more complex than M, since M is embedded into (M) over bar in a natural way. We show that the structural stability of A implies the structural stability of (M) over bar and that (M) over bar is robust to bounded rationality if (R) over bar is lower semi-continuous. This abstract characterization of complexity is important because it can be used to appraise the nontrivial issue of whether structural stability and robustness to bounded rationality are preserved when a structurally stable model M is extended to (M) over bar. By applying this abstract construction to a pure exchange economy, the result by Loi and Matta (2010), concerning the stability of the equilibrium set with respect to perturbations of endowments along a given path, is extended to perturbations of paths under bounded rationality.

Two estimators based on local linear regressions are proposed. The first estimator applies simple inequality constraints while the second uses rearrangement to maintain quantile monotonicity. The bandwidth parameter is allowed to vary across quantiles to adapt to data sparsity. For inference, the paper first establishes a uniform Bahadur representation and then shows that the two estimators converge weakly to the same limiting Gaussian process. As an empirical illustration, the paper considers a dataset from Project STAR and delivers two new findings. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using a regression discontinuity framework, I find that Medicare eligibility of an older spouse can crowd-out the health insurance coverage of a younger spouse. Medicare eligibility of older wives increases the likelihood that younger husbands are uninsured. Younger wives are less likely to be covered through an employer-based plan and more likely to have non-group coverage after an older husband turns 65. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The tests are couched in a general conditional heteroskedasticity framework with idiosyncratic shocks that are only required to have a finite variance if they are independent. We negligibly trim test equations, or components of the equations, and construct heavy tail robust score and portmanteau statistics. Trimming is either simple based on an indicator function, or smoothed. In particular, we develop the tail-trimmed sample correlation coefficient for robust inference, and prove that its Gaussian limit under the null hypothesis of no spillover has the same standardization irrespective of tail thickness. Further, if spillover occurs within a specified horizon, our test statistics obtain power of one asymptotically. We discuss the choice of trimming portion, including a smoothed p-value over a window of extreme observations. A Monte Carlo study shows our tests provide significant improvements over extant GARCH-based tests of spillover, and we apply the tests to financial returns data. Finally, based on ideas in Patton (2011) we construct a heavy tail robust forecast improvement statistic, which allows us to demonstrate that our spillover test can be used as a model specification pre-test to improve volatility forecasting.

Firstly, the stochastic variable model of construction timing selection of rail transit project is established. The Model consists of two maximization goals: operational value and guidable value. Rail construction cost, operating cost and other factors are selected as operational value indicators. Travel time saving, travel safety improvement, the reduction in social environment cost, and the savings in ground transportation facilities are selected as guidable value indicators. Secondly, the influence functions of construction time and Monte Carlo simulation are used to determine the optimal construction time which reflects the influence of social benefit on optimal construction time and provides the basis for selecting the corresponding development strategy of airport rail transit projects. The models built above are also applied to the case study in Nanjing Lukou International Airport. The results indicate that different considerations of social benefits and economic benefits yield significant difference in optimal construction time selection.

This era promises more robust insights into what works in health care. Several barriers, however, will need to be addressed if the full potential of these new data are fully realized; these will involve both policy solutions and stakeholder cooperation. Although a number of these issues have been widely discussed, we focus on the one we believe is the most important the facilitation of greater openness among public and private stakeholders to collaboration, connecting information and data sharing, with the goal of making robust and complete data accessible to all researchers. In this way, we can better understand the consequences of health care delivery, improve the effectiveness and efficiency of health care systems, and develop advancements in health technologies. Early real-world data initiatives illustrate both potential and the need for future progress, as well as the essential role of collaboration and data sharing.

This paper analyzes the water supply chain system with a single supplier and two distributors (local and foreign). Focusing on the water quantity competition between water distributors, we compare the impacts of competition intensity on profits of distributors and supply chain system under two-part pricing contracts versus wholesale price contracts. Our main findings include: (1) when the upstream water supplier offers distributors two-part pricing contracts, the water quantity and expected profits of both distributors decrease as the competition intensity increases. For the local distributor, water quantity and expected profit with a two-part pricing contract are less than those under a wholesale price contract, while for, the foreign distributor, water quantity and expected profit with a two-part pricing contract are greater compared to the case with a wholesale price contract. This reduces gaps of the two distributors in terms of both water quantity and expected profits. (2) Expect profits of water supply chain system decrease as the competition intensity increases, but the profits are still greater than that with wholesale price contracts. (3)With the two-part pricing contract, government can control the fixed costs to balance interests of both suppliers and distributors, and contribute to local economic development with reasonable allocation of water resources.","[Du Wen-yi; Ai Xing-zheng; Tang Xiao-wo] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China,"Du, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71102055, 71372140]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71102055,71372140)",,31,2,2,0,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,472,478,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600063,0

Our survey of 152 paired manufacturers (suppliers) and distributors (buyers) in China generally supports this argument, leading to a conclusion that interdependence is not a direct determinant of buyer supplier performance but a critical conduit that nourishes mid-range coupling behaviors, which in turn promotes a successful relationship.

Due to an inappropriate fiscal policy, however, the Czech economy has been hit by a second phase of recession. Of course, the economic slump had an impact on the labour market. The article first describes in detail the development of the gross domestic product of the Czech Republic and compares it with developments in selected countries of the European Union. Subsequently, attention is paid to the characteristics of the labour market: employment rate, unemployment rate and long-term unemployment. Because unemployment does not affect all groups equally, the paper includes an analysis of unemployment rates by age and educational groups. It turns out that the Czech Republic's entry into the European Union had a positive effect on the labour market. The development of unemployment after falling into recession confirms unemployment's cyclical nature. It is also evident that the highest unemployment rates in the Czech Republic belong to young people and people with the lowest levels of education.","[Pavelka, Tomas] Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Pavelka, T (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Business Adm, Dept Microecon, Prague, Czech Republic.",pavelkat@vse.cz,,,,,,,6,1,1,1,3,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,229,240,,,,,,12,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900015,0

In these multiple priors models, the decision maker is indifferent between holding a constant act or holding a non constant crisp act with the same expected utility, if it exists. In financial settings, we show that this indifference, together with the standard definition of monetary acts in the Anscombe-Aumann framework, implies that the investor ignores the variance of some assets, a behavior which conflicts with the assumption on which modern portfolio theory has been built. In this paper we establish the geometrical and topological properties of the set of priors that rule out the existence of non constant crisp acts. These properties in turn restrict what can possibly be an unambiguous financial asset. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We elicit risk and time preferences using multiple price list tests and their adaptations to the healthcare context. Risk and time preferences are compared in terms of switching points in the tests and the structurally estimated behavioural parameters. We find that doctors and patients significantly differ in their time preferences: doctors discount future outcomes less heavily than patients. We find no evidence that doctors and patients systematically differ in their risk preferences in the healthcare domain. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.
