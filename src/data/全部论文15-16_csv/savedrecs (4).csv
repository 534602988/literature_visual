It is hardly a simple issue; paper currency is deeply ingrained in the public's image of government and country, and any attempt to change long-standing monetary conventions raises a host of complex issues. The symbolic value of the euro, for example, as a flag for nascent European institutions, is hard to overstate. Nevertheless, it is important to ask whether currency in paper form has outlived its usefulness. Today, credit and debit cards are increasingly being used for even small transactions. And although today's cryptocurrencies fall far short of being true currencies-for one thing their prices are simply too volatile-the underlying technologies may ultimately strengthen the menu of electronic payments options.(1)","[Rogoff, Kenneth] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Rogoff, Kenneth] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Rogoff, K (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Rogoff, Kenneth/G-1894-2018",,,,,,24,34,42,1,25,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

This is inter alia attributed to the fact that substantial TFP growth is limited to a few industries. Because TFP growth is typically understood as technological progress, it is concluded that technology diffusion between sectors in Europe is hampered. We use EU KLEMS data sets to decompose sectoral TFP for nine European countries by means of a Malmquist approach in order to identify potential sources besides technical progress. Applying Harberger diagrams, we describe the sectoral distribution of TFP growth, efficiency gains and losses, economies of scale and technological progress. The analysis reveals that technological progress is quite evenly distributed across sectors in most European countries. The wide scattering of TFP growth is explained by deviating efficiency developments and the unused economies of scale. We conclude that the technology transfer between sectors in most European countries seems to work. Therefore, Europe in general does not need a new technology policy, but a further integration of the markets and a reduction of national market entry barriers. This requires further unification of pan-European standards in fields like trade and crafts codes or consumer protection policies.","[Schiersch, Alexander; Belitz, Heike; Gornig, Martin] German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany",DIW Berlin - Deutsches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung,"Schiersch, A (通讯作者)，German Inst Econ Res, D-10117 Berlin, Germany.",aschiersch@diw.de,,,,,,,39,3,3,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It questions the regulatory decision of mandatory shares listing, brought in 2002, whose aim was to encourage companies of certain size of shareholders' equity to enter the capital market. The effect of mandatory shares listing on further capital raising in public by companies has been analysed by means of secondary data and survey-based answers of their chief financial officers. Financing policies of voluntarily and mandatorily listed firms were compared for statistical differences. The research results have shown that mandatory listing of shares in the capital market has not spurred public companies to issue securities and raise funds in the capital market thereafter.","[Seba, Mihaela Grubisic] Inst Econ, Dept Ind Policy Innovat & Entrepreneurship, JF Kennedy Sq 7, Zagreb, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ); University of Zagreb,"Seba, MG (通讯作者)，Inst Econ, Dept Ind Policy Innovat & Entrepreneurship, JF Kennedy Sq 7, Zagreb, Croatia.",mgrubisic@eizg.hr,,,,,,,24,1,1,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Creating and finding the ideal design solution for packaging is an extremely complex process. Many characteristics of a packaging design can affect the level of customer satisfaction, where the different characteristics of the packaging tend to have a different significance. To make the problem more complex, the significance of characteristics of a packaging design is not the same for all customers. Therefore, creating and finding the ideal design solution for packaging often involves an evaluation of a number of variants, typically evaluated on the basis of multiple criteria, often with different significance. To provide an efficient approach for the selection of appropriate packaging, a framework for selecting the appropriate packaging design which meets customer preferences, based on the SWARA method and group decision making, is proposed. The usability and efficiency of the proposed framework is considered in the case of the selecting the appropriate packaging design for the wine of the autochthonous grape variety called Black Tamjanika. On the basis the considered examples, it can be concluded that SWARA method can be successfully used to solve many similar problems, and that in some cases may have some advantages over similar methods, such as AHP method or Conjoint Analysis. As an advantage of the proposed procedure can be mentioned a much smaller number of comparisons in pairs, compared with the AHP method, and much more comprehensible procedure for selecting the most acceptable alternative, compared with Conjoint Analysis. The proposed framework can also be easily adjusted to solve a significant number of MCDM problems.","[Stanujkic, Dragisa; Karabasevic, Darjan] Megatrend Univ, Pk Suma Kraljev Bb, Zajecar 19000, Serbia; [Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Inst Internet & Intelligent Technol, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Stanujkic, D (通讯作者)，Megatrend Univ, Pk Suma Kraljev Bb, Zajecar 19000, Serbia.",dragisa.stanujkic@fmz.edu.rs; darjankarabasevic@gmail.com; edmundas.zavadskas@vgtu.lt,"Stanujkic, Dragisa/J-5645-2019; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/Q-6048-2018; Karabasevic, Darjan/J-4913-2019","Stanujkic, Dragisa/0000-0002-6846-3074; Zavadskas, Edmundas Kazimieras/0000-0002-3201-949X; Karabasevic, Darjan/0000-0001-5308-2503",,,,,28,126,129,5,41,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

During times of expansion, systematic risks are relatively low; hence, the effect of raising systematic risks from portfolio diversification is slight. Consequently, the benefit of reducing individual risks dominates any loss from raising systematic risks, leading to a higher value for a bank by holding a diversified portfolio of assets. On the contrary, during times of recession, systematic risks are relatively high. It is more likely that the loss from raising systematic risks surpasses the benefit of reducing individual risks from portfolio diversification. Consequently, more diversification leads to lower bank values.

A majority of microcredit borrowers are women and since the prevalence of female borrowers is even greater among the very poor, there should be a positive correlation between female borrowers and financial performance. Most of the MFIs target women as preferred borrowers. However, no study to date has investigated the relationship between targeting women and MFI's sustainability with respect to profitability and yield. Utilizing a panel of 892 MFIs over a period of 10years, this study shows that increased proportion of women borrowers has a statistically significant positive impact on yield and financial performance of MFIs.

As a result, the investment gaps may be due to sex differences in production functions or in the costs of delivering human capital investments.","[Baker, Michael] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Baker, Michael; Milligan, Kevin] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Milligan, Kevin] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada",University of Toronto; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of British Columbia,"Baker, M (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Baker, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Milligan, Kevin/A-1627-2008","Milligan, Kevin/0000-0002-0998-0581","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council [410-2008-0346, 410-2011-0724]; NBER; SSHRC; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Canadian Foundation for Innovation; Statistics Canada",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); NBER; SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Canadian Foundation for Innovation(Canada Foundation for Innovation); Statistics Canada,"We thank workshop participants at Aarhus University, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Michigan State, National Taiwan University, Notre Dame, University of Waterloo, the Canadian Economics Association annual meetings, and the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute for helpful comments on earlier drafts of this research.

We test whether stagnation can be predicted by institutional characteristics and political shocks and compare the impacts of such variables with those of traditional macroeconomic variables. We examine the determinants of stagnation episodes using dynamic linear and nonlinear models. In addition, we analyze whether the effects of the included variables on the onset of stagnation differ from their effects on the continuation of stagnation. We find that inflation, negative regime changes, real exchange rate undervaluation, financial openness, and trade openness have significant effects on both the onset and the continuation of stagnation. Only for trade openness is there robust evidence of a differential impact. Open economies have a significantly lower probability of falling into stagnation, but once in stagnation they do not recover faster.","[Bluhm, Richard] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Hannover, Germany; [Bluhm, Richard; Szirmai, Adam] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [de Crombrugghe, Denis] Maastricht Univ, Maastricht, Netherlands",Leibniz University Hannover; Maastricht University; Maastricht University,"Bluhm, R (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Macroecon, Konigsworther Pl 1, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",bluhm@mak.uni-hannover.de,"de Crombrugghe, Denis Pascal/AGS-3426-2022","de Crombrugghe, Denis Pascal/0000-0002-0799-2984; Bluhm, Richard/0000-0002-5695-209X",Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD),Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD),We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD).,,63,3,3,0,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

Compared to homogeneous designs where all respondents get the same choice sets, heterogeneous designs allow for more variation in the attribute levels resulting in a larger amount of information on the respondents' preferences. Homogeneous designs have remained popular, however, because they are easier to generate and implement. In this paper, the question is raised about when homogeneous designs perform almost as well as heterogeneous designs under the Bayesian multinomial logit design framework. A simulation study is presented to identify the situations where the losses in estimation efficiency from using a homogeneous design are small and where they are large. When the residual degrees of freedom from using a homogeneous design are large and, to a lesser extent, the number of attributes and attribute levels are small, the efficiency losses are negligible and the use of a homogeneous design can be justified.

In this article we investigate the responsiveness of fiscal policy to business cycles in the Western Balkans, examining whether expenditure moved counter-cyclically and whether a larger proportion of expenditure was discretionary'; that is, related to the political cycle rather than economic conditions. Our results suggest that fiscal policy did not move counter-cyclically in the Western Balkans. Instead, countries overspent in the boom years and then reduced spending as a result of financing constraints during the crisis. Furthermore, the discretionary component of fiscal policy, defined here as spending unexplained by inertia and economic conditions, appears to be somewhat larger in the Western Balkans than in the European Union. This has important policy implications that affect the effectiveness of fiscal policy in dampening economic fluctuations.","[Koczan, Zsoka] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Kóczán, Z (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",zkoczan@imf.org,,,,,,,50,8,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,DEC,2016,28,4,,,,,468,486,,10.1080/14631377.2016.1225457,0.0,,,19,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EC2FF,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000387924400005,0

These findings call for more attention to be paid to unmarried caregivers, who presumably receive less support from family members and tend to be more vulnerable to negative income shocks than their married counterparts.","[Niimi, Yoko] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan",,"Niimi, Y (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.",niimi@agi.or.jp,,,"JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center on Behavioral Economics of the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science) KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center on Behavioral Economics of the Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The empirical work undertaken in this paper utilizes micro data from the Preference Parameters Study of Osaka University's twenty-first century COE Program 'Behavioral Macrodynamics Based on Surveys and Experiments' and its Global COE Project 'Human Behavior and Socioeconomic Dynamics.'

For this purpose, we use panel data model evaluation techniques to test the out-of-sample forecasting performance of competing models. We conclude that the evidence supports the hypothesis that increases in GDP per capita cause unidirectional poverty reduction, measured by the $1/day poverty rate, in the period 1970s-1980s. The results are similar when analysing low- and middle-income countries and mid-high- and very high-inequality countries separately. However, in the period 1980s-1990s, it is only statistically significant for low-income countries.","[Perez-Moreno, Salvador] Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Pérez-Moreno, S (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, Dept Appl Econ Econ Policy, Campus El Ejido, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",sperezmoreno@uma.es,"Pérez Moreno, Salvador/H-2290-2015","Pérez Moreno, Salvador/0000-0001-5207-7219",Department of International Development of the London School of Economics and Political Science,Department of International Development of the London School of Economics and Political Science,"The author thanks the Department of International Development of the London School of Economics and Political Science for their support, and particularly Diana Weinhold for her helpful comments.

However, there are social movements that try to occupy this particular sphere, yet deviate from the ideal of civic-minded organisations that support and sustain the democratic order. The main feature of such movements is the acceptance of violence as a means of political struggle and an anti-state and anti-egalitarian ideology. Since the beginning of the 1990s in Poland, aggressive homophobic rhetoric has escalated and the number of attacks on ethnic minorities, LGBT communities and leftists has increased greatly. Nevertheless, only a few such incidents aroused interest and action at the highest political level. Drawing on social movement theory and the methodology of protest event analysis, which uses information gleaned from national newspapers, we propose away to conceptualise the specific repertoires and targets of the Polish extreme right from 1990 to 2013 with a special emphasis on two kinds of repertoire: confrontational (violent) and conventional. Our general task is to show variations over time and analyse the three distinct time periods of this phenomenon: 1990-2000, 2001-2007 and 2008-2013. Our particular task is to test aspects of the mechanism of movement formalisation responsible for changes in the proportions of confrontational and conventional acts, actors responsible for such behaviour and targets related to these actions over time.","[Platek, Daniel] Polish Acad Sci, Warsaw, Poland",Polish Academy of Sciences,"Platek, D (通讯作者)，Polish Acad Sci, Warsaw, Poland.",dplatelal@gmail.com; pplucienniczak@gmail.com,,"Plucienniczak, Piotr/0000-0003-4814-695X",National Science Centre Poland [DEC 2012/05/N/HS6/03892],"National Science Centre Poland(National Science Centre, Poland)","The research project was financed by the National Science Centre Poland, decision number: DEC 2012/05/N/HS6/03892",,61,6,6,0,8,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

It shows that the sustainability of the EU in part or whole in normal times depends on member compatibility and coercive adaptation. If members share the same values, including a common vision of transnational governance and a commitment to mutual support (solidarity), the EU should be able to stick together through thick and thin. If, on the contrary, members hold incompatible outlooks on the distribution of transnational powers and solidarity, then the EU will be vulnerable to dismemberment. The EU today is prone to disunion because its members no longer share a common view of mutually acceptable transnational government and policy; powerful members insist upon bending recalcitrant members to their will (coercive adaptation), and participants hold contradictory attitudes towards solidarity on a variety of issues. Winston Churchill and Robert Schuman in the late 1940s hoped that their post-war Europe project would be something more than a single market; that it would become the cornerstone of European peace. They appreciated the value of cooperative economy, but considered material benefits icing on the cake. Brexit and Grexit are best seen in this larger perspective underscoring the wisdom of conciliation.","[Rosefielde, Steven] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Rosefielde, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, Chapel Hill, NC 27514 USA.",stevenr@email.unc.edu,,,,,,,43,3,3,1,29,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Drawing on Minsky's insights into financial instability and cycles, our framework combines household debt dynamics with behavioral asset price dynamics in a Keynesian macro model. We show that endogenous boom-bust cycles can emerge through the interaction between household debt and housing price dynamics. In this model, a long period of housing bubbles is characterized by increases in the profit share and the workers' indebtedness for most of the time.

We also suggest several other methodological refinements for estimates based on analysis of data from the American Time Use Survey: application of a vector of specialized replacement cost wage estimates for different child care activities rather than a single wage, and adjustments for the ratio of children to adults present and for the educational attainment of caregivers. Our estimates of the value of child care alone in 2004 and 2010 exceed previous estimates of the value of all non-market household production in the U.S. The end result is an upward adjustment of Gross Domestic Product by about 43 percent compared to previous adjustments of about 26 percent.","[Suh, Jooyeoun] Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, Dept Sociol, 74 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6HP, England; [Folbre, Nancy] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA 01003 USA",University of Oxford; University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Suh, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Time Use Res, Dept Sociol, 74 Woodstock Rd, Oxford OX2 6HP, England.",jooyeoun.suh@sociology.ox.ac.uk,,"Gershuny, Jonathan/0000-0001-5011-0257","ESRC [ES/F037937/1, ES/L011662/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-000-23-0704, ES/L011662/1, RES-000-23-0704-A, ES/F037937/1] Funding Source: researchfish",ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,35,32,31,1,13,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The analysis is based on bilateral sectoral M&A flow data and detailed information on policy barriers from a new database. Restrictive investment policies are found to reduce the probability of M&A inflows, controlling for bilateral frictions such as geography. This negative effect, however, is mitigated in countries with relatively large shares of manufacturing and (to a lesser extent) services in GDP. The same result holds for the number of M&A deals concluded. Findings are robust to accounting for the potential endogeneity of policy restrictiveness. The evidence suggests that the impact of policy is state-dependent and related to the composition of GDP in the target economy.","[Barattieri, Alessandro] Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy; [Barattieri, Alessandro] ESG UQAM, Montreal, PQ, Canada; [Borchert, Ingo] Univ Sussex, Sch Business Management & Econ, Dept Econ, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Mattoo, Aaditya] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",Collegio Carlo Alberto; University of Quebec; University of Quebec Montreal; University of Sussex; The World Bank,"Barattieri, A (通讯作者)，Coll Carlo Alberto, Turin, Italy.;Barattieri, A (通讯作者)，ESG UQAM, Montreal, PQ, Canada.",alessandro.barattieri@carloalberto.org,,"Borchert, Ingo/0009-0002-9512-5713",government of Norway through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Sweden through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of United Kingdom through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; UK Department for International Development (DFID),government of Norway through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of Sweden through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; government of United Kingdom through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; UK Department for International Development (DFID),"We would like to thank Ari Van-Assche, Arthur Blouin, Lucian Cernat, Jean-Claude Cosset and Barry Reilly for useful comments and suggestions.

We focus on three dimensions: (i) the ability to collaborate on problem-solving, (ii) joint decision-making in risk taking, and (iii) the willingness to cooperate in a public-goods game. Our main finding is that female groups are better at collaborating in problem-solving than male and mixed groups, and are also more willing to take risks. However, in the public-goods game we find no robust evidence of female groups contributing more than male and mixed groups. Our findings suggest that one reason why female loan groups often have higher repayment rates than male and mixed groups may be that female groups are more able to collaborate and find common solutions to common challenges.

As firms' practices are not fully observable by stakeholders, NGOs have applied pressure on firms by organizing information campaigns. This paper studies how media coverage affects how effective NGOs are in monitoring firms. We make use of large media shocks, generated by big sports events, that crowd out media coverage of firms' practices in event host and participant countries, and increase coverage of sponsors. We find NGOs to respond consistently. NGOs are more likely to disseminate critical coverage of firms sponsoring sports events, and are less likely to spotlight firms' practices in the event host and participant countries. We also find that NGOs take advantage of sports events to increase their impact on sponsors, since campaigns about sponsors trigger a significant negative reaction in the stock market.

In non-bifurcated systems, infringement and validity are decided jointly in the same proceedings at a single court. We build a model that shows the key trade-off between bifurcated and non-bifurcated systems and how it affects the incentives of plaintiffs and defendants in patent infringement cases. Using detailed data on patent litigation cases in Germany (bifurcated) and the U.K. (non-bifurcated), we show that bifurcation creates situations in which a patent is held infringed that is subsequently invalidated. We also show that having to challenge a patent's validity in separate court proceedings under bifurcation implies that alleged infringers are less likely to do so. We find this to apply in particular to more resource-constrained alleged infringers. Finally, we find parties to be more likely to settle in a bifurcated system. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This axiomatization rests on a pairwise comparison axiom that relates the winning probabilities of any pair of participants to their winning probabilities in a contest between the two of them. The resulting difference-form contest success function overcomes some of the drawbacks of the widely-used ratio-form. Contrary to other difference-form functions, the family we charaterize here can be scale invariant and have a positive elasticity of augmentation. By clarifying the properties of this family of contest success functions, this axiomatization can help researchers to find the functional form better suited to their application of interest.

We use a novel and comprehensive dataset that stretches beyond the traditionally considered tariff and trade defense measures to study the responsiveness of trade policies to business cycles and price competitiveness in the time period since the financial crisis. We find that the specter of protectionism has not been banished. Countries continue to pursue more trade-restrictive policies when they experience recessions and/or when their competitiveness deteriorates.

Based on a daily sample from 2009 to 2015 and the ARJI-GARCH models and copulas, our empirical results show that China's coke price and the world oil price are characterized by GARCH volatility and jump behaviors. Specifically, negative oil price shocks lead to falls in China's coke returns on the following day while positive oil prices have no significant effects. In addition, current coke returns positively respond to the very recent oil price jump intensity, and a time-varying and volatile lower tail dependence is found between the world oil price and China's coke price. Our results are expected to have implications for coke producers and users and policy makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Others have argued, however, that the currently high level of house prices may be rationalized by the low cost of financing, given the decline in interest rates over the last two decades. In this article, we assess these arguments through the lens of a simple asset pricing model applied to city-level data. We quantify the extent to which excess growth in Canadian house prices depends on the nature of the current regime governing real interest rates, expectations of rent growth in different cities and variations in property taxes.","[Head, Allen; Lloyd-Ellis, Huw] Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada",Queens University - Canada,"Head, A (通讯作者)，Queens Univ, Dept Econ, Kingston, ON, Canada.",heada@econ.queensu.ca,,,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"We are grateful to Lindsay Tu for research assistance.

The meta-synthesis of estimates collected from relevant studies shows that both the effect size and the statistical significance of the indirect effect of FDI, namely the productivity spillover effect, are obviously lower than those of the direct effect caused by foreign participation in company management through ownership. Moreover, the meta-regression analysis reveals that, probably due to the presence of publication selection bias, previous studies have not yet provided empirical evidence of a non-zero productivity spillover effect in the region.

To examine this issue, we conduct an empirical analysis in which we exploit the launch of a large stimulus programme in the autumn of 2008. We find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are better able to maintain their leverage levels and have better access to both short- and long-term debt compared with private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. We also find that preferential access to debt financing does not help SOEs improve their performance. Instead, SOEs perform significantly worse than private firms after the introduction of the stimulus programme. Moreover, political connections obtained through political participation help mitigate the discrimination that private firms face from Chinese banks and help improve firm performance. These results support the conjecture that China's state sector is advancing, with negative consequences for aggregate performance in the economy.","[Johansson, Anders C.] Stockholm Sch Econ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Feng, Xunan] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Liutai Rd 555, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",Stockholm School of Economics; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Feng, XN (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Liutai Rd 555, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",xunanfeng@gmail.com,"FENG, Xunan/JXM-4596-2024","Johansson, Anders C./0000-0002-2964-872X",Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302049],Ragnar Soderberg Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),Stockholm School of Economics (AJ) and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics (XF).

We know from the existing body of research that sentiment can predict future stock-market movements. However, do market movements affect sentiment? This article addresses these questions by testing whether market movements precede changes in the emotional well-being of the general public. Using Granger causality analysis, we compare how market movements affect public well-being during periods of increased (2010) and decreased (2012) volatility. The results show that 30-day-lagged returns are associated positively and significantly with the public's emotional well-being, and that this effect is stronger during periods of increased volatility. The results also show that this effect may persist for up to 120 days.","[Payne, Patrick; Browning, Christopher; Kalenkoski, Charlene M.] Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, 1301 Akron Ave, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA",Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"Payne, P (通讯作者)，Texas Tech Univ, Dept Personal Financial Planning, 1301 Akron Ave, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA.",patrick.payne@ttu.edu,"Kalenkoski, Charlene/M-1967-2019",,,,,,15,1,1,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using factor analysis, latent indices of de jure and de facto political institutions are constructed by exploiting several existing institutional datasets. The empirical evidence consistently suggests that societies with more extractive political institutions in Latin America, South Asia, Middle East and Eastern Europe have achieved systematically slower long-run economic growth and failed to catch-up with the West. The evidence confirms the primacy of de facto institutional differences over de jure institutions in causing differential growth and development outcomes over time. It also explains why highly concentrated political power and extractive political regimes inhibited the path of economic growth by setting persistent barriers to the engagement in collective action. In the long run, institutional differences account for up to two thirds of within-country development path and up to 83% of between-country development gaps.

A decoupling trend between real wages and productivity in the overall manufacturing sector is evident, but the dynamics within the sector is far from homogenous. Wages and productivity are further disaggregated into large-medium (LM) and cottage-small (CS) manufacturing firms and significant gaps between LM and CS firms are found. This paper challenges the conventional wisdom of negative wage elasticity with respect to employment. In contrast to the overall diverging trend between real wage and productivity in the overall manufacturing sector, a positive link between wages and productivity in the LM manufacturing industry has led to a positive correlation between wages and employment. This is analogous to the ideal situation where both productivity and wage increase, while the overall economy (employment and output) expands.","[Tadjoeddin, Mohammad Zulfan] Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Humanitarian & Dev Studies Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia",Western Sydney University,"Tadjoeddin, MZ (通讯作者)，Univ Western Sydney, Sch Social Sci & Psychol, Humanitarian & Dev Studies Grp, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",z.tadjoeddin@westernsydney.edu.au,,"Tadjoeddin, Mohammad Zulfan/0000-0002-4400-464X",,,,,48,8,9,1,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1354-7860,1469-9648,,J ASIA PAC ECON,J.

I use industry level import value as well as tariff schedules from these contracting party states that were graduated from the US Generalized System of Preferences list during the Uruguay Round. I exploit the rapid change in their tariff schedules from the best response to the optimal level within a single negotiation round to empirically test the terms-of-trade theory.

To do this, it is assumed that the stochastic dynamics of output and population are driven by mixed diffusion-jumps processes modulated by a Markov Chain. The most important results are that extreme sudden jumps in government spending per capita and in the population growth rate impact negatively the rate of per capita output growth. In particular, if there is a sudden sharp jump in the rate of population growth, then capital per capita suddenly decreases impacting negatively per capita output. Finally, the theoretical findings are supplemented with empirical evidence about the Mexican case obtained through a model that takes in account the volatility of the growth rates of the population and the per capita public expense as well as the surprises in the jump intensities of both variables.","[Estrella Castillo-Ramirez, Claudia] Univ Las Amer Puebla, Dept Finanzas & Contaduria, Puebla, Mexico; [Venegas-Martinez, Francisco] Inst Politecn Nacl, Escuela Super Econ, Mexico City 07738, DF, Mexico; [Lopez-Herrera, Francisco] Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Fac Contaduria & Adm, Div Invest, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP); Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Castillo-Ramírez, CE (通讯作者)，Univ Las Amer Puebla, Dept Finanzas & Contaduria, Puebla, Mexico.",ce1castillo@hotmail.com; fvenegas1111@yahoo.com; francisco_lopez_herrera@yahoo.com.mx,"López-Herrera, Francisco/F-9634-2010; Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/AAH-2212-2021","López-Herrera, Francisco/0000-0003-2626-9246; Venegas-Martínez, Francisco/0000-0003-1157-0298; Castillo Ramirez, Claudia Estrella/0000-0002-9927-3409",,,,,28,0,0,0,7,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

What effect this has had on economic growth is a subject of intense debate among politicians, policymakers, and economists. However, there has been less attention paid to the distributional effects of government spending even though economic inequality has grown greatly over the last generation and much social spending is at least indirectly intended to reduce inequality. The effects of government social spending in the United States on growth in family income at deciles of the income distribution were estimated.

Using rich vital statistics on infant health outcomes, this study evaluates the effect of introducing technologically advanced perinatal hospitals in 24 regions of Russia on infant mortality during the period 2009-2013. A 7-year aggregate panel dataset reveals that opening a perinatal centre corresponds to infant mortality reduction by 3.8 percent from the baseline rate, neonatal (0-28day) mortality by 7 percent and early neonatal (0-6day) mortality by 7.3 percent. We find that the perinatal centres help to save 263 additional infant lives annually, ranging from 3 to 25 lives in regions with different birth rates.

How should replacements be chosen when they differ in their uncertain ability to generate future incomes? As a particular version of that problem, we study the tree harvesting decision with two possible replacement species whose values as timber are stochastic and whose growth functions are deterministic. In the single-rotation (Wicksell) problem starting with a bare piece of land (an empty shop), it is optimal to choose and plant one species immediately if its current value is sufficiently high relative to that of the other species (the alternative equipment). However, if the species are insufficiently price-differentiated, it is preferable to leave the land vacant (the shop empty) despite the opportunity cost of doing so. In the repeated version of the problem, it is never optimal to leave the land bare provided the cost of replacement is null. Furthermore, the optimal harvest (tree retirement) age not only depends, on the price and current productivity of the trees in place but also on the price and productivity of the other species, because it may replace the current one. The harvest age reaches a peak at some critical threshold of the relative price that signals the necessity to switch to the alternative species; indeed this is when the opportunity cost of choosing one alternative replacement over the other is the highest. The land value (and also the value of the firm) is similar to an American option with free boundary, infinite expiry period, and endogenous payoff. The paper highlights the opportunity cost of alternative replacement options, and the central role of their volatility in both asset-retirement and replacement-choice decisions. All results are derived analytically; a numerical treatment by the penalty method completes the resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We study how hard leverage (binding commitment) influences soft leverage (appealing to a focal point) in a rich-context bargaining game known to exhibit competing claims to focality. In three treatments, our experiment varies one bargainer's ability to commit, holding the soft leverage condition fixed. As in previous studies, we observe that opening offers are consistent with the available soft leverage. The influence of hard leverage is most evident in the concessionary stage. Hard and soft leverage interact to influence outcomes: Hard leverage advantages its holder, yet settlements largely stay between the two focal points. We posit that focal points induce mutual expectations of bargainer social preferences that, when combined with the Nash bargaining solution, imply the comparative statics concerning the settlements observed. A similarly modified version of the Zeuthen-Harsanyi model of the bargaining process, agrees with the comparative statics on opening offers and concessions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Referees are typically appointed by a principal to be impartial, especially when unbiased referee judgment is vital for the accomplishment of the principal's objective. Answering whether referees make biased decisions and understanding the causes that lead referees to digress from their principal duty of impartiality is therefore fundamental from a theoretical point of view. At the same time, assessing the prevalence and origin of referee bias is germane to various domains of life. Referee bias is particularly relevant in sports, where partial decision-making can determine competition outcomes, which can have strong repercussions on athletes' careers and supporters' well-being.","[Dohmen, Thomas] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Sauermann, Jan] Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden",University of Bonn; Stockholm University,"Sauermann, J (通讯作者)，Stockholm Univ, Stockholm, Sweden.",jan.sauermann@sofi.su.se,"; Sauermann, Jan/M-9108-2016","Dohmen, Thomas/0000-0002-9321-0319; Sauermann, Jan/0000-0002-0550-0675",,,,,64,75,82,3,30,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

Using the British Workplace Employment Relations Survey 2004 we find that behaviour of employers and employees is consistent with the presence of gift-exchange motives: firms that screen applicants for personality are less likely to pay low wages and more likely to provide (non-pecuniary) benefits. Firms likewise benefit from employee screening, as they can implement more team-working and are generally more successful. Other human resource management practices only poorly predict these patterns. Moreover, there is no association between dismissals and personality tests, indicating that personality tests do not merely improve the fit between applicant and employer. Hence, we conclude that motivation based on gift-exchange motives is a plausible explanation for our results.","[Englmaier, Florian; Kolaska, Thomas] Univ Munich, Munich, Germany; [Leider, Stephen] Univ Michigan, Ross Sch Business, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Munich; University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Englmaier, F (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Munich, Germany.",florian.englmaier@econ.lmu.de; thomas.kolaska@econ.lmu.de; leider@umich.edu,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft [GRK 801],Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft(German Research Foundation (DFG)),Financial support from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft through GRK 801 (Kolaska) is gratefully acknowledged.,,38,4,4,0,18,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1610-241X,1612-7501,,CESIFO ECON STUD,CESifo Econ.

A generic model was developed to analyse the pooled data and give separate estimates of loss, hoarding and return rates, as well as the numbers of coins in circulation, hoarded and permanently lost. For standard design coins, no particular trend in attrition rate with denomination was observed and average lifetimes were generally more than 30 years. Higher attrition rates were observed for the commemorative 20 cent and 50 cent coins versus the standard design.

We present stylized facts on specific macro, micro and other drivers of invoicing based on 45 million Canadian import transactions. Four main results emerge. First, a large share of invoicing takes place in vehicle currencies that are neither the exporters nor the importers. Second, we document a novel link between the size of individual transactions and invoicing. Both the absolute value of a transaction and its relative size at the industry level matter. Third, the exchange rate plays an important role along three dimensions: exchange rate volatility, exchange rate regime, and currency transaction volumes in foreign exchange markets. Finally, we confirm the role of the market share of an exporting country at the industry level. Our results identify the most salient patterns in order to guide further developments in theoretical models of invoicing currency choice.

Hodgson's thought in his passage from political economy to Darwinian social science. The main argument is that Hodgson's tensions have their origins in two fundamental problems: the irrelevance of population thinking in analyzing both social structures and historical processes; and the necessity of different levels of abstraction in biology and social sciences. Hodgson resolves the first tension by shifting the focus of inquiry from the analysis of capitalism to the genesis of a single convention. But afterwards he is unable to come back down from the extremely abstract level of evolving systems (ranging from amoebas to humans) to the analysis of social problems in contemporary capitalism.,"[Liagouras, George] Univ Aegean, Dept Financial & Management Engn, Econ Anal, Chios, Greece",University of Aegean,"Liagouras, G (通讯作者)，17 Constadinoupoleos St, Holargos 15562, Greece.",g.liagouras@fme.aegean.gr,,"Liagouras, George/0000-0002-4410-2741",,,,,67,3,3,0,110,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

This lacking data hinders econometric studies of growth in this country. Series of such stocks are proposed in the literature, but most available empirical work on this topic suffers multiple deficiencies. The purpose of this article is to build the most reliable and longest possible statistical series of capital stocks for China. Our initial capital stocks are calculated on the basis of an output-capital ratio which is less approximate (and lower) than those generally provided. Our investment flows are consistent with the perimeters of the initial stocks. Our investment price indices are strictly tailored to the content of these stocks, and the unit root tests show that all the indices are non-stationary and cointegrated to the order of 2. This means they cannot be substitutes, as supposed in many other studies. Our depreciation rates are estimated by type of capital, under assumptions consistent with age-efficiency and retirement. Investment shares are used to approximate an overall capital structure and to calculate a total depreciation rate. Built from 1952 to 2014, our original series are available to econometricians seeking to conduct new empirical studies on China, over the long run. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Using Marx and Engel's concept of Utopianism as an analytical tool to distinguish between what is the work of 'cranks', and what of 'brave heretics', the paper examines four monetary responses to the crisis: (1) Positive Money's call for a state monopoly on money issuance; (2) the reintroduction of national currencies, in particular the drachma; (3) proposals for state-issued parallel currencies; and (4) grassroots or subaltern money networks of various types. The paper argues that the dominance of neoliberal ideology at a European Union level means that proposals for monetary reform at the international and national level are unlikely to be taken seriously by elites and consequently seem utopian in Marxian terms. There seems to be little political will to engage with the complexities of and potential opportunities of a more diverse monetary architecture within the Eurozone, and a perceived need to 'discipline' potentially 'irresponsible' governments like Greece's SYRIZA, although 'responsible' actors in the north of the Eurozone get more leeway. The potential of grassroots alternatives is also too often overstated. While alternative currency networks developed as part of the Greek crisis are not particularly well developed, alternative currency networks could work as sites of innovation, normalising the idea that there are progressive alternatives to Eurozone breakup.","[North, Peter] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"North, P (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Geog & Planning, Liverpool L69 8ZT, Merseyside, England.",P.J.North@liverpool.ac.uk,,,,,,,68,6,7,0,15,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

This contention is important since international financial market integration diminishes portfolio diversification benefits and creates contagion risk. We test this contention in this article in the context of the Australasian region. Australia and Asia have experienced very significant economic integration through a rapid growth in their bilateral trade. We utilize a battery of econometric techniques - cointegration, asymmetric generalized dynamic conditional correlations and panel regression models. As expected, we find that trade intensity significantly drives the interdependence between their stock markets in both the short run and the long run. Thus, given the ever increasing economic integration in this region, this finding implies that their stock markets face the risk of contagion, and that investors in these markets would also be confronted with the prospect of lower diversification benefits.","[Paramati, Sudharshan Reddy] Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang, Peoples R China; [Paramati, Sudharshan Reddy; Roca, Eduardo; Gupta, Rakesh] Griffith Univ, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld, Australia",Jiangxi University of Finance & Economics; Griffith University,"Paramati, SR (通讯作者)，Jiangxi Univ Finance & Econ, Int Inst Financial Studies, Nanchang, Peoples R China.",srparamati@yahoo.com,"Paramati, Sudharshan Reddy/AAN-3237-2021; Roca, Eduardo/JEO-3020-2023; Gupta, Rakesh/J-2793-2013","Paramati, Sudharshan Reddy/0000-0002-7958-9668; Gupta, Rakesh/0000-0001-6334-3420",,,,,34,27,27,0,15,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We find robust support for the main theoretical predictions. As we increase the payoff of a successful collective action (accruing to all players and only to those who contribute), the share of cooperators increases. The experiment also points to new avenues for refining the theory. We find that, as the payoff of a successful collective action increases, subjects tend to upgrade their prior beliefs as to the expected share of cooperators. Although this does not have a qualitative effect on comparative static predictions, using the reported distribution of beliefs rather than an ad hoc uniform distribution reduces the gap between theoretical predictions and observed outcomes. This finding also allows us to decompose the mechanism that leads to more cooperation into a belief effect and a range of cooperation effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The economic performance of this episode of the Japanese history has been dubbed the Japan syndrome. China has followed Japan's export-led growth model and the current world economy very much resembles the world economy following the oil crisis. It is then a legitimate question to ask whether China is likely to follow in Japan's steps and experience a major slowdown in its growth. The present paper shows that China can do a better job than Japan primarily because its large size allows the country to benefit from internal convergence. Based on the estimation of a growth equation using cross-country panel data, the paper forecasts that under reasonable assumptions about the growth rate of the world economy and China's investment rate, China could maintain reasonably high growth rates in the next 10 years.","[Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yao, Yang] Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Yao, Y (通讯作者)，Peking Univ, China Ctr Econ Res, Beijing, Peoples R China.",yyao@nsd.pku.edu.cn,,,,,,,6,2,2,1,8,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,SEP-OCT,2016,24,5,,,SI,,98,121,,10.1111/cwe.12176,0.0,,,24,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DW4FM,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383598000006,0

While some research paths lead to the innovation sought, others result in dead ends. Because firms benefit from their competitors working in the wrong direction, they do not reveal their dead-end findings. Time and resources are wasted on projects that other firms have already found to be fruitless. We offer a simple model with two firms and two research lines to study this prevalent problem. We characterize the equilibrium in a decentralized environment that necessarily entails significant efficiency losses due to wasteful dead-end replication and an information externality that leads to an early abandonment of the risky project. We show that different types of firms follow different innovation strategies and create different kinds of welfare losses. In an extension of the core model, we also study a centralized mechanism whereby firms are incentivized to disclose their actions and share their private information in a timely manner.

We find that student performance in high stakes exams significantly increases post ban, by about 0.07 standard deviations on average. These increases in performance are driven by the lowest-achieving students.

The second comes from big cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, in which a huge migration has given the companies opportunities to recruit excellent workers, making the resource allocation specialized and more efficient.

Our triple difference estimations exploit the response of export unit values to acquisitions of foreign affiliates and to changes in statutory corporate tax rates. This identification strategy corrects for a downward bias resulting from firms adjusting arm's length prices to obscure transfer price manipulations. We find that Danish multinationals reduce the unit values of their exports to low tax countries between 5.7 to 9.1 percent. This difference corresponds to a tax revenue loss of 3.24 percent of Danish multinationals' tax returns.","[Cristea, Anca D.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Nguyen, Daniel X.] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, Oester Farimagsgade 5, Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Oregon; University of Copenhagen,"Cristea, AD (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, 1285 Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",cristea@uoregon.edu; daniel.x.nguyen@gmail.com,,,,,,,41,64,72,7,45,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

In our simulations, the scaling up of public investments results in higher long-run output and consumption levels but requires a fiscal stabilization package in order to preserve fiscal sustainability. The effects on consumers' welfare after the fiscal adjustment are nontrivial. Our welfare analysis shows that consumers' welfare is increased when the government smooths the fiscal adjustment via higher borrowing and not through an increase in taxation. Moreover, the comparison between several stabilization packages via tax adjustment shows that higher welfare is achieved when the government relies mostly on taxation of capital as this allows higher levels of consumption. Lower fiscal costs that do not undermine fiscal sustainability can however be achieved if the government manages to reduce inefficiency in tax collection. Finally, we consider a change in the trade regime that causes a decline in revenues. We find that the higher fiscal burden required to preserve fiscal sustainability would completely wipe out the welfare gain of higher public investments.","[Ghilardi, Matteo F.; Sola, Sergio] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Ghilardi, MF (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",mghilardi@imf.org,,,,,,,30,1,1,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Using sovereign bond yield spreads with respect to Germany for a sample of ten central and peripheral countries from January 1999 to December 2012, we firstly examine the dynamic evolution of Granger-causality within the 90 pairs of yield spreads in our sample to detect episodes of contagion (associated with episodes of significant intensification in causality). Secondly, we make use of a logit model to explore whether there is evidence of pure contagion or fundamentals-based contagion, by trying to determine which factors might have been behind the detected contagion episodes. Our results suggest that contagion episodes are concentrated just after the inception of the EMU and matching the Global Financial Crisis, yielding more accurate and sensible indicators than those obtained from DCC-GARCH models used in prior studies. Indeed, they preceded the outburst of the Global Financial Crisis (causality intensification is detected from March 2008), and reached a peak during January May 2011. Furthermore, they underline the coexistence of pure and fundamentals-based contagion during the recent European debt crisis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We use recent developments in time series econometric methods to identify and quantify movements in both Twitter activity and Betfair prices, and compare the timings of the two. We find that the response of market prices appears somewhat sluggish and is indicative of market inefficiency, as Betfair prices adjust with a delay, and there is evidence for post-news drift.

In order to accommodate substantial heterogeneity (both observed and unobserved) across agents and markets, the article first develops a general framework for estimating and solving dynamic discrete choice models in continuous time that is computationally light and readily applicable to dynamic games. In the proposed framework, players face a standard dynamic discrete choice problem at decision times that occur stochastically. The resulting stochastic-sequential structure naturally admits the use of conditional choice probability methods for estimation and makes it possible to compute counterfactual simulations for relatively high-dimensional games. The model and method are applied to the retail grocery industry, into which Walmart began rapidly expanding in the early 1990s, eventually attaining a dominant position. We find that Walmart's expansion into groceries came mostly at the expense of the large incumbent supermarket chains, rather than the single-store outlets that bore the brunt of its earlier conquest of the broader general merchandise sector. Instead, we find that independent grocers actually thrive when Walmart enters, leading to an overall reduction in market concentration. These competitive effects are strongest in larger markets and those into which Walmart expanded most rapidly, suggesting a diminishing role of scale and a greater emphasis on differentiation in this previously mature industry.","[Arcidiacono, Peter; Bayer, Patrick] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Arcidiacono, Peter; Bayer, Patrick] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Blevins, Jason R.] Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Ellickson, Paul B.] Univ Rochester, Simon Grad Sch Business, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",Duke University; National Bureau of Economic Research; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Rochester,"Arcidiacono, P (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA.;Arcidiacono, P (通讯作者)，NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,65,41,58,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0034-6527,1467-937X,,REV ECON STUD,Rev.

To answer this question, we first develop a legislative bargaining model that describes negotiations over the allocation of distributive projects among legislators with different levels of seniority. Building on several predictions from the model, we develop two hypotheses for empirical testing. First, the adoption of term limits that results in a larger reduction in the variance of seniority within a legislature increases the amount of government spending. Second, legislatures that adopt stricter term limits increase the amount of government spending, while legislatures that adopt moderate term limits show no change in the amount. We provide evidence for these hypotheses using panel data for 49 US state legislatures between 1980 and 2010.","[Asako, Yasushi] Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Matsubayashi, Tetsuya] Osaka Univ, Osaka Sch Int Publ Policy, 1-31 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan; [Ueda, Michiko] Syracuse Univ, Dept Polit Sci, 100 Eggers Hall, Syracuse, NY 13210 USA",Waseda University; Osaka University; Syracuse University,"Asako, Y (通讯作者)，Waseda Univ, Fac Polit Sci & Econ, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan.",yasushi.asako@waseda.jp; matsubayashi@osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp; michiko.uedaballmer@gmail.com,,"Ueda, Michiko/0000-0001-6552-8090","JSPS [24830095]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24830095, 15H03317] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Yasushi Asako was supported by JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research Grant Number 24830095.,,28,0,0,0,2,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Working with data on households' deductible choices across three lines of insurance coverage and a model that nests expected utility theory plus a range of non-expected utility models, we perform a revealed preference analysis that yields household-specific bounds on the model parameters. We then impose stability and other structural assumptions to tighten the bounds, and we explore what we can learn about households' risk preferences from the intervals defined by the bounds. We further utilize the intervals to (i) classify households into preference types and (ii) recover the single parameterization of the model that best fits the data.

Banks are subject to reserve requirements and the central bank tenders reserves. Interbank payments redistribute holdings and banks trade with each other in a decentralized (over-the-counter) market. The central bank provides standing facilities where banks can either deposit surpluses or borrow to cover shortfalls of reserves overnight. The model provides insights on liquidity, trading volume, and rate dispersion in the interbank market features largely absent from the canonical models in the tradition of Poole (1968) and fits a number of stylized facts for the Eurosystem observed during the recent period of unconventional monetary policies.

The presence of rational speculative bubbles might explain these episodes of price booms followed by rapid reversals. Relying on the present value model of commodity pricing we test for the presence of periodically and partially collapsing price bubbles for 31 millet markets in Niger by using right-tailed recursive unit root tests. Once controlled for observed fundamentals, one-third of price series manifest explosive behaviour akin to a bubble. Under the rational bubble hypothesis, the results indicate that the traders operating in separate geographic areas differ with respect to information quality. A competing interpretation is that some large traders use their market power to charge higher prices to consumers.","[Bonjean, Catherine Araujo] Univ Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, 65 Bd F Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Simonet, Catherine] Overseas Dev Inst, London, England",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Bonjean, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, 65 Bd F Mitterrand, F-63009 Clermont Ferrand, France.",c.simonet@odi.org.uk; c.simonet@odi.org.uk,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the programme 'Investissements d'avenir' [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the programme 'Investissements d'avenir'(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),This work was supported by the Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government through the programme 'Investissements d'avenir' [ANR-10-LABX-14-01].,,29,6,6,0,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

First we use structural vector autoregressive models to identify negative structural shocks to consumer confidence, which are used as a proxy for recession fear. We then apply probit models and time-varying-transition-probability Markov-switching autoregressive models to investigate how the lack of consumer confidence affects the probability of recession. We find that recession fear leads to a higher probability of economic downturns. Furthermore, strong evidence exists that an increase in market pessimism may push the economy from an expansion state to a recession state. We also find weaker evidence suggesting that a lack of consumer confidence may trap the economy in the depressed regime longer.

We present an agent's dynamic decision model that explicitly deals with two types of investments and directly allows for contract regime switching by varying the probability of contract renewal. The fact that the unobservable investment in human capital is complementary with the agent's effort produces a result that increasing the probability of contract renewal increases investment and effort, with the consequent increase in production. We also show that there exists a specific level of investment in human capital, for which the investment in physical capital is profitable. We test these theoretical predictions using contract settlement data for the production of hatching eggs which covers the period when the contract changed from short-term to long-term.

The standard procedure has been to read Marx's Capital as an analysis that begins at a high level of abstraction and moves towards more concrete concepts. Our alternative approach posits that the forms of value in the Marxist system evolve from more concrete towards more abstract forms of wealth that increasingly separate from and obscure labour exploitation. Our procedure therefore replaces the dominant interpretation of 'successive approximations' employed by most scholars. We develop a broader account of Marx's project alongside textual evidence retrieved from many of his writings. We also provide a new way to incorporate the monetary, financial and rentier forms of wealth into Marx's labour value theory.

This model enables us to show that national regulatory authorities (NRAs) maximizing domestic welfare have incentives to increase termination rates above the social optimum to extract rent from international call termination. Excessive termination rates distort prices but transfer surplus from foreign to domestic consumers via intensified network competition. The model can explain the regulation of termination rates through rate floors. International network ownership and deregulation are alternatives to combat the incentives of NRAs to distort termination rates.

We focus on the economic value and consequences of protecting and disclosing personal information, and on consumers' understanding and decisions regarding the trade-offs associated with the privacy and the sharing of personal data. We highlight how the economic analysis of privacy evolved over time, as advancements in information technology raised increasingly nuanced and complex issues. We find and highlight three themes that connect diverse insights from the literature. First, characterizing a single unifying economic theory of privacy is hard, because privacy issues of economic relevance arise in widely diverse contexts. Second, there are theoretical and empirical situations where the protection of privacy can both enhance and detract from individual and societal welfare. Third, in digital economies, consumers' ability to make informed decisions about their privacy is severely hindered because consumers are often in a position of imperfect or asymmetric information regarding when their data is collected, for what purposes, and with what consequences. We conclude the article by highlighting some of the ongoing issues in the privacy debate of interest to economists.","[Acquisti, Alessandro] Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA; [Taylor, Curtis] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Wagman, Liad] IIT, Stuart Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60616 USA",Carnegie Mellon University; Duke University; Illinois Institute of Technology,"Acquisti, A (通讯作者)，Carnegie Mellon Univ, Heinz Coll, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",,"Taylor, Curtis/GWR-1891-2022; Acquisti, Alessandro/AAW-3231-2020","Acquisti, Alessandro/0000-0001-6582-6178",Alfred P.

For most of the countries, the speed of convergence is higher in the R&D expenditures of governments than in the R&D expenditures of higher education institutions and businesses. Differences in the speed of convergence could be explained by differences in industry structures, in cultural trajectories, in macroeconomic conditions, or in internationalisation. The more dissimilar countries are in terms of these factors the more likely they are to have divergent paths. Furthermore, differences in R&D convergence by institutional sectors could be due to the different goals of each sector and to the relative weight of each sector in the entire economy.","[Altuzarra, Amaia] Univ Basque Country, Fac Econ & Business, Bilbao, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Altuzarra, A (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country, Fac Econ & Business, Bilbao, Spain.",amaia.altuzarra@ehu.es,"Altuzarra, Amaia/A-4476-2019","Altuzarra, Amaia/0000-0002-9256-0050",,,,,48,5,6,0,15,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

We show that the signaling effects triggered by an improvement in the incentives to attend higher education can explain this fact, as well as the increase in the number of college graduates. Under imperfect credit markets and wealth heterogeneity, higher education is not only a signal of ability but also of individuals' (parents') wealth. General conditions on the distribution of wealth guarantee that after an increase in incentives to attend higher education, the absence of a college degree becomes a more evident signal of low ability. This results in a reduction in low-skill wages but not necessarily in increased high skill wages. The increased incentives to enroll in college can either arise from a skill-biased technology change or an improvement in access to higher education. An important difference is that while skill-biased technology change always results in an increase in the college premium, that is not necessarily the case when the increased incentives to enroll arise from improved access to higher education.","[Balart, Pau] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Balart, P (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",pbalart@eco.uc3m.es,"Balart, Pau/I-4213-2019","Balart, Pau/0000-0002-9088-537X",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity [ECO2012-34581],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitivity(Spanish Government),"I gratefully acknowledge the comments from Antonio Cabrales, Caterina Calsamiglia, Guillermo Caruana, David Perez-Castrillo, and Pedro Rey-Biel as well as to the participants in the seminars in UAB, UC3M, URV, SAEE ECORE.

The case of central-bank independence,JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,POLITICAL-ECONOMY; INFLATION; DEMOCRACY; CRISES; IMPACT,"Many countries have undertaken central-bank independence reforms, but the years of implementation differ. What explains such differences in timing? This is of interest more broadly, as it sheds light on factors that matter for the speed at which economic reforms come about. We study a rich set of potential determinants, both economic and political, but put special focus on a cultural factor, i.e. social trust. We find empirical support for an inverse u-shape: Countries with low and high social trust implemented their reforms earlier than countries with intermediate levels. We make use of two factors to explain this pattern: the need to undertake reform (which is more urgent in countries with low social trust) and the ability to undertake reform (which is greater in countries with high social trust). Overall, our findings imply that culture matters for institutional change.","[Berggren, Niclas] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden; [Berggren, Niclas] Univ Econ, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ KIE, Prague, Czech Republic; [Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov] HUI Res, Stockholm, Sweden; [Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov] Dalarna Univ, Dept Econ, Borlange, Sweden; [Hellstrom, Jorgen] Umea Univ, Umea Sch Business & Econ, Umea, Sweden",Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Prague University of Economics & Business; Dalarna University; Umea University,"Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, Stockholm, Sweden.;Berggren, N (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Dept Inst Environm & Expt Econ KIE, Prague, Czech Republic.",niclas.berggren@ifn.se; Sven-Olov.Daunfeldt@hui.se; jorgen.hellstrom@umu.se,"Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/N-5386-2019; Berggren, Niclas/N-3578-2019","Berggren, Niclas/0000-0003-0673-5123; Hellstrom, Jorgen/0000-0002-9067-0379; Daunfeldt, Sven-Olov/0000-0002-1013-8623",Johan and Jakob Soderbergs Stiftelse; Torsten Soderbergs Stiftelse; Swedish Research Council,Johan and Jakob Soderbergs Stiftelse; Torsten Soderbergs Stiftelse; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),"The authors wish to thank Christian Bjornskov and Frank Streif for very helpful advice, and participants in the Australasian Public Choice Society Conference in Singapore, 2013, the WINIR conference in London, 2014, the WWW for Europe Conference at Mendel University in Brno, 2014, and the European Public Choice Society Conference in Groningen, 2015 for good comments, and in Berggren's case, Johan and Jakob Soderbergs Stiftelse, Torsten Soderbergs Stiftelse and the Swedish Research Council for financial support.",,47,13,13,0,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

Therefore, using the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) index as a proxy for the countries' political risk situation, we empirically investigate the impacts of OPEC's political risk on the Brent crude oil prices, based on several Structural Vector Autoregression (WAR) models. The main empirical results indicate that: (1) The political risk of OPEC countries does have a significant and positive influence on Brent crude oil prices in the sample period from January 1998 to September 2014, and the most significant positive influences appear in about one and a half year and last about a year. (2) OPEC's integrated political risk contributes to 17.58% of the oil price fluctuations in the sample period, which is only lesser than that of the oil demand shocks (34.64%). (3) Compared with the political risk of OPEC countries in North Africa and South America, the political risk of OPEC countries in the Middle East contributes most to the oil price fluctuations. (4) Among the eight components of the political risk in OPEC, the internal conflicts contribute most to the oil price fluctuations in the sample period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Our findings indicate that free entry leads to socially excessive or insufficient market entry, depending on the commitment of investment in common property resources. In the non-commitment case, where quantities and investment are simultaneously chosen, there is a possibility of insufficient entry. However, in the pre-commitment case, where investment is chosen at a prior stage, free entry leads to excess entry and a reduction in common property resources. Interestingly, in this case, the excess entry results of Mankiw and Whinston (RAND J Econ 17:48-58, 1986) hold even without entry costs or economies of scale.

We then drop assumptions that turn out to be unnecessary for this result. While spillover effects of taxation may call for central rules for taxation, as long as spillover effects do not depend on the intra-regional distribution of the tax burden, decentralized taxation plus tax coordination is found superior to a union-wide tax.","[Lipatov, Vilen] Compass Lexecon Brussels, Brussels, Belgium; [Lipatov, Vilen; Weichenrieder, Alfons] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons] Goethe Univ Frankfurt, D-60054 Frankfurt, Germany; [Weichenrieder, Alfons] Vienna Univ Business & Econ, Vienna, Austria",Ifo Institut; Goethe University Frankfurt,"Lipatov, V (通讯作者)，Compass Lexecon Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.;Lipatov, V (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",vilenl@gmail.com; a.weichenrieder@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,"State of Hessen initiative for research, LOEWE.; [2014-11531]","State of Hessen initiative for research, LOEWE.;","This article is part of the research program of the Center 'Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe' (SAFE) funded by the State of Hessen initiative for research, LOEWE.

The results indicate that the limits of public debt are negatively related to economic growth and exhibit, from a given level of debt, an inverted U behaviour regarding the relationship between economic growth and public debt. Briefly, the high levels of public debt are coincident with reduced rates of economic growth and rising levels of inflation. Our results for three specific geographical areas resemble those of the overall analysis, despite some differences. In North African countries, the growth rates of the gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation also show an inverted U behaviour as the ratio of public debt/GDP increases. The highest rate of economic growth is recorded when the ratio of public debt/GDP is below 30% of GDP and corresponds to an average inflation rate of 5.33%. An identical behaviour of the GDP growth rates and inflation also appears in Sub-Saharan countries until the third interval (60-90%). However, the highest growth rate of the GDP and GDP per capita is registered when the public debt/GDP ratio is in the second interval (30-60%). For the countries of the Southern Africa Development Community, the highest average rate of economic growth (6.8%) is similar to North African countries, when the ratio public debt/GDP is below 30% of GDP, with an average inflation rate of 11%.

Among the salient and controversial topics discussed are the adequacy of GDP for the twenty-first century, the deficiencies of GDP as a measure of welfare, and the strange way in which banking services are calculated.","[Syrquin, Moshe] Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA",University of Miami,"Syrquin, M (通讯作者)，Univ Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124 USA.",,,,,,,,36,4,4,0,18,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

Productive capabilities have been shown to be highly predictive of future economic growth, yet the country-level variables associated with them remain relatively unknown. In this paper, we empirically explore what variables are systematically associated with productive capabilities using a model averaging framework that can handle a very large number of potential explanatory variables without the need for arbitrary model selection. In order to estimate our dynamic panel specification, we propose a novel Bayesian averaging of classical estimates procedure based on the simple and efficient bias-corrected least squares dummy variable estimator. Our baseline and robustness analysis consider a large number of variables, sample periods and model priors. We find that there is persistence (as measured by the lagged dependent variable) and that variables, such as commodity terms of trade, energy availability, government consumption, capital per worker, arable land and capital inflows show a strong and robust association with capabilities.","[Daude, Christian] OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75016 Paris, France; [Nagengast, Arne] Deutsch Bundesbank, Frankfurt, Germany; [Perea, Jose Ramon] OECD, Dev Ctr, F-75016 Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD); Deutsche Bank; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Daude, C (通讯作者)，OECD, Dept Econ, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, F-75016 Paris, France.",christian.daude@oecd.org,,"Nagengast, Arne/0000-0002-9479-5371",,,,,59,7,7,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Inflation, state fragility, external debt and commodity terms of trade volatility were positively associated, while trade openness and a more favourable fiscal balance/GDP ratio were negatively associated with sovereign CDS spreads. Yet the relative importance of economic fundamentals in the pricing of sovereign risk varies over time. The key factors are trade openness and state fragility in the pre-crisis period, the external debt/GDP ratio and inflation in the crisis period, and inflation and the public debt/GDP ratio in the post-crisis period. Asian countries enjoy lower sovereign spreads than Latin American countries, and this gap widened during and after the crisis. Trade openness was the biggest factor behind Asia's lower sovereign spreads before the crisis, and inflation during and after the crisis. The results imply that external factors were paramount in pricing sovereign risk prior to the crisis, but internal factors associated with the capacity to adjust to adverse shocks gained prominence during and after the crisis.","[Aizenman, Joshua] Univ Southern Calif, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Aizenman, Joshua] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jinjarak, Yothin] Univ London, London, England; [Park, Donghyun] Asian Dev Bank, Mandaluyong, Philippines",University of Southern California; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of London; Asian Development Bank,"Jinjarak, Y (通讯作者)，Univ London, SOAS, Banking & Finance, DeFiMS, London, England.",yj5@soas.ac.uk,"Jinjarak, Yothin/F-2746-2010","Jinjarak, Yothin/0000-0001-5262-3718",,,,,15,20,22,2,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1361-374X,1468-0106,,PAC ECON REV,Pac.

By contrast, when the information is boring but important people recommend others to learn it, but are less likely to learn it themselves. In five experiments participants were randomly assigned the role of chooser or adviser. Experiment la showed choosers paid real money for useless information, whereas advisers recommended others to resist the temptation. Experiment 1b showed this choice-advice difference persisted when participants introspected on their decisions in a hypothetical setting. Using an introspection task, experiment 2 demonstrated choosers' decisions relied more heavily on curiosity, whereas advisers' recommendations relied on the value of the information. Next, we examined the case where information is boring but important. In a hypothetical setting, experiment 3a revealed the vast majority of advisers recommended to learn the important information, whereas choosers were less enthusiastic about the boring information. Finally, experiment 3b demonstrated the majority of choosers chose not to pay actual money to learn the important information, whereas the majority of advisers recommended paying to learn it. We conclude by offering ways to utilize curiosity to encourage people to learn important information. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The final-product-specialisation type has been adopted as the basis of mainstream trade models that champion the benefits of free trade. The division-of-production-operations type can be extended through the works of Marx (transition to modern industry based on forms of manufacture), Young (industrial differentiation) and Hirschman (linkages). Through this some countries started reaping more benefits from increasing returns, engendering incipient uneven development that aggravates under unrestricted economic integration between them and the trailing countries. In the modern era the leading countries' trans-national corporations have further shaped the international division of production operations, resulting in different forms of enclave development when their activities are unregulated. Under recently reached multi-lateral agreements that limit the use of subsidies and investment measures and strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights, uneven development would be sustained. Some future research directions are considered.","[Ho, P.

With human capital, the wage is no longer the price of time - which is, instead, the wage plus returns to work experience. This has important implications: first, labour supply elasticities become functions of both preference and wage process parameters. One cannot estimate them separately. Second, the data appear consistent with larger elasticities than prior work suggests. Third, contrary to conventional wisdom, permanent tax changes can have larger effects on current labour supply than temporary changes. Fourth, effects of permanent tax changes grow over time.","[Keane, Michael P.] Univ Oxford, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Keane, Michael P.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia",University of Oxford; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Keane, MP (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",michael.keane@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,"Keane, Michael/R-6329-2019; Keane, Michael/O-2840-2013","Keane, Michael/0000-0002-3918-1377","Australian Research Council [FF0561843, FL110100247]; AFTS Secretariat of the Australian Treasury; ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Aging Research at UNSW [CE110001029]; Australian Research Council [FF0561843] Funding Source: Australian Research Council",Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); AFTS Secretariat of the Australian Treasury; ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Aging Research at UNSW(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"I thank the editor Kjell Salvanes and an anonymous referee for very helpful comments.

We find that financial frictions reduce the impact of trade liberalization, suggesting that they constitute an important trade barrier.","Univ Torcuato Di Tella, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Leibovici, Fernando] York Univ, 1034 Vari Hall,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada; Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada",Universidad Torcuato Di Tella; York University - Canada; University of British Columbia,"Leibovici, F (通讯作者)，York Univ, 1034 Vari Hall,4700 Keele St, Toronto, ON M3J 1P3, Canada.",flei@yorku.ca,"Kohn, David/ABA-1138-2021; Leibovici, Fernando/B-9800-2017","Leibovici, Fernando/0000-0002-0072-0441; Kohn, David/0000-0003-1480-7035",Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); C.V.

Stochastic dominance is used to examine whether the stochastic volatility level dominates with respect to maturity. The empirical analyses of energy-futures price series generally provide mild support for this hypothesis in terms of the first two degrees of stochastic dominance. Each type of futures has its own properties with respect to the maturity effect. SV levels play a role in determining the testing outcome. The hypothesis is more likely to hold at low SV levels. The higher the volatility level, the less likely the SHME will hold because SV surges to its peak level regardless of maturity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

(i) Does the inflation (price) factor affect nominal exchange rate? (ii) Do relative interest rates affect a country's exchange rate? (iii) Do the price and interest rate effects hold if controls for non-parity factors are embedded in tests? The quarterly data series for this study are taken over 55 years. The traditional parity condition model with price and interest rate as criterion variables is extended to take into account recently-verified non-parity factors, namely trade, productivity and foreign reserves. The results affirm that both parity factors and also the non-parity factors significantly affect the exchange rates of Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In our view, these findings relating to four free-floating currencies help extend our knowledge on how currency behavior is consistent with parity and non-parity theorems using a relevant methodological approach in this study.","[Ariff, M.] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia; [Zarei, A.] Sunway Univ, 5 Jalan Univ, Bandar Sunway 47500, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Putra Malaysia; Sunway University,"Ariff, M (通讯作者)，Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia.",ariff13@gmail.com,"Ariff, Mohamed/U-6072-2019; ZAREI, ALIREZA/M-5790-2019","ZAREI, ALIREZA/0000-0002-2843-798X",,,,,52,6,6,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The empirical results show that property of stationarity of relative real wage varies across different regions. Specifically, stationarity prevails in eastern and western regions, implying the regional development strategies launched there enhance labor migration, commodity trade and thus wage convergence. In contrast, almost all provinces in northeastern and central regions show non-stationarity, indicating the strategies there are less effective in promoting wage convergence.

What is missing from this literature is a general theoretical framework that explains the conflicting goals of properly applying the law and responding to social norms and the consequences of the law. We build a theoretical framework where law enforcement officials care about both reputation and performance. Outside evaluations assess the quality of the decision making of the officers, but can be influenced by strategic challenging of the sanctioning by the suspected violators. We first establish that reputational concerns can distort law enforcement, encouraging either over-enforcement or under-enforcement of the law, depending on the prior beliefs of violations and the observed signal. Introducing strategic challenging by the violator eliminates over-enforcement and allows for an even larger reduction in application of the law by less-skilled officers. Connections to empirical findings of distortions in law enforcement, along with an extension to deterrence are highlighted.","[DeAngelo, Gregory; McCannon, Bryan C.] W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Ctr Free Enterprise, 1601 Univ Ave,326, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA",West Virginia University,"DeAngelo, G (通讯作者)，W Virginia Univ, Dept Econ, Ctr Free Enterprise, 1601 Univ Ave,326, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",gregory.deangelo@gmail.com,,", Gregory/0000-0002-1648-3153",,,,,33,5,8,0,8,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Coupled with a CGE model, we consider the distributional effects of the significant capital outflows faced by the Argentinean economy at the end of its Currency Board, in a context with significant macroeconomic similarities to the present crisis in Greece. Both the relatively straightforward 'non-parametric' approach and the more complex behavioural approach lead to distributional results that are consistent with the data, suggesting that both are viable alternatives. Looking forward, it would be desirable for researchers to look for additional evidence regarding the distributional effects that these microsimulation models can illuminate for given macroeconomic shocks.

We argue that such wastage of resources was tolerated in our evolutionary past by Nature because it served fitness-enhancing functions. In this study, we propose and model one such function. We demonstrate how the honoring of sunk costs could have arisen as a commitment device that Nature found expedient for scenarios where conflicts over temptations between the emotional and rational centers of the brain might sabotage long-term investments.

The key prediction of the model, borne out in data from OECD countries over the years 1990-2012, is that an increase in government preferences for pursuing economic development relative to income equality makes countries' horizontal tax reactions stronger.

In contrast to the existing literature, we use forecasts submitted by individual Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members to uncover members' implicit loss function. Our key finding is that the loss function of FOMC members is asymmetric: FOMC members incur a higher loss when they underpredict (overpredict) inflation and unemployment (nominal and real growth) as compared to their making an overprediction (underprediction) of similar size. We also find that an asymmetric loss function, in some cases, weakens evidence against forecast rationality, though results depend on the variable being projected and the subgroup of FOMC members being studied. Furthermore, we add to the recent controversy on the relative quality of FOMC forecasts compared to staff forecasts.

We revisit this finding for the 27 EU member states from 2006 to 2011, introducing individual negative financial expectations as a further driving factor. We also distinguish between Western and Eastern European countries. In the period of Eastern EU enlargement after 2005, Euroskepticism increased by one third while income inequality on average remained stable. Negative financial expectations are positively related to Euroskepticism in the West and non-significantly negatively related in the East. This suggests that Westerners interpret European integration as a threat, while Easterners view it as a chance. In addition, income inequality lost its role in old Europe. An increase of one Gini point decreases the probability of Euroskepticism by half a percentage point in the West, while it has no impact in the East.","[Ritzen, Jo; Wehner, Caroline; Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Zimmermann, Klaus F.] Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany; [Ritzen, Jo; Wehner, Caroline] Maastricht Univ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",IZA Institute Labor Economics; University of Bonn; Maastricht University,"Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany.;Zimmermann, KF (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Bonn, Germany.",Zimmermann@iza.org,,"Wehner, Caroline/0000-0003-3527-7985",,,,,63,5,5,1,28,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Using Irish Household Budget Survey data, we show that tax reform results exhibit a low degree of sensitivity to changes in the underlying demand system. An adjustment for a mass of observed zero-expenditures in the data for certain goods produces most sensitivity in the tax reform results. Even in these cases, many of the tax reform recommendations remain constant. Including demerit good arguments in the tax reform model can substantially alter the tax reform recommendations relating to demerit goods. Notably though, when we include these arguments in the tax reform model, the results are particularly insensitive to changes in the underlying demand system.","[Savage, Michael] ESRI, Dublin, Ireland; [Savage, Michael] UCD, Dublin, Ireland; [Savage, Michael] TCD, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University College Dublin; Trinity College Dublin,"Savage, M (通讯作者)，ESRI, Dublin, Ireland.;Savage, M (通讯作者)，UCD, Dublin, Ireland.;Savage, M (通讯作者)，TCD, Dublin, Ireland.",michael.savage@esri.ie,,,ESRI,ESRI,"I would like to thank David Madden for countless helpful comments on this paper.

A new non-parametric method of producing stochastic projections is explored. This allows for the complex nature of the observed joint distributions of relevant variables and their time paths. Stochastic projections of a range of policy responses are produced, allowing for uncertainty regarding the world interest rate, productivity growth and the growth rates of two components of per capita government expenditure. The probability of exceeding a given debt ratio in each projection year, using a particular tax or expenditure policy, can then be evaluated. Examples of tax policies designed to achieve a target debt ratio are examined.

A possible reason, and also a critique of laboratory corruption games, is that the experiment may fail to trigger the intended immorality frame in the minds of the participants, leading many to question the very raison d'etre of laboratory corruption games. To test this idea, we compare behavior in a harassment bribery game with a strategically identical but neutrally framed ultimatum game. The results show that fewer people, both as briber and bribee, engage in corruption in the bribery frame than in the alternative and the average bribe amount is lesser in the former than in the latter. These suggest that moral costs are indeed at work. A third treatment, which relabels the bribery game in neutral language, indicates that the observed treatment effect arises not from the neutral language of the ultimatum game but from a change in the sense of entitlement between the bribery and ultimatum game frames. To provide further support that the bribery game does measure moral costs, we elicit the shared perceptions of appropriateness of the actions or social norm, under the two frames. We show that the social norm governing the bribery game frame and ultimatum game frame are indeed different and that the perceived sense of social appropriateness plays a crucial role in determining the actual behavior in the two frames. Furthermore, merely relabelling the bribery game in neutral language makes no difference to the social appropriateness norm governing it. This indicates that, just as in the case of actual behavior, the observed difference in social appropriateness norm between bribery game and ultimatum game comes from the difference in entitlement too. Finally, we comment on the external validity of behavior in lab corruption games.","[Banerjee, Ritwik] Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark",Aarhus University,"Banerjee, R (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Aarhus, Denmark.",rbanerjee@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,43,49,54,0,30,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

However, available evidence shows that valuing attributes of credence goods (such as organic products) while using stated preference methods faces additional obstacles compared to other normal goods. In this study, we examine consumers' preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for health and environmental attributes of organic products in Nigeria. We employ an approach that allows us to adequately capture the value of organic products by linking part of the heterogeneity across respondents to differences in scale, while making use of indicators of survey engagement, without risks of endogeneity bias and measurement error that arise from the deterministic methods. The empirical results show that market for organic products exists in Nigeria, with reduction in pesticide residues attribute attracting the highest value, followed by the certification programme. Furthermore, we observe that increases in the latent engagement variable lead to a greater probability of agreement with statements relating to survey understanding and realism, and hence more substantive output.","[Bello, Muhammad; Abdulai, Awudu] Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Abdulai, A (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Food Econ & Consumpt Studies, Kiel, Germany.",aabdula@food-econ.uni-kiel.de,"Abdulai, Awudu/AAI-3517-2021",", Awudu/0000-0003-4618-2789",,,,,39,12,13,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

It seeks to investigate the effect of land restitution on poverty reduction among the beneficiaries. We run two-stage least squares models of access to nature, per capita income and poverty status on the use of restituted land, among other variables. Our results suggest that the Khomani San beneficiaries have gotten more access to natural resources but that the use of restituted land has neither increased per capita income nor reduced poverty. In fact, the use of restituted land has contributed to increased poverty. Therefore, land restitution should become part of a broader, carefully crafted rural developmental strategy for it to be effective in reducing poverty. Otherwise, land restitution risks enabling indigenous communities to continue with their traditional way of life, and in fact thereby keep them poor.","[Dikgang, Johane; Muchapondwa, Edwin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Dikgang, J (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",jdikgang@uj.ac.za,"Dikgang, Johane/ABB-7214-2021","Dikgang, Johane/0000-0002-8076-4443; Muchapondwa, Edwin/0000-0002-3400-7548",ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa); Swedish Research Council Formas; Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency),ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa); Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas); Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency),"Funding from ERSA (Economic Research Southern Africa), the Swedish Research Council Formas and Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) is gratefully acknowledged.

Perceived deficiencies include inadequate allowance for simultaneity, and expectations hypotheses inconsistent with the structure of models employed. This paper re-visits the debate, first to address critics' major concerns, and second because in the view of the present authors, the debate closed on an unduly pessimistic note. This paper develops a simultaneous, rational expectations model of the USD/GBP market, with functional relationships for hedgers, speculators and a spot rate equation. The model is estimated with data contemporaneous to the debate, including a period during which the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission did not collect data on traders' open positions. Using the results of post-debate research on tests for stationarity with missing observations, the model, using only public information, outperforms a random walk in post-sample forecasts of the spot rate. Recent microstructure models of the exchange rate based on order flow have re-kindled the forecasting debate. The model developed here, however, is differentiated from these microstructure models, first because order flow utilises both public and private information, and second because the microstructure models do not directly address critics' concerns.","[Goss, Barry A.] Futures Markets Res Associates Pty Ltd, 5-33 Irving Rd, Toorak, Vic 3142, Australia; [Avsar, S.

The island has, since the early 1970s, adopted an export-led growth strategy to power its economy. However, a constant decline over the last decade in the exports to gross domestic product (GDP) ratio has resulted in a worsening current account to GDP ratio, which is now a cause for concern. Using a three-regime, self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model, this paper finds that the Mauritian economy may converge to either of two current account equilibria, namely a deficit of 9% or a surplus of 2.5% on a seasonally adjusted basis. A dynamic simulation exercise suggests that the Mauritian current account is more likely to switch from surplus to deficit equilibrium than from deficit to surplus equilibrium. Given that the prevailing deficit is in the vicinity of the deficit equilibrium, structural policies aiming to boost productivity and efficiency are indispensable for pulling Mauritius out of the deficit trap, the more so since the island has been experiencing a continuous erosion of trade preferences, which formerly enabled it to have privileged access for its exports to the EU market.","[Khadaroo, Ahmad Jameel] Univ Mauritius, Dept Econ & Stat, Reduit, Mauritius",University of Mauritius,"Khadaroo, AJ (通讯作者)，Univ Mauritius, Dept Econ & Stat, Reduit, Mauritius.",j.khadaroo@uom.ac.mu,,,,,,,49,5,5,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

We contribute to the extant literature by using the bank-level ratio of foreign ownership and applying five individual sub-indices of financial reforms from 50 countries. Within the emerging Asia and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries, our findings show that a higher ratio of foreign ownership in a bank can enhance competition, whereas a liberalization policy on banking supervision instead mitigates this positive relation between foreign ownership and competition. Conversely, the liberalization on bank privatization in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries significantly increases competition. Thus, financial reforms do matter to the foreign ownership-bank competition nexus. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A supplier values the input for this use value and for its foreclosure value, because once the input is acquired, it is unavailable to rivals. An unfettered auction often ensures the welfare-maximizing allocation of an input increment. However, it can fail to do so when the input would increase relatively rapidly the competitive position of a rival with a moderate competitive disadvantage.

Product market and labour market-related rigidities affect negatively the export performance both on their own and via a negative effect on the effectiveness of R&D and slow down the speed of adjustment.

The sample is divided into three groups of countries: those in the European Monetary Union (EMU); the standalone economies outside the EMU but members of the broader European Union (EU); and other developed economies. The main subject of examination across all three groups is the impact of macroeconomic variables on sovereign borrowing costs. EU countries have experienced high financial stress and a rapid rise in the credit default swaps (CDS) spreads during the EMU debt crisis. A nonlinear vector smooth transition autoregressive model is applied to investigate such a regime change in the finance-output link using sovereign CDS and industrial production index. The paper finds that regime-switching takes place rather suddenly in most EMU countries. The study concludes that due to the potential spillover effects in the EU as a whole, the individual country macroeconomic indicators were less reflected in the financial stress and spillover and contagion effects became dominant.","[Gevorkyan, Arkady; Semmler, Willi] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA",The New School,"Gevorkyan, A (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, New York, NY 10011 USA.",gevoa020@newschool.edu; semmlerw@newschool.edu,,"Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,40,3,3,0,12,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,FEB,2016,43,1,,,,,1,35,,10.1007/s10663-015-9286-2,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DC1TB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368998600001,0

We also examine their distributional impacts on producers and consumers in the sugar, oil and biofuel sectors and on government revenues. Additionally, we undertake a normative analysis for the purpose of comparing the welfare and environmental impacts of existing policies with those justified by the goal of maximizing social welfare and addressing market failure. The ex-post analysis of the outcomes for different stake-holders in the fuel and sugar sectors provides insights on the likely political-economic factors guiding policy choices. We find that the status quo policies are likely to have been motivated by the objectives of increasing oil exports, raising government revenue and promoting rural development through the sugarcane sector and have had a significant adverse effect on fuel and sugar consumers, aggregate social welfare and greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil.

As a result, the Federal Reserve should have moved much more quickly to shore up financial markets. Our article tests the hypothesis that the impact of the housing market crash on the financial system could have been anticipated. Using a VAR model along with impulse response functions and variance decompositions, we examine the link between housing market mortgage debt shocks and the financial intermediaries' credit market behaviour. We find important connections between key macroeconomic variables and the credit behaviour of these financial institutions. However, using the pre-crisis data, we find that housing market debt shocks fail to have an impact on the credit markets accessed by these firms. These results support the notion that the impact of this crisis on the financial system could not have been anticipated given the information available at the time.","[Schaffer, Marc] St Norbert Coll, Dept Econ, De Pere, WI USA; [Wheeler, Mark] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Arts & Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Western Michigan University,"Wheeler, M (通讯作者)，Western Michigan Univ, Dept Econ, Coll Arts & Sci, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",mark.wheeler@wmich.edu,,,,,,,16,1,2,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The focus is specifically on soft paternalist policies, because these often work with non-transparent nudges that are considered as manipulative in some contributions to the literature. We show that those soft paternalist policies that are manipulative indeed collide with three criteria of consumer sovereignty, reflective sovereignty, and citizen sovereignty that can be argued to represent common constitutional interest of citizens. On the other hand, we argue that the set of paternalist policies that is deemed acceptable on the constitutional level is restricted to non-manipulative instruments, and their application as government policies is limited to cases with stable and very homogenous preferences. However, we also argue that competitive markets are capable of supplying many mechanisms that allow individuals to cope with problems in their decision-making processes on a private level.","[Schnellenbach, Jan] Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Inst Econ, Chair Microecon, Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany",Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus,"Schnellenbach, J (通讯作者)，Brandenburg Tech Univ Cottbus, Inst Econ, Chair Microecon, Erich Weinert Str 1, D-03046 Cottbus, Germany.",jan.schnellenbach@b-tu.de,"Schnellenbach, Jan/A-1291-2015",,,,,,68,12,12,2,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,FEB,2016,69,1,,,,,135,156,,10.1111/kykl.12106,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DB9LD,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368836500006,0

For example, more fuel-efficient cars encourage more car travel. This study is the first to quantify this effect for personal automotive travel in Great Britain. We use aggregate time series data on transport activity, fuel consumption and other relevant variables over the period 1970-2011 and estimate the direct rebound effect from the elasticity of both vehicle and passenger kilometres with respect to: a) vehicle fuel efficiency (km/MJ); b) the fuel cost of driving ( pound/km); and c) road fuel prices ( pound/MJ). We estimate a total of 108 models, paying careful attention to methodological issues and model diagnostics. Taking changes in fuel efficiency as the explanatory variable, we find little evidence of a long-run direct rebound effect in Great Britain over this period. However, taking changes in either the fuel cost of driving or fuel prices as the explanatory variable we estimate a direct rebound effect in the range 9% to 36% with a mean of similar to 19%. This estimate is consistent with the results of US studies and suggests that around one fifth of the potential fuel savings from improved car fuel efficiency may have been eroded through increased driving. We also show how the normalisation of distance travelled (per capita, per adult or per driver) affects the results obtained. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We found that asset allocation information for pre-mixed investment options normally presented as a pie chart or a table had the largest impact on choices. Participants preferred investment options with more, and more evenly weighted, asset class allocations. This novel application of a 1/n strategy differs significantly from the existing findings of naive diversification in 'mix-it-yourself conditions where participants spread resources evenly across funds or categories. When asset allocation information was included, coefficients on return and risk information had unexpected signs, but when asset allocation was omitted, participants preferred options with high Sharpe ratios. We also demonstrate that none of the five prescribed information items was significant in explaining individual choices of more than 35% of participants. These findings highlight that information contained in prescribed investment disclosures might not be used in the manner intended by the regulator. The results raise important methodological questions about the way 'user-friendly' information prescribed by regulators is validated before being legislated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The theoretical basis is informed by the Cambridge corporate model originally proposed by Kaldor (1966), which is reinterpreted here as a theory for q. The core of the Kaldorian q theory is a negative long-run relation between q and growth rates, a negative relation between q and propensities to consume, and the fact that q can be different from 1 in the long-run equilibrium. We generalize this model through a medium-scale stock-flow consistent (SFC) model, which introduces important post Keynesian aspects missing in the Kaldorian model, such as endogenous money, a financial system, and inflation. We extend the model to include a more realistic treatment of firms' financial structure decisions and allow the interdependence between these decisions and dividend policy. Numerical simulations confirm that the original Kaldorian relations between q and growth rates and propensities to consume hold, but unlike the original model, in our model, q is not independent of how firms finance their investment. We also confirm the possibility of q being different from 1 in the long run. Finally, we contrast this post Keynesian q theory with the Miller-Modigliani dividend irrelevance proposition and the neoclassical investment and financial theory. It is shown that its validity depends crucially on the value taken by q: for q values different from 1 the proposition will not hold and dividend policy will be relevant for equity valuation. Therefore, post Keynesian q theory stands against the main predictions of mainstream finance and constitutes an alternative for developing a macroeconomic theory for equity markets.","[Bernardo, Javier Lopez; Stockhammer, Engelbert] Univ Kingston, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England; [Martinez, Felix Lopez] EOI, Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scotland",Kingston University,"Bernardo, JL (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Dept Econ, Kingston Upon Thames, Surrey, England.",,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",Ramon Areces Foundation (Madrid),Ramon Areces Foundation (Madrid),"The authors gratefully acknowledge helpful comments and suggestions from Paul Auerbach, Malcolm Sawyer, Dimitris Sotiropoulos, Rafael Wildauer, two anonymous referees, and participants of the twelfth conference on Developments in Economics Theory and Policy, in Bilbao, June 2015.

Such effectiveness cannot adequately be evaluated if the Taylor Rule estimation follows the standard regression methodology that has been criticized in the literature to be econometrically incorrect. Using a time-varying parameter estimation methodology, we find that equity momentum as an input in the Taylor Rule does not contribute to changes in Fed Funds.

This consideration highlights the quest for a more comprehensive approach to diffusion studies.","[Camerani, Roberto] Univ Sussex, SPRU Jubilee Bldg, Brighton, E Sussex, England; [Corrocher, Nicoletta; Fontana, Roberto] Bocconi Univ, CRIOS Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy; [Fontana, Roberto] Univ Pavia, Dept Econ & Management, Pavia, Italy",University of Sussex; Bocconi University; University of Pavia,"Corrocher, N (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, CRIOS Dept Management & Technol, Milan, Italy.",nicoletta.corrocher@unibocconi.it,,"Camerani, Roberto/0000-0002-5187-0378; Corrocher, Nicoletta/0000-0003-2642-8227",,,,,55,4,4,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Customs clearance to cross borders is critical to enhancing the competitiveness of both importers and exporters. As such, each country has adopted an authorized economic operator (AEO) program to promote the security of both imported and exported cargo as well as expedite freight movements. The purpose of this paper is to discover the factors which should be taken into account to utilize an AEO program, and to look at the causal relations between these factors. Design/methodology/approach - This study conducted a survey on 201 AEO programs in Korea. With partial least squares, the structure model is tested using the coefficient value of the determination of the dependent variable, explained by the sign and scale of the path coefficient, statistical significance, and leading variable. Moreover, this study performed bootstrap re-sampling to verify all paths and significance. Findings - It was found that AEO external pressure, training capacity, and sustainability are shown to have a significant impact on AEO performance. Furthermore, for the group with a high level of AEO application, training capacity and AEO sustainability are shown to have a greater effect on AEO performance. For the group with a low level of AEO application, internal regulation is shown to have a bigger impact on AEO performance. Originality/value - This study sets itself apart from previous ones in that it examines AEO application for trade security and facilitation with regard to customs, which would affect global supply-chain management.","[Chang-Bong, Kim; Kwon, Seung-Ha] Chung Ang Univ, Dept Trade & Logist, Seoul, South Korea; [Chun, Hong-Uk] Korea Customs Serv, Seoul, South Korea",Chung Ang University,"Kwon, SH (通讯作者)，Chung Ang Univ, Dept Trade & Logist, Seoul, South Korea.",seunghkwon@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,5,5,3,33,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Variety aspects of international railway operations as well as a large number of companies operating in the global railway market causes that currently we use a lot of independent systems that often should work together. The lack of international standards for data structures and protocols causes the need to design and maintain multiple interfaces. This approach is inefficient, time consuming and expensive. Therefore, the initiative to develop an open, international standard for the exchange of data for railway application was established. This standard was named railML. In this paper, we will also focus on a new topological model suitable to be used with members of the UIC (International Union of Railways) RailTopoModel. This International Railway Standard (IRS) define data model and a corresponding data exchange format. Unified and standardised data structures, which are application-independent and producer-independent, should simplify data exchange between railway systems and reduce number of interfaces which are required for systems cooperation.

In addition, the potential impacts of some special events that may affect system capacity (new interconnection, market coupling, increase in share of intermittent generation) on spot and forward markets are considered and evaluated. Daily spot prices from February 2000 to March 2013 of nine European electricity spot markets (APX-UK, APX-NL, Belpex, EPEX-FR, EPEX-DE, IPEX, Nordpool, Omel and OTE) and month-ahead prices in four markets (French, British, German and Dutch) from November 2007 to December 2012 are investigated. Results show that unit root tests, which are generally used in the literature to test market integration, are inadequate for assessing electricity spot market convergence, because spot prices are found to be fractionally integrated and mean-reverting time series. Furthermore, spot price behaviour and their association with different markets change over time, reflecting changes in the EU electrical system. One-month-ahead prices, by contrast, were found to have become more resilient to shocks and to follow more stable trends. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The methodology utilized allows us to analyse the specific impact of various components of the tax/benefit system upon these returns.","[Flannery, Darragh] Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland; [O'Donoghue, Cathal] Rural Econ Res Ctr, Limerick, Ireland",University of Limerick,"Flannery, D (通讯作者)，Univ Limerick, Limerick, Ireland.",,"flannery, darragh/F-2722-2015; O’Donoghue, Cathal/AAW-4109-2021","flannery, darragh/0000-0001-7192-8621; O’Donoghue, Cathal/0000-0003-3713-5366",,,,,38,0,0,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

Drawing on data from Mexico's Adultos Mayores Program (Older Adults Program) - a cash transfer scheme aimed at rural adults over 70 years of age - we evaluate the effects of this program on the well-being of the beneficiary population. Exploiting a quasi-experimental design whereby the program relies on exogenous geographical and age cutoffs to identify its target group, we find that the mental health of elderly adults in the program is significantly improved, as their score on the Geriatric Depression Scale decreases by 12%. We also find that the proportion of treated individuals doing paid work is reduced by 20%, with most of these people switching from their former activities to work in family businesses; treated households show higher levels of consumption expenditures (on average, an increase of 23%). Very importantly, we also rule out significant anticipation effects that might have been associated with the program transfers. Thus, overall, we find that non-contributory pension schemes targeting the poor in developing countries can improve the well-being of poor older adults without having any indirect impact (through potential anticipation effects) on the earnings or savings of future program participants.

This legal obligation has been intentionally breached by business entities in the Czech and Slovak Republic for a long time because of their ignorance of the relevant legislation, their indifference as well as their fear of disclosing data from the accounting prior to the competition and the concern about possible abuse. If a company fails to disclose its financial statements and annual reports, it can be viewed as a company where corruption and possible distortion of the economic state can occur, including the possibility of hiding their bad financial situation. This paper aims to define the basic information related to financial statements and annual reports, the meaning, steps and form of disclosing financial statements and annual reports, including the analysis of the current state in the context of global requirements for reporting and disclosing information within the ongoing globalization trends. The paper also mentions possible sanctions for the failure to comply with the legal obligations, including own proposals and recommendations to eliminate this negative situation. Although there are several options to penalize the non-disclosure of fmancial statements and annual reports in the collection of the documents in the public register, these penalties and sanctions are rarely used in practise, and accounting entities are well aware of that fact, which leads to the long-term non-compliance with the obligation.","[Hakalova, Jana; Palochova, Marcela] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic; [Tusan, Radoslav] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Financial, Letna 9, Kosice 04001, Slovakia",Technical University of Ostrava; Technical University Kosice,"Hakalova, J (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Dept Accounting & Taxes, Fac Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",jana.hakalova@vsb.cz; marcela.palochova@vsb.cz; radoslav.tusan@tuke.sk,"Tusan, Radoslav/C-3024-2016; Hakalová, Jana/G-1702-2018; Palochova, Marcela/G-3392-2018","Hakalová, Jana/0000-0001-9123-6809; Palochova, Marcela/0000-0001-5619-5001",,,,,15,3,3,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,603,610,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800075,0

We discuss various aspects of the contemporary baseball business, and compare them with the American Major League Baseball (MLB). One distinctive characteristic common to both Asian leagues is the governance structure, where member teams are owned by major conglomerates. We explore this characteristic to assess the business objectives of the Korean Baseball Organization and the Nippon Professional Baseball, and find that their sources of competitive balance differ from those in MLB. Our conclusion suggests that their business objective should begin to move slowly toward one similar to that of MLB, and safeguards should be implemented to maintain a reasonable competitive balance. We also conclude that sports diplomacy and the creation of international competition are important because international competition and the success of national teams are critical for fan demand.","[Jang, Hayley; Lee, Young Hoon] Sogang Univ, Seoul 121742, South Korea",Sogang University,"Lee, YH (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Dept Econ, Sinsoo Dong 1, Seoul 121742, South Korea.",yhnlee@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Young/AFO-2829-2022; Jang, Hayley/AAG-5569-2019","Lee, Young/0000-0002-1104-9446;",,,,,34,13,13,5,32,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

It adopts a gravity model for unbalanced panel data of China's 146 important trading partners over the period of 2002-2012. To eliminate the effects of FDI in determining the linkage between IPR and exports, the panel excludes the destination countries and territories that invest in China. The results reveal that the level of IPR protection in destination countries has a positive impact on China's flow of exports. Further analysis on data disaggregated by IPR score demonstrates that a higher level of IPR protection in destination countries and territories is positively linked with China's exports of these items in each of the IPR protection clusters and indicates a strong market power effect by the interplay between R&D expenditure and IPR in the destinations. Finally, both market power and market expansion effects are found to be prevalent in the destinations, as implied by the coefficient of IPR protection disaggregated by income level of China's export destinations. The results generally resemble those in the literature that describe the linkage between IPR protection and trade flows.","[Kabir, Mahfuz] Bangladesh Inst Int & Strateg Studies, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Salim, Ruhul] Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia",Curtin University,"Salim, R (通讯作者)，Curtin Univ, Curtin Business Sch, Sch Econ & Finance, Perth, WA 6845, Australia.",Ruhul.Salim@cbs.curtin.edu.au,,,,,,,53,5,5,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The weighting matrix can also be thought of as a measure of multivariate prudence. The sentiment channel is governed by two forces working in opposite directions; one is related to the consumer's aversion to long-run risk and the other is related to the consumer's aversion to short-run risk. The greater is the aversion to long-run risk relative to the aversion to short-run risk, the higher is the magnitude of the sentiment effect.

First, the 'paradox of thrift' and the 'paradox of costs' hold, meaning that lower saving rates generate higher growth rates while higher real wages generate higher profit rates, but the magnitude of the impact depends on the initial status of income distribution and monetary policy. Second, changes in autonomous labour-saving innovations might explain the phenomenon of the 'New Economy' of the second half of the 1990s within an alternative framework.

Globalization trends in design have caused a steady increase of competition in the market of furniture which is manifested by rising individualism of customers. The solution of this problem is a custom manufacturing in the furniture industry, because of the production of less quantity of product types in different variants according of customers' requirements. Custom manufacturing products are more expensive than products of mass production, because these are atypical products manufactured to meet specific requirements and customer wishes. Competitive company is one that can produce faster, cheaper with better quality. This intensified process of the world globalization is related in the large extend the enterprises of custom manufacturing, too. These companies cannot compete with large enterprises in the area of prices but their priority should be the quality for the acceptable price and creation of the relationships with customers which can be achieved by orientation on the effective quality management based on process approach. The aim of the presented paper was to propose a model for implementation of system of management quality in to the furniture companies which works on the principle of custom manufacturing. The model is based on the single customers' requirements and respects the partial utilization of elements of the mass production. The aspect of mass production in the model is based on the use of methods of measurement and evaluation of processes performance in management quality what is benefit for the custom company not only in the area of quality but in the whole efficiency.

A distinction is drawn between estimation uncertainty which is the focus of Ley's research and model ambiguity which arises in Ley's work and is the focus of my own recent proposal. The discussion is organized around the prior covariance matrix, which needs to be diagonal to support all-subsets regressions. The basic question addressed here is: what aspects of the prior covariance matrix can be taken as known, what aspects can be estimated and what aspects require a sensitivity analysis because they are neither known nor estimable. When diagonality is in doubt, we are more-or-less forced into a model ambiguity sensitivity mode because the data are never rich enough credibly to estimate the full prior covariance matrix. When diagonality is assumed, the data evidence, though very limited, can help to estimate the diagonal elements, but this literature has not yet produced a compelling conventional treatment which will necessarily include both estimation uncertainty and model ambiguity as they relate both to the diagonal values and to the rest of the prior covariance matrix.

Third, and most importantly, better corporate governance increases liquidity of corporate bonds.

Local and multinational firms' relative positions in the supply chain are typically determined through the use of input-output tables. For a panel of Romanian firms, we show that the level of industry aggregation in these tables and the applied spillover definitions bear an important impact on estimated spillover effects. We find that the total impact of foreign presence - irrespective of the channel - is considerably larger when detailed IO-tables are used. When more aggregated tables are used, one is likely to misclassify a considerable number of supplier-client activity as within-industry competitive activity. Including within-industry supply and use in the measures of supplier-client activity results in a further increase of the spillover effect on local suppliers, whereas the within-industry spillover effect disappears.","[Lenaerts, Karolien] Fund Sci Res FWO Vlaanderen, Brussels, Belgium; [Lenaerts, Karolien; Merlevede, Bruno] Dept Gen Econ, Ghent, Belgium; [Lenaerts, Karolien] Ctr European Policy Studies CEPS, Brussels, Belgium; [Merlevede, Bruno] IWH Halle, Halle, Germany; [Merlevede, Bruno] HUBrussel, Brussels, Belgium",Ghent University; Leibniz Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung Halle (IWH),"Lenaerts, K (通讯作者)，Fund Sci Res FWO Vlaanderen, Brussels, Belgium.;Lenaerts, K (通讯作者)，Dept Gen Econ, Ghent, Belgium.;Lenaerts, K (通讯作者)，Ctr European Policy Studies CEPS, Brussels, Belgium.",karolien.lenaerts@ceps.eu,,"Merlevede, Bruno/0000-0002-5707-1155; Lenaerts, Karolien/0000-0002-3299-4690",Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen),Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (FWO-Vlaanderen)(FWO),"The authors would like to thank the editor, two anonymous referees, Beata Javorcik, Glenn Rayp, Koen Schoors, Mariana Spatareanu, and the participants of the European Trade Study Group 2011 (Copenhagen), the Final WIOD Conference 'Causes and Consequences of Globalization' 2012 (Groningen), the 20th International Input-Output Conference 2012 (Bratislava) and the 3rd International Workshop: 'Economics of Global Interactions: New Perspectives on Trade, Factor Mobility and Development' 2012 (Bari), for their useful comments and suggestions.

To achieve this we develop an equilibrium model of wage determination and employment which extends the current literature on equilibrium wage determination with matching and provides a bridge between some of the most prominent macro models and microeconometric research. The model incorporates productivity shocks, long-term contracts, on-the-job search and counter-offers. Importantly, the model allows for the possibility of assortative matching between workers and jobs due to complementarities between worker and job characteristics. We use the model to estimate the potential gain from optimal regulation and we consider the potential gains and redistributive impacts from optimal unemployment benefit policy.

With this analysis, we would like to highlight the financial ratios but also some other important ratios that will provide us with a clearer picture regarding financial performance of Croatian public hospitals due to the Rehabilitation Law of public institutions enforced from January 2013. Therefore, based on that change the authors will be able to conclude whether the hospitals were more effective in the years after the introduction of the Rehabilitation Law. Public hospital managers are responsible for ensuring the provision of high quality health care services to patients, with the lowest costs for taxpayers (Value for money). At the national level, it is important to make a suitable and optimal allocation of limited financial and physical resources taking care of continuous improvement of health care patients. Financial indicators provides managers and different stakeholders (e. g. the Ministry of Health and Croatian Health Insurance Fund) with hospital quality information necessary for the successful and balanced management of hospitals, and the efficient allocation of budgetary resources.

To reap the full gains of natural resource income, politicians need to remain in office over time. Hence, even a rent-seeking incumbent who prioritizes his own welfare above that of citizens, will want to provide voters with goods and services if it promotes his probability of remaining in office. While this incentive benefits citizens under the rule of rent-seekers, it adversely motivates benevolent policymakers to short-term overprovision of goods and services. In equilibrium, politicians of all types indulge in excessive resource extraction, while voters reward policies they realize cannot be sustained over time. Moreover, overextraction might even be reinforced as voters become better informed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

A Panel VAR Model Approach for Baltic and Scandinavian Countries,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Emigration; Trade; Exports; Foreign Direct Investment; Remittances Received; VAR Model,INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION; TRADE,"This paper analyzes causality relationships between mobility factors such as emigration, trade balance, export, foreign direct investment and remittances received. A panel VAR model is developed for a group of Scandinavian and Baltic countries (7) to test for causalities between those mobility factors in 1999-2014. The presence of cointegration is tested using the Fisher-Johansen cointegration test. The Wald test is also employed to provide evidence on whether there are any causalities between variables. The results showed no long run associationship between mobility factors and the presence of only one causality relationship, namely the causality running from remittances received to emigration. In this sense remittances usually help to trigger an initial or more massive migration in the first place, and later, the persistence of imbalances or migrants networks contribute to the migration process's continuation. Therefore, as an effective migration policy in a short run we recommend promotion and the use of remittances received in activities related to improve productivity of any sector. This is to avoid higher migration and also to reduce poverty in sending countries. In addition, when the imbalances are reduced, such policies promote family reunifications so that to reinforce migrant networks.","[Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 20, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo] Univ Granada, Campus Cartuja, E-18071 Granada, Spain; [Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Campus Tafira,Edificio Dept Empresariales 35017, Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Spain",Kaunas University of Technology; University of Granada; Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"Mihi-Ramirez, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 20, LT-44309 Kaunas, Lithuania.",a.mihi@ktu.edu; ecuenca@ugr.es; maria.martel112@alu.ulpgc.es,", Eduardo/HIK-2340-2022; Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose/N-4293-2017; Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/N-2217-2017","Mihi-Ramirez, Antonio/0000-0003-3801-9906; Miranda-Martel, Maria Jose/0000-0001-5661-9935; Cuenca-Garcia, Eduardo/0000-0001-9976-8930",,,,,42,2,2,0,11,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

This division of social and economic theoretical realms is at odds with the everyday realities of life, where social activities are entwined with economic activities through a nested relationship. Sen's major contribution in the field of economics is to resist the desocialization of economics and challenge the philosophical foundation of traditional economic theory. Sen contributed to shifting the focus in the field of economics and development studies from an exaggerated emphasis on growth towards issues of personal well-being, agency and freedom. In this line of argument, known as capability approach (CA), Sen has provided a broader definition of human welfare involving more complex motivations, like social concerns and the well-being of future generations, etc. However, despite having many promising features, Sen's CA also has its own weaknesses when considered on its own. CA is often criticized for its underspecified nature and the lack of a definite list of capabilities raised some concerns regarding the practical application of this approach. Through an exhaustive review of relevant literature, this paper sets out to outline the main feature of Sen's approach. The aim of this paper is to identify the potential as well as the limits of CA for the conceptualization and assessment of human wellbeing. The paper concludes that in order to use CA to construct an empirically grounded assessment of wellbeing, one needs to adopt carefully designed procedural methods for the selection of relevant capabilities.","[Naz, Farah] Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria",University of Klagenfurt,"Naz, F (通讯作者)，Univ Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria.",fanaz@edu.aau.at,,,,,,,37,0,0,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,36,46,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100005,0

By taking a strategic perspective of technology, we argue that it is not sufficient to analyze only the size or novelty/quality of the technology base as technology bases can best be understood as portfolios of individual technologies. In such a framework, risk consideration should be taken into account. More specifically, we argue that increasing technological breadth can serve as a hedge against the inherent uncertainties of developing and commercializing technology, in particular when the technology base is very large or novel. We also propose that technology has higher impacts on financial performance for firms with broader technology portfolios. A similar argument proposes that technological breadth can offset the increased risks of addressing foreign markets.

Maybe because he knew that many economists and international agencies were wrong in recognizing the crisis. Although they. rectified and predict a longer and serious crisis, are trustworthy their forecasts? In spite of their cyclical character, crises are difficult to anticipate and manage. Usually, they are related to the unbalanced growth, characteristic of Capitalism. Therefore, the present crisis was seen to come in the measure that, for time, well-known imbalances exist in real estate and financial sectors. Besides, the financial sector has been placed at the top of the control of the other activities; and neo-liberal doctrines have reduced regulatory capacity of public policies. Considering that this crisis may be indicating the end of a stage, we should not forget Sampedro and his lessons on the importance of the split of inequalities. He was a humanist. That is a very import difference with the neo-liberal way of understand our economic and social systems.","[Nieto Solis, Jose Antonio] Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid,"Solís, JAN (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Madrid, Spain.",janietos@ccee.ucm.es,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

According to the mean standardized mortality rate of children, Croatia is among those EU countries that need to put an additional work in prevention of traffic accidents, especially in urban environments. This paper presents a review of previous studies and positive experiences in implementing preventive measures for the traffic safety of children. In addition to educational programs that have given positive results, this paper displays the performance evaluation of engineering measures aimed at road infrastructure. The best results are achieved by combining various systematic measures and a multidisciplinary approach. Civil Engineering Faculty in Osijek is leading the project called Microsimulation Modelling of Pedestrian Movement of Children with the aim of the improvement of pedestrian safety of children in the transportation network of the city of Osijek. The subject of the project is microsimulation modelling of pedestrian movement of children, with special emphasis on children between the ages of 5 and 10. The indicators of the risky behaviour will be analysed in the real traffic environment and the reaction time of children and adult traffic participants will be measured and compared.

Students prefer consuming fast food 0-3 times a week (51,2%) and in their lunch times(52,7%). Students mainly prefer soft drinks (80,7%) and/or tea (71,1%) as beverages along their fast food meals. Among the main reasons why students prefer fast-food are that they study at school (65,2%), fast-food products are delicious (64,3%) and cheap (63,0%). It has been determined that although a great majority of the participants (61,3%) think that fast-food consumption habit has negative effects on human health, only 23,8% of them think of taking precautions against these negative effects of fast food consumption in the future. Within the scope of this research, Chi-square teest has been used in order to understand whether there is a significant relation between fast-food consumption habits of students and the independent variables of gender; residence and monthly income.

We have used two indices: one for spot and the other for futures, for the daily data from 12 June 2000 to 30 September 2013 from Nifty stock indices. We have then tested for ARCH effects, and subsequently employed various models of the ARCH and GARCH conditional volatility. The GARCH(1,1) model is found to be significant, and it implies that the returns are not autocorrelated and have 'short memory'. It supports the hypothesis of the efficiency of the markets. The negative 'news' has more significant effect on volatility, corroborating the 'leverage impact' in finance on market volatility. We have also tested the volatility spillover effects. The two methods we employed support the spillover effects and the causality is bidirectional. We also have used the dummy variable for the US subprime mortgage financial crisis and found that they are statistically significant.

Regional competitiveness has become the point of interest to a broad spectrum of authors, as well as important institutions which bring different views and definitions of this term. The aim of this contribution is not to examine the different approaches and aspects of regional competitiveness in general, but to focus on functional urban regions as a specific type of region and to highlight the potential impact of their existence and identification to increasing the competitiveness of the territory.","[Putnokiova, Veronika] Univ Pavla Jozefa Safarika Kosiciach, Fak Verejnej Spravy, Katedra Verejnej Politiky & Teorie Verejnej Sprav, Popradska 66, Kosice 04132 1, Slovakia",University of Pavol Jozef Safarik Kosice,"Putnokiová, V (通讯作者)，Univ Pavla Jozefa Safarika Kosiciach, Fak Verejnej Spravy, Katedra Verejnej Politiky & Teorie Verejnej Sprav, Popradska 66, Kosice 04132 1, Slovakia.",v.putnokiova@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,1,COLL POLYTECHNICS JIHLAVA,JIHLAVA,"TOLSTEHO 1556-16, JIHLAVA, 586 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-88064-25-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,333,343,,,,,,11,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8MG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392435700027,0

The study proposes a model of innovation and diffusion of productive knowledge as an interactive process between innovators and imitators under conditions of dynamic uncertainty. The process can be modelled as a Stackelberg game, where the innovator acts as a leader in choosing whether to share knowledge or set up private protection and the imitator as a follower in choosing when becoming active. Under these conditions, activation thresholds are derived for both innovators and imitators. If protection policies are effective, the imitator can be trapped into an inaction region by the innovator. Thus, there will be two regimes without and with diffusion, according to whether the inaction region is enacted or not. Under these conditions, discovery and diffusion appear to be dynamic complements, as a higher speed of activation of innovating firms is favoured by a higher level of imitation and a higher speed of activation of imitating firms is favoured by a higher level of discoveries. In order to explore some of the quantitative implications of these results, the paper also proposes an application of the model to four European countries.","[Scandizzo, Pasquale L.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Ctr Econ & Int Studies, Rome, Italy; [Ventura, Marco] Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ventura, M (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat, Rome, Italy.",mventura@istat.it,"Ventura, Marco/AFV-7975-2022; Scandizzo, Pasquale/HIZ-8395-2022","Ventura, Marco/0000-0003-3388-7122; Scandizzo, Pasquale/0000-0002-8824-3589",,,,,37,4,4,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Assuming that appropriate instruments for the presence of endogeneity are available, I apply a control function approach to remove the possible endogeneity. Based on the conditional mean independence between the model error and the selection error, the model can be regarded as a semi-parametric regression model with a discrete mismeasured covariate, thereby permitting a non-classical measurement error. Additional identification assumptions include monotonicity restrictions on the regression function and an empirical testable rank condition. I then use the identification result to construct a sieve maximum likelihood estimation estimator to estimate the model parameters consistently and recover the selection rule and joint probabilities of the accurately measured endogenous variable and the mismeasured observed variable. The proposed estimation method allows for a rather flexible functional form of the mismeasured endogenous covariate, requires only one valid instrument to control for both endogeneity and measurement errors for the variable of interest, and imposes no distribution assumptions on the selection rule.

This is in line with the prevailing view, which says that the invisible hand of the market can be fallible but the visible one is crippled. Processes which accompany and propel globalization such as deregulation, liberalization and privatization are its legible and clear confirmation. On the other hand, among the effects of globalization, tax competition plays a key role and is used by the strong enterprises. Fiscal stimuli are a controversial tool, since their common use by different countries entails specific competition and thus the erosion of expected results. In this context, it is necessary, on the one hand to offer support for domestic companies (in particular in the sector of small and medium-sized enterprises), on the other hand, granting large foreign companies privileges as a precondition before making their investments should be avoided. The aim of this article is to show how large influence globalisation has on tax competition and how important in this respect is the active role of the state. This role should largely limit numerous of tax benefits for international corporations, which damage local businesses to maintain fair competition mechanisms. In order to present the intended objectives, it has been used literature research methods which are based on an analysis of domestic and foreign compact publications and articles.","[Skalska, Sonia Kozub] Ul Jesionowa 17, PL-41703 Ruda Slaska, Poland",,"Skalska, SK (通讯作者)，Ul Jesionowa 17, PL-41703 Ruda Slaska, Poland.",sonia.kozub.skalska@edu.uekat.pl,,,,,,,23,1,1,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2022,2027,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800251,0

The work extends existing literature and especially the work of Hall and Rust (2007) to endogenous prices and strategic oligopoly competition. We show that the optimal decision rule is an (S,s) order policy and prices and inventory are strategic substitutes. Fixed ordering costs generate infrequent orders. Additionally, with strategic competition in prices, (S, s) inventory behavior together with demand uncertainty generates endogenous cyclical patterns in prices without any exogenous shocks. Hence, the developed model provides a promising framework for explaining dynamics of commodity markets and especially observed autocorrelation in price fluctuations.","[Steinmetz, Alexander] Univ Appl Sci Wurzburg Schweinfurt, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany",,"Steinmetz, A (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Wurzburg Schweinfurt, Munsztr 12, D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany.",alexander.steinmetz@fhws.de,,,,,,,29,0,0,1,11,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Yet, there appears to be much reluctance when it comes to the implementation. In this paper, we argue that deterring corruption through wage incentives may become prohibitively expensive that the government finds it optimal to accept higher net revenues at the expense of honesty. Deviating from the existing literature, we set an endogenous monitoring technology that allows us to capture the dual role of auditing, as a complement with and as a substitute for wage incentives to deter bribery. We find that the government is better-off either completely eliminating corruption or accepting corruption by offering wages lower than the market wage. Offering public wage premium that does not deter bribery is suboptimal. When it is optimal to deter bribery, the government can do it either through wage incentives or monitoring. The role of wage incentives decreases in societies with higher level of dishonesty.

The term structures have many interesting shapes, and we provide some empirical evidence from refined oil future prices at NYMEX defending our modeling idea. Motivated from these results, we present a cointegrated forward price dynamics using the Heath-Jarrow-Morton approach. In this setting, the concept of cointegration is extended to what we call cointegration in the limit, which is an asymptotic form of the notion. The Margrabe formula for spread option prices is shown to hold, with an explicit plug-in volatility.

They have a direct effect on the policymaking process, particularly in inflation-targeting countries, and are utilised in forecasting and modelling exercises. In South Africa, the price indices on which inflation is based have been subject to important structural breaks following changes to the underlying basket of goods and the methodology for constructing price indices. This paper seeks to identify a consistent measure of core inflation for South Africa using trimmed means estimates, measures that exclude changes in food and energy prices, dynamic factor models, and wavelet decompositions. After considering the forecasting ability of these measures, which provide an indication of expected second-round inflationary effects, traditional in-sample criteria were used for further comparative purposes. The results suggest that wavelet decompositions provide a useful measure of this critical variable.","[Kotze, Kevin] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa; [du Plessis, Stan; du Rand, Gideon] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Cape Town; Stellenbosch University,"Kotzé, K (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Rondebosch, South Africa.",kevin.kotze@uct.ac.za,,"Du Plessis, Stan/0000-0002-2899-5172; Kotze, Kevin/0000-0002-7968-266X",Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),The authors gratefully acknowledge financial support from Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA) and have benefitted from the comments of the anonymous referees.

I adopt a simple binary choice model to approximate a household's decision to purchase a new car and identify the policy effect using a difference-in-difference framework in which non-eligible households serve as the control group. The estimation results are as follows. First, the subsidy program significantly boosted the overall demand for new vehicles, increasing the average probability of a new purchase by eligible households from 7.1 to 13.9 percent. Second, beneficiaries of the subsidy program were mostly rich households and those owning relatively new cars. Finally, the program effect on aggregate vehicle sales was not quickly reversed in contrast to recent evidence on the comparable US program.","[Min, Heechul] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, Seoul 130791, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Min, H (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Dept Int Econ & Law, 107 Imun Ro, Seoul 130791, South Korea.",hmin@hufs.ac.kr,,,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,"Department of International Economics and Law, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, 107 Imun-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-791, Republic of Korea.

These two, along with changes in inequality, form the three broader effects that can be computed in multiple ways depending upon the base period and the sequence of calculation. Changing the base does not alter the broader effects while specific attributions within each effect get interchanged. For a given base, there will be six possible sequences and we take an average of these to compute the three broad effects. Finally, poverty change on account of the three broad effects comprising growth of total income, change in inequality, and change in total population are shown as part of the within-group effect while change in population shares, which is different from change in total population, is a between-group effect.

We have other results that refine or extend the result of Yaari (1965). Full annuitization can be viewed as an American-type option that allows an economic agent to exchange the value of labor income with the extra leisure that is brought about by annuitizing all of her wealth. When the agent's wealth is above a certain wealth threshold, annuitization is triggered, otherwise it is not. Accordingly, wealth plays a key role in controlling the distance to full annuitization.

The mobilization of protesters in cities throughout the world was preceded by much speculation in the media and blogosphere over the past few years, where commentators have been quick to suggest that the end of neoliberalism is upon us. The validity of postneoliberalism, however, remains tenuous, as its advocates continue to treat neoliberalism as a monolithic, static, and undifferentiated end-state. Despite the desire to move beyond neoliberal strictures, there is an undeniable continuity to neoliberalism that must be appreciated if we ever hope to leave this unforgiving version of capitalism truly in the past.","Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, Stn Csc Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada",University of Victoria,"Springer, S (通讯作者)，Univ Victoria, Dept Geog, POB 3060, Stn Csc Victoria, BC V8W 3R4, Canada.",simonspringer@gmail.com,,,,,,,115,50,57,2,116,SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC,THOUSAND OAKS,"2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA",0486-6134,1552-8502,,REV RADICAL POL ECON,Rev.

After creating hypothetical ratings for a nonrated sample, I examine if these firms react in a similar fashion to credit rating threats as do rated firms since a response to a rating stimulus by a nonrated firm that is qualitatively similar to a rated firm would open up a new argument against firms' regard for ratings.

This paper deals with optimal nonlinear income taxation in an international setting, where consumers derive utility from their relative consumption compared both with other domestic residents and people in another country. The optimal tax policy in our framework reflects both correction for positional externalities and redistributive aspects of such correction due to the incentive constraint facing each government. If the national governments behave as Nash competitors to each other, the resulting tax policy only internalizes the externalities that are due to within-country comparisons, whereas the tax policy chosen by the leader country in a Stackelberg game also to some extent reflects between-country comparisons. We also derive globally Pareto-efficient tax policies in a cooperative framework, and conclude that there are potentially large welfare gains of international tax policy coordination.

In these models, the demand curve alone can be used to make welfare statements, a fact relied on by much empirical work. There is ample evidence, though, that people misuse care for a different reason: mistakes, or behavioral hazard.'' Much high-value care is underused even when patient costs are low, and some useless care is bought even when patients face the full cost. In the presence of behavioral hazard, welfare calculations using only the demand curve can be off by orders of magnitude or even be the wrong sign. We derive optimal copay formulas that incorporate both moral and behavioral hazard, providing a theoretical foundation for value-based insurance design and a way to interpret behavioral nudges.'' Once behavioral hazard is taken into account, health insurance can do more than just provide financial protection-it can also improve health care efficiency.","[Baicker, Katherine] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; Harvard Univ, Sch Business, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; Harvard University,"Baicker, K (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,"Mullainathan, Sendhil/0000-0001-8508-4052",National Institute on Aging (NIA) [P30-AG012810]; NIA [T32-AG000186],National Institute on Aging (NIA)(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); NIA(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)),"We thank Dan Benjamin, David Cutler, John Friedman, Drew Fudenberg, Ben Handel, Ted O'Donoghue, Matthew Rabin, Jesse Shapiro, Andrei Shleifer, Jonathan Skinner, Chris Snyder, Douglas Staiger, Neil Thakral Glen Weyl, Heidi Williams, Danny Yagan, and the anonymous referees for helpful comments.

According to the political budget cycle hypothesis, in election years government officials engage in opportunistic fiscal policy manipulation for electoral gains. We test that hypothesis using data on taxes, spending, and employment for a panel of 268 U.S. cities over the period 1970-2004. While our estimates provide no evidence of altered total expenditures or taxes in election years, we do find a 0.7% increase in total municipal employment, including increases in police, education, and sanitation employment.","[Moulton, Shawn R.] ABT Associates Inc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",ABT Associates,"Moulton, SR (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",charles.adam.bee@gmail.com; shawn_moulton@abtassoc.com,,,National Science Foundation [DGE-0504495],National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)),"We thank Bill Evans and Abigail Wozniak for detailed feedback on early drafts of this manuscript.

First, we find a lower incidence of preference reversals for probability equivalents from the dual-to-selling version of Becker, Degroot, and Marschak (1964; BDM) than for certainty equivalents from traditional BDMconsistent with conjectures regarding response mode. Second, the Blavatskyy (2009, 2012) model of probabilistic choice can explain the incidence of preference reversals when using probability equivalents. Thus, between response mode (outside the Blavatskyy model) and stochastic choice (as per Blavatskyy), preference reversals in the original certainty equivalent case seem to be explained. We also present estimates for risk and stochasticity parameters; the former are not correlated across mechanisms, but the latter are. Finally, relatively more error-laden behavior (based on within-mechanism checks) can be associated with fewer reversals across mechanisms. The data make clear, empirically, the logical proposition that reducing reversals requires only a better match with binary choice, not necessarily rational behavior at any deeper level.","[Collins, Sean M.; James, Duncan] Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Fordham University,"Collins, SM (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Dept Econ, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.",scollins15@fordham.edu; dujames@fordham.edu,,,Fordham University's Office of Research,Fordham University's Office of Research,"The authors are grateful for helpful comments from the editor, three anonymous referees, Daniel Friedman, Mark Isaac, Maros Servatka, Joel Sobel, Richard Watt, seminar participants at the University of Canterbury, and the Florida State University Experimental Economics Readings Group.

Our data corroborate the theoretical predictions for teams: Neither a lead nor a lag in the first component contest affects a team's performance in the subsequent contests. In individual tournaments, however, contrary to the theoretical prediction, we observe that leaders perform worse-but laggards perform better-after learning the outcome of the first contest.

These tradeoffs lead to a comprehensive discussion of the defining features of MSPs. The formal model we develop focuses on the MSP versus vertical integration choice, which we interpret in the context of professional services. A key tradeoff emerges between the need to coordinate decisions that generate spillovers across professionals (best achieved by a vertical integrated firm) and the need to both motivate unobservable effort by professionals and ensure professionals adapt their decisions to their private information (best achieved by a MSP). We show how this baseline tradeoff is impacted by the nature of contracts available to the vertically integrated firm and the MSP, and by the possibility of professionals holding pessimistic expectations when deciding whether or not to join the vertically integrated firm or MSP.

In the empirical analyses, this study utilizes panel econometric techniques such as FMOLS, DOLS, and panel VECM. The results suggest that, in the short run, immigration has a significant positive impact on unemployment rate and that the unidirectional short-run causality runs from immigration to the unemployment rate. The results further suggest that in the long run, immigration has a negative but insignificant impact on the unemployment rate. Though Canada attracts highly skilled immigrants, but generally Canadian employers do not recognize foreign education and foreign experience. Consequently, initially, immigrants face difficulties in the job market leading to an increase in the unemployment rate. Overtime, immigrants receive Canadian job experience and in many cases, Canadian education and training. All of these improve immigrants' employment prospect and consequently, in the long run, the adverse impact on unemployment rate is eliminated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After we check that the lognormal distribution is adequately fitted to Japanese income data, by the asymptotic theorem of selected order statistics we construct an approximate linear model, which is extended to dynamic models, including a stochastic volatility (SV) model and a random-walk SV model. We can thus estimate the parameter of inequality directly. Both models are estimated using Japanese income data with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and a model comparison is made. The SV model is better fitted than the random-walk SV model. We can capture the changing Gini coefficients for Japan using the SV model. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The objective is to investigate the macroeconomic effects of this uncertainty by explicitly taking into account the role of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. We first consider the case of symmetric monetary transmission in the monetary union and show that if the transmission mechanism is not too strong, monetary uncertainty may be beneficial in terms of macroeconomic performances and stabilisation. We then allow for some transmission asymmetry among the member countries and show that the beneficial impact of monetary uncertainty is exacerbated for countries that are more sensitive to the common monetary policy. More importantly, our findings suggest that the central bank's communication about its preferences could represent a specific instrument to influence inflation expectations and thus macroeconomic outcomes in the member countries.

These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and fiscal regulators with real-time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due to the complexity of the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple-bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips etal. (Explosive behavior in the 1990s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values? International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201-26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real-time date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well-known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.","Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; Univ Auckland, Auckland 1, New Zealand; Univ Southampton, Southampton SO9 5NH, Hants, England; Singapore Management Univ, Singapore 178902, Singapore; Macquarie Univ, N Ryde, NSW 2109, Australia",Yale University; University of Auckland; University of Southampton; Singapore Management University; Macquarie University,"Phillips, PCB (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Cowles Fdn Res Econ, Box 208281, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",peter.phillips@yale.edu,"PHILLIPS, Peter Charles Bonest/D-1444-2009; YU, Jun/D-1455-2009","Yu, Jun/0000-0003-2360-5873; Shi, Shuping/0000-0001-8571-3066; Phillips, Peter C B/0000-0003-2341-0451","NSF [SES 09-56687, SES 12-58258]; Financial Integrity Research Network (FIRN); Singapore Ministry of Education [MOE2011-T2-2-096]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1258258] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","NSF(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Financial Integrity Research Network (FIRN); Singapore Ministry of Education(Ministry of Education, Singapore); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This article and its technical companion Testing for Multiple Bubbles: Limit Theory of Real Time Detectors (Phillips et al., 2015a, this issue) build on work that was originally circulated in 2011 in a long paper entitled Testing for Multiple Bubbles accompanied by a long supplement of technical results.

Do awards affect consumers' choices or, conversely, are they conferred on the most popular products? To disentangle this issue, we use data about the most important Italian literary prize, the Strega Prize, undertaking two different estimation strategies to evaluate the impact that winning the Prize has on book sales. First, we adopt a regression discontinuity design using a measure of book sales as a dependent variable and as a forcing variable (proxying for intrinsic book quality) the jury votes received by each nominated book in the competition. We find that the Strega Prize has a very strong impact on sales. Second, by using weekly data on appearances on bestseller lists, we estimate a difference-in-differences model in which we compare sales performance of treated and control books before the award is conferred with their respective performances afterward. The results confirm a huge influence of the Prize on book sales and show that most of the impact occurs in the weeks following the announcement of the Prize.","[Ponzo, Michela] Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, I-80126 Naples, Italy; [Scoppa, Vincenzo] Univ Calabria, Dept Econ Stat & Finance, I-87036 Arcavacata Di Rende, CS, Italy; [Scoppa, Vincenzo] Inst Study Labor IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Naples Federico II; University of Calabria; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Ponzo, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Federico II, Dept Econ & Stat, Via Cintia Monte S Angelo, I-80126 Naples, Italy.",michela.ponzo@unina.it; v.scoppa@unical.it,,"Scoppa, Vincenzo/0000-0002-2774-0258; PONZO, Michela/0000-0002-5970-9415",,,,,19,8,9,0,19,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0885-2545,1573-6997,,J CULT ECON,J.

However, little evidence directly explores the fly-paper effects of whether women retain control over these transfers once within the household and how reallocation of the transfers affects women's empowerment. We study these dynamics in the context of BRAC's randomized CFPR-TUP program in Bangladesh, which provides livestock and training to rural women in ultra poor households. Our analysis confirms previous findings that CFPR-TUP increased household asset ownership, but shows complex effects on targeted women. Women appear to retain ownership over transferred livestock, but new investments from mobilized resources are largely owned by men. CFPR-TUP also reduces women's movement outside the home and control over income, consistent with transferred livestock requiring maintenance at home. However, beneficiary women also report intangible benefits such as increased social capital and, even with limited mobility, a preference for work inside the home given a hostile environment outside the home.

To resolve this puzzling contrast, we differentiate average human capital (literacy) from upper-tail knowledge. As a proxy for the historical presence of knowledge elites, we use city-level subscriptions to the famous Encyclopedie in mid-18th century France. We show that subscriber density is a strong predictor of city growth after the onset of French industrialization. Alternative measures of development such as soldier height, disposable income, and industrial activity confirm this pattern. Initial literacy levels, on the other hand, are associated with development in the cross-section, but they do not predict growth. Finally, by joining data on British patents with a large French firm survey from the 1840s, we shed light on the mechanism: upper-tail knowledge raised productivity in innovative industrial technology.","[Squicciarini, Mara P.] KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium; Univ Calif Los Angeles, Anderson Sch Management, NBER, Los Angeles, CA 90024 USA",KU Leuven; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Squicciarini, MP (通讯作者)，KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium.",,,,FWO; LICOS; KULeuven Methusalem Project,FWO(FWO); LICOS; KULeuven Methusalem Project,"We thank the editor, Andrei Shleifer; the coeditor, Larry Katz; three referees; as well as Ran Abramitzky, Quamrul Ashraf, Sascha Becker, Ruxanda Berlinschi, Davide Cantoni, Nick Crafts, Giacomo De Luca, Christian Dippel, Frederic Docquier, Paola Giuliano, Avner Greif, Oded Galor, Noel Johnson, Mark Koyama, Stelios Michalopoulos, Joel Mokyr, Suresh Naidu, Nathan Nunn, Ahmed Rahman, Enrico Spolaore, Jo Swinnen, Joachim Voth, Fabian Waldinger, John Wallis, Ludger Woessmann, Noam Yuchtman, and numerous seminar audiences for helpful comments and suggestions.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the impact of the program over more than 10 years after its implementation. A nonexperimental evaluation framework based on multiple pre- and posttreatment periods is used to estimate the policy effects. We find that the reform had important and lasting effects on the number of children aged 1-4 years old attending childcare and the numbers of hours they spend in daycare. For children aged 5 years old, we uncovered strong evidence that implementing full-day kindergarten alone was not enough to increase maternal labour force participation and weeks worked, but when combined with the low-fee daycare program it was, and these effects were also long lasting. Finally, our results on cognitive development suggest the reform did not improve school readiness and may even have had negative impacts on children from low-income families. (C) 2015 Elsevier ay.

In this paper we provide a large-scale assessment of the enrollment effects of India's midday meal scheme, which offers warm lunches, free of cost, to 120 million primary school children across India, and is the largest school feeding program in the world. To isolate the causal effect of the policy, we make use of its staggered implementation across Indian states in government but not private schools. Using a panel dataset of more than 420,000 schools observed annually from 2002 to 2004, we find that midday meals result in substantial increases in primary school enrollment, driven by early primary school responses to the program. Our results are robust to a wide range of specification tests.","[Jayaraman, Rajshri; Simroth, Dora] ESMT Berlin, D-10178 Berlin, Germany",European School of Management & Technology,"Jayaraman, R (通讯作者)，ESMT Berlin, D-10178 Berlin, Germany.",rajshri.jayaraman@esmt.org; dora.simroth@esmt.org,,,DFG [JA 1675/2-1],DFG(German Research Foundation (DFG)),"We gratefully acknowledge funding from DFG Grant JA 1675/2-1, and we thank Arun Metha and Naveen Bhatia for kindly sharing their District Information System for Education (DISE) data.

Using a two-period model where the probability of a regime shift increases in the first-period pollution stock, we examine the issue of coalition formation under both fixed and dynamic membership. Our analysis suggests that endogenous uncertainty may increase participation. We find that full cooperation may be sustained, but only in the presence of endogenous uncertainty. Interestingly, when the shift in the environmental damage is large enough, the model provides a way to solve the  puzzle of small coalitions found in the literature related to international environmental agreements. We also find that in period 1 (period 2) endogenous uncertainty leads to a lower (higher) pollution stock under dynamic membership as compared to the fixed membership case.","[Nkuiya, Bruno] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Marrouch, Walid] Lebanese Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Beirut, Lebanon; [Bahel, Eric] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; Lebanese American University; Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Nkuiya, B (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",bnkuiya@bren.ucsb.edu; walid.marrouch@lau.edu.lb; erbahel@vt.edu,"Nkuiya, Bruno/AAE-5896-2022; Nkuiya, Bruno/AAB-2497-2020; Marrouch, Walid/D-5597-2019","Marrouch, Walid/0000-0001-8488-6555; Nkuiya, Bruno/0000-0001-6268-3001",,,,,21,15,16,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

Man's identity, preferences, place and status are defined in reference to society and that society is the arbiter of man's success or failure. in this paper 1 examine societal linkages in the context of their dissolution, arguing that if the societal link is damaged or broken, man is fundamentally changed. Since despair evidences eviction from society, I examine despair, the loss of hope, and the behaviors associated therewith from the perspectives of many disciplines to define despair and to characterize the despairing individual and his relationship to society. I then develop a model of a goal-oriented, socially-embedded agent in which the usual concept of the individual is challenged, and hope and despair are fundamental to this challenge. Using this theoretical framework, I return to the economics literature and examine the extent to which economics has, at least implicitly, recognized despair without necessarily confronting it either in theory or policy design, argue why this failure has weakened both our theory and our policy, and suggest a possible remedy.

This log t test allows us to endogenously identify the groups of countries that converge to different equilibriums and those that do not converge to any convergence clubs. We mainly find that, first, world countries do not seem to converge at the same steady-state level; instead, they form four separate clubs converging to their own steady-state paths and few countries are found to converge to no group at all. In addition, although the world as a whole shows the evidence of convergence, economic and geographic groups seem to converge at different speeds. Last, estimates from an ordered-logit model reveal that initial energy intensity level and openness are mainly responsible for the formation of the world convergence clubs, whereas industry share and R&D share are not.","[Yu, Yihua; Song, Feng] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yonghui] Singapore Management Univ, Sch Econ, Singapore 178903, Singapore",Renmin University of China; Singapore Management University,"Zhang, YH (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing 100872, Peoples R China.",yonghui.zhang@hotmail.com,"Zhang, Yonghui/AFL-9055-2022","Yu, Yihua/0000-0003-2709-6092; Zhang, Yonghui/0000-0001-6962-4768",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Renmin University of China [13XNJ017],Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Renmin University of China,This work was supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and the Research Funds of Renmin University of China [grant number 13XNJ017].,,38,25,26,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The method considers the integrated weight of the decision makers with the subjective and objective preference and the effect of time weight. In the proposed method, a mathematical programming model is used to determine the integrated weight, and a basic unit-interval monotonic (BUM) function based approach is used to calculate the time weight. In addition, a distance measure of membership function is introduced to effectively measure the degree of difference between the alternatives in the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS). Finally, a numerical example is introduced to illustrate the proposed method.","[Li, Guangxu; Peng, Yi] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Management & Econ, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China; [Kou, Gang] Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China",University of Electronic Science & Technology of China; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Kou, G (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Business Adm, Chengdu 611130, Peoples R China.",kougang@swufe.edu.cn,"Kou, Gang/G-3869-2010","Kou, Gang/0000-0002-9220-8647","National Natural Science Foundation of China [71222108, 71325001, 71471149]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This research was supported in part by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (#71222108, #71325001 and #71471149).",,56,31,32,2,42,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Most studies analyzing peer influences ignore the reflection'' problem that occurs with studying peer effects. To address the reflection problem, this paper employs a spatial econometric approach to estimate a social interactions model. This is the first study in the literature on adolescent risky sexual behavior to use this approach to estimate peer effects. Similar to other research on peer effects and adolescent risky sexual behavior, this paper finds the existence of peer effects. However, the more vital outcome from this study is that older and male peers increase the likelihood of adolescent early sexual debut, while peers whose mothers are more open about sexual activity decrease adolescent risky sexual behavior. This methodology can help further our knowledge about the social context that influences adolescent sexual behavior.","Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, Toledo, OH 43606 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Toledo,"Ajilore, O (通讯作者)，Univ Toledo, Dept Econ, 2801 W Bancroft St, Toledo, OH 43606 USA.",gbenga.ajilore@utoledo.edu,,"Ajilore, Olugbenga/0000-0002-0862-6230",Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [P01-HD31921],Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),"The author would like to thank the editor and two anonymous referees for comments and helpful suggestions.

Rising attendance rates at 4-year institutions have not decreased average preparedness of college goers or of college graduates, and further attendance gains are possible before diminishing returns set in. We use multinomial logit models to demonstrate that measures of likely success (grade point average) became more predictive of college attendance over time, while other student characteristics such as race and parents' education became less predictive.

In a theory model where the producer price is subject to bargaining between the brand-name producer and a distributor, we show that the effects of stricter price regulation crucially depend on whether the producer faces competition from parallel imports. While parallel imports improve the bargaining position of the distributor, price regulation counteracts this effect and may even be profitable for the producer. We test the implications of our model on a unique dataset with information on sales and prices at both producer and retail level for 165 substances over 4 years (2004-2007). We show that stricter price regulation reduces competition from parallel imports, and has no (strictly negative) effect on producer profits in the presence (absence) of parallel imports. Our results suggest that price regulation might improve static efficiency without being harmful for dynamic efficiency in the presence of parallel imports. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in the longer run, the decreasing attractiveness of the eastern region and the increasing attractiveness of the western region proved to be transitory, although the pre-crisis relative advantage of the eastern region was not fully restored.

Government dependency varies by state and territory and is influenced differently by each component. Analysis accounting for varying age structures fails to explain the differences. Projections of future government dependency to 2050 find increases for all jurisdictions under three scenarios.

Using the evolutionary biology of happiness, this paper argues that happiness is absolute, universal, and uni-dimensional and is also cardinally measurable and interpersonally comparable. This is needed to make choices motivated by reward (pleasure) and punishment (pain) consistent with fitness maximization. However, happiness indices obtained by virtually all existing methods of happiness measurement are largely non-cardinal and non-comparable, making the use of averaging in group happiness indices of dubious philosophical validity. A method of measuring happiness to give cardinal and interpersonally comparable indices is discussed. These may contribute towards the more scientific study of happiness that is based on sounder methodological grounds as well as yielding more useful results.","Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Ng, YK (通讯作者)，Nanyang Technol Univ, Div Econ, Singapore 639798, Singapore.",,"Ng, Yew-Kwang/AAM-1664-2021","Ng, Yew-Kwang/0000-0001-5669-9883",,,,,55,2,4,0,22,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

Yet, recent massive and continuing oil discoveries in Africa have been offered as a potential stop-gap measure to simultaneously improve socio-economic conditions and enhance energy security on that continent, as well as to bridge global income inequalities, while supporting the energy needs of richer countries, especially at a time of continuing disquiet in the major oil producing centers in the world. Memories of plunder of African resources, formed by years of resource curse, however, erect dark clouds over the possibility of using oil to achieve the seemingly irreconcilable aims of oil benefit to both Africa and the rest. Australia finds itself at these crossroads: It has a looming oil crisis and an emergent relationship with Africa. In this paper, I argue for a non-determinist, research-led approach to resolve this imbroglio.","[Obeng-Odoom, Franklin] Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Property Econ, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia",University of Technology Sydney,"Obeng-Odoom, F (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Sydney, Sch Built Environm, Property Econ, Sydney, NSW 2007, Australia.",,"Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/G-2644-2017","Obeng-Odoom, Franklin/0000-0003-3997-7751",,,,,32,0,0,0,5,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

I investigate the effects of skill bias technical change in the frontier economies on the evolution of output, the quantity and quality of human capital in the adopting countries. The framework introduces a novel feature by connecting the direction of technology adoption to a sequential process of skill accumulation, where the returns of advanced human capital depend on the quality of basic education. I find that moderate skill bias at the frontier produces convergence in output per capita, while strong skill bias generates two convergence clubs among adopting countries. In the latter case, a further increase in skill bias leads to a larger disparity in output between clubs. Furthermore, the countries in the low income club converge to a new steady-state characterized by a higher quantity and lower quality of skilled labor. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The output multiplier is derived. The approach taken allows for heterogeneity in agents' utility functions. The intertemporal elasticity of substitution is allowed to vary with an agent's initial endowment of wealth. Multipliers are derived under simple monetary reaction rules. These cases describe how the effectiveness of fiscal policy might depend on the distribution of wealth in the economy. We find that an increase in wealth anywhere along the distribution of wealth increases the size of the fiscal multiplier under real interest rate targeting. Owing to changes in real interest rates under a less accommodative monetary policy an increase in wealth has an ambiguous effect under a strict inflation target or in a flexible price equilibrium. A redistribution of wealth always has an ambiguous effect which depends, in part, on the relative sensitivity of changes in consumption due to changes in expected future taxes when wealth varies for the losing versus the gaining quintile.","[Sedgley, Norman, III; Scott, Charles; Derrick, Fred] Loyola Univ Maryland, Baltimore, MD USA",Loyola University Maryland,"Sedgley, N (通讯作者)，4501 N Charles St, Baltimore, MD 21210 USA.",nsedgley@loyola.edu,,"Sedgley, Norman/0000-0002-7526-1745",,,,,18,0,0,0,9,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

Some micro sources of macro errors",JOURNAL OF INSTITUTIONAL ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROUP DECISION-MAKING; ESCALATING COMMITMENT; CONSENSUS PROCESSES; INFORMATION; PREFERENCE; BIAS; AVAILABILITY; CONFIDENCE; ACCURACY,"Many institutions, large or small, make their decisions through some process of deliberation. Nonetheless, deliberating institutions often fail, in the sense that they make judgments that are false or that fail to take advantage of the information that their members have. Micro mistakes can lead to macro blunders or even catastrophes. There are four such failures; all of them have implication for large-scale institutions as well as small ones. (1) Sometimes the predeliberation errors of an institution's members are amplified, not merely propagated, as a result of deliberation. (2) Institutions fall victim to cascade effects, as the initial speakers or actors are followed by their successors, who do not disclose what they know. Non-disclosure, on the part of those successors, may be a product of either informational or reputational cascades. (3) As a result of group polarization, deliberating institutions sometimes end up in a more extreme position in line with their predeliberation tendencies. Sometimes group polarization leads in desirable directions, but there is no assurance to this effect. (4) In deliberating institutions, shared information often dominates or crowds out unshared information, ensuring that institutions do not learn what their members know. Informational signals and reputational pressure help to explain all four errors. The results can be harmful to numerous institutions, including large ones, and to societies as a whole. Markets are able to correct some of these problems, but cascade effects occur there as well.","[Sunstein, Cass R.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Hastie, Reid] Univ Chicago, Grad Sch Business, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Harvard University; University of Chicago,"Sunstein, CR (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",csunstein@law.harvard.edu,"Sunstein, Cass/AAV-8196-2020",,,,,,49,1,2,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

It has been claimed that a sufficient proportion of arbitrageurs needs to sell over-priced stocks to correct the mis-pricing. However, because each arbitrageur tends to choose his optimal time of entering or exiting the market, there exists a lack of coordination in selling out Thus, the bubble will continue growing for a considerable period. Moreover, our work incorporates trend followers' impacts on stock prices into the analysis of the duration of bubbles. The derived equilibrium trading strategy suggests that each arbitrageur will wait for a longer period before selling out, compared with the optimal strategy obtained from previous models where only arbitrageurs' coordination risks are considered. This paper presents defects in the Efficient Market Hypothesis. Further, having shown that the duration of mis-pricing is increasing in arbitrageur's leverage ratio, the model provides rationales for regulations on individual use of leverage. This is compatible with the findings in previous literature that macro-prudential policy tools, such as limiting the use of leverages can be more effective than traditional monetary and fiscal policies in taming asset overpricing.

In consumer-to-consumer (C2C) online markets, not only can individuals buy from other individuals but also sell. This article investigates the socio-economic factors shaping individuals' decisions to undertake C2C e-commerce. By means of a multinomial logit model and a unique data set of individuals across the full European Union, C2C purchasing and selling online patterns are analysed. This is an area where empirical evidence has usually focused on consumers' purchasing behaviour and less is known about sellers. Interestingly enough, results point out that the profile of sellers and buyers differs greatly, except for gender. Hence, certain socio-economic features, social online networks and the breath of internet use show different effects over e-selling and e-buying. Moreover, cross-region differences in incomes appear to be correlated with consumers' e-commerce use.","Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Asturias 33006, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Vicente, MR (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Dept Appl Econ, Asturias 33006, Spain.",mrosalia@uniovi.es,"vicente, maria rosalia/H-9831-2015","vicente, maria rosalia/0000-0001-7826-8494",,,,,12,6,8,1,64,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Our empirical analysis considers industry data for the Euro area and the Dutch economy. Shocks on financial markets are measured as shocks to corporate bond spreads and implied volatility. For shock identification, we employ a recently proposed decomposition of the forecast error variance combined with an ordering perturbation in our VAR. Bond spread shocks are found to have severe consequences for real economic development independently whether they are accompanied by shocks to volatility. Shocks to volatility seem to imply only severe effects for parts of the real economy if they are accompanied by bond spread shocks.","[Antony, Juergen] Pforzheim Univ, D-75175 Pforzheim, Germany; [Broer, D.

The policy change created a severe marriage squeeze for local men, triggering their animal spirits to engage in entrepreneurial activities. Empirical results show that local men exposed to high sex ratios as a result of the removal of the marriage ban were more likely to become entrepreneurs later on. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using three realistic worker tasks, we find that the existence of the beauty premium indeed, depends on the task: while relatively more attractive workers receive higher wage bids in a bargaining task, there is no such premium in either an analytical task or a data entry task. Our analysis shows that the premium in bargaining is driven by statistical discrimination based on biased beliefs about worker performance. We also find that there is substantial learning after worker-specific performance information is revealed, highlighting the importance of accounting for longer-run interactions in studies of discrimination.

I ask how experts update beliefs in a relatively simple environment with minimal market incentives. Using data from the Associated Press (AP) Top 25 Poll for college football I find that many standard sets of Bayesian beliefs are rejected by the data, and that experts, while using Bayes rule, may still be subject to similar biases as non-experts, including confirmatory bias and lagged signal response, which may be symptomatic of inattention, voter heterogeneity, and signal reassessment. In more complex environments, experts may have strong incentives to substantially deviate from Bayes' rule, biasing expert predictions in unknown directions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

We also differentiate between major types and sources of FDI. We find that FDI concentrated in a persistently decreasing number of districts. Concentration across those districts that received at least one FDI project within a given time interval also increased, but this increase leveled off in the more recent past. These trends hold for essentially all types and sources of FDI, while the average level of concentration varies considerably between these types and sources.","[Bickenbach, Frank; Liu, Wan-Hsin; Nunnenkamp, Peter] Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Liu, WH (通讯作者)，Kiel Inst World Econ, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",wan-hsin.liu@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,48,9,9,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

This paper addresses resulting problems in the existing literature concerning data quality and the appropriate measurement of key variables, as well as the question of causality between military spending and democracy.

This is a pioneering study that uses the hybrid DEA model, evaluating the proportionate inputs with a radial measure and the non-proportionate inputs with a non-radial measure, in order to examine the impact of non-performing loans (NPLs) on the efficiency of Taiwan's banking sector from 2006 to 2010. In summary, this research demonstrates the following: (1) Only nine banks remained in the top efficiency list during these years: China Development Industrial Bank, Mega International Commercial Bank, Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Cathay United Bank, Bank of Kaohsiung, Industrial Bank of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, Land Bank, and Bank of Taiwan. (2) Risk is an important factor that should be taken into consideration when evaluating banking efficiency. (3) From the hybrid DEA model, we find that most of the inefficient banks have an inefficiency factor caused primarily by too many NPLs (risk). (4) The efficiency of Taiwan's large-scale banks is significantly better than the small-scale bank. By looking at the inefficiency index, the large-scale bank's inefficiency is caused by NPLs.

Farm-level evidence from Moscow and Belgorod regions",POST-COMMUNIST ECONOMIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH; AGRICULTURE,"The transition process did not affect the organisation of agricultural production as originally anticipated. Since the late 1990s, in Russia and some other CIS countries, numerous large-scale agro-holdings emerged which agglomerated multiple farms, entities of the upstream and downstream sectors of agribusiness, as well as non-agricultural industries. Owing to the common practice of registering such affiliated farms/firms as independent business units, data on agro-holdings' aggregate group performance are extremely scarce. It is therefore difficult to capture their emergence, determinants of growth and developmental prospects.This study is based on a unique panel dataset from Moscow and Belgorod regions. The growth trajectories of farms affiliated to agro-holdings vis-a-vis independent farms were investigated by applying a quantile regression approach. Overall, only minor differences were found. Any advantages of affiliated farms appear to be due to extramural factors; i.e. it is all about how to link individual production units, thus benefiting from strong positioning in local and regional markets and making the most of lobbying and ties to relevant politicians. In sum, agro-holdings are expected to remain as a model for organising agricultural production.","[Matyukha, Andriy; Voigt, Peter; Wolz, Axel] Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany",Leibniz Institut fur Agrarentwicklung in Transformationsokonomien (IAMO),"Wolz, A (通讯作者)，Leibniz Inst Agr Dev Transit Econ IAMO, Halle, Saale, Germany.",wolz@iamo.de,", IAMO/G-2328-2012",,German Research Foundation (DFG),German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG).

Instead, we argue that there is heterogeneity in the decision processes and strategies that managers follow, and that they make adaptive adjustments to their strategies that are conditioned on the choices of other firms as well as their prior choices. Using data on U.S. corporate capital structures between 1965 and 2003, we find evidence that is consistent with our proposed alternative. Our characterization of the evolution of corporate capital structures emphasizes the roles of a firm's initial capital structure and its competitors' capital structure strategies.","[Arce, Daniel G.; Kieschnick, Robert L.] Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA; [Cook, Douglas O.] Univ Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Dallas; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"Kieschnick, RL (通讯作者)，Univ Texas Dallas, Richardson, TX 75083 USA.",rkiesch@utdallas.edu,,,,,,,46,2,3,2,22,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

This paper estimates the price and income elasticity of demand for gasoline in countries where fuel prices are government-subsidized. We make use of biennial panel road-sector data for 32 countries over the 1998-2010 period and find demand for gasoline to be price inelastic both in the short run and long run. We estimate the short-run price and income elasticities at -0.05 and 0.16 and the long-run price and income elasticities at -0.25 and 0.81, respectively. It is our contention that concerned governments should play an active role in identifying and committing to a road map to progressively abandoning fuel subsidies. They should also not be discouraged by relatively small consumption corrections in the short run. A reduction in subsidies can eventually release considerable amount of resources for more crucial and potentially growth-enhancing public services such as education and health. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The criteria used in assessing pension systems are the philosophy of pension design, the extent of coverage, investment policies and performance, and administrative and compliance costs. The paper argues that three broad reform directions to strengthen public pensions merit consideration. The first direction is to enhance the professionalism of the existing provident and pension fund organizations, including their governance practices. The second direction is to strengthen the role of noncontributory budget-financed pensions (e.g. social pensions). The third is to adopt a systemic perspective to pension reform that includes reforms in complementary areas (labor markets, public financial management practices, and the civil service); developing a financing-mix of pensions; and lastly, improving effective coverage by exploring complementarities between health care and pension programs.","[Asher, Mukul] Natl Univ Singapore, LKY Sch Publ Policy, Singapore 259772, Singapore; [Bali, Azad S.] Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA 6150, Australia",National University of Singapore; Murdoch University,"Asher, M (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, LKY Sch Publ Policy, 469c Bukit Timah Rd, Singapore 259772, Singapore.",sppasher@nus.edu.sg,,"Bali, Azad Singh/0000-0001-6430-2997",,,,,17,22,24,4,54,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1832-8105,1748-3131,,ASIAN ECON POLICY R,Asian Econ.

In particular, can polynomial-time truthful-in-expectation mechanisms achieve a near-optimal approximation ratio for combinatorial auctions with submodular valuations? We prove that this is not the case: There is a constant gamma > 0 such that there is no randomized mechanism that is truthful-in-expectation or even approximately truthfulin-expectation - and guarantees an m(-gamma)-approximation to the optimal social welfare for combinatorial auctions with submodular valuations in the value oracle model. In contrast, a non-truthful (1-1/e)-approximation algorithm is known (Vondrak, 2008), and a truthfulin-expectation (1-1/e)-approximation mechanism was recently developed for the special case of coverage valuations (Dughmi et al., 2011b).

Assessing their effectiveness is complicated by selection bias; countries which change their capital-flow management measures (CFMs) often share specific characteristics and are responding to changes in variables that the CFMs are intended to influence. This paper addresses these challenges by using a propensity-score matching methodology. We also create a new database with detailed information on weekly changes in controls on capital inflows, capital outflows, and macroprudential measures related to international transactions from 2009 to 2011 for 60 countries. Results show that these macroprudential measures can significantly reduce some measures of financial fragility. Most CFMs do not significantly affect other key targets, however, such as exchange rates, capital flows, interest-rate differentials, inflation, equity indices, and different volatilities. One exception is that removing controls on capital outflows may reduce real exchange rate appreciation. Therefore, certain CFMs can be effective in accomplishing specific goals but most popular measures are not good for accomplishing their stated aims. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Market-based policies, in particular, often use information about carbon intensity to adjust relative deployment incentives for different energy sources. However, the carbon intensity of bioenergy is difficult to quantify because carbon emissions can occur when land use changes to expand production of bioenergy crops rather than simply when the fuel is consumed as for fossil fuels. Using a long-term, integrated assessment model, this paper develops an approach for computing the carbon intensity of bioenergy production that isolates the marginal impact of increasing production of a specific bioenergy crop in a specific region, taking into account economic competition among land uses. We explore several factors that affect emissions intensity and explain these results in the context of previous studies that use different approaches. Among the factors explored, our results suggest that the carbon intensity of bioenergy production from land use change (LUC) differs by a factor of two depending on the region in which the bioenergy crop is grown in the United States. Assumptions about international land use policies (such as those related to forest protection) and crop yields also significantly impact carbon intensity. Finally, we develop and demonstrate a generalized method for considering the varying time profile of LUC emissions from bioenergy production, taking into account the time path of future carbon prices, the discount rate and the time horizon. When evaluated in the context of power sector applications, we found electricity from bioenergy crops to be less carbon-intensive than conventional coal-fired electricity generation and often less carbon-intensive than natural-gas fired generation.

On the other hand, the Chinese economic growth model is heavily reliant on domestic investment. Our study examines the important issue of how China's domestic investment responds to its FDI outflows. We investigate this issue analyzing, for the first time, China's domestic investment at industrial level. We specifically account for the factor of government support given the significant role played by the state in the Chinese economy. Using industrial level data, we further evaluate whether domestic investment reacts to outward FDI differently between state dominated and non-state dominated industries. Our study adopts an accelerator model where the system-Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) is employed for our estimations. Our empirical results suggest that domestic investment responds positively to outward FDI in China, Furthermore, the FDI outflows influences domestic investment differently depending on the level of government support in the particular industries. Such influence is much stronger in state dominated industries than in the non-state dominated ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In order to investigate whether the Dutch will be able to cope with possible cutbacks in the generosity of pensions, we analyze their preparedness for retirement in 2008, at the eve of the prolonged slump. In contrast to previous efforts to measure preparedness for retirement, we disentangle the roles of variation in needs and accumulated resources by comparing annuitized wealth from administrative data with self-reports of minimal and preferred expenditures during retirement. In order to draw conclusions that are representative for the Dutch population we estimate a multivariate sample selection model and simulate pension annuities and consumption needs. The model takes into account that some people thought more about retirement than others and that some people found it more difficult than others to answer questions about retirement needs. We find that in the aggregate the Dutch can expect to retire quite comfortably, exceeding their expenditure floors and affording their preferred level of spending. However, both needs and resources vary widely across the sample and about a fifth cannot afford their minimal expenditures even if they would draw down housing wealth. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Polanyi presented history woven into a new paradigm for analysis of socioeconomic systems, demonstrated discovery similar to abductive processes, and extended abduction into a holistic context. One of Polanyi's most important contributions to socioeconomic analysis is the explanation of three integrated network models of socioeconomic reciprocity. They are coadjuvancy, redistribution, and market exchange. Polanyi extended abductive reasoning in two ways. First, he extended it beyond the cognitive logic of a person to inferences and societal belief changes of institutions. Second, he showed that, in the real world, beliefs are not only fixed like an abductive process, they are fixed in law. Throughout Polanyi's historical presentation, market beliefs are being revised, thus serving as a demonstration of the abductive process. I make both positive and negative critique of a number of Polanyi's concepts, with special attention to reciprocity, the double movement, and freedom. This critique and abduction extension strengthens Polanyi's paradigm for future socioeconomic analysis with his integrative network models.","Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,"Hayden, FG (通讯作者)，Univ Nebraska Lincoln, Econ, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA.",,,,,,,,13,1,1,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

If distribution A Lorenz dominates distribution B, then all indices in a broad class of measures must confirm A as less unequal than B. Recent research, however, shows that standard inequality theory cannot be applied to ordinal data (Zheng Res. Econ.

Typically a criterion used to compare distributions is the polarization relation as proposed by Allison and Foster (J. Health Econ. 23(3), 505-524, 2004).

Finally, the disparities in poverty and the extent to which provincial growth and inequality affect poverty are analyzed.","Off Natl Econ & Social Dev Board, Bangkok 10100, Thailand",,"Limpanonda, S (通讯作者)，Off Natl Econ & Social Dev Board, 962 Krung Kasem Rd, Bangkok 10100, Thailand.",suphannada@nesdb.go.th,,,,,,,35,2,2,0,10,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

These modeling decisions included both the theoretical frameworks laid onto the theorem and the assumptions (including meanings ascribed thereto) said to underlie it. The present article illustrates this using the 1960s and 1970s extortion debate as a backdrop, showing how conclusions reached regarding the theorem's validity hinged on the Coase theorem worlds created by the authors involved.","Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Denver, CO 80217 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Denver,"Medema, SG (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, CB 181, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",steven.medema@ucdenver.edu,,,National Endowment for the Humanities; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Earhart Foundation,National Endowment for the Humanities; Institute for New Economic Thinking; Earhart Foundation,"The author wishes to thank the editors and four anonymous referees for their insightful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

A Natural Experiment,AUSTRALIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNIT-ROOT; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; CHINA; COINTEGRATION; CONSUMPTION; INVESTMENT; INFERENCE,"The Australian home loan market has seen a significant and persistent boom over more than two decades. The extant literature exploring the underlying factors explaining this boom has predominantly looked at the demand side rather than the supply side. In this paper, we look at a major supply-side issue, the introduction of mortgage-backed securities and its likely impact on the home loan market. In doing so, we have developed a mathematical model that theorises this likely relationship. Our mathematical model predicts possible existence of an unstable equilibrium in the home loan market in the presence of mortgage-backed securities. We have subsequently backed up our theoretical exercise with sound empirical evidence acquired and analysed as a natural experiment in the Australian scenario using quarterly market data on home loans and mortgage-backed securities data for a 36-year period from 1976 to 2012. Using unknown structural break tests, we have identified significant breaks around late 1992 to mid-1995, clearly indicating that there were significant changes in the housing market due to the introduction of mortgage-backed securities in early 1993. We have also performed a stability test confirming that under certain conditions this market can become unstable.","[Nabin, Munirul H.; Bhattacharya, Sukanto; Rafiq, Shuddhaswatta] Deakin Univ, Geelong, Vic 3217, Australia",Deakin University,"Nabin, MH (通讯作者)，Deakin Univ, Deakin Business Sch, 72 Elgar Rd, Burwood, Vic 3125, Australia.",mnabin@deakin.edu.au,,"Rafiq, Shuddhasattwa/0000-0002-2109-7441",,,,,32,0,1,0,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

We shed light on the cash flow sensitivity of investment and cash holdings using panel data for Asian firms in economies at different stages of financial development. We find that the cash flow sensitivity of investment and cash holdings rises as bank health deteriorates. Moreover, the impact of non-performing loans on the cash flow sensitivity is more prevalent across firms in economies with a higher level of financial intermediary development. As financial intermediaries develop, firms become more dependent on bank credit and bank-dependent firms are more vulnerable to external shocks hitting the financial system. Therefore, when bank health is impaired, bank-dependent firms increase their reliance on internal funds and raise their propensity to save out of cash flow to materialize profitable investment opportunities in the future.

(2009), who find that fixed exchange rate regimes lead to higher long-run productivity growth in countries with low financial development, while the effect in financially developed countries is insignificant. The channel that explains this evidence in my model is the following: A fixed exchange rate regime leads to lower inflation when the money growth is otherwise high under flexible exchange rates. In turn, lower inflation results in higher long-run productivity growth since financial intermediaries hold a fraction of deposits as reserves, whose return is lower than the market rate and, thus, is affected by inflation. I show that the positive effect of fixed exchange rate regime on growth is larger for countries with lower levels of financial development because inflation and the fraction of deposits held as reserves are typically higher in these countries.

Pre-capitalist societies attempted to suppress envy, and familial and community relations held the emotion of envy in check through social sanctions. Capitalism, however, encourages envy. The connection between capitalism and envy is not new. Thorstein Veblen (2007) methodically addressed it in his explanation of invidious distinction and emulation. As capitalism has evolved into its present incarnation of neoliberalism, however, envy has also evolved. The evolution, nature, and role of envy within neoliberalism must be studied in order to understand more fully its consequences. This research seeks to examine the social ontology of envy. According to advocates of neoliberalism, inequality serves an important social function: It is the great motivator, without which individuals would not have incentives to improve. Inequality and by extension envy are thus heralded as the prime catalysts of economic activity.","Univ Cambridge Girton Coll, Heterodox Econ, Girton, Cambs, England",University of Cambridge,"Wrenn, MV (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge Girton Coll, Heterodox Econ, Girton, Cambs, England.",,,,,,,,24,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

The promotion strategies which enable the companies to have systematic applications of marketing concepts in order to compete with other companies in the sector are discussed. To evaluate the marketing attitudes as applied by the companies, a questionnaire was performed with forty nine Turkish construction firms. The perception and application of the marketing are discussed based on the organizational structure and key interest areas of construction companies.

Human capital is proxied by mean years of education, and stocks of household information are constructed from deflated expenditure on a set of information goods in personal consumption. After unit root and cointegration testing, models were estimated with dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS). Results show that the stocks of information constructed from consumer expenditure flows are related to LPI after control variables are accounted for.

It is comparatively easy to calculate and straightforward to interpret. It always exists, is unique and continuous in the priors. It is undominated, i.e. efficient among the different types of the principal subject to the agent's interim participation constraint. It is a perfect Bayesian equilibrium of the three-stage game in Myerson [16] and Maskin and Tirole [14]. It dominates the RSW allocation as defined in Maskin and Tirole [14] and coincides with it when the latter is undominated. It is the unique neutral optimum as defined in Myerson [16] when there are only two types. When the assured allocation is separating, then it is a neutral optimum with three or more types. It is an equilibrium of a game of competition in a market with adverse selection. (c) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The prospect of informational spillovers implies that in the first best the districts converge in their policy choice. Strikingly, when authority is decentralized, the equilibrium predicts the opposite. The districts use their policy choice to discourage other districts from free-riding on them, thereby inefficiently minimizing informational spillovers. To address this failure, we introduce a dynamic form of federalism in which the central government harmonizes policy choices only after the districts have experimented. This progressive concentration of power induces a policy tournament that can increase the incentive to experiment and encourage policy convergence. We compare outcomes under the different systems and derive the optimal levels of district heterogeneity.","[Callander, Steven] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway",Stanford University; University of Oslo,"Callander, S (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",,,,"European Research Council under the EU's 7th Framework Programme, ERC GA [283236]; European Research Council (ERC) [283236] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)","European Research Council under the EU's 7th Framework Programme, ERC GA; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)","We benefitted from the audiences at the 2012 Nemmers Conference, the 2012 NYU-LSE conference on political economy, the 2012 Symposium on Collective Decisions at the University of Hamburg, Stanford GSB, Yale University, University of Namur, Paris School of Economics, ETH Zurich, APSA, MWPSA, the Australasian Econometric Society Meetings, the Priorat Workshop in Theoretical Political Economy, and in particular the comments of Joe Aldy, David Austen-Smith, Hande Mutlu-Eren, Sarah Soule, Jon Skjaerseth, Daniel Sturm, Dan Treisman, Jorgen Wettestad, Glen Weyl, and Lin Zhang, and the able research assistance of Anders Hovdenes.

We consider a setting in which a data analyst wishes to buy information from a population from which he can estimate some statistic. The analyst wishes to obtain an accurate estimate cheaply, while the owners of the private data experience some cost for their loss of privacy. Agents are rational and we wish to design truthful mechanisms. We show that such problems can naturally be viewed and solved as variants of multi-unit procurement auctions. We derive auctions for two natural settings: 1. The analyst has a fixed accuracy goal and wishes to minimize his payments. 2. The analyst has a budget and wishes to maximize his accuracy. In both results, we treat each agent's cost for privacy as insensitive information. We then show that no individually rational mechanism can compensate individuals for the privacy loss incurred due to their reported valuations for privacy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In contrast, David Hume's approach of supporting state religion and limiting entry into the religious market is not a promising strategy for mitigating religious corruption.

We apply a regression discontinuity design using administrative data from South Korea to estimate the first-year impact of subsidies for formal home and institutional care on informal care use and medical expenditures. These subsidies lead to increases in formal long-term care utilization, even when accounting for crowd out of private spending. Our main finding is that the benefits of subsidized home and facility care are heterogeneous across physical function level, and therefore that setting policy accordingly has the potential to dramatically reduce medical expenses. We also find that formal long-term care is a substitute for informal care at the intensive margin, but do not find such evidence at the extensive margin. The results suggest that publicly financed home care may have limited impact among the more able, but that it may be both more cost-effective and beneficial than institutional care for the least able.

To understand the potential impact of these policy measures on the overall distribution of wealth, this paper investigates the link between components of wealth and the overall distribution of wealth, using factor decomposition methods. Applying methods from the literature and a new decomposition approach based on the recentered influence function, it uses the newly published data provided by the Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey. Specifically, the paper studies the (marginal) contributions of and the elasticity with respect to components of the household's balance sheet for the euro area as a whole as well as for 15 euro area countries. We find some factors (such as wealth held in households' main residence) to contribute a higher proportion to inequality while others (such as risky financial assets) display only a relatively weak contribution. In addition, elasticities reveal a diverging impact of different components on the wealth distribution. Furthermore, the relative contribution and the point elasticities of the components of total wealth differ across euro area countries, indicating regionally distinctive impacts of policy measures.","Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, Vienna, Austria",,"Lindner, P (通讯作者)，Oesterreich Natl Bank, Econ Anal Div, Vienna, Austria.",peter.lindner@oenb.at,,,,,,,51,7,8,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2015,42,2,,,SI,,291,322,,10.1007/s10663-015-9290-6,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,CG5UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353361700006,0

Firms choose technologies from a continuous technology set in stage one, and engage in either Cournot or Bertrand competition in stage two. If the technology set is sufficiently convex and the degree of product differentiation is sufficiently high, we find that (i) Bertrand competition leads to more interior technology choices than Cournot competition, and (ii) Cournot competition induces a greater incentive to innovate for both firms. Furthermore, welfare analysis shows that Bertrand competition always yields higher consumer surplus and social welfare than Cournot competition although the marginal cost of production is higher.","[Ma, Hongkun; Zeng, Chenhang] Shandong Univ, Sch Econ, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, X.

Despite the fact that time is a key trade barrier, the time it takes for shipments to clear customs and how customs' processing times affect firms' exports remain largely unknown. In this paper, we precisely estimate the effects of custom-related delays on firms' exports. In so doing, we use a unique dataset that consists of the universe of Uruguay's export transactions over the period 2002-2011 and includes precise information on the actual time it took for each of these transactions to go through customs. We account for potential endogeneity of these processing times by exploiting the conditional random allocation of shipments to different verification channels associated with the use of risk-based control procedures. Results suggest that delays have a significant negative impact on firms' exports along several dimensions. Effects are more pronounced on sales to newer buyers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Some of these scenarios are the solutions to Mathematical Programs subject to Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) that maximize the net economic gain for the Saudi economy. The policies examined have the potential to generate economic gains exceeding 23 billion USD in 2011, or about 4% of Saudi Arabia's GDP. This economic gain comes mainly from inter-sectoral fuel pricing policies that incent shifting the mix in technologies that generate electricity and produce water from energy intensive technologies to more efficient ones. We show that when complemented by credits for investments in solar and nuclear power generation capacities, a modest increase in the transfer prices of fuels among sectors is sufficient to produce economic gains close to those achieved by deregulating transfer prices. The approach we develop here is an alternative to the classic recommendation of deregulating inter-sectoral fuel prices in situations where the conditions for successful liberalized markets do not exist. It is a template for introducing the notions of incentivizing behavior using prices into countries that rely more on administrative procedures than markets, leading to a deeper understanding of how markets can lead to economic gain.

Since both school locations and student cohorts were selected with very little information, treatment and control groups are balanced on observables. We can therefore estimate the effect of education by comparing the treated to the untreated living in the same village, as well as those living in villages where no schools were set up. We find a significant positive treatment effect of education for the first generation of students, as well as their descendants: they have higher living standards, are less likely to be farmers, and are more likely to be politically active. We find large village-level externalities-descendants of the uneducated in villages with schools do better than those in control villages.

Results of a fractional logit and a logit model show that fixed assets, education and off-farm employment, among other household factors, have a strongly reducing effect on both the intensity and incidence of poverty. Furthermore, some commune characteristics were found to be closely linked to poverty. Notably, the presence of means of transport and post offices significantly reduces both poverty intensity and incidence. However, other commune and household factors affect only poverty incidence or intensity but not both. Hence, a typical approach using a logit/probit model that only examined the determinants of poverty incidence did not adequately evaluate or even ignored important impacts of some factors on poverty intensity.

By developing a model specifically for the 2000-2001 heterodox ERBS program in Turkey, I also depart from the existing literature which has focused almost exclusively in Latin America. What I aimed in this model is to generate the macroeconomic dynamics observed after the implementation of the program in Turkey. In order to assess the model's quantitative performance; it is calibrated by using data restrictions mainly from the Turkish economy. In addition to replicate the general qualitative effects of a currency peg, the model can successfully account quantitatively for the responses of consumption and current account balance and real exchange rate observed in Turkey. The closeness of the predicted consumption boom in the model and the actual boom in Turkey is particularly remarkable: 10.08% predicted increase in total consumption spending vs. 9.6% actual. And 37.06% predicted increase in durables spending vs. 39.5% actual. Overall, results indicate that sticky price model can explain the ERBS syndrome in Turkey to a great extend under the assumption that disinflation program is perceived by the public as non-credible.

We build a life-cycle model where human capital is accumulated in early, middle and late childhood. Both families and the government can increase the human capital of young agents by investing in education at each stage of childhood. Ability in each dynasty and wages per unit of human capital are stochastic. Different realizations of these values and the resultant education spending histories generate a stochastic steady-state distribution of income. Government spending can reduce persistence by weakening the link between parental income and education spending for a child. Our results show that doubling early childhood spending in the U.S. to match levels in Norway and Denmark eliminates less than 8.5 percent of the gap in intergenerational income persistence. Increased government education spending in later childhood has almost no effect on persistence. Early childhood expenditures can have a larger effect when allocated to low income families.

I determine the paths that workers will take after a policy is instated as well as how long a policy needs to be in place to guarantee the successful elimination of discrimination. The policies I consider are (1) a hiring subsidy that promotes the hiring of disadvantaged workers to the better job, (2) an investment voucher that defrays the monetary cost of human capital investment, and (3) an equal treatment policy under which firms are required to treat workers equally across groups. I find that all three policies have the potential to eliminate persistent discrimination if certain conditions are met.

In the classical model including a positive intercept parameter, the volatility process diverges to infinity at least in probability, and it has been shown that no consistent estimator of the full parameter vector, including intercept, exists. This paper considers a nonstationary ARCH model which arises by setting the intercept term to zero. Unlike nonstationary ARCH models with positive intercept, this model includes the interesting case of log volatility following a random walk, which is called the stability case. For the ARCH(1) model without intercept, the paper derives asymptotic theory of the maximum likelihood estimator and proposes a test of the stability hypothesis.

We also complement our analysis with the 2004 Census data to capture the agglomeration of small firms. Unlike previous studies that often focused on specific industries, we assess the impact of agglomeration in a comprehensive range of industries and extend the scope of analysis to upstream industries as well. Moreover, we explore how the ownership of Chinese firms shapes their ability to benefit from agglomeration effect as well as to act as the source of externality. We find that congestion and fiercer competition offset the benefits of agglomeration for firms operating within agglomerated regions. On the other hand, a co-location of large firms contributes significantly to productivity. We also find a more important contribution from the agglomeration of upstream industries than from that of the same industry. Private enterprises are the primary source of agglomeration effects especially in upstream industries, whereas their productivity is boosted most by the agglomeration of other private enterprises. We reckon that industrial agglomeration contributed up to 14% of the productivity growth in China's industrial sector between 2000 and 2007. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Based on energy consumption features of the Chinese households at different income levels, this paper adopts an input-output price model to analyze possible impacts of removing energy subsidies on income distribution under different scenarios. Results show that: (1) The distributional impacts of removing subsidies vary by fossil fuels. From the perspectives of combined effects, transport fuel subsidy removal and coal subsidy removal have the strongest and the weakest progressive effects respectively, while the removal of electricity subsidies has a regressive effect. Moreover, the removal of petroleum product subsidies has the greatest impact on households, followed by the removal of electricity and coal subsidies, respectively. (2) Indirect impacts of energy subsidy reform are greater than direct impacts on households. (3) Government price controls can reduce the negative impact of energy subsidy reform. Policy implications are thus summarized. Energy subsidy reform can start from the energy that has the strongest progressive effect and the minimum impact on households. The Chinese government can take certain compensatory measures to mitigate the impact of reform on poor households. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The essential ingredient to this success is endogenous asset market segmentation permitting the extent of household participation in asset markets to vary smoothly with changes in aggregate conditions. Households in our model incur fixed transactions costs when exchanging bonds and money and, as a result, carry money balances in excess of current spending to limit the frequency of such trades. While we impose no stickiness at the microeconomic level in either prices or portfolio adjustment, our model drives gradual adjustment in the aggregate price level following a monetary shock and thus persistent non-neutralities. In our model, households can alter the timing of their trading activities in response to changes in both individual and aggregate states. We show that this added flexibility relative to fixed segmentation models can substantially reinforce the sluggishness in aggregate price adjustment following a monetary shock, and it can transform dramatic, transitory changes in real and nominal interest rates into more moderate and persistent liquidity effects. When we extend our setting to consider production, we find that small changes in household participation rates add substantial persistence to movements in inflation, and they deliver persistence in real interest rates that is otherwise absent. These changes are also critically important to our model's success in reproducing the empirical correlation between aggregate consumption growth and real interest rates; when they are suppressed, the success is lost.

We discuss whether the economic development of coastal counties benefits the whole area. To do this, we focus on the distance from the coast factor, which is influenced by transportation time. The results indicate the presence of significant spatial autocorrelation in the Bohai Rim Region. Further, economic spatial spillover effects exist in this region. Distance from the coast exerts a significantly negative impact on the local GDP per capita but a significantly positive impact on the GDP per capita of other districts. This means that the economic development of coastal counties does not benefit the whole region. Value of exports exerts a significantly positive influence on the local economy and no significant influence on other counties, while foreign direct investment exerts a significantly positive influence on the local economy and a significantly negative influence on other counties. Number of employees in units exerts a significantly positive influence on the local economy and a significantly negative influence on the other counties. The factors primary industry's share in GDP and tertiary industry's share in GDP influence the local economy positively, but the former exerts no significant influence on other counties and the latter exerts a negative influence on other counties. Rate of fixed asset investment influences the local economy negatively and has no significant effect on other counties. Total retail sales of social consumer goods has no significant influence on the local economy but a positive significant influence on the others. Finally, marine resource utilization and marine output can affect economic growth positively. On this basis, we propose policy suggestions for harmonious economic development in this region.

Our work to this point is to investigate a multi-period mean-variance portfolio optimization under the assumption that the risk aversion is changeable according to the macroeconomic market state as the returns of the risky assets do. It is well known that the Markowitz's mean-variance portfolio selection problem is time-inconsistent, especially when the risk aversion is assumed to be dynamically changeable. Within a game theoretic framework, we derived the (subgame perfect Nash) equilibrium strategy and equilibrium value function in closed-form. We identify some interesting properties of the equilibrium investment strategy, the equilibrium value function, the terminal variance and the efficient frontier under the equilibrium strategy through numerical sensitivity analysis.

Usually, floating exchange rate regimes are considered to better help countries cope with negative real shocks. However, for countries with close ties to the euro area, the advantages of pegging their exchange rate to the euro might dominate even during such a crisis. By applying standard panel growth regressions, the empirical analysis shows that during the crisis, countries with a floating exchange rate (i.e. those that should be better able to react to a crisis) did indeed grow more successfully.","[Oeking, Anne] Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, D-45128 Essen, Germany; [Oeking, Anne] Univ Duisburg Essen, D-45117 Essen, Germany",University of Duisburg Essen,"Oeking, A (通讯作者)，Ruhr Grad Sch Econ, D-45128 Essen, Germany.",anne.oeking@uni-due.de,,,,,,,16,2,2,0,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Each college has strict preferences over the sets of students and each student has strict preferences over the colleges. Each student receives a score from a central exam. The students are endogenously divided into two groups: those who are eligible to apply to colleges, and those who are not. Eligibility respects the students' scores. We extend the college admissions model with eligibility criterion studied by Perach and Rothblum in Int (J Game Theory 39:657-667 (2010)) to a general case where different students may obtain the same scores from the central exam. We introduce three notions of stability that respect eligibility. We define three new rules based on the McVitie-Wilson algorithm, each of which satisfies different notions of stability. We also study incentive compatibility. We show that two of our rules are immune to strategic manipulations.","[Abizada, Azar] ADA Univ, Sch Business, Baku 1008, Azerbaijan; [Chen, Siwei] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Coll, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; ADA University; Sun Yat Sen University,"Abizada, A (通讯作者)，ADA Univ, Sch Business, 11 Ahmadbay Aghaoglu St, Baku 1008, Azerbaijan.",aabizada@ada.edu.az; chensw6@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Chen, Siwei/0000-0002-8486-2251",,,,,16,2,4,0,7,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1434-4742,1434-4750,,REV ECON DES,Rev.

The introduction of Incapacity Benefit in 1995 coincided with a strong decline in disability benefit expenditure, reversing previous sharp increases. From 2008 the replacement of Incapacity Benefit with Employment and Support Allowance was intended to reduce spending further. We bring together administrative and survey data over the period and highlight key differences in receipt of disability benefits by age, sex, and health. These disability benefit reforms and the trends in receipt are also put into the context of broader trends in health and employment by education and sex. We document a growing proportion of claimants in any age group with mental and behavioral disorders as their principal health condition. We also show the decline in the number of older working age men receiving disability benefits to have been partially offset by growth in the number of younger women receiving these benefits.

For identification, we make use of a natural control group of firms that are exempted from paying tariffs. Both imported input and export prices rise. The effect on export prices is specific to firms sourcing inputs from developed economies and exporting output to high-income countries. Results are consistent with a scenario within which firms exploit the input tariff cuts to access high-quality inputs in order to quality-upgrade their exports. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Norms to get married should be stronger among more traditionalist individuals, so they should put more emphasis on the mere fact of getting married and put less emphasis on match quality. In the empirical analysis, we used the East Asian Social Survey to estimate and compare both OLS and instrumental variables results. In line with the theoretical predictions, there seems to be an identity-based happiness gain from marriage for traditionalist individuals. These findings can be interpreted as evidence for identity-based utility effects from marriage. The results also show important differences between OLS and instrumental variables results, confirming the importance of addressing endogeneity properly.","Yonsei Univ, EastAsia Int Coll, Wonju 220710, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Bessey, D (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, EastAsia Int Coll, Yonseidae Gil 1, Wonju 220710, South Korea.",dbessey@yonsei.ac.kr,,,,,,,28,0,3,5,43,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

Our analysis uses school administrative data and household survey data to show that these policies coincided with a decrease in school enrolment of at least 400,000 and possibly more than 900,000 learners. These policies appear to have pushed many students into the labour market at earlier ages than was observed for previous generations, which explains much of the sudden increase in labour force participation and unemployment during this period. However, since these individuals would probably have entered the labour market sooner if not for their poor employment prospects, we argue that the resulting increase in unemployment signifies a more accurate reflection of disguised unemployment that already existed in the mid-1990s rather than a deterioration of labour market conditions.","[Burger, Rulof] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa; [Van der Berg, Servaas; Von Fintel, Dieter] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; Stellenbosch University,"Burger, R (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Econ, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, South Africa.",rulof@sun.ac.za,"Burger, Rulof/AAA-5632-2020","Burger, Rulof/0000-0002-5800-4528; von Fintel, Dieter/0000-0001-6771-1315; Van der Berg, Servaas/0000-0002-3487-4983",Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,The authors would like to thank Martin Gustafsson and John Knight for useful feedback on earlier drafts of this paper.

One of the reasons ascribed for accumulating official reserves is the so-called mercantilist motive. This motive is seen as a part of an active industrial policy in the sense that these resources allow the monetary authorities to maintain a stable and undervalued real exchange rate, promoting economic growth and development via the tradable goods sector. In this paper we attempt to assess this motive using data for ten selected Latin American economies during the period 1996-2011. Unlike most previous work done on this topic, we consider official reserves as one of the determinants of the real exchange rate. Our econometric findings indicate that international reserves in the region appreciate the real exchange rate. This result suggests that the strategy of hoarding reserves in Latin America has not promoted economic growth and development.","Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico",Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico,"Cruz, M (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Autonoma Mexico, Inst Invest Econ, Mexico City 04510, DF, Mexico.",,"Cruz, Moritz/AAC-1229-2020","Cruz, Moritz/0000-0002-3771-8302",DGAPA-PASPA-UNAM,DGAPA-PASPA-UNAM,"Moritz Cruz is a professor in the Instituto de Investigaciones Economicas at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

We document how this changed after 1998. More than 80 percent of the state-owned firms in 1998 were shut down or privatized by 2007. Among firms we classify as state-controlled in 2007, many were restructured and registered as private firms with a controlling share held by a state-owned conglomerate or were new firms established after 1998. In 2007, almost half of the state-controlled firms were registered as private firms, and about 40 percent were new firms established after 1998. The privatization and convergence in labor productivity decelerated after 2007, but the establishment of new state-owned firms continued at roughly the same rate. When we interpret these facts through the lens of an equilibrium model of heterogeneous firms, we find that the transformation of firms that remained under state control and the creation of new state-controlled firms together account for 21 percent of China's growth from 1998 to 2007 and 18 percent of its growth from 2007 to 2012. However, the exit and privatization of state-owned firms had a negligible effect on aggregate growth.","[Hsieh, Chang-Tai] Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Song, Zheng (Michael)] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",University of Chicago; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Hsieh, CT (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,,,,,,,31,165,178,5,54,BROOKINGS INST,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

I construct a unique dataset containing firm-level trade transaction data, balance sheets and credit scores from an independent credit insurance company for Belgian manufacturing firms between 1999 and 2007. Firms are more likely to be exporting or importing if they enjoy lower credit constraints. Also, firms that have better credit rating export and import more. Importing and exporting behaviors differ in how both the level and growth of the various margins of trade are related to credit constraints in one important dimension. In the case of exports, it is the intensive and extensive margins of exports in terms of both product and destinations that are significantly associated with credit constraints whereas for imports it is the extensive margin in terms of products only.

Amongst the factors affecting this wage gap, industrial relations and industry differences still require further research. Using data from EU-SILC in 25 European countries, this article analyses how national wage-setting institutions impact wage differences between male and female full-time employees in three distinct industries. Complementing the country comparison is an in-depth study of the German case using data from the German Linked Employer-Employee Database, shedding light on the interaction of industry-specific wage-setting regulations and gender equity in living wages. Findings from the international comparison suggest a substantial gender wage gap for full-time employees across industries with specific country patterns. Country patterns seem to be due to the overall influence of trade unions and the relationship between pay bargaining strategies and specific minimum wage policies. The German case adds to these findings by analysing the impact of sectoral models of wage bargaining for industry-specific gender wage gaps, focussing on living wages for skilled full-time employees.","[Schaefer, Andrea; Gottschall, Karin] Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, D-28334 Bremen, Germany",University of Bremen,"Schäfer, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bremen, Ctr Social Policy Res, Postfach 33 04 40,Str 5, D-28334 Bremen, Germany.",andrea.schaefer@uni-bremen.de,,"Gottschall, Karin/0000-0003-2978-3224",,,,,77,34,38,0,55,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

But unlike almost all other countries, Germany emerged from the crisis quickly and stronger than before. What lies behind this success story, if at all it is one? The commonplace - neoliberal - answer is that Germany's success is the hard-won reward for strict economic management, combining fiscal conservatism and structural reforms of welfare and the labour market. The latter, by reducing labour costs, fostered competitiveness, boosted growth, and increased employment. Progressive economists arguing that Germany beggared its Eurozone neighbours by squeezing workers' wages, share a similar view. However, this particular explanation of Germany's resilience is wrong and unhelpful. Germany's export success cannot be explained in terms of its (labour) cost competitiveness, but is caused by strong non-price competitiveness. This, in turn, is due - much more than is normally recognized - by the remaining distinctly non-neoliberal dimensions of Germany's economic model (including a Keynesian crisis response). German and European policymakers preaching austerity and structural labour-market changes as the model for other Eurozone countries, misunderstand Germany's rebound from crisis, with serious costs to Eurozone populations.

However, laboratory experiments consistently find different behaviour between auction formats.

Ultimately, the evidence does not support this hypothesis, but a bidder's propensity to gamble is associated with how much risk he takes in both auctions whereas his propensity to take financial risks is not.

We begin by proposing a new set of preferences inspired by the new decision theoretical literature. In our main example, we use the concept of wariness which captures the idea of agents concerned with the worst case scenario. As a consequence, utility functions are weighted sums of a term with discounted future and another which concentrates in the worst period consumption. In this new context, we can have bubbles in a purely classical framework. In the second part of the paper, we change the classical budget set to allow for lack of commitment for the part of the agent. We analyze three different situations where this can happen. In the first one, agents can borrow only with collateral, represented by a durable good. In the second, we study bankruptcy laws where the whole firm is used as collateral, and in the third situation, the agents are punished by exclusion from the market. These three situations have the virtue of being real life based.","[Araujo, Aloisio] IMPA, BR-22460320 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil; [Araujo, Aloisio] EPGE FGV, BR-22250040 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Instituto Nacional de Matematica Pura e Aplicada (IMPA); Escola de Pos-Graduacao em Economia (EPGE),"Araujo, A (通讯作者)，EPGE FGV, Praia Botafogo 190, BR-22250040 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",aloisioa@fgv.br,,,,,,,35,3,3,0,7,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

It provides a simple theoretical account of the coexistence of different forms of family when farms are heterogenous in land endowments and technology is stagnant.

To that end, I develop a dynamic model in which agents differ in labor productivity and disability status, which are both private information. The optimal allocation can exhibit negative marginal labor income tax rates for high-skilled individuals but zero for low-skilled individuals, which is contrary to standard results. Also, I find that a reform to the optimal system in the calibrated model would significantly improve the U.S. system. The welfare gains amount to a 3.48 percent increase in consumption with a utilitarian social welfare function, which might be larger with a non-utilitarian function. Better insurance for people in bad states and reduced intratemporal distortions account for almost all the welfare gains. However, intertemporal distortions do not appear to play a major role.

However, little is known about the different pathways through which education shapes people's satisfaction with life overall. One reason for this is because previous studies have traditionally analysed the effect of education on life satisfaction using single-equation models that ignore interrelationships between different theoretical explanatory variables. In order to advance our understanding of how education may be related to overall quality of life, the current study estimates a structural equation model using nationally representative data for Australia to obtain the direct and indirect associations between education and life satisfaction through five different adult outcomes: income, employment, marriage, children, and health. Although we find the estimated direct (or net) effect of education on life satisfaction to be negative and statistically significant in Australia, the total indirect effect is positive, sizeable and statistically significant for both men and women. This implies that misleading conclusions regarding the influence of education on life satisfaction might be obtained if only single-equation models were used in the analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In textbook discussions, the construction of factor-tracking portfolios is presented as a simple exercise solved using well-known optimization methods such as linear programming. While mathematically correct, the standard approach does not address two practical considerations. First, when building portfolios, investment managers typically consider matching the target loadings of some factors as more important than matching the target loadings of other factors. Second, investment managers generally seek to achieve their investment objectives in the most efficient way possible, by minimizing turnover and/or transaction costs. In short, portfolio construction generally requires prioritizing and reconciling multiple objectives. To address the shortcomings of the standard factor-matching framework, we show how a multi-objective optimization methodology known as 'goal programming' can be effectively employed to build portfolios that successfully balance competing investment aims.","Fidel Investments, Boston, MA 02210 USA",,"Simonian, J (通讯作者)，Fidel Investments, Boston, MA 02210 USA.",joseph.simonian2@fmr.com,,,,,,,10,2,2,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

While acknowledging the trend rise in wage employment in the labour force over the period 1971-2009, the article also shows that over half of the labour force has remained in non-wage employment, which has left a significant share of them vulnerable to the abuses of the capitalist system. The lack of technological upgrading has meant that employers have increasingly resorted to subcontracting work to informal homeworkers to compete in low value added activities. Outsourcing has also allowed employers to bypass the minimum wage legislation.

The results show some intriguing differences and similarities. Unlike heterosexuals, gay and lesbian couples respond differently to changes in the cost of time. However, all couples are characterized by the importance of market goods over time and the importance of human capital in the market over the home, with respect to household production. Hence, although there are differences in the sexual division of labor between households of different sexual orientations, the value of household commodities is mostly driven by differences in the amount of market goods used in the home. Market goods are determined by income, and differences in income within a couple-type swamp differences in income across couple-types, and as a result there is no statistical difference in the value of household commodities produced across the three sexual orientations.

Robustness check demonstrates that the model is informative on seemingly unrelated time series; further, we also provide a simple application of performance attribution.","[Anghel, Andrei; Dumitrescu, Dalina] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, FABBV, Bucharest, Romania; [Tudor, Cristiana] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, REI, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Anghel, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, FABBV, Bucharest, Romania.",andrei.anghel@strade.ro; dalina.dumitrescu@fin.ase.ro; cristiana.tudor@net.ase.ro,"tudor, cristiana/A-2705-2010; Tudor, Cristiana/AGZ-0508-2022; Dumitrescu, Dalina/F-9911-2016; Anghel, Andrei/J-4749-2015","tudor, cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666; Tudor, Cristiana/0000-0001-6108-1666;","European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115]; CNCS-UEFISCDI [IDEI 303, PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593]",European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development; CNCS-UEFISCDI,"The contribution of Andrei Anghel to this work was cofinanced from the European Social Fund through Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013, project number POSDRU/159/1.5/S/142115 Performance and excellence in doctoral and postdoctoral research in Romanian economics science domain.; The contribution of Cristiana Tudor to this research was supported by CNCS-UEFISCDI, Project number IDEI 303, and code PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0593.",,23,4,4,1,17,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

One plan is offered by a profit-maximizing private insurer; the other by social-welfare-maximizing public option. In equilibrium, the distinct objectives of the two insurers induce adverse selection in consumer choice: the public option covers the less healthy consumers, yielding the more profitable segment of market to the private insurer.

The Error Correction Model is estimated to measure short-run dynamic effects and the long-run equilibrium between the two time series. The empirical evidence suggests that Wagner's law is supported.

However, while an extensive set of existing studies demonstrate diversification benefits when investors hold international stocks or bonds, they are generally silent on the implications of holding commodities. Using an asset pricing framework, we investigate the benefits to investors from holding commodities, both individually and in portfolios. Generally, commodity and stock markets are integrated, although there are time-varying benefits to investors that are subject to sample period selection and investment horizon. We show that Asian investors receive positive risk adjusted returns in gold and rice markets but not in any of the other commodity markets investigated. The risk adjusted returns are time-varying: during the Asian financial crisis risk adjusted returns were negative - a penalty for investing in commodities - whereas during the global financial crisis the reverse was true and investors earned positive excess returns. The time-varying nature of the benefits that arise from diversification in commodities and their breakdown during periods of crisis, highlight the problems that investors may face when using commodities for long-term investment in addition to traditional holdings of stocks and bonds.","[Batten, Jonathan A.] Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia; [Szilagyi, Peter G.] Cent European Univ, CEU Business Sch, H-1023 Budapest, Hungary; [Szilagyi, Peter G.] Univ Cambridge, Judge Business Sch, Cambridge CB2 1AG, England; [Wagner, Niklas F.] Univ Passau, Dept Business & Econ, D-94030 Passau, Germany",Monash University; Central European University; University of Cambridge; University of Passau,"Batten, JA (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Monash Business Sch, Dept Banking & Finance, Caulfield, Vic 3145, Australia.",jonathan.batten@monash.edu,"Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/AAC-8854-2019; Batten, Jonathan/J-3838-2013","Szilagyi, Peter Gabor/0000-0003-1197-7928; Batten, Jonathan/0000-0002-3871-7360",,,,,60,16,15,1,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We show, in fact, that market power matters, depending on the level of intra-modal competition, and that airlines apply differentiated mark-ups. Besides, consistent with the implementation of inter-temporal price discrimination (IPD), we find a non-monotonic inter-temporal profile of fares with a turning point included in the interval of the 43rd to 45th days before departure.

Another important stage, which is quite widely discussed among scholars, is the imposition of fines against cartels. The main problem, which occurs on the practical and theoretical level is the estimation of the optimal size of fines. Although propositions stating that today's fines are possibly too low, more and more often appear in the scientific literature and public space, the concept of the optimal fine is not fully analyzed and discussed among academic society yet. It is important that the size of the fine allows to find the compromise among damage settlement, deterrence from other violations of competition law, punishment of violators and practical possibilities to pay the fine. In this article the main attention is paid to the concept of the optimal fine in the country of small economy with developing culture of competition. The empirical analysis is based on Lithuanian cases. This country is chosen because it corresponds to the features of the small economy with the developing culture of competition. In Lithuania, the Law on Competition became effective in 1999 and the competition has not been treated as a value yet. The empirical analysis of two Lithuanian cartels cases allowed to assess and identify the specifics of the economic efficiency of fines imposed on cartels. According to the theoretical and practical analysis, the recommendations pointed to the improvement of the fining system, are presented in the article as well.","[Bruneckiene, Jurgita; Pekarskiene, Irena] Kaunas Univ Technol, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Bruneckiene, J (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",jurgita.bruneckiene@ktu.lt; irena.pekarskiene@ktu.lt,"Bruneckiene, Jurgita/AAE-4948-2020","Bruneckiene, Jurgita/0000-0002-8281-1813",Research Council of Lithuania [IEP-01/2012],Research Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),This research was funded by a grant (No. IEP-01/2012) from the Research Council of Lithuania.,,58,2,2,0,16,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The seminal work by Alfred Marshall has represented the foundation for a rich strand of literature, whose late expansion and refinement were inspired by the experiences of localised development in emerging regions. This is the case of Italian industrial districts, which have emerged as a territorial model of industrial agglomeration, decentralised production and flexible specialisation. Recently, the traditional explananda of the emergence of clusters have been reconsidered. The evidence about the growth of clusters in areas that did not have obvious natural advantages, or the first comers' benefits of early agglomeration economies, has inspired a different conceptualisation, which draws consistently from the evolutionary perspective on industrial dynamics. Klepper shows that more successful firms have higher spin-off rates and their spin-offs tend to outperform competitors. Organisational reproduction and heredity are thus identified as the primary forces underlying clustering. The present paper investigates the emergence and evolution of an Italian industrial district, the Sassuolo tile district, one of the largest and most successful ceramic districts in the world and a paradigmatic example of an Italian Marshallian district. Overall, our findings confirm that organisational reproduction and heredity represent primary mechanisms of clustering. However our results also show that spin-offs do not perform better than non-spin-offs.

That is, a poor person is on average willing to forgive 102 percent more of their total consumption in order to have inflation reduced from 10 percent to 0. In absolute terms this represents a cost of 0.461 percent of consumption for the poorest and 0.228 percent for the richest. I accomplish this by introducing preference heterogeneity in a monetary search model first developed by Lagos and Wright, and calibrate the model to match each agent's type of cash holdings, approximated by their holdings in transactional accounts that bear almost no interest, as a fraction of their net worth using data from the Survey of Consumer Finances. I also show that this welfare difference increases to 130 percent (2.28 percent for the poorest 20 percent and 0.992 percent for the richest 20 percent) whenever frictions in the use of money are imposed (holdup problem). This distributional effect is further augmented if more frictions in the terms of trade are present. The ability to explicitly model these frictions is the advantage of using this model. Hence, inflation in this framework, as other studies have shown, acts as a regressive consumption tax; and this regressiveness is augmented with the holdup problem.","Colorado Coll, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA",Colorado College,"de Araujo, P (通讯作者)，Colorado Coll, 14 E Cache La Poudre, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA.",Pedro.deAraujo@coloradocollege.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

In a context of acute competition, firms are required to adequately answer to growing internal and external pressures, by efficiently exploiting, acquiring and developing new knowledge. As a consequence, companies face difficulties to hire the right individuals to perform a specific assignment at a given point in time. Additionally, highly knowledgeable workers, who are specialized in advanced technical areas, are not necessarily equipped with the competences required to perform certain essential activities. In this context, there is a need for further research in the field of intellectual capital management, in order to help firms better identify, assess, develop and efficiently mobilize knowledge workers' skills and competences. The purpose of this research is two fold. First, it explores existing literature on competency-driven approaches as well as on dynamic capabilities. Based on this review, it proposes a comprehensive framework for knowledge portfolio optimization. Second, the study examines ways and means through which a competency-driven approach acts as a lever of internal dynamic capabilities. The study is based on a field research conducted within an engineering environment. A multi-dimensional competency management method is developed and takes into account the various strategic configurations of the studied departments. Challenges emerging from incorrect identification, assessment, and evolution over time of required competences are discussed. This paper contributes to research in the field of organizational learning, by introducing an operational competency-driven method, and addressing performance implications. This study thus aims to reach out corporate policy makers and field practitioners by investigating, highlighting, and further supporting the significant role of evolutionary competences in capability-enhancing approaches. In particular, the integrative approach described in this study aims to enable team managers to identify opportunities for competency development. For this reason, the study contributes to advance organizational learning designs.","[Depeige, Audrey] Inst Knowledge & Innovat South East Asia, Bangkok, Thailand; [Girodon, Julien] ERPI ENGSI, Nancy, France",,"Depeige, A (通讯作者)，Inst Knowledge & Innovat South East Asia, Bangkok, Thailand.",audrey.depe@bumail.net; julien.girodon@univ-lorraine.fr,"D., Audrey/K-4859-2013","D., Audrey/0000-0002-7469-2551",,,,,27,1,1,0,9,ACAD CONFERENCES LTD,NR READING,"CURTIS FARM, KIDMORE END, NR READING, RG4 9AY, ENGLAND",2049-0933,,978-1-910810-01-9,PROC EUR CONF INTELL,,,2015,,,,,,,72,79,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD2QA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359062600009,0

We study conditions under which ambiguity-averse consumers survive and affect prices in the limit. If ambiguity vanishes with time or if the economy exhibits no aggregate risk, ambiguity-averse consumers survive, but have no long-run impact on prices. In both scenarios ambiguity-averse consumers are fully insured against ambiguity in equilibrium and thus behave as expected utility maximizers with correct beliefs. If ambiguity-averse consumers are not fully insured against ambiguity, their behavior mimics expected utility maximizers with wrong beliefs and a stochastic discount factor which might be consistently higher or lower than their actual discount factor. We use this insight to analyze a Markov economy with large persistent ambiguity. Consumers with decreasing absolute ambiguity aversion whose prudence with respect to ambiguity exceeds twice their absolute ambiguity aversion a.s. survive in the presence of expected utility maximizers with correct beliefs. If the economy further exhibits aggregate risk, they drive the expected utility maximizers out of the market and determine prices in the limit. In contrast, consumers with increasing or constant absolute ambiguity aversion only survive in the absence of aggregate risk and have no impact on limit prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Generally, a typical Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) only includes a core set of variables. As such, other variables, for example alternative measures of inflation that might be of interest to policy-makers, do not feature in the model. Given this, we implement a closed-economy New Keynesian DSGE model-based procedure which includes variables that do not explicitly appear in the model. We estimate such a model using an in-sample covering 1971Q2 to 1999Q4 and generate recursive forecasts over 2000Q1 to 2011Q4. The hybrid DSGE performs extremely well in forecasting inflation variables (both core and nonmodelled) in comparison with forecasts reported by other models such as AR(1). In addition, based on ex-ante forecasts over the period 2012Q1-2013Q4, we find that the DSGE model performs better than the AR(1) counterpart in forecasting actual GDP deflator inflation.","[Gupta, Rangan; Kanda, Patrick T.; Modise, Mampho P.] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Paccagnini, Alessia] Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ, Milan, Italy",University of Pretoria; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,,"Paccagnini, Alessia/0000-0002-2421-7242",,,,,33,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Each household receives a private signal about future productivity. In equilibrium, the stock price serves to aggregate and transmit this information. We find that dispersed information about future productivity affects the quantitative properties of our real business-cycle model in three dimensions. First, households' ability to learn about the future affects their consumption-savings decision. The equity premium falls and the risk-free interest rate rises when the stock price perfectly reveals innovations to future productivity. Second, when noise trader demand shocks limit the stock market's capacity to aggregate information, households hold heterogeneous expectations in equilibrium. However, for a reasonable size of noise trader demand shocks the model cannot generate the kind of disagreement observed in the data. Third, even moderate heterogeneity in the equilibrium expectations held by households has a sizable effect on the level of all economic aggregates and on the correlations and standard deviations produced by the model. For example, the correlation between consumption and investment growth is 0.29 when households have no information about the future, but 0.41 when information is dispersed.","[Hassan, Tarek A.] Univ Chicago, NBER, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hassan, Tarek A.] Univ Chicago, CEPR, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Mertens, Thomas M.] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",National Bureau of Economic Research; University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Center for Economic & Policy Research (CEPR); New York University,"Hassan, TA (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, NBER, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",tarek.hassan@chicagobooth.edu; mertens@stern.nyu.edu,,,,,,,37,5,5,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0889-3365,1537-2642,,NBER MACROECON ANNU,NBER Macroecon.

(2004). The new MDDF allows for calculating comparable technical efficiencies for banks under different technologies relative to the potential technology available to the industry across nations. The inefficiency term of the new MDDF is further associated with relevant environmental variables of the form proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). The new MDDF is then applied to examine and compare bank efficiencies of 17 Central and Eastern European countries. Non-performing loans (NPLs) are regarded as an undesirable, jointly produced with various loans, and the omission of them tends to underestimate technical inefficiency scores. Evidence is found that the estimated technology gap dominates technical efficiencies.

According to empirical results, the stock market and the foreign exchange market have a long-run co-integration relationship. In the short-run, the stock market and the foreign exchange market are negatively correlated, supporting the viewpoints of the portfolio approach. However, using the error-correction adjustment process, the long-run relationship between the two is positive, supporting the results of the traditional approach.

The models offer a base for the analysis of the potential budgetary implications of the government policies for the target countries. A short-and mid-term forecast for public expenditure is an important part of the modern methods of governmental management for the Central and Eastern European countries. This involves taking into account a wide range of factors, from GDP, inflation, demographic evolution and age share, to public expenditure type correlation. Such a forecast can be obtained with the help of artificial neural networks (ANNs), using the application GMDH Shell, which proved its ability to create complex and accurate forecasts for the economic, social and financial domains.","[Magdalena, Radulescu; Logica, Banica] Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Studies, Pitesti, Arges, Romania; [Zamfiroiu, Tatiana] Univ Craiova, Fac Business Adm, Craiova, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Pitesti; University of Craiova,"Magdalena, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pitesti, Fac Econ Studies, Targu Din Vale St 1, Pitesti, Arges, Romania.",magdalena.radulescu@upit.ro,"Radulescu, Magdalena/AEW-0205-2022",,,,,,36,5,5,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

In the second stage, we compare two decision modes, non-cooperative and cooperative, in order to characterize the nature of cooperation within the families. In addition, we extend the basic model on the basis of a Stackelberg game. In this setting, we consider the case in which a man acts as a leader and a woman acts as a follower.

In comparison with mainstream literature, we focus exclusively on the reduction of the tax distortions that affect labor demand, using the revenues generated by environmental levies. Our starting point is the double dividend hypothesis with respect to the environmental taxation. The main objective of this paper is to validate the second dividend hypothesis, hence testing the carbon taxation ability to reduce harmful effects of taxes on inputs such as labor. Following the trajectory of the double dividend hypothesis, the paper examines the potential of carbon taxation enactment accompanied by the payroll tax cuts in order to lower the efficiency costs of these pre-existent distortionary taxes. The feasibility of tax swap mechanism between environmental and payroll taxation is verified through estimating and comparing their efficiency costs. The results obtained from empirical analysis confirm that there is a high potential of swapping these taxes and implementing offsetting measures, where the efficiency costs of payroll taxation are considerably larger than of environmental taxation. Hence, we conclude that there is enough room for this tax swap mechanism to take place which would have a two-folded outcome -environment protection improvement and decreasing the efficiency costs of the fiscal system. Given the fact that the efficiency costs of environmental taxes are considerably lower (both in absolute and percentage values), than payroll taxation in the EU, it is possible to apply payroll tax cuts and consequently increase the ratio of environmental taxation.","[Nerudova, Danuse; Dobranschi, Marian] Mendel Univ Brno, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Nerudova, D (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",danuse.nerudova@mendelu.cz; marian.dobranschi@mendelu.cz,"Dobranschi, Marian/V-6136-2018; Nerudova, Danuse/J-3034-2012","Dobranschi, Marian/0000-0002-5642-0341; Nerudova, Danuse/0000-0001-8150-6107","Mendel University in Brno, Czech Republic [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0031]","Mendel University in Brno, Czech Republic","The paper is the result of the project Postdoc contracts at MENDELU technical and economic research No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/30.0031, at Mendel University in Brno, Czech Republic.",,35,7,7,1,26,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

We propose a new hybrid forecasting model utilizing the combined prediction's principle as well as the artificial intelligence's technique. First, the new method presented combines the single models in series. Next, we present the principle of hybrid prediction which is a foundation of our model, and its validity is proven and carefully illustrated in this paper. According to this principle, the combined model consists of three sole prediction models and demonstrates greater forecast accuracy than the single model. The new model also owns the qualitative prediction, as well as the quantitative prediction. Furthermore, a clear introduction of the three sole prediction models is given, and the comprehensive forecasting rules are introduced. The comparison analysis is included in this paper to validate the new method, and the multi-agent simulation, including different investment strategies, is given in complex situations, such as the stock market. According to the results of the multi-agent simulation and theoretical proofs, the combined model owns the highest accuracy of stock price prediction and results in more profits than other single models. Accordingly, we can conclude that this model would be a suitable and powerful method in directing investment decisions. This newly presented model functions similarly to the prediction system, which not only exhibits a high accuracy rate but also has an effect on guiding operations in the stock market due to the introduction of intelligent agents.","[Wu, Chong; Luo, Peng; Wang, Lu] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Li, Yongli] Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kun] South Univ Sci & Technol China, Dept Finance Math & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology; Northeastern University - China; Southern University of Science & Technology,"Li, YL (通讯作者)，Northeastern Univ, Sch Business Adm, Shenyang 110819, Peoples R China.",wuchong@hit.edu.cn; luopeng_hit@126.com; liyongli_hit@126.com; wang25999168@163.com; chen.k@sustc.edu.cn,"wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023","LI, Yongli/0000-0002-5617-8866; Wu, Chong/0000-0003-1017-4496; Chen, Kun/0000-0002-8311-469X; Li, Yongli/0000-0002-1979-9057",National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271070]; Doctoral Research Foundation of Education Department of China [20092302110060],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Doctoral Research Foundation of Education Department of China,"This paper was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71271070), and the Doctoral Research Foundation of Education Department of China (20092302110060).",,31,3,3,1,80,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

These cultural attitudes were reported in the World Values Survey, which surveyed individuals' opinions on a series of subjects in various societies. The empirical analysis verifies that cultural attitudes play a significant role in occupational choices: when other factors that may be correlated with one's opportunity and advantage are controlled for, a stronger cultural demand for pecuniary rewards leads individuals to choose more lucrative jobs, and a stronger demand for social prestige leads them to choose more prestigious jobs. The paper further explores the neighborhood effects on cultural transmission and finds a positive relationship between the proportion of the population from the same ancestry in the residential area and the effects of cultural attitudes on occupational selection.

This study examines the role of financial vis-a-vis non-financial firms in transmitting shocks across countries using a dynamic conditional correlation analysis. We provide empirical evidence from a sample of 49 countries. A novel finding of our study is that non-financial firms play a more pronounced role in the cross-market transmission of shocks than financial firms. Financial contagion is positively related to the level of equity market development and bilateral trade intensity. It is higher during periods of US economic downturns and financial crises. Given that the extent of international contagion varies across economic states and is more prevalent in the non-financial than in the financial sector, this study has implications for global sector rotation strategies.

Second, we apply this approach to the identification of structural weaknesses in East Germany relative to the western part of the country. The case of East Germany forms an interesting subject because while its convergence process after unification began promisingly in the first half of the 1990s, convergence has since slowed down. The existing gap can now be traced mainly to structural weaknesses in the East German economy, such as the absence of strong industrial cluster structures. With this in mind, we investigate whether East Germany does in fact reveal the abovementioned structural weaknesses. Does East Germany possess fewer industrial clusters? Are they less connected?

The risks of this transition are endogenous and depend on state of the natural resource system and human behavior. In designing least cost policies of risk reduction, policy makers should consider the optimal mix of natural and human risk reduction. Decisions about the best risk reduction mix matter most for systems vulnerable to ex post multi-stability, in which the natural resource system has the potential to begin in one of multiple, locally optimal basins of attraction. This is because ex ante decisions can affect the initial conditions for the ex post system, thereby determining the ex post basin of attraction and the optimal ex post state. In this paper, we find that an ex ante system that is convex and uniquely stable without risk may become non-convex and multi-stable in the presence of endogenous risks and ex post multi-stability. This result arises because ex post non-convexities, and the uncertainties associated with the invasion and its magnitude, can create ex ante non-convexities that generate multiple optimality candidates.

First, some data on public and private funding levels are presented. The article then discusses two important trends: (i) the increased presence of cost sharing and (ii) the move towards performance-based funding. We show where countries differ in terms of the fees paid by students and the financial support received by students. Using the degree of output orientation and the degree of centralization as dimensions to classify the various countries' funding mechanisms, differences may be shown between countries. Reforms in funding approaches, inspired by new public management thinking, are discussed. One such reform is the introduction of performance agreements that increasingly underlie the public budget of universities. We focus on the drivers of the reforms and the question of whether these reforms actually matter for the performance of national higher education systems-for instance on the issue of student completion rates.","[Jongbloed, Ben; Vossensteyn, Hans] Univ Twente, Ctr Higher Educ Policy Studies, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands",University of Twente,"Jongbloed, B (通讯作者)，Univ Twente, Ctr Higher Educ Policy Studies, POB 217, NL-7500 AE Enschede, Netherlands.",b.w.a.jongbloed@utwente.nl; j.j.vossensteyn@utwente.nl,,,,,,,43,37,37,1,34,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

It is a supply-use model which considers production technologies and allows for supply side constraints. The model has been illustrated for three floods in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Results show that most of the neighboring regions gain from the flood due to increased demand for reconstruction and production capacity constraints in the affected region. Regions located further away or neighboring regions without a direct export link to the affected region mostly suffered small losses. These losses are due to the costs of increased inefficiencies in the production process that have to be paid for by all (indirectly) consuming regions. In the end, the floods cause regionally differentiated welfare effects.","[Koks, Elco E.] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Thissen, Mark] Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy PBL, The Hague, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"Koks, EE (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Inst Environm Studies IVM, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",elco.koks@vu.nl,"Thissen, Mark/ABA-8140-2020; Koks, Elco/ABE-7946-2020","Thissen, Mark/0000-0001-7654-3253; Koks, Elco/0000-0002-4953-4527","EU [282834, 603396]",EU(European Union (EU)),This work was supported by funding from the EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no. 282834 (TURAS - Transitioning towards urban resilience and sustainability) and grant agreement no. 603396 (RISES-AM - Responses to coastal climate change: Innovative Strategies for high End Scenarios - Adaptation and Mitigation).,,47,103,107,3,60,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

To assess the influence of major economic changes, we estimate both linear and nonlinear models for all the macroeconomic fundamentals. Overall, most structural exchange rate models outperform a naive random walk model in terms of forecasting accuracy in the short horizon. When the fundamentals are only linearly modelled, the forecasting ability of the Taylor rule is generally superior to other fundamental models. When the fundamentals are nonlinearly specified, the predictability of some other models rises dramatically to match that of the Taylor rule models in short and/or long horizons. Of importance, we determine that the yen/dollar exchange rate forecasting performance effectively improves in several fundamental models when influential economic changes are incorporated.","[Matsuki, Takashi] Osaka Gakuin Univ, Suita, Osaka, Japan; [Chang, Ming-Jen] Univ Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, England",University of Liverpool,"Matsuki, T (通讯作者)，Univ Liverpool, Dept Econ Finance & Accounting, Liverpool L69 3BX, Merseyside, England.",ming-jen.chang@liverpool.ac.uk,,"Matsuki, Takashi/0000-0002-8027-7397",National Science Council [NSC 101-2410-H-259-016]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K03403] Funding Source: KAKEN,"National Science Council(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The authors would like to thank Kimiko Sugimoto and Jyh-Lin Wu as well as the seminar participants of National Dong Hwa University, the 2016 Asia-Pacific Economic & Financial Development Conference and the 2016 Taiwan Scientific Symposium Edinburgh for their insightful comments.

But how important is risk matching for long-run job satisfaction? Empirical research has been limited because job choices are endogenous, hindering identification of causal effects. We circumvent these problems by using data from the natural experiment of German Reunification. Pre-reunification East Germans chose jobs in a socialist environment without market income risk. These jobs were then exposed to market risks post-reunification, providing quasi-experimental variation. We find that workers in pre-reunification jobs report relatively higher job satisfaction, despite being less well-matched in terms of risk preferences. This unexpected result is robust to alternate explanations which might affect job satisfaction such as potential differences in job expectations, self-selection into leaving pre-reunification jobs, and past unemployment spells. We conjecture the results are consistent with projection bias: individuals at the start of their careers may over-estimate the extent to which risk matching matters for their future job satisfaction.

We also assessed the asymmetric behaviour of these variables by exploring whether they exhibit two particular forms of asymmetry, which are deepness and steepness asymmetries. These results have shown that there is no empirical evidence of business cycle asymmetry in all the variables at any conventional level of significance in the sample period. Also, through application of further robust testing, our findings indicate the presence of pro-cyclical asymmetry in some of the variables and at the same time indicate the presence of asymmetries in the volatility.","[Osman, Mohamed] Univ Dubai, Dubai, U Arab Emirates; [Hoque, Ariful; Hassan, Kamrul] Murdoch Univ, Murdoch, WA, Australia",University of Dubai; Murdoch University,"Hoque, A (通讯作者)，Murdoch Univ, Sch Management & Governance, Murdoch, WA, Australia.",a.hoque@murdoch.edu.au,"Hoque, Ariful/ABB-2497-2020","Hoque, Ariful/0000-0001-8369-6653",,,,,27,0,0,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0004-900X,1467-8454,,AUST ECON PAP,Aust.

This history is primarily consistent with a demand driven theory of institutional change, as the needs of its clients and the type of crisis changed substantially over time. Some deceptively new IMF activities are not entirely new. Before emerging market economies dominated IMF programs, advanced economies were its earliest (and largest) clients through the 1970s. While currency problems were the dominant trigger of IMF involvement in the earlier decades, banking crises and sovereign defaults became the key focus after the 1980s. Around this time, the IMF shifted from providing relatively brief (and comparatively modest) balance-of-payments support in the era of fixed exchange rates to coping with more chronic debt sustainability problems that emerged with force in the developing economies and have now migrated to advanced economies. As a consequence, the IMF has engaged in serial lending, with programs often spanning decades. Moreover, the institution faces a growing risk of lending into insolvency; this has been most evident in Greece since 2010. We conclude with the observation that the IMF's role as an international lender of last resort is endangered.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Int Financial Syst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Trebesch, Christoph] Univ Munich, Dept Econ, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany",Harvard University; University of Munich,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, John F Kennedy Sch Govt, Int Financial Syst, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",carmen_reinhart@harvard.edu; christoph.trebesch@econ.lmu.de,,,,,,,60,33,39,0,29,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Our theoretical framework studies the provision of a durable public good as a modified two-period version of Battaglini et al. (2012). The experimental design allows us to disentangle inefficiencies that would result in a one-shot world (static inefficiencies) from additional inefficiencies that emerge in an environment in which decisions in the present affect future periods (dynamic inefficiencies). We solve the first-best solution and compare it to the symmetric stationary subgame-perfect equilibrium of a legislative bargaining game. The experimental results indicate that subjects do react to dynamic linkages, and, as such, there is evidence of both static and dynamic inefficiencies. The quantitative predictions of the bargaining model with respect to the share of dynamic inefficiencies are closest to the data when dynamic linkages are high. To the extent that behavior is different from the model's predictions, a systematic pattern emerges namely, the use of strategic cooperation, whereby groups increase the efficiency of current proposals by selectively punishing, in future proposals, individuals who propose highly inefficient allocations.

While it is difficult to unite individuals in a common endeavor, some people, who we call movers and shakers, seem able to do it. The article specifically examines moving and shaking of an investment project, whose return depends on its quality and the total capital invested in it. We analyze a model with two types of agents: managers and investors. Managers and investors initially form social connections. Managers then bid to buy control of the project, and the winning bidder puts effort into making investors aware of it. Finally, a subset of aware investors are given the chance to invest and they decide whether to do so after receiving private signals of the project's quality. We first show that connections are valuable since they make it easier for a manager to move and shake the project (i.e., obtain capital from investors). When we endogenize the network, we find that while managers are identical ex ante, a single manager emerges as most connected; he consequently earns a rent. In extensions, we move away from the assumption of ex ante identical managers to highlight forces that lead one manager or another to become a mover and shaker. Our theory sheds light on a range of topics, including entrepreneurship, venture capital, and anchor investments.","[Akerlof, Robert] Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England; UNSW Australia Business Sch, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Warwick; University of New South Wales Sydney,"Akerlof, R (通讯作者)，Univ Warwick, Coventry, W Midlands, England.",,,,Australian Research Council (ARC) [FT130101159]; Australian Research Council [FT130101159] Funding Source: Australian Research Council,Australian Research Council (ARC)(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council),"We are grateful to the editors, Andrei Shleifer and Pol Antras, and three anonymous referees for detailed and thoughtful suggestions.

It finds that consumers increase their liquor consumption in response to extended Sunday on-premises sales hours, but not in response to extended off-premises sales hours.

However, most privatization studies that examine the efficiency impacts of privatization employ relatively short time frames: usually 3-years before and 3-years after the privatization. In contrast, this study examines the long run effects (up to 24 years) of privatization on productivity based on an examination of major, mostly federal, share-issue privatizations in Canada. We control for factors that might affect productivity apart from privatization by including panels of Always-SOE firms and Always Private firms, and estimating difference-in-difference models. The major finding is that the productivity of Privatized SOEs increases relative to SOEs at a decreasing rate, peaking at 14-16 years. Despite this improvement, the productivity of privatized firms, continues to lag that of Always-Private firms. We consider some of the policy implications of these findings.

Religiosity and religious affiliation may serve as markers for statistical discrimination. Further, affiliation to the same religion may enhance group identity, or affiliation irrespective of creed may lend social identity, and in turn induce taste-based discrimination. Religiosity may also relate to general prejudice. We test these hypotheses across three culturally diverse countries. Participants' willingness to discriminate, beliefs of how trustworthy or trusting others are, as well as actual trust and trustworthiness are measured incentive compatibly. We find that interpersonal similarity in religiosity and affiliation promote trust through beliefs of reciprocity. Religious participants also believe that those belonging to some faith are trustworthier, but invest more trust only in those of the same religion religiosity amplifies this effect.

A cointegrating relationship between the real effective exchange rate and the ratio of the current account balance to the GDP is tested, based on both linear and nonlinear models. The half-life of current account imbalances is relatively short, implying high capital mobility. Results point to the existence of a long-run relationship, and in most cases the causality runs from the exchange rate to the current account.","[Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Eesti Pank, Dept Econ & Res, Tallinn, Estonia; [Cuestas, Juan Carlos] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Regis, Paulo Jose] Xian Jiaotong Liverpool Univ, Int Business Sch Suzhou, Suzhou, Peoples R China",Bank of Estonia (Eesti Pank); University of Sheffield; Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University,"Cuestas, JC (通讯作者)，Eesti Pank, Dept Econ & Res, Tallinn, Estonia.;Cuestas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England.",juan.carlos.cuestas@eestipank.ee; paulo.regis@xjtlu.edu.cn,"Cuestas, Juan Carlos/K-4270-2014","Regis, Paulo Jose/0000-0002-3256-464X","MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain) [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; Generalitat Valenciana project [AICO/2016/038]","MINECO (Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Spain)(Spanish Government); Generalitat Valenciana project(Center for Forestry Research & Experimentation (CIEF))","The authors gratefully acknowledge useful comments on a previous draft entitled 'On the relationship between competitiveness and current account: The case of East Asian countries' when presented at the 1st International Seminar on Asia and Pacific Economies (XJTLU, Suzhou, China, 2-3 May 2013).

The methodology is based on Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) and Dynamic Model Selection (DMS) framework The important feature of DMA method is an allowance for both time-varying coefficients and large state space model (i.e., the set of oil price determinants can change in time). Within this framework it was explicitly shown how the significance of oil price determinants vary in time. These determinants itself were chosen with respect to some previous studies. Contrary to the currently reported DMA applications in some other fields, no significant evidence was found that DMA is superior over, for example, ARIMA model. However, DMA could also not been rejected as a significantly worse model due to certain statistical tests. The performed DMA analysis was checked for robustness on various model parameters and for certain computational issues. It was found, for example, that in the context of the 2008 oil price peak exchange rates and stock markets were important oil price drivers, whereas oil production or oil import were just minor determinants. Some role of the change in inventories was found, but not greater than the one in 1991. The role of China's economy as an oil price driver in 2008 was found to be relatively smaller than in other time periods. Also, the robustness of these findings was discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Such behavior is expected to depend on the incentives imposed by the electoral system. We estimate the causal effect of local representation in a closed-list proportional representation system where individual candidates have no clear electoral incentive to favor their hometown. Using data from Norwegian regional governments, we still find a hometown bias. We document that municipalities with a representative on the regional council from the same party as the regional governor tend to obtain more funding for local investments. Citizens also tend to vote more often for parties whose gubernatorial candidate is from their own hometown, consistent with expectations of particularistic benefits. A possible explanation is that regional council members are often recruited from local politics and remain loyal to their roots. We find no evidence that regional council experience affects politicians' future career prospects at the local level. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This paper takes a quantitative approach to this problem. Regression analysis of auction data from 1965-2015 reveals that the age-price profiles of Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol - the two greatest painters born in the 20th century - closely resemble the profiles of the two artists' careers derived both from textbooks of art history and from retrospective exhibitions. The agreement of these sources confirms that the auction market assigns the highest prices to the art that scholars judge to be the most important, and examination of the artists' careers reveals that this art is the most important because it is the most innovative. These results lend strong support to our understanding of creativity at the individual level, with a sharp contrast between the extended experimental innovation of Pollock and the sudden conceptual innovation of Warhol.","[Galenson, David W.; Lenzu, Simone] Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Galenson, David W.] Univ CEMA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Chicago,"Galenson, DW (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Dept Econ, 1126 East 59th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Galenson, DW (通讯作者)，Univ CEMA, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",galenson@uchicago.edu; lenzus@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,44,3,4,0,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

In the framework of fiscal decentralization, municipalities in the Czech Republic have an opportunity to influence immovable property tax revenues. The aim of the research is to find out the municipalities' attitude towards the possibility of increasing immovable property tax revenues through a coefficient and how this option is used by municipalities. In the article, there is a description of the immovable property tax development in the Czech Republic on the basis of time series. The research relies on the evaluation of secondary statistical data and on the results of primary research focused on the application of the local coefficient. Municipalities have the option to edit tax components and the amount of tax reflects then the specificities and needs of the community. However, almost 92% of municipalities still postpone the introduction of a local coefficient. The motivation for the introduction of local coefficients was an increase in municipalities' revenues generally or the need to fund specific projects. On the other hand the empirical research showed that some form of compensation is introduced in 46% of the municipalities.","[Janouskova, Jana; Sobotovicova, Sarka] Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namest 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic",Silesian University Opava,"Sobotovicová, S (通讯作者)，Silesian Univ Opava, Sch Business Adm Karvina, Dept Finance & Accounting, Univ Namest 1934-3, Karvina 73340, Czech Republic.",sobotovicova@opf.slu.cz,"Sobotovicova, Sarka/AAA-6033-2021","Sobotovicova, Sarka/0000-0001-9665-2043","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization","This paper was supported by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports Czech Republic within the Institutional Support for Long-term Development of a Research Organization in 2015.",,32,9,9,2,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Key determinants are the costly international pressure and the size of the haven country's revenue pool. The latter is determined endogenously by the decisions of many individual investors. Our analysis suggests a non-standard market model that explains why haven countries would ever comply with international standards of transparency despite the large empirically observable returns in the tax haven business. It also alludes to why service fees in tax havens can be positive despite a competitive financial market with multiple tax havens. Furthermore, we identify a trade-off between the fight against tax havens and high tax rates. Finally, low fines for disclosed offshore tax evasion, e.g. in special programs for tax evaders who voluntarily report their offshore wealth, strengthen haven countries against international pressure.

We study optimal output growth in the presence and in the absence of concerns about model uncertainty, and find that these can lead to substantially different conclusions regarding the optimal emissions and the optimal mix of fossil fuel. In particular, the optimal use of coal will be significantly lower on a robust path, while the optimal use of oil/gas will edge down.","[Li, Xin] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Narajabad, Borghan] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA; [Temzelides, Ted] Rice Univ, Dept Econ, Houston, TX 77251 USA; [Temzelides, Ted] Rice Univ, James A Baker Inst Publ Policy 3, Houston, TX 77251 USA",International Monetary Fund; Federal Reserve System - USA; Rice University; Rice University,"Li, X (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",XLi4@imf.org; borghan.narajabad@frb.gov; tedt@rice.edu,,,,,,,23,9,9,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

While North Dakota oil production has increased significantly since 2005 with the development of Bakken formation, the impact on the rest of the economy including agriculture, historically the largest industry in North Dakota, has received little attention. We employ a variant of the Corden-Neary resource development model to test the impact of the oil boom in North Dakota caused by technical change on employment and wages in two tradable sectors of the state economy: agriculture and energy, alongside the rest of the state's economy, using a Vector Error Correction (VEC) model marking the very first use of the dynamic vector autoregression (VAR) analysis in this theoretical framework. It was determined that the oil boom, as represented by the number of rigs in the state, led to an increase in employment and wages in energy sector, as expected, but also in the rest of the economy. Oil development activity had no significant impact on agricultural wages. Both energy sector equations, employment and wage, suggest relative independence of these variables from the movements in agriculture and the rest of the economy, and being impacted mostly by the changes in energy sector itself. Seasonality does not play significant role in energy sector employment and wages unlike in agriculture and the rest of the economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

If moral hazard explains banking instability arising from the adoption of deposit insurance, then deposit insurance will be associated with bank insolvency more than with bank runs. To test the hypothesis, we develop a new empirical framework distinguishing between banking instability initiated by panic withdrawals of deposits, and banking instability initiated by the insolvency problem of banks. Using a dataset covering 118 countries over the period 1980-2004, we find that deposit insurance per se has no significant effect either on bank insolvency or on bank runs. However, interacting deposit insurance with credit to the private sector, we observe a positive and significant effect on bank insolvency and bank runs, suggesting that moral hazard outweighs the positive effect of deposit insurance on banking stability.","[Ngalawa, Harold] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Westville Campus,Private Bag X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa; [Tchana, Fulbert Tchana] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Viegi, Nicola] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Private Bag X20, ZA-0028 Hartfield, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; The World Bank; University of Pretoria,"Ngalawa, H (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Westville Campus,Private Bag X54001, ZA-4000 Durban, South Africa.",ngalawa@ukzn.ac.za; ftchanatchana@worldbank.org; nicola.viegi@up.ac.za,"Ngalawa, Harold Phellix/HGE-9156-2022","viegi, nicola/0000-0002-7181-6686; Ngalawa, Harold/0000-0002-7040-5594",,,,,42,15,18,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1514-0326,1667-6726,,J APPL ECON,J.

However, a simultaneous decline in the wage share leads to an overall decline in EU15 GDP; hence, the EU15 as a whole is a wage-led economy. Furthermore, Austria and Ireland also experience a decline in growth when they decrease their wage share along with their trading partners. The results indicate that the decline in the wage share had significant negative effects on growth in the EU15 and supports the case for wage coordination.

We study the transmission mechanism of shocks from returns to risk-neutral volatility by providing an examination of the news-impact curves and impulse-response functions of risk-neutral volatility, in order to better understand how option prices respond to return innovations. We report a value of -3% for the magnitude of the average VRP and we recover the empirical densities under physical and risk-neutral measures. Allowing for VRP is crucial for adding flexibility to the shape of the two distributions. In our estimation procedure, we adopt a MLE approach that incorporates both physical return and risk-neutral VIX dynamics. By introducing volatility - instead of variance - innovations in the joint likelihood function and by allowing for contemporaneous correlation between innovations in returns and the VIX we show that we may critically reduce the bias and improve the efficiency of the joint maximum likelihood estimator, especially for the parameters of the volatility process. Modeling returns and the VIX as a bi-variate normal permits identification of a contemporaneous correlation coefficient of approximately -30% between returns and risk-neutral volatility.

Prospects under the Clean Power Plan,ENERGY ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Electricity generation; Clean Power Plan; Natural gas; Emission rates,,"EPA proposed the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to regulate CO2 emissions from existing power plants. The CPP establishes state-by-state emission rate goals for affected fossil units, largely existing coal and natural gas combined cycle generators. A key element of the proposal is its flexibility mechanisms, including the ability of states to trade obligations with other states and to convert to mass-based targets. How states decide to take advantage of this flexibility may have significant impacts on fuel markets of the future. This analysis uses the DIEM economy/electricity model to examine the consequences of a range of these alternative choices for fuel demands across the United States. Key findings for the June 2014 proposal include: the CPP tends to continue an ongoing shift in fuel consumption by electricity generators from coal to natural gas, a rate-based approach to CPP leads to more gas use in the early years than a mass-based approach but the effect disappears over time as new more-efficient gas units are constructed, and there may be substantial regional variation and stresses in fuel markets, especially over the next five years.

The impact of union coverage on job satisfaction,OXFORD ECONOMIC PAPERS-NEW SERIES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,LIFE SATISFACTION; TRADE-UNIONS; MEMBERSHIP; QUALITY,"The links between unionization and job satisfaction remain controversial. In keeping with the existing literature we find statistically significant negative correlations between unionization and overall job satisfaction. However, failure to account for fixed unobservable differences between covered and uncovered employees leads to a systematic underestimate of the effects of coverage on both overall job satisfaction and satisfaction facets for both union members and non-members. Once one accounts for these differences between covered and uncovered employees, union coverage is positively and significantly associated with satisfaction with pay and hours of work. Examination of the pay satisfaction effect indicates this is apparent for employees who attain coverage in the same job and for those who become covered when switching employers, but the effect is not apparent for job switchers who remain with the same employer. Furthermore, the 'new' coverage effect on pay satisfaction dissipates over time.","[Bryson, Alex] UCL, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England; [Bryson, Alex] NIESR, London, England; [White, Michael] Univ Westminster, Policy Studies Inst, London, England",University of London; University College London; University of Westminster,"Bryson, A (通讯作者)，UCL, 20 Bedford Way, London WC1H 0AL, England.;Bryson, A (通讯作者)，NIESR, London, England.",a.bryson@ucl.ac.uk,,,Norwegian Research Council [202647],Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway),This research was supported by the Norwegian Research Council (grant number 202647) to AB.,,34,14,17,0,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We applied the fixed effects panel model using data on a large number of countries over the period 1980-2010. Our results suggest that higher age dependency not only directly impacts negatively on labour productivity but also modifies the impact of other determinants of labour productivity. Child dependency has a more adverse effect on labour productivity than old age dependency. We specifically find that the marginal effects of gross capital formation, information and communication improvement, and labour market reforms are significant at lower levels of age dependency. However, the marginal effect of savings on labour productivity is high at a high level of age dependency. The impact of age dependency varies between developed and developing economies. Diversity in the size and nature of age dependency across regions and different income groups help to explain the labour productivity differential across them.","[Choudhry, Misbah Tanveer] Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan; [Marelli, Enrico] Univ Brescia, Dept Econ & Management, Brescia, Italy; [Signorelli, Marcello] Univ Perugia, Dept Econ, Perugia, Italy",Lahore University of Management Sciences; University of Brescia; University of Perugia,"Choudhry, MT (通讯作者)，Lahore Univ Management Sci, Suleman Dawood Sch Business, Lahore, Pakistan.",misbah.tanveer@lums.edu.pk,,"SIGNORELLI, Marcello/0000-0002-7820-7090; Choudhry, Misbah Tanveer/0000-0002-6059-7764",,,,,42,3,4,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

However, nominal rigidities are conducive to multiple equilibria, implying endogenous macroeconomic uncertainties that compound the primitive (exogenous) uncertainties.

Under the status quo, agents are paid by an outside donor and offer members free services. In our multi-country randomized control trial, we evaluate the change in this incentive scheme on agent behaviour and performance, and on overall village-level outcomes. We find that privatized agents start groups, attract members, mobilize savings, and intermediate loans at similar levels after a year but at much lower costs to the NGO. At the village level, we find higher levels of borrowing, business-related savings, and investment in business. Examining mechanisms, we find that self-help groups serve more business-oriented clientele when facilitated by agents who face strong financial incentives.","[Greaney, Brian P.] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Kaboski, Joseph P.] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Kaboski, Joseph P.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Van Leemput, Eva] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Yale University; University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Greaney, BP (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",,"Greaney, Brian/AHB-7808-2022",,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation(Bill & Melinda Gates FoundationBill & Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Explorations InitiativeCGIAR),"Research funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation grant to the University of Chicago Consortium on Financial Systems and Poverty.

In the unique symmetric equilibrium, the only individuals who make positive contributions are those who most value the public good and who are also the most pessimistic; that is, according to their beliefs, the proportion of players who most like the public good is smaller than it would be according to any other possible belief. We predict whether the aggregate contribution is larger or smaller than it would be in an analogous game with complete information and heterogeneous preferences, by comparing the beliefs of contributors with the true distribution of preferences. A trade-off between preferences and beliefs arises if there is no individual who simultaneously has the highest preference type and the most pessimistic belief. In this case, there is a symmetric equilibrium, and multiple symmetric equilibria occur only if there are more than two preference types.","[Maldonado, Wilfredo Leiva] Catholic Univ Braslia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil; [Rodrigues-Neto, Jose A.] Australian Natl Univ, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Australian National University,"Maldonado, WL (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Braslia, Brasilia, DF, Brazil.",wilfredo@pos.ucb.br; jarnwi@yahoo.com,"Maldonado, Wilfredo/AAA-7909-2021","Rodrigues-Neto, Jose A./0000-0002-4245-812X; Maldonado, Wilfredo/0000-0001-9576-9418",CNPq (Brazil) [303420/2012-0],CNPq (Brazil)(Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ)),"Wilfredo Leiva Maldonado acknowledges the financial support of CNPq (Brazil) through Grant 303420/2012-0.

Empirical results based on a newly assembled dataset of 80 countries over the 1970-2010 period suggest that particularly when institutions prompt governments to be accountable to the general citizen does public capital spending promote growth. Taking account of the type of financing for this spending, we show that the growth-promoting effect under an accountable government appears to prevail for various financing sources, including a reallocation from current spending, an increase in revenue, and a rise in the budget deficit.

Cross-country literature on conflict finds that ethnic diversity, and ethnic polarization in particular, are associated with greater incidence of conflict. However, the question remains as to where within ethnically diverse countries conflict begins and where and how it spreads. To study this question, I present a model in which local ethnic groups' decision to attack depends on three key variables: ethnic population shares, ethnic groups' weapons ratio, and the share of co-ethnic successes in the battles that took place in the previous period. The model generates three predictions: conflict starts in ethnically homogeneous areas and only later spreads to ethnically heterogeneous areas; neighbor co-ethnics' success increases subsequent probability of winning and may lead to attack; and greater ethnic diversity is associated with costlier conflict. I find strong support for these predictions using detailed municipal-level data on attacks and ethnic polarization during the initial spread of the Bosnian Civil War. Moreover, my conflict model is able to predict the sequence of actual conflict outcomes with reasonably high accuracy.","[Novta, Natalija] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Novta, N (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",nnovta@imf.org,,,,,,,54,10,12,1,5,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1542-4766,1542-4774,,J EUR ECON ASSOC,J.

J,"Phan, T",,,,Toan Phan,,,"Information, insurance and the sustainability of sovereign debt",REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Sovereign debt; Insurance; Asymmetric information,DEFAULT; ECONOMICS; MARKETS; MODEL,"In an influential paper, Bulow and Rogoff (1989) prove that in a competitive financial market, the threat of credit exclusion alone cannot sustain repayment of sovereign debt, as the defaulting government can still enter cash-in-advance insurance contracts. However, their result relies on an important assumption: symmetric information. This paper shows JEL classification: that if a debtor government has some private information about the underlying distribution of future economic shocks, then debt repayment is sustainable in equilibrium. This is true even if there is only one period with private information, and even if default does not have a spillover effect to any other relationship. The intuition is that a default is a signal of a bad distribution of future shocks, leading to higher risk premia on future financial contracts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The results show a high degree of persistence of GCC bank profitability, stability and credit growth. Stable banks tend to expand credit faster, and are more profitable. Bank credit growth did not seem to affect bank stability up to a certain level; however, at a higher level of credit growth, banks become less stable. Government ownership significantly affects both the stability and credit growth of the banking system. Our results suggest a need for more stringent risk-based supervision, so as to monitor and control loan growth and to provide early warnings of the potential risks associated with rapid credit growth by weaker banks.

We define an implied investment target, which is implicitly contained in a time-consistent strategy at a given time step and wealth level. By imposing the implied investment target at the initial time step on a time-consistent strategy, we form a hybrid strategy which may generate better mean-variance efficient frontiers than the time-consistent strategy. We extend the numerical algorithm proposed in Cong and Oosterlee (2016b) to solve constrained time-consistent mean-variance optimization problems.

We extend Hsieh and Klenow's (2009) methodology to include intermediate inputs and consider all sectors of the economy (agriculture, manufacturing, and services). We find that within-industry misallocation almost doubled between 1996 and 2011. Equalizing total factor revenue productivity across firms within an industry could have boosted valued-added 48% and 79% above actual levels in 1996 and 2011, respectively. This implies that deteriorating allocative efficiency may have shaved around 1.3 percentage points off the annual GDP growth during the 1996-2011 period. Allocative efficiency deterioration, despite being a widespread phenomenon, is significantly higher in the service sector, with 5 industries accounting for 72% of the total variation. Capital distortions are the most important source of potential value-added, efficiency gains, especially in the service sector, with a relative contribution increasing over time.

The agents are assumed to know the aggregate payoffs but do not know their decomposition by issues. This framework applies to many real-world problems, such as the formation of joint ventures. We present a novel solution concept to the problem, termed the multicore, wherein an agent consents to participate in the grand coalition if she can envision a decomposition of the proposed allocation for which each coalition to which she belongs derives greater benefit on each issue by cooperating with the grand coalition rather than operating alone. An allocation is in the multicore if all agents consent to participate in the grand coalition. We provide a theorem characterizing the nonemptiness of the multicore and show that the multicore generalizes the core. We prove that the approach of the multicore has the potential to increase cooperation among parties beyond that of solving issues independently. In addition, we establish that the multicore wherein agents take into account the specifics of the original issues is a refinement of the core of the sum of individual issues in which such information is ignored.","[Gayer, Gabrielle] Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel; [Persitz, Dotan] Tel Aviv Univ, Coller Sch Management, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Bar Ilan University; Tel Aviv University,"Gayer, G (通讯作者)，Bar Ilan Univ, Dept Econ, IL-52100 Ramat Gan, Israel.",gabi.gayer@gmail.com; persitzd@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,15,2,2,0,3,ECONOMETRIC SOCIETY,NEW YORK,"NEW YORK UNIV, DEPT ECONOMICS, 19 W 4 ST, NEW YORK, NY 10012 USA",1933-6837,1555-7561,,THEOR ECON,Theor.

We consider a model in which a consumer enjoys current consumption as well as utility generated by earlier memorable consumption. Lasting utility flows are generated only by some goods, and only when their consumption exceeds customary levels by a sufficient margin. We offer axiomatic foundations for the structure of the utility function and study optimal consumption in a dynamic model. We show that rational consumers, taking into account future utility flows, would make optimal choices that rationalize lumpy patterns of consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This paper studies the impact of the reduction in the number of primary schools on the migration decision of rural residents. First, using China Health and Nutrition Survey that contains information on community characteristics, we find that both the disappearance of village primary school and the increased distance to nearby primary school increased the migration probability of village residents. Second, using the 1% population survey in 2005 and prefecture level information, we find that the decline in the number of primary schools between 2000 and 2004 increased the migration probability of rural residents. Exploring the heterogeneous effects, we find that the migration of individuals with primary-school-age children is more sensitive to the relocation of primary schools, and that the effect is stronger for families with boys than those with girls. These results suggest that human capital investment motive and regional education policy play an important role in China's urbanization process.

It uses a dynamic structural vector autoregressive model to estimate the related structural impulse response functions. The estimates suggest that wind power shocks have a more prolonged negative effect on spot prices than solar power shocks. Significant autocorrelations of wind power for larger lags indicate these results. The total negative merit order effect of a solar power shock is larger when using a reasonable model specification. One reason might be that solar power shocks coincide with demand peaks. However, results regarding the relation of the effects of wind and solar should be dealt with carefully because these results do not hold for all specifications. Past static estimates show differences in the total average negative merit order effects. These estimates might be overstated if wind and solar power dynamics are transferred to the merit order effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Communication potentially removes conflicting perceptions that may otherwise plague flexible contracts. Indeed, we find that introducing free-form communication sharply reverses an advantage of rigid contracts in favor of flexible contracts, which then deliver much higher earnings. Control treatments that avoid selection effects reveal a strong parallel shift from rigid to flexible. Chat content analysis identifies clarification of post-shock transfers, promises, and personal rapport as key correlates of high earnings, with clarification working only in conjunction with flexible contracts. A communication channel restricted to clarifying transfer plans also favors use of flexible contracts, but mildly compared to chat.

While these short-run results are consistent with standard Malthusian predictions, Malthusian convergence was delayed up to 1786 in former-Morisco districts.

However, the introduction of a fat tax has been discussed frequently in the Czech Republic during the last few years; here, we provide empirical evidence in order for this public debate to be better informed. We use detailed microeconomic data to estimate the impact of potential fat taxes on household expenditure and government revenues in the Czech Republic. We evaluate the impact of three types of fat taxes: ad valorem, specific per kilogram of product and specific per kilogram of fat. We simulate these in such a way that they all raise the same budget revenues as a 10% ad valorem tax on fat-rich products. Accounting for higher food expenditures in the aggregate national accounts than in the detailed microeconomic data results into higher budget revenues, 7.3 and 6.1 billion Czech korunas, respectively. Overall we find, and thus confirm the overwhelming evidence from other countries, that fat taxes are regressive in income.","[Chuda, Tatiana; Jansky, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Chudá, T (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.",tana.chuda@gmail.com; jansky.peta@gmail.com,"Jansky, Petr/H-4782-2014","Jansky, Petr/0000-0001-6499-9923",,,,,38,0,0,0,21,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

To guide physicians to prescribe safer, less addictive, and more cost-effective drugs, Texas WC implemented one of the first formularies tailored specifically for the treatment of work-related injuries by establishing a list of non-preferred drugs that require preauthorization before they can be prescribed. I draw on Texas WC administrative data on medical and pharmacy bills to examine the impact of the formulary on health care bills paid for through WC several months after a worker's initial injury. I find that the closed formulary results in workers being half as likely to use non-preferred drugs and reduces average spending on non preferred drugs by half several months after claims begin. I find no evidence that spending on preferred drugs or spending on non-pharmacy medical care increase to compensate for the decreased spending on non-preferred drugs. The lack of a shift towards preferred drugs suggests that doctors were not choosing non-preferred drugs over preferred drugs prior to the formulary. Instead, non-preferred drugs were one of multiple approaches doctors used in treating work-related injuries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The study employs a time-varying approach and a sample of US stock returns for the period between January 1982 and March 2011, a period which includes the current liquidity crisis, so as to examine the relationship between default risk, liquidity crises and value and size premiums. The findings indicate that the default premium has explanatory power for value and size premiums, which affect firms with different characteristics.

However, it is still unclear how much of the response is due to changes in real economic activity, and how much is caused by tax avoidance. In this paper, we distinguish between real responses and income-shifting between tax bases. We show that separating income-shifting responses can largely affect the welfare analysis of income taxation. In our empirical example of Finnish business owners, we find that income-shifting accounts for a majority of the overall elasticity of taxable income, which significantly decreases the marginal excess burden.","[Harju, Jarkko; Matikka, Tuomas] VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland; [Harju, Jarkko] CESifo, Munich, Germany",VATT Institute for Economic Research; Ifo Institut,"Harju, J (通讯作者)，VATT Inst Econ Res, Helsinki, Finland.;Harju, J (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",jarkko.harju@vatt.fi; tuomas.matikka@vatt.fi,,"Harju, Jarkko/0000-0003-2027-4343",Nordic Tax Research Council; Finnish Cultural Foundation; OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Emil Aaltonen Foundation,Nordic Tax Research Council; Finnish Cultural Foundation(Finnish Cultural FoundationFinnish IT center for science); OP-Pohjola Group Research Foundation; Emil Aaltonen Foundation,"Many thanks to Leon Bettendorf, Essi Eerola, Seppo Kari, Martin Jacob, Tuomas Kosonen, Claus Thustrup Kreiner, Jani-Petri Laamanen, Andreas Peichl, Rick van der Ploeg, Jukka Pirttila, Doina Radulescu, Hakan Selin, Robert Ullman and Roope Uusitalo for their useful comments and discussion.

Instrumental variables (IV) estimation of the payoff to choosing one type of education compared to another is made particularly challenging by individuals choosing between several types of education. Not only does identification require one instrument per alternative, but it is also necessary to deal with the issue that individuals who choose the same education may have different next-best alternatives. We address these difficulties using rich administrative data for Norway's postsecondary education system. A centralized admission process creates credible instruments from discontinuities that effectively randomize applicants near unpredictable admission cutoffs into different institutions and fields of study. The admission process also provides information on preferred and next-best alternatives from strategy-proof measures of individuals' ranking of institutions and fields. The results from our IV approach may be summarized with three broad conclusions. First, different fields of study have substantially different labor market payoffs, even after accounting for institution and peer quality. Second, the effect on earnings from attending a more selective institution tends to be relatively small compared to payoffs to field of study. Third, the estimated payoffs to field of study are consistent with individuals choosing fields in which they have a comparative advantage. Comparing our estimates to those obtained from other approaches highlights the importance of using instruments to correct for selection bias and information on individuals' ranking of institutions and fields to measure their preferred and next-best alternatives.","[Kirkeboen, Lars J.; Leuven, Edwin; Mogstad, Magne] Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway; Univ Oslo, N-0316 Oslo, Norway; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Statistics Norway; University of Oslo; University of Chicago,"Kirkeboen, LJ (通讯作者)，Stat Norway, Oslo, Norway.",magne.mogstad@gmail.com,"Kirkebøen, Lars/IUP-6635-2023",,Norwegian Research Council's Programme for Research and Innovation in the Education Sector (FINNUT) [237840],Norwegian Research Council's Programme for Research and Innovation in the Education Sector (FINNUT),"We thank four anonymous referees, the editor, Peter Arcidiacono, and seminar participants at several universities and conferences for valuable feedback and suggestions.

We show in this paper that this widely found relation between matches on the one hand and unemployment and vacancies on the other hand can be the result of different underlying mechanisms. Obviously, it can be generated by assuming a Cobb-Douglas matching function. Less obvious, the same relationship results from a vacancy free-entry condition and idiosyncratic productivity shocks. A positive aggregate productivity shock leads to more vacancy posting, a shift of the idiosyncratic selection cutoff and thereby more hiring. We calibrate a model with both mechanisms to administrative German labor market data and show that idiosyncratic productivity for new contacts is an important driver of the elasticity of the job-finding rate with respect to the market tightness. Accounting for idiosyncratic productivity can explain the observed negative time trend in estimated matching efficiency and asymmetric business cycle responses to large aggregate shocks.

China has experienced serious air pollution problems in recent years, and Chinese public awareness of air pollution has soared. In this paper, we use China as a natural experiment to investigate the effect on stock returns of depressed moods induced by air pollution. Daily air-pollution data from 2005 to 2014 are analysed and the results obtained from the empirical research show that a contemporaneous negative and a two-day lagged positive relationship exists between air pollution levels and stock returns over this time period. The relationship is mediated by the influence of air pollution on investment decisions. The results also indicate that the effect is weakened for companies that protect air quality, but no stronger effect is detected for polluting companies. The findings imply that air pollution is a behavioural factor with some connection to stock returns in China.","[Li, Q.; Peng, C.

Institutional changes and union wage premia in Central Europe,JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Institutional change; Unions; Wages,LABOR-MARKET INSTITUTIONS; TRADE-UNIONS; DISPERSION; EMPLOYMENT,"In this paper we use the national samples from the European Structure of Earnings Survey (ESES) to analyze the evolution of the wage premium of firm- and industry-level agreements in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland (the CE3) around the time of their accession to the EU. We find that despite a generalized reduction in union coverage in these countries, the union wage premium after accession to the EU became bigger and statistically more significant for Poland and Hungary, particularly for industry-level agreements. We interpret these findings in terms of the institutional reforms that occurred in the CE3 between 2002 and 2006. These reforms, which were prompted by the EU Commission's requirements for EU accession, increased the social partners' ability to bargain and enforce wage agreements, and made industry-level unions more effective in guaranteeing the protections provided by labor standards. Results are less conclusive for the Czech Republic, probably due to factors that attenuate the effect of bargaining coverage upon wages, e.g. a smaller effect of institutional reforms, a greater use of mandatory extension mechanisms, the more radical firm restructuring during transition in that country.

We find that a 1 percentage point reduction in the local unemployment rate is associated with a roughly 0.27 percentage point reduction in the fraction of jobs requiring at least a bachelor's degree and a roughly 0.23 percentage point reduction in the fraction requiring five or more years of experience. This pattern is established using multiple measures of labor availability, is bolstered by similar trends along heretofore un-measured dimensions of skill, and even occurs within firm-job title pairs. We further confirm the causal effect of labor market tightening on skill requirements using a natural experiment based on the fracking boom in the United States, as an exogenous shock to the local labor supply in tradable, non-fracking industries. These industries are not plausibly affected by local demand shocks or natural gas extraction technology, but still show fewer skill requirements in response to tighter labor markets.

We then use a nonordered multinomial logit model to evaluate the impact of the rise in tuition fees on the types of pathways selected by the university. We show that there is a significant impact on these pathways. The increase in tuition fees reduces geographic and social mobility, thereby accentuating the phenomena of social segregation.

The Bayesian estimation of the model reveals that the model that includes news shocks on macroeconomic aggregates produces a remarkable fit of the data. News shocks in stationary and non-stationary TFP, investment-specific productivity and preference shocks significantly affect labour market variables and explain a sizeable fraction of macroeconomic fluctuations at medium-and long-run horizons.

In addition, given capital stock and fixed export costs, firms with higher productivity are more likely to export. I then use the 2012 Chinese enterprise survey from the World Bank to empirically investigate the impact of participation in export on Chinese firms' capacity utilization rate. The results show that on average, export firms have capacity utilization rate 1.55-2.01 percent higher than non-export firms, which amounts to 14.6-18.9 percent of the standard deviation of capacity utilization rate in the sample. I also find that firms with a larger part of shares owned by the government have lower capacity utilization. Stronger market competition leads to over-investment and therefore lower capacity utilization rate. Faced with more rigorous labor market regulation, firms will substitute capital for the use of labor, resulting in higher capacity utilization rate.","[Tian, Xian-Liang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics,"Tian, XL (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Ctr Ind & Business Org, Dalian, Peoples R China.",xian-liang@dufe.edu.cn,,,"Dongbei University of Finance and Economics [DUFE2015Y10]; Center for Industrial and Business Organization, DUFE [040069]","Dongbei University of Finance and Economics; Center for Industrial and Business Organization, DUFE","This work was supported by Dongbei University of Finance and Economics [grant number: DUFE2015Y10] and the Center for Industrial and Business Organization, DUFE [grant number: 040069].

The model illustrates a trade-off of group liability lending: while higher levels of group liability increase within group risk-sharing, if liability is too high, borrowers strategically default. The model predicts the existence of an optimal partial liability that maximizes transfers between group members while avoiding strategic default Consistent with this prediction, loan officers from a large microfinance institution in southern Mexico who rarely allow one group member to repay while the other defaults achieve substantially lower default rates than loan officers for whom the practice is commonplace or for those for whom it has never occurred. Structural estimation using repayment data suggests that while a partial liability below full liability may reduce default rates, the incidence of strategic default is rare. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This suggests that the true welfare benefits of natural capital may not be adequately reflected in conventional economic data and, therefore, studies seeking to evaluate the contribution of natural capital to human well-being should consider employing data sets that capture subjective elements of welfare. The magnitudes of the reported marginal effects of natural capital on social welfare, however, are small. This is perhaps due to the fact that (1) there are shortcomings in the measure of natural capital; (2) life satisfaction effects are unlikely to reflect the poorly understood benefits that natural capital provides; and (3) keystone species (such as mosquitoes) and integral ecosystems (such as wetlands) may be negatively associated with life satisfaction, even though such components of natural capital are vitally important to sustaining ecosystems and human life","[Ambrey, Christopher L.] Griffith Univ, Urban Res Program, Gold Coast, Qld, Australia; [Fleming, Christopher M.] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, South Bank Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia; [Manning, Matthew] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Aboriginal Econ Policy Res, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus; Griffith University; Australian National University,"Fleming, CM (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, South Bank Campus, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",chris.fleming@griffith.edu.au,"Manning, Matthew/HKE-4255-2023; Fleming, Christopher/ABE-3736-2020","Manning, Matthew/0000-0002-1622-4936; Fleming, Christopher/0000-0001-7596-7775; Ambrey, Christopher/0000-0002-3790-7509",,,,,17,10,11,3,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The methodology used is twofold. This paper estimates by the generalized method of moments (GMM) an optimal monetary policy rule and a rule including dummy variables which can detect the presence of asymmetries. The crisis in the euro-zone and the liquidity problems caused the implementation of nonconventional policy measures from 2008. Our results show a) asymmetries in the interest rate-setting behaviour of ECB and b) changes in the monetary policy decisions to enhance economic growth.,"[Barros-Campello, Esther; Pateiro-Rodriguez, Carlos; Venancio Salcines-Cristal, J.] Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ & Adm Empresas, La Coruna, Spain",Universidade da Coruna,"Barros-Campello, E (通讯作者)，Univ A Coruna, Fac Econ & Empresa, Dept Anal Econ & Adm Empresas, La Coruna, Spain.",esther.barros@udc.es; cpateiroudc@gmail.com; vsalcines@gmail.com,"RODRIGUEZ, CARLOS PATEIRO/S-5715-2018; Barros-Campello, Esther/M-6370-2015",,,,,,57,1,2,0,2,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In this work, we show that a simple asset pricing model with representative agent is able to generate time series of returns that replicate such stylized facts if the risk aversion coefficient is allowed to change endogenously over time in response to unexpected excess returns under evolutionary forces. The same model, under constant risk aversion, would instead generate returns that are essentially Gaussian. We conclude that an endogenous time-varying risk aversion represents a very parsimonious way to make the model match real data on key statistical properties, and therefore deserves careful consideration from economists and practitioners alike.","[Berardi, Michele] Univ Manchester, Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Berardi, M (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Econ, Sch Social Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England.",michele.berardi@manchester.ac.uk,"Berardi, Michele/ABD-2410-2020","Berardi, Michele/0000-0001-8145-5207",,,,,39,2,4,0,6,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

Changes in ambiguity over loss probabilities are expressed through the specific concept of stochastic dominance of order n defined by Ekern (Econ Lett 6:329-333, 1980). We characterize conditions on the function capturing attitudes towards ambiguity under which an individual always considers one situation to be more ambiguous than another in a model of two states of nature. We propose an intuitive interpretation of the properties of this function in terms of preferences for harms disaggregation over probabilities, also labelled ambiguity apportionment.","[Courbage, Christophe] Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland; [Rey, Beatrice] Univ Lyon, F-69007 Lyon, France; [Rey, Beatrice] GATE Lyon St Etienne, CNRS, F-69130 Ecully, France; [Rey, Beatrice] Univ Lyon 2, F-69007 Lyon, France",University of Applied Sciences & Arts Western Switzerland; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon (ENS de LYON); Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1; Universite Jean Monnet; Universite Lyon 2; Universite Lyon 2,"Courbage, C (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Western Switzerland HES SO, Haute Ecole Gest Geneve, CH-1227 Carouge, Switzerland.",christophe.courbage@hesge.ch; rey-fournier@gate.cnrs.fr,,"Courbage, Christophe/0000-0002-2554-0228",,,,,29,2,2,0,2,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Our new method-the partition perturbation method-partitions the Markov-switching parameter space to keep a maximum number of time-varying parameters from perturbation. For this method to work in practice, we show how to reduce the potentially intractable problem of solving MSDSGE models to the manageable problem of solving a system of quadratic polynomial equations. This approach allows us to first obtain all the solutions and then determine how many of them are stable.

As is often the case, the cause of intolerance is ignorance, as it is here. To acquire knowledge about potential influences, which we need for both the evaluation of internal and external validity of experimental results, we cannot do without theory. A purely empiricist (inductive) methodology will be unable to give us sufficient understanding of the validity of these results. An account of causality only based on directly observed things, is an account based on factual influences only. This account will be too restricted, because it will not deal with the unobserved potential influences, which we need - again - for the evaluation of the internal and external validity of the experimental results. Every investigation in a laboratory that is feasible regarding a specific potential influence may lead to deep knowledge. It is simply scientifically irrational to dismiss this kind of knowledge.","[Boumans, Marcel] Univ Amsterdam, NL-1012 WX Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Boumans, Marcel] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Boumans, Marcel] Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Utrecht University,"Boumans, M (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Sch Econ, Utrecht, Netherlands.",m.j.boumans@uu.nl,"Boumans, Marcel/AAX-1395-2021","Boumans, Marcel/0000-0002-8717-8148",,,,,9,2,2,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

Though smaller than for most other OECD countries, we find substantial wage penalties to motherhood, ranging from a 1.2 % wage reduction for women with lower secondary education to 4.9 % for women with more than four years of higher education. Human capital measures such as work experience and paid parental leave do not explain the wage penalties, indicating that in the Norwegian institutional context, mothers are protected from adverse wage effects due to career breaks. We do however find large heterogeneity in the effects, with the largest penalties for mothers working full time and in the private sector. Contrary to most studies using US data and to previous research from Norway, we find a small wage penalty also to fatherhood. Also for men, the penalty is greater for those who work full time and in the private sector. A substantial share of the fatherhood wage penalty is explained by paternity leave.","[Cools, Sara] BI Norwegian Business Sch, Oslo, Norway; [Strom, Marte] Inst Social Res, Oslo, Norway",BI Norwegian Business School,"Strom, M (通讯作者)，Inst Social Res, Oslo, Norway.",sara.cools@bi.no; marte.strom@samfunnsforskning.no,,,Norwegian Research Council [1110]; Research Council of Norway,Norwegian Research Council(Research Council of Norway); Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"We are grateful to Jenny Clarhall, Eva Klove, Andreas Kotsadam, Ingrid Kruger, Jo Thori Lind, Kalle Moene and Fredrik Willumsen for helpful comments and suggestions.

We show that the time horizon considerably affects the structure of the optimal penalty scheme. In the finite game framework decreasing as well as escalating penalty schemes may be optimal. For the more appropriate infinite game framework we show three main results: First, any penalty scheme can be replaced by a (weakly) escalating penalty scheme that leads to the same criminal activity and the same social penalization cost. Second, the optimal penalty scheme is of the escalating type. Third, the socially optimal level of crime under escalating penalties may be higher than the level which would be optimal under uniform penalties.","[Endres, Alfred; Rundshagen, Bianca] Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 11, D-58084 Hagen, Germany; [Endres, Alfred] Univ Witten Herdecke, D-58448 Witten, Germany",Fern University Hagen; Witten Herdecke University,"Endres, A (通讯作者)，Univ Hagen, Dept Econ, Univ Str 11, D-58084 Hagen, Germany.;Endres, A (通讯作者)，Univ Witten Herdecke, D-58448 Witten, Germany.",Alfred.Endres@FernUni-Hagen.de,,,,,,,41,5,5,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

Using a longitudinal panel of over 265 000 individuals in Sweden, this paper shows in a regression kink design that labour income taxes affect capital gains realizations in two ways. An increase in the marginal labour income tax rate increases the likelihood of realizing capital gains and the amount of realized capital gains. One implication of this result is that labour income taxes have a lock-out effect but that the magnitude of this effect is smaller than the lock-in effect of the actual capital gains tax.","[Jacob, Martin] WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany",WHU - Otto Beisheim School of Management,"Jacob, M (通讯作者)，WHU Otto Beisheim Sch Management, Vallendar, Germany.",martin.jacob@whu.edu,,,,,,,35,1,1,1,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To calculate a new global poverty threshold based on 2011 PPP, this paper moves away from the World Bank's method of anchoring a single global poverty line on the national poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries. It instead proposes an alternative method of using equivalent poverty lines. Each country is shown to have a different equivalent poverty line. This paper finds that there is no single international poverty line in 2011 PPP that is equivalent to $1.25 in 2005 PPP. Single poverty lines vary for each region because countries have experienced different inflation rates and have different PPP conversion rates between 2005 and 2011. To calculate a single poverty line in 2011 PPP, this paper measures the weighted average of equivalent poverty lines of 101 countries around the globe with weights proportional to their populations. Based on the new method, the corresponding poverty line is estimated at $1.93 in 2011 PPP. The World Bank has officially adopted the poverty line of $1.90 in 2011 PPP. This paper demonstrates that our proposed poverty line performs better than the World Bank's in terms of preserving the real purchasing power of the previous line of $1.25 in 2005 PPP. Given the new poverty threshold of $1.93, the number of poor worldwide is reduced by 6.42 million, with the reduction largely occurring in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.","[Kakwani, Nanak] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Son, Hyun H.] Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines",University of New South Wales Sydney; Asian Development Bank,"Son, HH (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, Manila, Philippines.",n.kakwani@unsw.edu.au; hhson@adb.org,"Kakwani, Nanak/Q-5581-2019",,,,,,4,9,11,1,20,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

This would necessitate a paradigm shift. Economics has, over time, tried to produce a coherent model to underpin the dominant laissez-faire liberal approach. But we have never proved, in that model, that left to their own devices, the participants in an economy will self-organize into a satisfactory state. This is an assumption. Complex interactive systems with direct interaction between heterogeneous agents may show no tendency to self-equilibrate and will undergo endogenous crises. Economists should concentrate on the emergence of certain patterns. Colander and Kupers suggest that we may be able to nudge the system into good basins of attraction. A more radical view is that there are no fixed basins of attraction; these change with the evolution of the system and it is illusory to believe that we can choose good basins. We may be able to recognize and influence the emergence of certain states of the economy, but we are far from Leon Walras's dream of economics as a science like astrophysics.","[Kirman, Alan] Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France; [Kirman, Alan] Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France",Aix-Marseille Universite,"Kirman, A (通讯作者)，Aix Marseille Univ, Marseille, France.;Kirman, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Hautes Etud Sci Sociales, Paris, France.",,,,"EU COST Action [IS1104]; LABEX, OTMed","EU COST Action(European Union (EU)European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST)); LABEX, OTMed","This work was partly financed by the EU COST Action IS1104 and the LABEX, OTMed.",,161,18,20,0,27,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

The inference on the oil-equity implied volatility relationships depends on Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014, 2015) who proposed a set of directional measures that enable the dynamic and directional characterization of the relationships among financial variables. We find uniform results across the sample countries indicating that the connectedness between oil and equity is established by the bi-directional information spillovers between the two markets. However, we find that the bulk of association is largely dominated by the transmissions from the oil market to equity markets and not the other way around. The pattern of transmissions is varying over the sample period; however most of the linkages between oil and equities are established from the mid of 2009 to the mid of 2012 which is a period that witnessed the start of global recovery.

The first law states that the higher the growth of the manufacturing output, the more significant is the growth rate of the economy's product as a whole. The second law, known as the Kaldor-Verdoorn law, establishes a deterministic relation between the growth of manufacturing productivity and manufacturing output growth. This paper begins showing stylized facts of the production and exports of manufactured goods to show that these remain related to the income level of countries in recent years. Thereafter, a theoretical reflection on the importance of manufacturing in the process of economic development is performed, associating it to the manufacturing exports and to the exchange rate regime. Then, the paper performs a Kaldorian model systematization to assess the importance of manufacturing and its exports on the economic development. Econometric tests are performed based on a dynamic panel data for a sample of 63 middle and high-income countries, excluding major exporters of fuels for the period between 1990 and 2011, to analyze whether there is any difference in growth dynamics between these two groups. Estimates attest the occurrence of the two Kaldor laws, demonstrating that output growth in the manufacturing sector is essential to increasing economic growth and productivity, particularly in middle-income economies. The results also confirm that manufacturing exports are relevant to the development process and that the exchange rate contributes to this process in middle-income countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We provide a novel way to answer this question by comparing Protestant and Catholic minorities using Swiss census data. Exploiting the strong adhesion of religious minorities to their denomination' ethical principles and the historical determination of the geographical distribution of denominations across Swiss cantons, we find that Protestantism is associated with a significantly higher propensity for entrepreneurship. The estimated difference ranges between 1.5 and 3.2% points, it is larger the smaller the size of the religious minority, it is mainly driven by prime age male entrepreneurs and it stands up to a number of robustness checks.

Unless they have an impact on monetary payoffs, the perceptions of anonymous individuals are irrelevant to people's decision making. However, a large body of research in sociology and social psychology demonstrates that self-identity is developed through one's understanding of how one is perceived by others. Using (Cooley's, Human nature and the social order, 1964) concept of the looking-glass self as a framework, we evaluate experimentally whether or not people care about the imputed judgment of anonymous others arising from their imagination of their perceptions. We implemented variants of the Becker-DeGroot-Marschak mechanism to elicit the monetary value attached to the perceptions by participants. In one variant, only nonnegative bids were allowed, while in another, negative bids were allowed. We show that in an environment in which the perceptions of others are only conveyed to participants anonymously and privately, self-interested individuals exhibited strong negative perception avoidance even though the perceptions have no impact on their monetary payoff. The participants were willing to spend a significant amount in order to avoid confirming the supposedly negative perception. Thus, for them, ignorance was truly bliss. We also show that, in the absence of the audience effect, the fair-minded participants adopted a neutral attitude towards the perception of them as fair.","[Riyanto, Yohanes E.] Nanyang Technol Univ, Sch Humanities & Social Sci, Div Econ, 14 Nanyang Dr HSS 04-83, Singapore 637332, Singapore; [Zhang, Jianlin] Singapore Inst Management, Global Educ, 461 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599491, Singapore",Nanyang Technological University,"Zhang, JL (通讯作者)，Singapore Inst Management, Global Educ, 461 Clementi Rd, Singapore 599491, Singapore.",yeriyanto@ntu.edu.sg; zhangjianlin@sim.edu.sg,"; Riyanto, Yohanes E./C-2939-2009","Zhang, Jianlin/0000-0003-1153-9477; Riyanto, Yohanes E./0000-0001-7343-4043",Nanyang Technological University; Singapore Institute of Management,Nanyang Technological University(Nanyang Technological University); Singapore Institute of Management,"Financial support from the Nanyang Technological University and the Singapore Institute of Management is gratefully acknowledged.

These risky utilities include financial utilities like exchanges, clearinghouses or payment systems, as well as standard utilities like electricity transmission networks. Continuation of service is essential, so risky utilities cannot be liquidated. The optimal regulatory contract minimizes the social cost among the contracts that steer the firm away from risky activities. It is simple and implemented with a capital (equity) adequacy requirement and a resolution mechanism when that requirement is breached. The social cost function is explicitly computed, and comparative statics can be simply derived.","[Rochet, Jean-Charles] Univ Zurich, Dept Banking & Finance, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] SFI, Zurich, Switzerland; [Rochet, Jean-Charles] TSE IDEI, Zurich, Switzerland; [Roger, Guillaume] Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of Zurich; University of Sydney,"Roger, G (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",guillaume.roger72@gmail.com,,,European Research Council under European Community [249415-RMAC]; NCCR FinRisk,European Research Council under European Community(European Research Council (ERC)); NCCR FinRisk(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"We thank an anonymous referee for useful comments as well as seminar participants at UBC, Copenhagen Business School, the Reserve Bank of Peru, the Bank of Korea, the University of Melbourne, the University of NSW, the University of Queensland, the Australian National University, and conference participants at ESAM 2014 (Hobart), the European Sovereign Debt Crisis conference and the 2015 European Winter Finance Summit.

In this article, we extend the NTA for Slovenia by including the value of unpaid household production. Based on time-use data, we discover that people in Slovenia spent even more time on household production than on paid work, which emphasises the necessity of including household production in the NTA analysis. We find that there are large net transfers of household production flowing from adults to children, and to a lesser extent also to the elderly. We calculate unpaid production separately for both genders, and discover that females provide much more unpaid production and total productive work than males. In addition, they face a much more intensive rush hour of life' than males. We expect that similar patterns may be found in other post-communist countries where equalising labour force participation by gender was central to the communist agenda, but where no similar efforts were undertaken to equalise household work burdens.","[Sambt, Joze; Verbic, Miroslav] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia; [Donehower, Gretchen] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Demog, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Verbic, Miroslav] Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana; University of California System; University of California Berkeley,"Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Ljubljana 61000, Slovenia.;Verbic, M (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Res, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",miroslav.verbic@ef.uni-lj.si,,,European Union [613247]; US National Institute on Aging [R37 AG025247]; Counting Women's Work project from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Development Research Centre,European Union(European Union (EU)); US National Institute on Aging(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Aging (NIA)); Counting Women's Work project from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation; International Development Research Centre(International Development Research Centre - IDRC),"This project has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration under grant agreement 613247.

Retired households need to manage risks and generate income from their savings. We study the dynamics of retirement wealth and portfolio allocation using the three wealth waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia panel survey. The average retired household maintained or accumulated wealth in 2002-2006 and decumulated in 2006-2010 consistent with trends in financial asset prices. At older ages, households prefer portfolios with less risk and more liquidity, while maintaining ownership of the family home. The probability of households exhausting financial assets increased over the sample, but households who depleted financial wealth did not liquidate their housing wealth at higher rates than other households. In contrast to the USA, the overall effect of health shocks on the wealth of retired Australian households is minimal, but financial shocks have large effects.","[Spicer, Alexandra] Reserve Bank Australia, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Stavrunova, Olena] Univ Technol Sydney, Broadway, NSW, Australia; [Thorp, Susan] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Thorp, Susan] Australian Natl Univ, Ctr Appl Macroecon Anal, Canberra, ACT, Australia",Reserve Bank of Australia; University of Technology Sydney; University of Sydney; Australian National University,"Stavrunova, O (通讯作者)，UTS, Sydney, NSW, Australia.",olena.stavrunova@uts.edu.au,,"Stavrunova, Olena/0000-0001-9568-3753; Thorp, Susan/0000-0003-3462-0876","Australian Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA); ARC [DP120102239]; Chair of Finance and Superannuation UTS: Sydney Financial Forum (through Colonial First State Global Asset Management); New South Wales government; Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA); Industry Superannuation Network (ISN); Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Capital Market Dysfunctionality, UTS","Australian Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA)(Australian Government); ARC(Australian Research Council); Chair of Finance and Superannuation UTS: Sydney Financial Forum (through Colonial First State Global Asset Management); New South Wales government; Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia (ASFA); Industry Superannuation Network (ISN); Paul Woolley Centre for the Study of Capital Market Dysfunctionality, UTS","This paper is based on work undertaken while Spicer was at the University of Technology Sydney.

Contrary to the outcome under competitive labor markets, we show that profit taxes are not neutral and the firm's tax evasion decision is not separable from its production decision under right-to-manage wage formation, where a trade union and firm bargain over the wage rate (except in the special case of a monopoly union). A similar conclusion follows from an efficient bargaining model, where a trade union and firm bargain over both the wage rate and employment.

Belarus stands apart owing to the referents retained for narratives about a post-Soviet national identity. One of the very few countries resulting from the breakup of the USSR that has revived the Soviet legacy and interpretation of history, Belarus did so in the mid-1990s following a critical appraisal of the past made during the perestroika. The historical narrative about a Belarusian identity now relies on significant references to the Great Patriotic War as in the Soviet narrative. These references weave a sense of identity and legitimate the contemporary sociopolitical system. Belarus is the only former Soviet Socialist Republic that has returned so directly, head-on, to its Soviet legacy, which has as its major glorious component victory during World War II. The ruling elite exploits this narrative to legitimize the regime while erasing or minimizing a nationalist heritage that rebuts the Soviet legacy, refuses to see WW II as a sacred event and draws attention to other historical events and victories.","[Zadora, Anna] Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg,"Zadora, A (通讯作者)，Univ Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.",zadora@unistra.fr,,,,,,,65,1,1,0,2,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Specifically, we mainly find that 1) R-2 is not a satisfied proxy when the information environment for individual firm is improved, while idiosyncratic volatility is a satisfied proxy under the improved information environment; 2) R-2 and idiosyncratic volatility are satisfied proxies for firm-specific return variation when the information environment for individual firm is deteriorated.

We assert that country A chooses a military strategy of catching up with the military expenditure of its rivals, subject to public spending constraints on public investments, including health and education, leading to decrease in long-term economic welfare. This implies nonlinear convergence path: only when the military expenditure gap between countries reaches the threshold level, will it provide incentives to catch up with rival's military expenditures. We test this nonlinear catching up hypothesis for 37 countries spanning from 1988 to 2012. Results from individual nonlinear cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (NCADF) regression indicate that 53% of countries converge to world's average military expenditure: where 39% of countries converge to Germany; 33% of countries converge to China; 22% of countries converge to the USA, and 11% of countries converge to Russia. Interestingly, USA does not exhibit nonlinear military expenditure convergence toward world's average level. For panel NCADF regression, the result suggests that on average, there is evidence for countries converging to USA's military expenditure at 10% significance level. For the convergence to the world's average, the statistical significance is at the 1% significance level.","[Lau, Chi Keung Marco] Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England; [Demir, Ender; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin] Istanbul Medeniyet Univ, Dept Int Relat, Istanbul, Turkey",Newcastle University - UK; Northumbria University; Istanbul Medeniyet University,"Lau, CKM (通讯作者)，Northumbria Univ, Newcastle Business Sch, Newcastle Upon Tyne NE1 8ST, Tyne & Wear, England.",chi.lau@northumbria.ac.uk,"Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/K-6487-2017; Lau, Chi Keung/T-7850-2019; Demir, Ender/J-8808-2017","Lau, Chi Keung/0000-0002-2430-5592; Demir, Ender/0000-0003-4034-269X; Bilgin, Mehmet Huseyin/0000-0002-9897-9792; Lau, chi keung/0000-0003-2488-1589",,,,,40,14,14,0,11,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Yet, the majority of these studies are not constructed based on a structural model, but rather examine the causality between the variables in question. Considering these two shortcomings in the literature and the lack of consistent results, this study attempts to provide further evidence for the relationship between military expenditures and economic growth for the case of Turkey by considering income inequality within an augmented Solow growth model.

We exploit a field experiment that randomized access to savings accounts among a largely unbanked population of Nepalese villagers. One year after the accounts were introduced, we administered lottery choice and intertemporal-choice tasks to the treatment and control groups. We find that the treatment is more willing to take risks in the lottery-choice task and is more responsive to changes in experimental interest rates in the intertemporal-choice task. The results on time discounting are less conclusive, but suggest that the treatment group is more willing to delay receiving money.

We looked at investment in general and R&D intensity in particular, as the relatively intangible nature of the latter may make it more subject to the effects of sentiment and affect. We find that average local happiness is positively correlated with both R&D intensity and firm investment, after controlling for firm and local area characteristics. This positive relationship may be due to the optimism and longer term perspectives that are typically associated with higher levels of life satisfaction/happiness. We also look at inequality in happiness levels and find that the effect of local happiness is stronger in places with more equal happiness distributions. Younger firms' investment behavior is also more strongly correlated with local happiness levels.

Using panel data for 123 countries from 1995 to 2012, our results suggest a positive and statistically meaningful relationship between neighboring countries' corruption levels and domestic graft. This result is robust to including two-way fixed effects, country-specific time trends, and the standard set of control variables. The effect becomes stronger as income increases, if capital cities are located closer to each other, and if countries share a common political union, such as the European Union. We find less evidence for common language or comparable institutional backgrounds (e.g., similar degrees of democracy), but some evidence for trade relationships as potential transmission channels. These findings allow two main conclusions. First, a country with corrupt neighbors will find it difficult to get rid of corruption. Second, on a more positive note, efforts aimed at decreasing domestic corruption levels could produce positive externalities in affecting neighboring countries. This could particularly hold true within a common institutional framework, such as the European Union.","[Jetter, Michael] Univ Western Australia, 8716 Hackett Dr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Correa, Esteban Aleman; Jetter, Michael; Agudelo, Alejandra Montoya] Univ EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia; [Jetter, Michael] IZA, Bonn, Germany",University of Western Australia; Universidad EAFIT; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ Western Australia, 8716 Hackett Dr, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia.;Jetter, M (通讯作者)，Univ EAFIT, Medellin, Colombia.;Jetter, M (通讯作者)，IZA, Bonn, Germany.",ealeman1893@gmail.com; mjetter7@gmail.com; alejamontoyaa@gmail.com,,"Jetter, Michael/0000-0001-7967-5200",Semillero SIEDE; Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIEF) at the Universidad EAFIT,Semillero SIEDE; Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIEF) at the Universidad EAFIT,We also thank the Semillero SIEDE and the Center for Research in Economics and Finance (CIEF) at the Universidad EAFIT for their support.

Claims of positive spillovers in the form of technology transfers have been questionable, in part because of the many ambiguous conclusions obtained. The paper argues that the lack of focus in the mechanisms underpinning spillovers may be one of the reasons for the ambiguity. Using local input-output linkages as the mechanism for technology transfer, this study examines the presence and the enabling conditions for spillovers. Accounting for the variations in firms' characteristics, the findings show that skills-oriented MNCs participating in international production networks transmit horizontal spillovers to local establishments. Vertical spillovers from MNCs are mostly relevant only to lower-skilled establishments. For skilled and export-oriented local establishments, technologies learned from producing for international production networks are more significant than forming linkages with MNCs in the domestic market.","[Kam, Andrew Jia Yi] Natl Univ Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Kam, AJY (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Malaysia, Inst Malaysian & Int Studies, Bangi, Selangor, Malaysia.",Andrew@ukm.edu.my,"Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/R-4041-2017","Kam Jia Yi, Andrew/0000-0002-7608-2423",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia [GGPM-2014-002],Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,"Andrew Jia Yi Kam, Research Fellow, Institute of Malaysian and International Studies, National University of Malaysia, E-mail: Andrew@ukm.edu.my.

The approach is different from both the mainstream approach that stresses properties of production function and the Kaleckian approach that emphasizes the long-run adjustment of utilization. The analysis identifies several developments that may have increased inequality since the 1980s, including the shift of the power relation in favor of top managerial pay, the decline in the retention rate, increasing share buybacks, rising indebtedness of lower-income households and stock market booms. In contrast to Piketty's explanation, the decline in the natural growth rate reduces inequality in this Kaldorian framework.","[Ryoo, Soon] Adelphi Univ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA",Adelphi University,"Ryoo, S (通讯作者)，Adelphi Univ, Dept Finance & Econ, Garden City, NY 11530 USA.",sryoo@adelphi.edu,,,,,,,66,9,9,1,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2016,67,2,,,SI,,429,457,,10.1111/meca.12096,0.0,,,29,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK7ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375145700009,0

Empirical evidence seems to suggest that secular stagnation and debt deflation in the Euro area may be rather slowly developing. Yet what appears as major peril is that debt deflation with a lack of economic growth, rising real interest rates and further rising debt may trigger household defaults, defaults of firms and banks, rise of risk premia, and default risk of certain sectors of the economy or sovereign defaults. It is this rising default and financial risk that may lead to a regime change to a slowly moving debt crisis with high financial risk and high financial stress. In order to explore those issues, a macro policy model of Svensson type is introduced, exhibiting a regime of low and high financial stress. Then, a four dimensional multi-regime VAR is employed to an Euro area data set to support the theoretical model and the claim that in particular Southern Euro area countries are affected by debt deflation and financial market stress.","[Semmler, Willi; Haider, Alexander] New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA",The New School,"Haider, A (通讯作者)，New Sch Social Res, Dept Econ, 79 Fifth Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",semmlerw@newschool.edu; haida588@newschool.edu,,"Haider, Alexander/0000-0003-1820-8099; Semmler, Willi/0000-0002-8384-8159",,,,,50,0,0,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2016,43,2,,,SI,,257,278,,10.1007/s10663-016-9327-5,0.0,,,22,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK6UV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375061900004,0

It is estimated that there are more than 60 million left-behind children (LBC) remaining in the countryside after their parents migrate, typically living with surrogate caregivers. Extensive research has focused on the impact of parental out-migration on children's mental health, but less attention has been paid to the effects of parental return-migration. The present paper examines the changes in mental health before and after the parents of fourth and fifth grade students out-migrate or return-migrate. We draw on a panel dataset collected by the authors of more than 19 000 students from 252 rural primary schools in northwestern China. Using DID and propensity score matching approaches, our results indicate that parental out-migration has a significant negative impact on the mental health of LBC, as they tend to exhibit higher levels of anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem. However, we find that parental return-migration has no significant effect on the mental health of LBC.","[Shi, Yaojiang; Shen, Yanni] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Ctr Expt Econ Educ, Xian, Peoples R China; [Bai, Yu] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Kenny, Kaleigh; Rozelle, Scott] Stanford Univ, Freeman Spogli Inst Int Studies, Stanford, CA 94305 USA","Shaanxi Normal University; Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS; Institute of Geographic Sciences & Natural Resources Research, CAS; Stanford University","Bai, Y (通讯作者)，Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Geog Sci & Nat Resources Res, Ctr Chinese Agr Policy, Beijing, Peoples R China.",shiyaojiang7@gmail.com; baiy.12b@igsnrr.ac.cn; shenyanniceee@163.com; kaleigh.kenny@gmail.com; rozelle@stanford.edu,"Bai, Yu/AAO-2988-2020","Bai, Yu/0000-0002-6052-7766","Ministry of Education of China [B16031]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71333012, 71473240]","Ministry of Education of China(Ministry of Education, China); National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC))",The authors are supported by the 111 Project from Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. B16031) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 71333012 and 71473240).,,33,49,52,8,60,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,MAY-JUN,2016,24,3,,,SI,,105,122,,10.1111/cwe.12161,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DR5QJ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000379957200008,0

With this attention externality, depending on the cost of producing quality some markets exhibit commoditized price salient equilibria, while others exhibit de-commoditized quality salient equilibria.

First, they increase the market power of a seller with locked-in customers. Second, they increase competition for new customers.

Taken together, the results suggest that, if markets are very competitive to begin with, then switching costs make them even more competitive; whereas if markets are not very competitive to begin with, then switching costs make them even less competitive.

The dynamic interplay between economic growth and fertility is examined as an economy moves through two phases distinguished by the skill composition of the workforce. In the initial phase, the economy comprises skilled and unskilled workers. In the second phase, all workers are skilled. Skilled workers are shown to have fewer children than less educated workers. Aggregate fertility initially declines as the fraction of skilled workers rises with economic growth, and then may recover as the fertility of a skilled workforce rises with skilled wages, for given child care prices. However, in equilibrium, child care prices rise proportionally to skilled wages when child care is produced with constant returns to skilled labour. Results indicate that whether or not the rise in fertility witnessed in high-income countries will continue depends on each country's structure of child care.","[Day, Creina] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Australian National University,"Day, C (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Arndt Corden Dept Econ, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",creina.day@anu.edu.au,,,,,,,24,10,10,0,13,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

While we confirm some results found in previous literature, including an inverse relationship of financial development and exchange rate management to seigniorage, we find little evidence that political instability and polarization lead to greater reliance on seigniorage. We also find robust evidence that the size of the shadow economy and natural resource rents are directly related to seigniorage, the latter result likely a result of exchange rate management. Thus, an effective strategy to reduce reliance on seigniorage is to lower the incentives to operate in the shadow economy, while exchange rate management may be counter-productive in countries with considerable natural resource rents.

We present a two-sector model in which liberalization, by allowing debt-denomination mismatch, relaxes borrowing limits in the financially constrained sector, but endogenously generates crisis risk. When regulation restricts external financing to standard debt, liberalization preserves financial discipline and may increase allocative efficiency, growth, and consumption possibilities. By contrast, under unfettered liberalization that also allows uncollateralized option-like liabilities, discipline breaks down, and efficiency falls. The model yields a testable gains-from-liberalization condition, which holds in emerging markets.

Bank charter value arises from the monopolistic rents in the imperfect competition in the highly regulated banking industry. It may offset moral hazard resulting from government safety net. We analyze the impact of bank charter values, jointly with bank leverage, within the framework suggested by the Marcus (J Bank Financ 28:2259-2281, 1984) model, which originally introduced the disciplining role of bank charter value. We demonstrate that while high charter values reduce risk-taking incentives, low charter values are positively associated with higher risk-taking incentives in the shareholder value maximization problem. We also show that the impact of government bailouts (Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP) on bank risk taking is non-monotonic: It increases risk-taking incentives for bailout recipients relative to non-recipients for weak institutions with low charter values and high leverage, while the opposite is true for strong institutions with high charter values and low leverage.","[Schenck, Natalya A.] Off Comptroller Currency, Enterprise Risk Anal Div, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA; [Thornton, John H., Jr.] Kent State Univ, Dept Finance, 475 Terrace Dr, Kent, OH 44242 USA",United States Department of the Treasury; Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Schenck, NA (通讯作者)，Off Comptroller Currency, Enterprise Risk Anal Div, 400 7th St SW, Washington, DC 20219 USA.",Natalya.schenck@occ.treas.gov; jthornt5@kent.edu,,,,,,,51,5,8,0,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Using the Empirical Mode Decomposition technique, the S&P 500 stock price index is divided into different frequencies known as intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual. The IMFs and the residual are then reconstructed into high frequency, low frequency and trend components using the hierarchical clustering method. Using different measures, it is shown that the low frequency and trend components of stock prices are relatively important drivers of the S&P 500 index. These results are also robust across various sub samples identified based on structural break tests. Therefore, US stock prices have been driven mostly by fundamental laws rooted in economic growth and long-term returns on investment.","[Tiwari, Aviral K.] IFHE Univ, Fac Management, IBS Hyderabad, Donthanapally Shankarapalli Rd, Hyderabad 501203, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Dar, Arif B.] Inst Management Technol, Delhi 201001, India; [Bhanja, Niyati] MICA, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS); MICA; University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",aviral.eco@gmail.com; billaharif0@gmail.com; niyati.eco@gmail.com; rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"Dar, Arif Billah/AAL-9688-2020; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263",,,,,17,4,5,0,3,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 24,2016,10,,,,,,,,20169.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-9,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7HG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372962800001,0

In particular, we revisit the question of sales displacement in the digital era, and analyze how licensed online music streaming affects digital music purchasing behavior. Our results show no evidence of digital music sales displacement by unlicensed downloading and present, for some countries in our sample, a rather small but positive elasticity of up to 0.04 between these two channels. We also find a positive relationship between the use of licensed streaming websites and licensed websites selling digital music, suggesting a stimulating effect of music streaming on digital music sales. Our results present important cross country differences in these effects, with elasticities ranging between 0.09 and 0.01. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects according to individuals' profiles. For both unlicensed downloading and licensed streaming alike, our results suggest that consumers with higher interest in music view these channels as complements to licensed digital purchases to a larger extent.

By documenting the numerous points of contact between Canadian inflation, on one hand, and institutional power and distributive conflict, on the other, we argue that inflation may be validly understood as a power process insofar as it feeds on social conflict and is systematically associated with the redistribution of income between different income groups. Over the past century, Canadian inflation has tended to redistribute income from capital to labor, from large to small firms, and from the upper to the lower income brackets. Given these facts, Canadian inflation must be understood as a political phenomenon.","[Aquanno, Scott] Univ Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Aquanno, Scott] Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada; [Brennan, Jordan] Unifor, Toronto, ON, Canada",University of Toronto,"Aquanno, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ontario, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Aquanno, S (通讯作者)，Univ Toronto, Munk Sch Global Affairs, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

On the cost side, there are three major categories: general infrastructure such as transportation and housing to accommodate athletes and fans; specific sports infrastructure required for competition venues; and operational costs, including general administration as well as the opening and closing ceremony and security. Three major categories of benefits also exist: the short-run benefits of tourist spending during the Games; the long-run benefits or the Olympic legacy which might include improvements in infrastructure and increased trade, foreign investment, or tourism after the Games; and intangible benefits such as the feel-good effect or civic pride. Each of these costs and benefits will be addressed in turn, but the overwhelming conclusion is that in most cases the Olympics are a money-losing proposition for host cities; they result in positive net benefits only under very specific and unusual circumstances. Furthermore, the cost-benefit proposition is worse for cities in developing countries than for those in the industrialized world. In closing, we discuss why what looks like an increasingly poor investment decision on the part of cities still receives significant bidding interest and whether changes in the bidding process of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will improve outcomes for potential hosts.","[Baade, Robert A.] Lake Forest Coll, Econ, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA; [Matheson, Victor A.] Coll Holy Cross, Econ, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Baade, RA (通讯作者)，Lake Forest Coll, Econ, Lake Forest, IL 60045 USA.",baade@mx.lakeforest.edu; vmatheso@holycross.edu,,,,,,,50,114,125,7,89,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Suspecting that the trade flows between the two countries could suffer from another aggregation bias, we disaggregate their trade flows by commodity and consider the trade balance of 45 industries that trade between the two countries. We find significant short-run effects of currency depreciation on the trade balance of 17 industries. The short-run effects last into the long run in 15 cases.

The agent's effort affects the informativeness of a signal about an option's return. Based on the information provided by the agent, the principal decides whether to exercise the option at hand. We derive properties of the optimal contract in both static and dynamic versions of the problem. We show that there are intermediate values of the prior probability that the option is of high quality at which positive effort cannot be sustained. We also show that if the prior is below a threshold, then the agent is rewarded for delivering 'bad news' about the option's quality. We derive distortions (relative to the first best) on the implemented effort level and optimal stopping decision. For some parameter values, it is optimal for the principal to commit to an ex-post suboptimal stochastic decision to exercise an option. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our theoretical model examines the interaction between these two effects. We show that (i) the relationship between the home-country wage and emigration pressure is hump-shaped, (ii) the hump is more pronounced the lower the cost of migration, and (iii) the ratio of high to low-skilled emigrants is decreasing in the home-country wage. We test our model empirically for three different skill groups of emigrants and find strong evidence in support of the three hypotheses. The peak emigration rate for the low skilled is estimated at $4000 at 2000 PPP-adjusted prices. A rise in the annual per-capita income of the source country from $231 of the poorest economy in our sample to $4000, is associated with an increase in the emigration rate of its low-skilled workers from about 2.7% to 5.0%.

In countries that are heavily dependent on resource exports, urbanization appears to be concentrated in consumption cities where the economies consist primarily of non-tradable services. These contrast with production cities that are more dependent on manufacturing in countries that have industrialized. Consumption cities in resource exporters also appear to perform worse along several measures of welfare.

The amount of information about the quality of a new match depends on a worker's past job experience. Allowing workers to learn from experience generates a decline in job finding probabilities with age that is consistent with patterns found in the data. Moreover, workers with more past experience will on average have less wage volatility on new jobs, which is also consistent with the data. In contrast to the fact that the cross-sectional wage distribution fans out with experience, this second result implies that individual wage changes become more predictable.","[Gorry, Aspen] Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; Utah State University,"Gorry, A (通讯作者)，Utah State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Logan, UT 84322 USA.",aspen.gorry@gmail.com,,,,,,,38,6,7,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1759-7323,1759-7331,,QUANT ECON,Quant.

But there is an equally vigorous literature from political science which speaks to the political economy of transitions. We look at the dynamics of how economic modernisation triggers structural changes with winners and losers and how this is reflected in the polarisation of the political sphere amongst middle-income countries. This paper asks the question of whether South Africa is an archetypical example of a country stuck in a trap and how this has affected the policy choices that it has made. South Africa needs to move up the value chain with a viable value proposition, and this requires a very different policy set and human capital plan.","[Luiz, John M.] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Luiz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, Private Bag X3, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",john.luiz@gsb.uct.ac.za,"Luiz, John M/B-5554-2008; Luiz, John/AAU-9761-2020","Luiz, John M/0000-0003-3806-4424; Luiz, John/0000-0003-3806-4424",Oppenheimer Memorial Trust; National Research Foundation,Oppenheimer Memorial Trust; National Research Foundation,The support of the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust and the National Research Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

However, they are also useful in research as summaries of a large number of state policies that cannot be studied simultaneously. Prior research found that business climate indexes focused on productivity and quality of life do not predict economic growth, while indexes emphasizing taxes and costs of doing business indicate that low-tax, low-cost states have faster growth of employment, wages, and output. In this paper, we study the relationship between these two categories of business climate indexes and the promotion of equality or inequality. We do not find that the productivity/quality-of-life indexes predict more equitable outcomes, although some of the policies underlying them suggest they might. We do find, however, that the same tax-and-cost-related indexes that are associated with higher economic growth are also associated with increases in inequality.","[Neumark, David; Muz, Jennifer] UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA; [Neumark, David] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Neumark, David] UCI, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine; National Bureau of Economic Research; University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Neumark, D (通讯作者)，UCI, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.;Neumark, D (通讯作者)，UCI, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",dneumark@uci.edu,"PATTANAYAK, MANORANJAN/N-7858-2017",,,,,,11,4,7,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

To organise our approach, we categorise sub-Saharan Africa countries according to the two main systems of budgetary institutions: the English-based system and the French-based system. The quality of budget institutions is measured through five criteria: centralisation, comprehensiveness, fiscal and procedural rules, sustainability and credibility, and transparency. Our findings show that, on average, Anglophone Africa countries have better budgetary institutions than their Francophone counterparts, and this difference is the main determinant of the fiscal performance gaps between the two groups. These performance gaps are mostly due to the characteristics effect, meaning that the relative poor fiscal performance of Francophone countries is not due to the French-based system itself but rather to the environment in which it operates. The budget process and procedures in these countries are relatively less comprehensive, sustainable and transparent and that adversely affects their fiscal performance.","[Sarr, Babacar] Ctr Budget & Policy Prior, 820 First St NE, Washington, DC 20002 USA",,"Sarr, B (通讯作者)，Ctr Budget & Policy Prior, 820 First St NE, Washington, DC 20002 USA.",bsarr@internationalbudget.org,,,,,,,29,5,5,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Special attention is paid to changes in and the attitudes of governments toward state ownership. Although statist approaches gained momentum in the economic policy of various states in and after the 2008/2009 crisis, this did not mean a fundamental reorientation expressed in changes in the main economic conditions such as ownership patterns. Nevertheless, governments in some CEE countries seem to flirt with such ideas too in the general policy of increasing state economic intervention. The privatisation process was stopped and in a number of cases, formerly privatised assets were re-nationalised. Governments strengthened their influence in the governance structure in mixed-ownership companies. The main body of the present paper provides a better understanding of this change in state property policies. We also call attention to the risks of a reversal of the privatisation logic. An increasing role of the state as proprietor may today strengthen similar negative political and economic consequences and risks as the ones against which the privatisation agenda of the 1990s was suggested. It can reduce competition, give way for political and personal rent-seeking, and weaken the functions of market economic institutions.","[Szanyi, Miklos] Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst World Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary; [Szanyi, Miklos] Budapest Business Sch, Budapest, Hungary",Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies; Budapest Business University,"Szanyi, M (通讯作者)，Hungarian Acad Sci, Ctr Econ & Reg Studies, Inst World Econ, H-1051 Budapest, Hungary.;Szanyi, M (通讯作者)，Budapest Business Sch, Budapest, Hungary.",szanyi.miklos@krtk.mta.hu,,,"Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office [112069]","Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office","The paper was written within the framework of the research supported by the Hungarian National Research, Development and Innovation Office (Grant No. 112069).",,41,22,22,0,13,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

Distance; which has been used in previous studies as an indicator of the cost of remitting, is found to be a poor proxy.","[Ahmed, Junaid; Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany; [Ahmed, Junaid] Capital Univ Sci & Technol Islamabad, Fac Management & Social Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan; [Martinez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada] Univ Jaume 1, Inst Int Econ, Castellon de La Plana, Spain",University of Gottingen; Capital University of Science & Technology; Universitat Jaume I,"Ahmed, J (通讯作者)，Univ Gottingen, Dept Econ, Gottingen, Germany.;Ahmed, J (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Sci & Technol Islamabad, Fac Management & Social Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan.",junaid.ahmed@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Ahmed, Junaid/AFV-2496-2022; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/K-1633-2014","Ahmed, Junaid/0000-0001-9003-2337; Martínez-Zarzoso, Inmaculada/0000-0002-3247-8557",Spanish MINECO [ECO2014-58991-C3-2-R]; University Jaume I [P1.B2013-06],Spanish MINECO(Spanish Government); University Jaume I,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the comments and suggestions made by Prof. Stephan Klasen.

We further evaluate the optimal weights, hedging effectiveness, and dynamic hedging strategies for the MS-DCC-GARCH model based on both the regime-dependent and regime-independent optimal hedge ratios. We finally complement our analysis by examining the in- and out-of sample hedging performances for alternative strategies. Our results mainly show significant volatility and time-varying risk transmission from energy markets to carbon market. We also find that spot and futures segments of the emission markets exhibit time varying correlations and volatile hedging effectiveness. The subsample estimates show significant changes in the hedge effectiveness over the different phases of the European carbon market. These results have important investment and policy implications.

It is well known that higher female wages have an ambiguous effect on fertility: the positive income effect is offset by a negative substitution effect due to the higher opportunity cost of the maternal time required for child-rearing. Here it is shown that housing costs add a new dimension to this relationship. If the housing needs of children are a sufficiently important cost of child-rearing, then other costs of child rearing such as the opportunity cost of maternal time are rendered relatively less important. Hence the negative substitution effect of higher female wages on fertility is weaker, implying that higher female wages are more likely to boost fertility. This effect is stronger when the housing supply elasticity is high since house prices, and hence the costs of children, are kept in check. The analysis here helps to reconcile empirical observations about fertility, female wages and house prices in a number of countries. For governments concerned about low fertility, policies to increase housing supply elasticity in order to keep house prices in check would be helpful. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast to the existing literature, we consider three types of performance functions: additive, weakest link (the performance is the min of performances of n contestants), and best shot (the performance is the max of performances of n contestants). For any of the three types, we derive easy-to-check sufficient conditions to judge whether reward or punishment is better. From the sufficient condition for the additive performance function, we know that punishment is better for less heterogeneous people and reward is better for more heterogeneous people. In addition, the sufficient conditions for the best-shot and weakest-link cases suggest that some unintuitive results hold; even under the best-shot (weakest link) performance function, the bottom punishment (top reward) becomes better when the gap in the abilities of contestants becomes very small (large).

This paper examines the effect of these policy risks on real option decisions of electric power plant investment. To model both an investment decision and generation flexibility, this study evaluates an exotic compound American option on multiple strips of European spread options through the implementation of least squares Monte Carlo simulation. Government credibility risk leads to more investment in less green resources and induces additional cash flow variation, which increases the average time to investment (value of waiting). However, in an extreme case, government credibility can actually hasten investment because the risk may be more favorable to electric power companies. Furthermore, if emission trading is planned to be implemented in the future (e.g., 2020), and the market believes that the probability of successful implementation is low, firms will build a less green plant early to benefit from the period before the green rule is applied.

Together with the increasing production of variable renewable energy sources (RES), the intraday market is gaining importance. We investigate the explanatory power of a fundamental modeling approach explicitly accounting for must-run operations of combined heat and power plants (CHP) and intraday peculiarities such as a shortened intraday supply stack. The fundamental equilibria between every hour's supply stack and aggregated demand in 2012 and 2013 are modeled to yield hourly price estimates. The major benefits of a fundamental modeling approach are the ability to account for non-linearities in the supply stack and the ability to combine time-varying information consistently. The empirical results show that fundamental modeling explains a considerable share of spot price variance. However, differences between the fundamental and actual prices persist and are explored using regression models. The main differences can be attributed to (avoided) start up-costs, market states and trading behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Some theories have assumed that the U-shape is caused by unmet expectations that are felt painfully in midlife but beneficially abandoned and experienced with less regret during old age. This paper is the first to analyze age patterns in unmet expectations. Using the German Socio-Economic Panel, a unique data set that contains life satisfaction expectations as well as the same individuals' subsequent life satisfaction realizations, I match 132,609 life satisfaction expectations to subsequent realizations. I find people to err systematically in predicting their life satisfaction over the life cycle. They expect-incorrectly-increases in young adulthood and decreases during old age. These errors are large, ranging from 9.8% at age 21 to 4.5% at age 68. They are stable over time and observed within cohorts and individuals as well as across socio-economic groups. These findings support theories that unmet expectations drive the age U-shape in wellbeing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using annual data ranging from 1995 to 2013, we conducted a manifold investigation. Firstly, we studied the descriptive statistics of key variables affecting public debt dynamics. We found that the ex-communist countries recorded lower public debt ratios, negative flow costs and primary deficits. By comparison, the advanced economies achieved primary surpluses in order to balance larger public debt-to-GDP ratios and positive flow costs. Secondly, using the accounting approach we analyzed the dynamics of public debt. The results indicated unstable patterns for the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Employing a logit model with fixed effects, we also showed that running primary deficits is more likely to increase the probability of having unstable dynamics of public debt. Thirdly, we examined the distribution of the flow cost which revealed the existence of fat tails, suggesting an increased likelihood of large debt burdens. We also found that the uncertainty of the future debt burden is mainly driven by the variability of the real GDP growth rate.","[Stoian, Andreea; Iorgulescu, Filip] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, 6 Piata, Bucharest 010374, Romania; [Stoian, Andreea; Iorgulescu, Filip] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, CEFIMO, 6 Piata, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Stoian, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Dept Finance, 6 Piata, Bucharest 010374, Romania.;Stoian, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, CEFIMO, 6 Piata, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",andreea.stoian@fin.ase.ro,"Stoian, Andreea/D-7626-2012; Iorgulescu, Filip/Q-8068-2017","Stoian, Andreea/0000-0002-1115-5986;","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/138907]","European Social Fund, through the Sectorial Operational Programme Human Resources Development","We express our gratitude for useful comments and suggestions to Elias Soukiazs (University of Coimbra), Dimitros Paparas (Harper Adams University), Enrico Marelli (University of Brescia) and to the participants at the 16th INFER Annual Conference (Pescara, Italy).

Productivity gains in the production of ICT are given as the answer. But technical progress in upstream industries, in general, should not raise TFP growth in downstream industries. This article investigates two explanations for this apparent puzzle: the existence of intangible capital and the externalities of ICT investment. Using newly constructed comprehensive data covering 16 OECD countries for 24 industries for a period of 32 years, I find evidence of intangible capital accumulation, but no evidence of positive spillovers from ICT use. Results show that what would have considered as a perfect case of spillovers from ICT use under conventional method is the impact of R& D and other intangible capital. Once these two channels are accounted for in the model, neither domestic nor foreign ICT spillovers exist.","[Acharya, Ram C.] Dept Ind, 10 East Tower,235 Queen St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada",,"Acharya, RC (通讯作者)，Dept Ind, 10 East Tower,235 Queen St, Ottawa, ON K1A 0H5, Canada.",ram.acharya@ic.gc.ca,,,,,,,32,23,24,0,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Unlike the existing studies, which assume the convenience yield to have either a constant value or to have a stochastic behavior with mean reversion to one equilibrium level, the model of this paper extends the Gibson and Schwartz (1990) model to allow for regime switching in the convenience yield along with the other parameters. A closed form solution for the futures price is derived and the model parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method. The results show that the estimated regimes are very close to the contango and backwardation regimes commonly seen in futures markets. The results also show that the transitional probabilities play an important role in shaping the futures term structure implied by the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These studies generally contend that corruption acts more like a grabbing hand' than as a helping hand'. However, it is plausible that a significant component of foreign investment may be attracted to locales that offer opaque financial environments. Specifically, we hypothesize that money laundering opportunities may encourage illicit capital flows into certain jurisdictions. Using the USA as the source' country, we investigate the effect of corruption and money laundering opportunities on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows. The empirical findings indicate that corruption deters foreign investment, while money laundering opportunities attract it. We also show that the effect of money laundering and corruption vary based on the host country's level of development.

Our findings provide evidence of a significant and positive relationship between all country corruption measures and inflation. Countries with a corrupted environment and bad governance use seigniorage as a source of revenue which induces higher monetary expansion and therefore higher inflation rates. After controlling for money supply, our results suggest that corruption is affecting inflation via other channels. Our results show also that the negative effect of corruption on inflation is different across subsample countries.

Using panel data on 64 dictatorships from 1960 to 2000, we find empirical evidence that our hypotheses are not rejected.","[Bove, Vincenzo] Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Brauner, Jennifer] Univ London, Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ, London, England",University of Essex; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Bove, V (通讯作者)，Univ Essex, Dept Govt, Wivenhoe Pk, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England.",vbove@essex.ac.uk,"Bove, Vincenzo/O-2279-2019",,,,,,58,46,50,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

Performance measures used in this paper are average growth rates for five-year period - from 2010 to 2014, average net profit growth rate and average sales revenue growth rate. Descriptive analysis of performance measures and capital structure measures shows significant deviations regarding minimal and maximal values in the sample consisting of 120 SFH. Two hypotheses set in the paper were confirmed with multiple linear regression and by constructing two empirical models. Empirical results imply that owner' s knowledge on financing set as equity-to-assets ratio significantly positively influences average net profit growth rate which was confirmed in model 1. Furthermore, owner` s knowledge on financing set as debt-to-equity ratio significantly positively influences average sales revenue growth rate which was confirmed in model 2.

Population health depends on the prevalence of infectious diseases that can be avoided through costly prevention. The incentive to do so comes from the negative effects of ill health on the quality and quantity of life. The model can generate a poverty trap where infectious diseases cycle between high and low prevalence. These cycles originate from the rationality of preventive behavior in contrast to the predator-prey dynamics of epidemiological models. We calibrate the model to reflect sub-Saharan Africa's recent economic recovery and analyze policy alternatives. Unconditional transfers are found to improve welfare relative to conditional health-based transfers: at low income levels, income growth (quality of life) is valued more than improvements to health (quantity of life).","[Chakraborty, Shankha] Univ Oregon, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Papageorgiou, Chris] Int Monetary Fund, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Perez Sebastian, Fidel] Univ Alicante, Alicante, Spain; [Perez Sebastian, Fidel] Univ Hull, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of Oregon; International Monetary Fund; Universitat d'Alacant; University of Hull,"Sebastián, FP (通讯作者)，Univ Hull, Sch Business, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England.",fidel.perez.sebastian@gmail.com,"Perez-Sebastian, Fidel/AAA-5832-2019",,Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-36719],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"An earlier version circulated under the title Battling Infection, Fighting Stagnation.

The hallmark of this literature is the consistency with which selected Early Warning Signals, such as the level of reserves and exchange rate appreciations, are presumed to predict different types of crises across countries and time. The diversity of crises theories that motivate Early Warning Signals presents, however, a challenge to empirical implementations. Given that the true model of Early Warning Signals is unknown, omitted variable bias contaminates estimates and confidence levels when the uncertainty surrounding a particular theory has been ignored. After addressing model uncertainty in Early Warning Signal regressions, using an extended version of Frankel and Saravelos (2012. J. Int. Econ. 87, 216-231) dataset, we do not find a single Early Warning Signal that alerts to all dimensions of the 2008 crisis.

We find a very strong and robust positive effect of 'soft-information-intensive' relationships, a less robust positive effect of long-lasting relationships and a negative effect of credit concentration as measured by the number of banking relationships. We also find that 'sof-tinformation-intensive' relationships reduce credit rationing for innovative firms, while long-lasting relationships seem to favour innovation via other relational channels.

We formulate the following hypothesis: (i) during downturns, the final values of the natural interest rate and of the potential output level are highly likely to be overestimated by integrating algorithmic extraction and the results yielded by the anchoring heuristic; (ii) during boom periods and especially in times of financial bubbles, the final values are highly likely to be overestimated by integrating algorithmic extractions with the results yielded by employing the representativeness heuristic. Shifting from optimism to pessimism and vice versa plays a key role in the selection of heuristics. The overestimation thus generated can be a serious obstacle to the proper conduct of monetary policy. For Romania, the hypothesis is confirmed. In the period from 2005 to 2010, the potential level of output and the natural rate were systematically overestimated during both the upturn of the business cycle and the recession, as well as during the recovery phase.",,,,,,,,,,,45,2,2,0,4,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

This paper aims to provide evidence on whether the bank landing channel in the selected euro area countries as a whole is operational. Unlike the existent studies we test for differences of the bank lending channel relevance for the large and the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We apply a macro identification strategy to identify loan supply shocks attributable to the banks' balance sheet constraints and use them in a typical monetary policy VAR model to verify the existence of the bank lending channel. Additionally, we provide evidence on how the shocks in loan activity affect output and inflation. The analysis of impulse responses reveals that a negative shock (an increase in the policy rate) leads to a significant increase in credit standards for large enterprises as well as the SMEs. This implies that the restrictive monetary policy shock increases banks' balance sheet constraints and that the banks in the short run respond by tightening credit standards for enterprises. Tightening credit standards shock in turn negatively impacts the growth of business loans. The empirical results thus provide evidence that the bank lending channel is operational. A negative shock to the credit standards reduces output in the short run, yet no significant impact on inflation can be observed. When banks unexpectedly tighten credit standards for SMEs the monetary policy (European central bank) seems to respond in a more pronounced manner (by reducing monetary policy rate more) than when banks tighten credit standards for large enterprises.","[Dajcman, Silvo] Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Dajcman, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Razlagova 14, SLO-2000 Maribor, Slovenia.",silvo.dajcman@uni-mb.si,,,,,,,45,7,8,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

In the existing literature, the concept of the financialization of the nonfinancial corporation remains ambiguous; as such, clarification of the trends that have occurred in NFC financial behavior is an important prerequisite for analyses of why NFC behavior has changed and with what consequences. By systematically delineating the evidence for the financialization of NFCs, this paper contributes to the literature by establishing precisely how NFC financial behavior has changed in the post-1980 U.S. economy. The growing financialization of nonfinancial corporations is summarized by an increased share of financial assets in NFC portfolios, increasing indebtedness and equity repurchases among large firms, and deleveraging among smaller firms. The paper concludes by introducing the behavioral insights gained by approaching these stylized facts from a conceptual standpoint emphasizing the interdependence of portfolio and financing decisions and, thus, the links between the changes in financial behavior across NFC balance sheets.","[Davis, Leila E.] Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA",,"Davis, LE (通讯作者)，Middlebury Coll, Dept Econ, Middlebury, VT 05753 USA.",,,,,,,,45,64,69,3,74,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

This paper uses a computable overlapping generations model to quantify the growth of labor productivity necessary to achieve a balanced budget over the next decades on the existing pension system in 2010. The results indicate that in the best of cases, a 4 percent annual growth rate would be required until 2050. In addition, it would be necessary that the aging population over the coming decades is less than currently projected by the INE, that the government implements what is known as Silent Reform, and that workers substantially increase the length of their working lives.","[Diaz-Saavedra, Julian] Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain",University of Granada,"Díaz-Saavedra, J (通讯作者)，Univ Granada, E-18071 Granada, Spain.",,"Saavedra, Julián Díaz/AAA-6687-2019","Saavedra, Julián Díaz/0000-0002-6585-4053",,,,,13,0,0,0,11,INST ESTUDIOS FISCALES,MADRID,"AVDA CARDENAL HERRERA ORIA, 378, MADRID, 28035, SPAIN",0210-1173,2386-4176,,HACIENDA PUBLICA ESP,Hacienda Publica Esp.,,2016,,218,,,,,11,31,,10.7866/HPE-RPE.16.3.1,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,EJ0YV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392938100001,0

In order to be able to do that, enterprises must be dynamic. Even though - several authors suggest a positive association between organisational culture and the enterprise's dynamic - we are still lacking the empirical support for such assertion. Therefore, we empirically tested the association between the type and strength of culture and the level of enterprises' dynamics. Since organisational culture and the enterprises' dynamics are both a complex phenomenon, we applied a case study approach combined with quantitative methods. The research indicates that the adhocracy culture type positively influences the level of enterprises' dynamics. Regarding the strength of culture, our research results show that positive effects of strong culture exceed the eventual negative effects of such culture and positively influence the level of enterprises' dynamics.","[Duh, Mojca; Belak, Jernej; Milfelner, Borut] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Belak, J (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia.",jernej.belak@um.si,"Milfelner, Borut/AAP-5114-2020; belak, jernej/E-7911-2013","Milfelner, Borut/0000-0003-4469-3972; belak, jernej/0000-0001-9855-4973",,,,,71,8,8,6,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

Moreover, it has further asserted its dominance over geopolitical discourse and ideology worldwide. I contend that neoliberal supremacy in the policy arena and upon domestic and international institutions has been largely uncontested because it has penetrated all aspects of life to the extent that it now represents what Thorstein Veblen referred to as the modern point of view. Understanding the global power of neoliberalism requires examining not only its well-established hegemony over institutions as social constructs, but also its impact on habits of thought as mental constructs. From a Veblenian perspective, I argue that the neoliberal doctrine generates habits of thought which legitimize the transformation of a market-oriented economy into a full-fledged market society. The impact of the normalization of the neoliberal mode of behavior may, in the end, worsen the fracture between nation and state and unravel the fabric of society by justifying fully detached, emotion-free, and self-centered actions that crowd-out pro-social behaviors and challenge any social conception of the common good.","[Duroy, Quentin] Denison Univ, Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA",University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Duroy, Q (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Econ, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We construct a theoretical framework of parimutuel markets in which we model both strategic interaction and individual bettor risk preferences, distinguishing between sophisticated insiders and recreational outsiders. We solve this model analytically for the optimal insider betting amount in a static symmetric Nash equilibrium. A new data set of 126 million individual horse race bets in New Zealand from 2006 to 2014 allows us to calibrate the model. We find that insiders (those betting $100 or more) outperform outsiders by 7.5% in terms of realized returns. The best fit of the model to the data is obtained when insiders are assumed to be risk neutral and to have an information advantage of 0.08 in probability terms. This finding provides empirical support for the common assumption of risk neutrality in strategic interaction models of parimutuel betting.","[Geertsema, Paul] Univ Auckland, Dept Accounting & Finance, Auckland 1, New Zealand; [Schumacher, Christoph Rainer] Massey Univ, Sch Econ & Finance, Auckland, New Zealand",University of Auckland; Massey University,"Geertsema, P (通讯作者)，Univ Auckland, Dept Accounting & Finance, Auckland 1, New Zealand.",p.geertsema@auckland.ac.nz,"; Geertsema, Paul/G-5257-2019","Schumacher, Christoph/0000-0002-0710-3649; Geertsema, Paul/0000-0002-1461-3807",,,,,16,0,0,0,4,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Social contributions paid by firms are reduced by 1% of GDP for four years and are financed by increasing the consumption tax. Our main results are the following. First, in the first years following implementation the Spanish trade balance improves by around 0.6% of GDP, the (before-consumption tax) real exchange rate depreciates by 0.7% and the terms of trade deteriorate by 1.3%. Second, the trade balance improves when the temporary fiscal devaluation is also enacted in the rest of the euro area, albeit to a lower extent than in the case of unilateral (country-specific) implementation. Third, similar results are obtained if we consider the case of a smaller euro area economy, specifically Portugal. Fourth, quantitative results are robust to changes in some key parameters but crucially depend on the degree of substitutability between domestic and imported tradables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, the artificial neural network as one of the machine learning method is used to model creditworthiness of Croatian companies. The input space consisted of 29 variables containing companies' financial coefficients and additional variables such as defense interval (in days), days of accounts receivables, days of accounts payables, the number of employees, and other. Fourthy neural network architectures were tested in order to find the model which produces the smallest error and the stability of results. The most successful model yields the average classification rate of 84.57% in a 10-fold subsampling procedure. Besides the model accuracy, the paper also analyses the importance of predictors using sensitivity analysis. The results of suggested model are then compared to some previous research in this area and similar models in other countries.

Standardized test scores as well as the fraction of students with competences considered inadequate are examined. Regardless of measurement and subject area, the bulk of the gap is explained by social differences in income, wealth and parental education. Using reduced-form regressions, two major mediating mechanisms are identified: first, on average the home environment of Roma children is less favourable for cognitive development; second, the educational environment of the average Roma student is different from the average non-Roma student. Comparing students with similar home environments from the same school and class, the ethnic gap in test scores is found to be insignificant. Ethnic differences in the home environment are explained by social disparity, and ethnicity seems to play no additional role in that regard. The unequal distribution of Roma students in schools and classes is found to be explained predominantly by social difference, too, with a significant residual portion, indicating the effect of ethnic segregation.","[Kertesi, Gabor; Kezdi, Gabor] RCERS HAS, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary; [Kezdi, Gabor] Cent European Univ, Budapest, Hungary",Central European University,"Kertesi, G (通讯作者)，RCERS HAS, Inst Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",kertesi.gabor@krtk.mta.hu; kezdig@ceu.hu,,,European Union's Seventh Framework Programme GRINCOH project ('Growth-Innovation Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe'); CEU Institute for Advanced Study; [OTKA-101409],European Union's Seventh Framework Programme GRINCOH project ('Growth-Innovation Competitiveness: Fostering Cohesion in Central and Eastern Europe'); CEU Institute for Advanced Study;,We thank seminar participants at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences as well as the Editor and an anonymous referee for their helpful comments.

Our analysis shows that the proportion of adults with a college degree has increased more in cities with a higher initial schooling level in Korea. This finding is consistent with what Berry and Glaeser (2005) and others found for the USA. However, if we control for the difference in ageing across cities, the relationship between the initial schooling level and the proportion of adults with a college degree does not hold any longer. It is argued that the difference in ageing across cities can largely account for the divergence of human capital levels across cities in Korea.","[Kim, Woo-Yung] Kongju Natl Univ, Fac Econ & Trade, Gongju, South Korea",Kongju National University,"Kim, WY (通讯作者)，Kongju Natl Univ, Fac Econ & Trade, Gongju, South Korea.",kwy@kongju.ac.kr,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Therefore, this paper presents a comparative analysis of e-government readiness based on the selected global e-government readiness reports and other related e-government initiatives.

Further, it also provides a global scale classification of related reports, indices and ranks focusing on the best performing countries in the world from the recent past.

The results are consistent with the theory introduced in this study on the substitutability of executive compensation and firm's debt/lease financing. Our findings represent fresh empirical evidence and renewed interpretation regarding the relationship between executive equity- based incentives and firm's financing choices.

First, the general framework of the implementation of the changes in the public administration is introduced, with an emphasis on the application of the methods, previously used in the private sector. The improvement of the quality of the public services and the savings of the public funds introduced new methods for the management of the public administration. The benchmarking is one of the methods to improve the quality of the public administration. In the Czech Republic, it has been mainly used in municipalities since 2000. The aim of this article is to identify the benefits of the use of benchmarking and their perception by the researched subjects (municipal authorities) and their development in time. The research was conducted in 2005 and 2013 in the municipal offices in the Czech Republic The research is based on the questionnaires and interviews. The results show that the most common benefit of the use of benchmarking is the very possibility of comparison and thus a municipality is able to determine its own position compared to the others. This implicates the consequent possibility of using good practice and using experience, suggestions and ideas of others and the possible application of the verified procedures. The benchmarking is an opportunity leading to the improvement of the organization, its performance and savings implementation.","[Nunvarova, Svatava] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Nunvárová, S (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",nunvar@econ.muni.cz,,,,,,,17,0,0,2,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,727,732,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-92,0.0,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500093,0

While the patent system's aim is that firms apply to patent their innovations, especially the most important ones, theoretical results in the existing literature suggest that large innovations will rather be protected by secrecy because of the legal uncertainty surrounding intellectual property rights. In line with the predictions of their model, our probit analysis conducted using data from the Community Innovation Survey 4 shows that, in the intermediate goods industry, small innovations are patented while secrecy is used to protect large ones. For very innovative small firms, the share of innovative sales in total sales has a negative effect on patent application. These findings support the view that many innovative firms regard patent filing as no more secure than secrecy, which therefore limits the diffusion of knowledge.","[Pajak, Serge] Univ Paris Sud, RITM, Dept Law Econ & Management, 54 Bd Desgranges, F-92330 Sceaux, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Pajak, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Sud, RITM, Dept Law Econ & Management, 54 Bd Desgranges, F-92330 Sceaux, France.",serge.pajak@u-psud.fr,,,,,,,39,10,10,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1043-8599,1476-8364,,ECON INNOV NEW TECH,Econ.

Considering the possibly different causal impacts of positive and negative shocks, this research employs asymmetric Granger causality test to further examine the relation. Results show that negative shocks in the insurance and banking sector Granger-cause each other, the positive shocks in these two sectors do not have significant Granger cause with each other. Moreover, the positive (or negative) shocks in the insurance sector Granger cause the opposite direction of shocks in the banking sector. According to the test results, regulatory authorities should pay more attention to the systemic risk resulted from the downturn of insurance and banking sectors, and the insurance industry should be further strengthened, since the insurance sector plays a more active role in the insurance-banking nexus and can promote the stability and development of the financial system.","[Pan, Guochen; Guo, Jingyan] Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Jing, Qiaoling] Hubei Urban Construct Vocat & Technol Coll, Dept Econ & Management, Wuhan, Peoples R China",Wuhan University; Hubei Urban Construction Vocational & Technological College,"Pan, GC (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Econ & Management Sch, Dept Insurance & Actuarial Sci, Wuhan, Peoples R China.",gcpan@whu.edu.cn; guojingyan@whu.edu.cn; 64625328@qq.com,"pan, guochen/D-3056-2013",,National Natural Science Foundation of China [71271157],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 71271157.

One part of this methodology is so called complex networks which have very close to real-world networks. The study of complex networks is active part of scientific research in many areas such as mathematics, economy, sociology, biology, and others. To study such large graphs, it is possible to use random graphs models. Such graphs are usually described by some rules that define probability of structure or properties of such graphs. It is believed that studying random graphs can help understand the structure of large graphs or complex networks. Social networks have its own importance for companies and also for organization of public administration. There is possibility to obtain infounation about relationship not only between individuals but also between organizations. Organizations can obtain resources, information or knowledge from their external connections. This paper focus on Random Graph models and its utilization within area of global strategic management which is important in international strategies. Analysing of real network is very difficult due to possibilities of observing such network and gaining information about relationships inside the network. Random Graph models are suitable for modelling similar situation within different situation. This paper will demonstrate how Random Graph models can extend viewing on global strategic management for multinational or international strategy.","[Panus, Jan] Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Panus, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Studentska 95, Pardubice 53210, Czech Republic.",jan.panus@upce.cz,"Panus, Jan/GRF-0682-2022",,,,,,16,0,0,1,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1628,1634,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800201,0

Using a tractable, intertemporal choice model, this paper derives analytic solutions to show that, when loss aversion is high, the reference-dependent decision maker saves a markedly larger amount than is predicted by the standard model. When the loss aversion is low (i.e. the individual is loss-tolerant), the overall result is ambiguous, although the decision maker may deviate into consuming more; if he faces a small level of uncertainty relative to the intensity of his loss aversion, he may even do this by borrowing. Given the same loss aversion level, this study determines that, in the presence of positive state-dependence, the state-independent model generates greater deviation than the state-dependent one. Finally, this paper derives a two-period general equilibrium result with two agents who have different attitudes toward loss.","[Park, Hyeon] Manhattan Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA",Manhattan College,"Park, H (通讯作者)，Manhattan Coll, Dept Econ & Finance, 4513 Manhattan Coll Pkwy, Riverdale, NY 10471 USA.",hyeon.park@manhattan.edu,,,,,,,29,5,5,1,24,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

It is designed to model global international linkages and to assess the international transmission of shocks under an endogenous framework and incomplete ERPT assumption. First, we use the global VAR model to estimate the steady state of observable endogenous variables of the multi-country DSGE model in order to take into account international linkages, possible cointegration relationships within domestic variables and between domestic and foreign variables, and the role of common unobserved and observed global factors such as oil prices. Second, using the estimated multi-country DSGE model for the Euro-area to conduct ERPT analysis yields the following results. On the one hand, exchange rate volatility contributes to a large part of the import price inflation variation of the Euro-area in contrast to foreign markup shocks. On the other hand, nominal rigidity induces a persistent but lower impact of the exchange rate changes on import inflation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result of their autonomy and flexibility, they are able to satisfy individual demand in areas that are often perceived as being financially unattractive for larger companies. According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, in 2014, 99.84 % of active companies employed from 0 to 249 employees. The key question that all companies are forced to address consists of securing funding, in which respect SMEs are primarily dependent on the banking sector. However, the development of technology has provided a new form of financing, i.e. so-called P2P lending which consists of a platform or marketplace in which lenders and borrowers are able to meet virtually. This development leads to the question of the role that P2P lending plays in terms of the funding of SMEs compared to traditional means of financing economic entities such as bank loans. The aim of the paper is to provide a description of the role of P2P lending with respect to the funding of SMEs in the Czech Republic. The method employed in order to assess the role of business financing consists of comparing P2P lending with traditional ways of financing businesses.

Based on tourism system approach, the factors of risks are divided in two dimensions: internal risks and external risks and seven criteria: political, economic, cultural-social, technological, environmental-health, functional and safe-security. Data were analyzed by fuzzy inference system and Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) synthesizing to construction of forecasting risk assessment system. Tourists' perspectives towards the possibilities of risks were first assessed within seven risk factors and converted into a systematic structure within the structure of rough sets. Designing of a fuzzy expert system was dealt with using the created knowledge database. Then, the system's sensitivity analysis was examined. The results indicate that the system can be a good way to estimate the risks and their fluctuation rates and impacts on the development of tourism destinations. The technological, social, functional and safety-security risks had the highest values in the system designed for minimum travel repeatability. The research suggests that it is important impact of risks and their interaction with each other on the future development of tourism destination.","[Sabokbar, Hassanali Faraji] Univ Tehran, Dept Human Geog, Tehran 1417854151, Iran; [Ayashi, Athareh] Univ Tehran, Dept Tourism Planning, Tehran 1417854151, Iran; [Hosseini, Ali] Univ Tehran, Dept Geog & Urban Planning, Tehran 1417854151, Iran; [Banaitis, Audrius; Banaitiene, Nerija] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Ayashi, Raziyeh] Kharazmi Univ, Dept Tourism Planning, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; University of Tehran; University of Tehran; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; Kharazmi University,"Banaitis, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Dept Construct Econ & Property Management, Fac Civil Engn, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",audrius.banaitis@vgtu.lt,"Hosseini, Ali/B-6190-2018; sabokbar, Hassan Ali Faraji/AAO-8318-2021; Banaitiene, Nerija/AAN-8039-2020; Banaitis, Audrius/R-6749-2018","Hosseini, Ali/0000-0002-3942-2222; sabokbar, Hassan Ali Faraji/0000-0002-5470-4287; Banaitiene, Nerija/0000-0001-8420-5609; Banaitis, Audrius/0000-0002-3302-1209; Ayashi, Athareh/0000-0003-1196-1846",,,,,62,8,9,2,28,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

In terms of bilateral relations between the European Union and Russia, the operation of the program as an instrument of the European Neighbourhood Policy was discussed. The key issues and challenges for tourism development in the studied area were determined. A literature study was carried out which proved that projects financed by EU funds play a significant role since they are important tools in tourism development. A quantitative and qualitative analysis was performed; it concerned 16 tourist projects conducted under the Tourism development as part of the priority of pursuing social, economic and spatial development. A Database of Projects carried out in Poland under the European Territorial Cooperation objective was used in the study. The results of tourist projects were discussed from the subjective, objective and territorial point of view, in particular hard results. Based on the collected information, barriers to the development of the area as a cross-border tourist destination were determined. Options were identified for a continuation of activities that have been started, including works for the development of cross-border products under a new tool, i.e. the European Neighbourhood Instrument, which entered into force in 2014, limiting the eligible area to the Polish-Russian borderland.","[Studzieniecki, Tomasz] Gdynia Maritime Univ, Fac Entrepreneurship & Commod Sci, Dept Tourism & Hotel Management, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland; [Korneevets, Valentin] Immanuel Kant Baltic Fed Univ, Inst Recreat Tourism & Phys Culture, Dept Social Culture Serv & Tourism, 14 A Nevsky Str, Kaliningrad 236041, Russia",Gdynia Maritime University; Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University,"Studzieniecki, T (通讯作者)，Gdynia Maritime Univ, Fac Entrepreneurship & Commod Sci, Dept Tourism & Hotel Management, Ul Morska 81-87, PL-81225 Gdynia, Poland.",tomaszstudzieniecki@wp.pl; Vkorneevets@kantiana.ru,"Studzieniecki, Tomasz/Q-7351-2018; Korneevets, Valentin/Q-7298-2017","Studzieniecki, Tomasz/0000-0002-1272-0908; Korneevets, Valentin/0000-0002-7049-0346",,,,,26,4,4,0,12,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,1135,1143,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-146,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500147,0

Specifically, their quarterly real gross domestic product (GDP) series spanning from 1999 are subjected to tests for their long run and short run lead-lag relations within a tri-variate modelling framework. Contrary to popular perception, the empirical evidence suggests that generally very nominal links exist between the GDP of these EA countries and that of the US. Direct links with Europe are found to be totally non-existent. All this would imply that the EA economies have a very limited susceptibility to shocks in the US and Europe, unless these shocks precipitate a global economic crisis of severe proportions such as the Great Recession. The growing conviction that when China sneezes, the world would catch a cold is also dispelled by the empirical results.","[Tan, Eu Chye] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Tang, Chor Foon] Univ Sains Malaysia, Ctr Policy Res & Int Studies, George Town, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Sains Malaysia,"Tan, EC (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"Tang, Chor Foon/F-9289-2011","Tang, Chor Foon/0000-0003-2242-9222",,,,,38,0,0,0,4,WROCLAW UNIV ECONOMICS,WORCLAW,"KOMANDORSKA 118-120, WORCLAW, 53-345, POLAND",1233-5835,,,ARGUM OECON,Argum.

By adopting sorting, cross-sectional tests and checks of the monotonic relation, we have examined the performance of the portfolios formed on the prices of over 850 companies listed on the Polish stock market within the years 2000-2014. Contrary to the globally prevailing evidence, the expensive stocks have significantly outperformed the cheap stocks. Additional sorts on value, size and momentum may be used further to improve the price-based strategies while the strongest anomaly has been identified among the growth companies. We hypothesize that the reverse character of the low-price anomaly may be explained by the impact of another phenomena: the underperformance of lottery-stocks.

We argue that general economic laws are unhelpful as a guide to understanding the past or predicting the future because they ignore the central role of political and economic institutions, as well as the endogenous evolution of technology, in shaping the distribution of resources in society. We use regression evidence to show that the main economic force emphasized in Piketty's book, the gap between the interest rate and the growth rate, does not appear to explain historical patterns of inequality (especially, the share of income accruing to the upper tail of the distribution). We then use the histories of inequality of South Africa and Sweden to illustrate that inequality dynamics cannot be understood without embedding economic factors in the context of economic and political institutions, and also that the focus on the share of top incomes can give a misleading characterization of the true nature of inequality.","[Acemoglu, Daron] MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Robinson, James A.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Harvard University,"Acemoglu, D (通讯作者)，MIT, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.",daron@mit.edu; jrobinson@gov.harvard.edu,"Acemoglu, Daron/JQW-5242-2023",,,,,,107,156,175,6,188,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

Input substitutability in the production function is also tested for the relationship between capital and energy in different manufacturing sectors. The simulation exercise reveals that the model produces highly differentiated results when different sets of elasticity parameters are adopted. As a general result, lower substitutability values correspond to a reduction in the flexibility of energy substitution possibilities, making carbon abatement efforts more expensive. Moreover, this restriction generates changes in the distribution of costs associated with abatement efforts across regions. This brings to severe implications on international competitiveness especially for energy-intensive industrial sectors. The direct implication derived from this work is that in order to use CGE models to assess the amount and distribution of mitigation costs and to inform the international community involved in discussing the feasibility of climate policies, the use of empirically estimated behavioural parameters at the highest possible disaggregation level is highly recommended.

This evidence, therefore, contradicts the standard predictions from traditional neoclassical or AK-type growth models with exogenous depreciation. In this paper, we first confirm these findings for a larger sample of 101 countries. We then study the dynamics of growth and persistence in a model that renders a positive link between embodied technological progress, depreciation and output growth. We find that the model's predictions appear consistent with the empirical evidence on persistence, long-term growth and depreciation rates. In addition, we provide evidence of a unit root in output with a large battery of second-generation panel unit root tests. This supports the general validity of the endogenous growth model proposed.

We identify two causes: inefficiency and congestion. Inefficiency might be due to the fact that inputs are of relatively low quality (e.g, temporary workers) and/or, for a given quality, to the fact that inputs do not have incentives to exert their maximum level of effort. Congestion arises when the number of new cases is above the number that can be solved when full efficiency is achieved. This decomposition is applied to the universe of Catalonian first instance courts for the period 2005-13 applying a fixed-effect panel stochastic frontier model (Wang and Ho, 2010). In this particular case, we conclude that poor performance is not due to inefficiency on the courts' side, but to an increase in the litigation demand, that is, to congestion, while inefficiency tends to decrease along time and is correlated with the presence of temporary judges.","[Espasa, Marta] Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; Inst Econ Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Espasa, M (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"; Esteller, Manel/L-5956-2014","Espasa, Mateu/0000-0003-4822-1024; Esteller, Manel/0000-0003-4490-6093","Generalitat de Catalunya through the Centre d'Estudis Juridics i Formacio Especialitzada; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-37873, ECO2012-37131]; government of Catalonia [2014SGR420]",Generalitat de Catalunya through the Centre d'Estudis Juridics i Formacio Especialitzada; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya),"We thank participants at the II Annual Conference of the Asociacion Espanola de Derecho y Economia (AEDE) held in Barcelona (UPF), June 2011, and at the European Association of Law and Economics (EALE) held in Hamburg; in particular, we thank Pablo Salvador and Alois Stutzer (our respective discussants), Nuno Garoupa and Veronica Grembi for their comments.

In this paper, we introduce reference points to a canonical model of International Environmental Agreements (IEAs). Countries have reference points on IEA membership. An LEA member that abates is aggrieved if there is a material loss relative to the case with the referenced membership. We find that reference points weakly reduce the abatement level for an LEA with given membership, while interestingly, reference points weakly increase the equilibrium membership and thus the equilibrium abatement level of the LEA. These results imply that effective management of reference points could be conducive to the resolution of the climate problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

They show that incorporating information on the financial cycle yields measures of potential output and output gaps for the United States, United Kingdom and Spain that are estimated more precisely and are more robust in real time. With its well-developed financial markets and relatively open capital markets, the South African economy is potentially susceptible to the build-up of the sort of financial imbalances that characterised the recent financial crisis. Using the framework developed in Borio et al., a finance-neutral measure of the output gap is estimated for South Africa. The traditional Hodrick-Prescott filter is extended to incorporate information on credit and property prices. Including financial cycle proxies result in output gaps that are estimated more precisely and are more robust to data revisions and the arrival of new data points (i.e. estimated output gaps are more robust in real time), while also reflecting the impact of financial variables on economic activity. As such, the estimated finance-neutral output gap seems to represent a more appropriate measure on which to base monetary policy decisions.","[Kemp, Johannes Hermanus] Univ Stellenbosch, Bur Econ Res, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa",Stellenbosch University,"Kemp, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Stellenbosch, Bur Econ Res, ZA-7600 Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa.",jhkemp@sun.ac.za,,,,,,,41,2,2,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

I set up a common pool resource game in which subjects exchange recommendations prior to the extraction decision. The classical tension of this game between individual and collective incentives opens the door for strategic communication. However, I find that subjects are highly consistent with their transmitted message and, to some extent, responsive to the incoming recommendation. Recommendations are efficiency enhancing: extraction levels are lower when the outgoing and the incoming messages are closer to each other. This is particularly relevant in treatments with a high proportion of cooperative recommendations. I link experimental behavior with survey data and I find that lying behavior is negatively correlated with the ratio between the (reported) satisfactory and realized earnings from the fishermen.

Seventy nine countries over 1971-2011 are grouped into high-, low- and negative-growth categories based on exponential growth rate of their per capita output. Tests of cointegration suggest the existence of long-run relation between energy (electricity) consumption and output in high- and low-growth panels but its absence in the panel with negative growth. Accounting for cross-country dependency strengthens the findings. Estimates of long-run elasticity of output with respect to energy (electricity) are significant in panels with positive growth rates. The common correlated effect mean-group estimators of the error-correction model suggest (1) long-run bidirectional causality between output and energy (electricity) in all three groups of countries, (2) short-run bidirectional causality in output-energy relation for the full sample as well as in the low-growth category; and (3) unidirectional causality from output to energy in the negative-growth category. The finding of long-run bidirectional causality is robust to inclusion of carbon emission, urbanization, exports, and foreign direct investment as control variables. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Official Tanzanian poverty statistics are, however, based on a methodology which presumes equal sharing per equivalent adult within the household. This paper combines subjective and objective micro-data from Tanzania's 2007 Household Budget Survey and 2007 Views of the People Survey. By imputing individual consumption based on the relative probability of self-reported food deprivation, it provides an example of the possible importance of one type of intra-household inequality-i.e., the hunger of old women-for poverty measurement. Implications include the complexity of gendered intra-household inequality and the importance of technical poverty measurement choices for public policy priorities, such as old age pensions.","[Osberg, Lars] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Osberg, L (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 3J5, Canada.",lars.osberg@dal.ca,,"Osberg, Lars/0000-0001-9643-9269",,,,,28,3,4,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0034-6586,1475-4991,,REV INCOME WEALTH,Rev.

The theoretical approach applied is based on the balance-of-payments constraint hypothesis (known as Thirlwall's law), adapted to include internal and external imbalances. Our empirical analysis shows that both the extended model and the original Thirlwall's law over-predict the actual growth in Italy, suggesting that there are supply constraints that impede the economy from growing faster. Another conclusion is that part of the decline in economic growth is explained by the loss of competiveness during the euro period. A scenario analysis shows that a budget deficit and public debt discipline aiming at achieving the goals of the Stability Pact are not significant stimuli for faster growth. On the other hand, reducing the import dependence of the components of demand, or reducing the import and increasing the export shares in the economy, are the most effective policies for fostering growth in Italy.","[Soukiazis, Elias] Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal",Universidade de Coimbra,"Soukiazis, E (通讯作者)，Univ Coimbra, Fac Econ, P-3000 Coimbra, Portugal.",,"Antunes, Micaela/GQZ-8240-2022; Antunes, Micaela/AAD-8220-2020; Cerqueira, Pedro/K-6899-2019","Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Antunes, Micaela/0000-0002-2113-2139; Cerqueira, Pedro/0000-0002-3155-188X",FCT [SFRH/BSAB/1340/2013]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [SFRH/BSAB/1340/2013] Funding Source: FCT,FCT(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"This paper was written while Pedro Cerqueira was a visiting scholar at the Economics Department of The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, receiving financial support from the FCT grant #SFRH/BSAB/1340/2013.",,34,2,2,0,18,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

By contrast, if players are free to quit a repeated Prisoner's Dilemma without information flow to new partners, cooperation from the outset of new partnerships cannot be a part of any symmetric equilibrium. Fujiwara-Greve and Okuno-Fujiwara (Rev Econ Stud 76:993-1021, 2009) showed that symmetric trust-building strategies can constitute an equilibrium for sufficiently long initial (D, D) (trust-building) periods. However, trust-building periods create social loss of payoffs, and there is a possibility that an asymmetric equilibrium with some players cooperating immediately, while others defect, may be more efficient. We show that there is a fundamentally asymmetric locally stable Nash equilibrium consisting of the most cooperative strategy (C-trigger with ending the partnership when betrayed) and the most noncooperative strategy, which plays D and ends the partnership immediately. When the deviation gain is relatively small, the fundamentally asymmetric equilibrium is neutrally stable against equilibrium entrants within trust-building strategies and is more efficient than any Nash equilibrium consisting of non-degenerate trust-building strategies. Our result indicates that behavioral diversity can be stable and beneficial for the society, even if players are free to escape from personalized punishments.","[Fujiwara-Greve, Takako] Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1088345, Japan; [Okuno-Fujiwara, Masahiro] Musashino Univ, Dept Econ, Koto Ku, Tokyo 1350063, Japan; [Suzuki, Nobue] Komazawa Univ, Fac Econ, Setagaya Ku, Tokyo 1548525, Japan",Keio University,"Fujiwara-Greve, T (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Dept Econ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",takakofg@econ.keio.ac.jp; okuno.fujiwara@gmail.com; nsuzuki@komazawa-u.ac.jp,,,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [21530171]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15K00473, 24530361, 21530171] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","We are grateful to an anonymous co-editor and a referee for valuable comments.

Bidders' utility functions belong to the class of constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) or constant absolute risk aversion (CARA). The bidders' types are independent across bidders, while a bidder's private value, initial wealth and degree of risk aversion are allowed to be correlated. We show that a monotone equilibrium always exists in a general setting allowing for asymmetric bidders. Moreover, with symmetric bidders, a symmetric monotone equilibrium strategy must exist. A bidder's equilibrium strategy increases with bidders' private values and degrees of risk aversion.

The high volatility of the dynamics of diversification observed in Vietnam suggests the hypothesis that firms decide to enter into new industries following a trial and error process, initiated by boundedly rational herding behaviors, i.e., firms follow the most commonly observed business combinations. Using a survivor-based (SB) measure of relatedness, we test the hypothesis of boundedly rational behavior. We find that both the probability of exit and the different performance measures (Return on sales and Total factor productivity) are not or are negatively correlated with SB-related diversification. This is in contrast to what has been observed in developed countries. However, using the SIC distance approach, we obtain the expected positive relationship between performance and relatedness in diversified firms. The conflicting result between these two relatedness indices therefore suggests there has been a trend in follow-up among inexperienced firms that imitate the direction and intensity of the diversification of dominating players within the industry (herd behavior). However, diversified firms gain experience over time and choose more efficient business combinations in subsequent entries. When we use the classical SIC-based approach, we find that greater diversification raises profitability, but only to an optimum relatedness point, beyond which the positive effect fades away. To control for the endogeneity of diversification relatedness and the serial correlation in error terms, we adopt an instrumental-variable two-stage least-squares estimation approach (IV-2SLS) with GMM treatment.","[Hien Thu Tran] RMIT Int Univ, Hochiminh City, Vietnam; [Santarelli, Enrico] Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, I-40126 Bologna, Italy; [Zaninotto, Enrico] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Bologna; University of Trento,"Santarelli, E (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, Dept Econ, Piazza Scaravilli 2, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",hien.tran@rmit.edu.vn; enrico.santarelli@unibo.it; enrico.zaninotto@unitn.it,"Tran, Hien/HTM-2982-2023; Zaninotto, Enrico/HME-0987-2023","Tran, Hien/0000-0002-1399-9146; SANTARELLI, ENRICO/0000-0001-8986-2755",,,,,70,4,6,2,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We identify a sentiment shock that drives the movements of bubbles and is transmitted to the real economy through endogenous credit constraints. This shock explains most of the stock market fluctuations and sizable fractions of the variations in real quantities. It generates the comovement between stock prices and the real economy, and is the dominant force behind the internet bubbles and the Great Recession.","[Miao, Jianjun] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [Miao, Jianjun] Jinan Univ, Inst Ind Econ, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Miao, Jianjun] Zhejiang Univ, AFR, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Pengfei] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Xu, Zhiwei] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Boston University; Jinan University; Zhejiang University; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Miao, JJ (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",miaoj@bu.edu; pfwang@ust.hk; xuzhiwei09@gmail.com,"Xu, Zhiwei/HOF-1321-2023; Wang, Pengfei/X-2272-2019","Xu, Zhiwei/0000-0002-6591-4183; Wang, Pengfei/0000-0002-8686-4787",Hong Kong Research Grant Council [645811]; NSFC [71403166],Hong Kong Research Grant Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council); NSFC(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"We are grateful to the editor and two anonymous referees for constructive and insightful comments.

Finding a subpopulation with less acute differences in unobserved characteristics would allow this concern to be addressed. This paper shows that gays and lesbians are one such interesting groupfor the intra-household division of labor and its effects on market productivity cannot be sex-determined in this subpopulation. Indeed, there are substantial intra-household variations in labor market outcomes and other characteristics; the patterns and magnitudes are similar to different-sex households. Simultaneously, the gender wage gap between gays and lesbians is much smaller than in the heterosexual population; in specifications that control for geographic location it is near zero. These findings suggest that the intra-household division of labor is an important factor driving gender differences in labor market outcomes. Such an interpretation is consistent with recent studies that control for productivity.","Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business,"Montag, J (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Econ, Nam W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",josef.montag@gmail.com,"Montag, Josef/AAC-4168-2019; Montag, Josef/AAM-4975-2020","Montag, Josef/0000-0001-5175-2083; Montag, Josef/0000-0001-5175-2083",University of Turin; Cornell University; Czech Science Foundation; CERGE-EI; Masaryk University; Mendel University,University of Turin; Cornell University; Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); CERGE-EI; Masaryk University; Mendel University,"For valuable discussions and helpful comments I would like to thank Daniele Bondonio, Jan Broulik, Dusan Drabik, Libor Dusek, Jaroslav Krivanek, Peter Huber, Peter Mantel, Alfredo Paloyo, Giovanni Ramello, Gregor von Schweinitz, participants at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Law and Economics Association at Stanford University, the 2010 Workshop on Perspectives on (Un-) Employment at the Institute for Employment Research, Nuremberg, and participants in seminars at the Rheinisch-Westfalisches Institut fur Wirtschaftsforschung, Essen, the Czech Economic Society, Brno, the University of Economics, Prague, and Tilburg University.

Affiliate divestiture is the result of many factors, some internal and some external to the firm. Using detailed confidential survey data of Swedish multinationals, we are able to examine divestiture decisions within the context of the world-wide affiliate network of the firm. In contrast, most existing studies of multinational exit focus on one country only. A model of mergers and acquisitions with financing constraints generates predictions regarding the correlation between affiliate size and the decision to sell. Consistent with this theory, we find that larger affiliates are more likely to be divested, but an increase in relative size of an affiliate reduces the probability of divestiture. Additional network characteristics, the presence of other affiliates nearby and sales of affiliates elsewhere, are also positively correlated with divestiture. We find no support for the notion of footloose multinationals.","[Tekin-Koru, Ayca] TED Univ, Dept Business Adm, Ankara, Turkey; [Norback, Pehr-Johan] Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, SE-11485 Stockholm, Sweden; [Waldkirch, Andreas] Colby Coll, Dept Econ, Waterville, ME 04901 USA",Ted University; Research Institute of Industrial Economics (IFN); Colby College,"Norbäck, PJ (通讯作者)，Res Inst Ind Econ IFN, POB 5501, SE-11485 Stockholm, Sweden.",ayca.tekinkoru@tedu.edu.tr,"Tekin-Koru, Ayça/U-7590-2019; Tekin-Koru, Ayça/I-5210-2018","Tekin-Koru, Ayça/0000-0002-0817-9055;",,,,,59,14,14,0,34,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

The covariance is measured through the novel use of rolling windows of the realized covariance (both forward and backward looking) and testing is conducted with the cointegrated VAR. The model is able to account for expected returns with more plausible degrees of risk aversion, but only when using sufficiently long, backward-looking measures of the covariance. This suggests that market participants assess risk, in part, based upon the pro-cyclicality of returns, and infer it from experience in the recent past. There is also evidence that inclusion of the real exchange rate improves the plausibility of the estimates and the model fit.","[Stillwagon, Josh R.] Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06106 USA; [Stillwagon, Josh R.] Univ Copenhagen, INET Ctr Imperfect Knowledge Econ, DK-1168 Copenhagen, Denmark",Trinity College; University of Copenhagen,"Stillwagon, JR (通讯作者)，Trinity Coll, Dept Econ, Hartford, CT 06106 USA.",Joshua.Stillwagon@trincoll.edu,,,,,,,39,4,4,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0965-7576,1467-9396,,REV INT ECON,Rev.

We study this problem with the aid of a dynamic general equilibrium model driven by analytics of endogenous growth and investigate the viable policy options and assess the interactions between knowledge driven growth, acquisition of human capital, and the role of strategic public policy for the Canadian economy. We study alternative public policies aimed at fostering the development of human capital (investment in education) and those at enhancing investments in innovation. Based on the re-allocation effects triggered by public subsidization policies on higher education versus industry/business R&D, our results corroborate that Canadian economy is falling short of its potential in (business) technological innovation. Our analyses further imply that the most welfare enhancing policy is to have a complementary mix of education and R&D subsidization designed to avoid the trade-offs that emerge in the short run.

First, firm size matters in both decisions on exporting and on using FTA schemes. In particular, firm size is more quantitatively important in decisions on FTA use than on exporting. Second, firms with experience in utilizing FTAs for exporting have an approximately 40% higher probability of using an FTA for exporting to a new country.

We measure managerial practices using the World Management Survey, a methodology that enables us to construct robust measures of management quality comparable across countries. We find substantial heterogeneity in managerial practices across six industrialized countries, with more centralized systems (Italy and Germany) lagging behind the more autonomous systems (Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom, and United States). For Italy, we are able to match organizational practices at the school level with student outcomes in a math-standardized test. We find that managerial practices are positively related to student outcomes. The estimates imply that if Italy had the same managerial practices as the United Kingdom (the best performer), it would close the gap in the math OECD PISA test with respect to the OECD average. We argue that our results are robust to selection issues and show that they are confirmed by a set of IV estimates and by a large number of robustness checks. Overall, our results suggest that policies directed at improving student cognitive achievements should take into account principals selection and training in terms of managerial capabilities.","[Di Liberto, Adriana] Univ Cagliari, IZA, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy; CRENoS, New Lexington, OH USA; Bocconi, IGIER, EIEF, Milan, Italy; CEPR, London, England",University of Cagliari; Bocconi University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Di Liberto, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cagliari, IZA, I-09124 Cagliari, Italy.",,"Sulis, Giovanni/AAE-3758-2022","Sulis, Giovanni/0000-0003-2970-4725; SCHIVARDI, FABIANO/0000-0001-7708-1011",Regione Sardegna [CUP F71J09000300002]; Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli,Regione Sardegna(Regione Sardegna); Fondazione Giovanni Agnelli,"We thank Daniele Checchi, Gianfranco De Simone, Andrea Gavosto, Erik Hanushek, Victor Lavy, Angelo Paletta, Paolo Sestito, Marco Sideri, John Van Reenen and seminar participants at the University of Cagliari, University of Padova, the 2013 AIEL Conference (Rome), the 2013 Brucchi Luchino Conference (Rome), the 2014 RES Conference (Manchester), the 2014 ESPE Conference (Braga) and the 10 Years of the World Management Survey Conference (Cambridge, MA) for very useful comments and discussions.

We apply a difference-indifferences strategy on exhaustive French fiscal data that provide information on gross income as well as on the use of paid childcare services between 2005 and 2008. We use the fact that the new policy results in a significant increase in the use of paid childcare services.

With this aim, instructions are slightly modified to imprint one of the two incentive features present in a standard Bertrand duopoly: the winning rule (competition) and the winner's payoffs (cooperation). Therefore, under a between subject design, we examine pricing behaviour in three treatments: a Competition Priming treatment, a Payoff Priming treatment and a non-priming Baseline. Taking the Baseline as benchmark, the results show that whereas priming for competition reduces significantly market prices from the beginning, priming for payoffs holds market prices at a significantly high level for a longer period.

Such an elimination would also eliminate the intragenerational redistribution done by the following policies of social security. Due to spousal and survivor's benefit provisions, US Social Security system redistributes (mostly) to single-earner married households. Since retirement benefits are a concave function of past mean earnings, the system redistributes from high earners to low earners. Finally, existence of a cap on social security taxable earnings makes the system regressive. This paper quantifies redistributive, labor supply, and welfare implications of these policies using a general equilibrium life-cycle model. Agents start out as permanently married or single and with education levels and wage profiles, where the latter depend both on education and gender. The household is the decision maker and decides on labor supply of its member(s) and saving. Elimination of these policies results in a 5.5% rise in labor force participation of married females, while increasing aggregate welfare by 0.4%. A majority of households experience positive gains in welfare. Single-earner married households incur large welfare losses (as big as 1.1%), whereas two-earner households with high skilled spouses experience substantial welfare gains (as big as 1.9%).

Two political parties can commit in advance to policy platforms, but not to a maximum level of rent extraction. In the case without uncertainty, the electorate can limit rents to the same extent as in a purely backward-looking model of accountability, and the policy preferred by the voter who represents the median preferences of the electorate is implemented. In the case with uncertainty about the bliss point of the representative voter, the electorate has to accept higher rent seeking by the incumbent politician, but nonetheless retains some control over rent extraction. The policy positions of the two competing parties do not converge as they do in the case without uncertainty.

This model, predicting that marginal productivity of capital is equal in all countries, gives an answer to the capital allocation puzzle (Lucas, 1990). Another prediction of the model is that skilled labor productivity is greater in developed countries than in the underdeveloped countries, providing an important factor in explaining skilled labor migration towards rich countries. It also explains how a country with agents who experience no asymmetries of information, no irrational behaviour, and no credit constraints, could be trapped in a low fixed points where only small amounts of capital are invested, low wages are paid, productivity of skilled workers is low, and most of the labor force is unskilled.","FLACSO, Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Quito, Ecuador",,"Pérez-Oviedo, W (通讯作者)，FLACSO, Fac Latinoamer Ciencias Sociales, Quito, Ecuador.",wperez@flacso.edu.ec,"Perez, Wilson/GVU-2063-2022",,,,,,34,0,0,0,3,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In the advocacy treatments, voters can organize themselves into advocacy groups in order to reveal their policy preferences. We find that voters often overcome the collective action problem of forming an advocacy group. In fact, we observe the formation of both informative advocacy groups, which convey new information, and uninformative advocacy groups, which do not.

Estimates rely on detailed health measures that not only are more homogeneous than commonly-used self-reported health measures, but they also can be interpreted as plausibly exogenous with respect to labour supply. Further, this paper investigates the unique role that certain fringe benefits, namely health insurance and paid sick leave, play in the link between health shocks and subsequent employment activity. Results show that, compared to commonly-used self-reported measures of health, health problems defined by the US government as priority' conditions correlate with smaller labour supply shifts, but non-work-related injuries lead to larger shifts. Second, the arrival of a health shock appears to reduce the probability of remaining employed full time, while also increasing the likelihood of quitting work. Relatively few full-time workers who acquire health problems switch to part-time employment. Third, in the event of a health shock, sick leave appears to facilitate reductions in employment activities, while employer-provided insurance appears to hinder such adjustments.","[Zimmer, David M.] Western Kertucky Univ, Dept Econ, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA",,"Zimmer, DM (通讯作者)，Western Kertucky Univ, Dept Econ, Grise Hall 426, Bowling Green, KY 42101 USA.",david.zimmer@wku.edu,,,,,,,35,4,5,0,22,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

Using state-of-the-art bootstrap correlation testing and a data set of teams for the German soccer league (Bundesliga), we find evidence that even though this new game-theoretical approach has no significant correlation to a large number of performance measures, it is significantly related to some of the most important measures typically used in academic research (e.g. the player scores published by sports magazines and the number of played matches). These results indicate that the theoretically appealing new measure can be considered an interesting variable in pay-performance regressions and should be used accordingly in future research.","[Auer, Benjamin R.] Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany; [Hiller, Tobias] Univ Leipzig, Dept Microecon, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany",Leipzig University; Leipzig University,"Auer, BR (通讯作者)，Univ Leipzig, Dept Finance, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany.",auer@wifa.uni-leipzig.de,,,,,,,31,9,9,0,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

We use a difference-in-differences identification strategy, measuring the changes over time in these outcomes following the combat loss of a medic or doctor and comparing it to the changes following the combat loss of a soldier who is not a medic or doctor. We find that overall unit deaths decrease in the five or ten days following the deaths of medical personnel in Vietnam, Korea, and the Pacific theater in World War II (WWII). In contrast, the WWII European and North African results indicate that overall unit deaths rise following medical personnel deaths. We find no relationship between medical personnel deaths and other unit deaths in Iraq and Afghanistan. For Korea and the Pacific theater of WWII, our estimates suggest unit commendation medals decrease following the deaths of medical personnel. This pattern of evidence is consistent with a model in which units often halted aggressive tactical maneuvers and reduced pursuit of their military objectives until deceased medical personnel were replaced.

First, we find that the product market reform induced by the large-scale internal market reform of the European Union in 1992 enhanced, on average, innovative investments in manufacturing industries of countries with strong patent rights since the pre-sample period, but not so in industries of countries with weaker patent rights. Second, the positive response to the product market reform is more pronounced in industries where, in general, innovators tend to value patent protection higher than in other industries, except for the manufacture of electrical and optical equipment. The observed complementarity between competition and patent protection can be rationalized using a Schumpeterian growth model with step-by-step innovation. In such a model, better patent protection prolongs the period over which a firm that successfully escapes competition by innovating, actually enjoys higher monopoly rents from its technological upgrade.","[Aghion, Philippe] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Howitt, Peter] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; [Prantl, Susanne] Univ Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany",Harvard University; Brown University; University of Cologne,"Aghion, P (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",paghion@fas.harvard.edu; peter_howitt@brown.edu; prantl@wiso.uni-koeln.de,"Prantl, Susanne/GWC-7361-2022","AGHION, Philippe/0000-0002-9019-1677",,,,,66,63,70,10,98,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1381-4338,1573-7020,,J ECON GROWTH,J.

Nationally representative household level survey data are combined with historical climate variability information at the Upazila level. Flood prone Upazilas are distinguished from non-flood prone Upazilas, since the latter may be susceptible to higher risks from local rainfall variability. Adult members of the same household are found to be less likely than the household head to be self-employed in agriculture in areas with high local rainfall variability. Moreover, it is shown that occupational diversification comes at a cost in terms of lower household-level welfare (consumption). The effects of three policy actions, such as access to credits, safety net, and markets are considered. Access to market appears to be more effective in reducing the likelihood of costly within household occupational diversification as an ex ante climate risk reducing strategy as compared to access to credit and safety nets.","[Bandyopadhyay, Sushenjit; Skoufias, Emmanuel] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank,"Skoufias, E (通讯作者)，World Bank, Mail Stop MC4-415,1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",eskoufias@worldbank.org,,,,,,,16,19,22,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",1569-5239,1573-7152,,REV ECON HOUSEHOLD,Rev.

The analysis uncovers the objectives of public and private enterprises and estimates labor adjustment costs by ownership. Public plants maximize the discounted present value of profits without a soft budget constraint. There is strong evidence of quadratic and linear firing costs at the plant level. The higher quadratic adjustment costs of the public plants may reflect their internalization of social costs of employment adjustment. Domestic private plants and collective plants have about the same discount factor, much lower than state-controlled plants.","[Cooper, Russell] Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Gong, Guan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Key Lab Math Econ SUFE, Minist Educ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Yan, Ping] Peking Univ, Natl Sch Dev, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics; Peking University,"Cooper, R (通讯作者)，Penn State Univ, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",russellcoop@gmail.com; ggong@mail.shufe.edu.cn; pyan@nsd.pku.edu.cn,"sun, huan/JEO-7152-2023; sun, huan/IUN-8843-2023",,"National Science Foundation [0819682]; National Science Foundation of China [70903004, 71273001, 71273162, 71110107025]; Department of Social Science of Peking University; PCSIRT [IRT13077]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0819682] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); National Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Department of Social Science of Peking University; PCSIRT(Program for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Comments from the Editor, Chad Syverson, and referees are much appreciated.

Both team members are identically productive and can contribute to both tasks. By moving first, the team leader effectively determines the division of the tasks in the team. We show that the existence of multiple but finitely many types of task divisions is associated with a non-convex leader's budget constraint. Non-convexity generates discontinuities and non-monotonicities in the equilibrium provision of the good and also in the follower's utility if incomes are redistributed within the team. Non-monotonicity of the follower's utility motivates the follower to give a cash transfer to the leader. Having received the cash transfer, the leader adopts a task division that compensates the contributions of the follower. Hence, we observe a non-cooperative gift exchange with a monetary gift to the leader and a subsequent non-monetary reward to the follower through a lighter task allocation. These gift exchanges disappear in the presence of infinitely many types of task divisions generated by a continuum of complementary tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The strategies tested are based on mean-reverting calendar spread portfolios established with dynamic hedge ratios. Entry and exit signals are generated by so-called Bollinger Bands. The trading system is applied to twenty-two years of historical data from 1992 to 2013 for various specifications, taking transaction costs into account. The significance of the results is evaluated with a bootstrap test in which randomly generated orders are compared to orders placed by the trading system. Whereas we find most combinations involving the front-month and second-month futures to be significantly profitable for all commodities tested, the best results for the risk-adjusted Sharpe Ratio are obtained for WTI Crude Oil and Natural Gas, with Sharpe Ratios in excess of 2 for most combinations and a rather smooth performance for all calendar spreads.

Kalecki's insight into the generation of free cash (cash in excess of new investment) was formulated at a time when consumer deficit spending and other private deficit spending was minuscule. But it can be shown that his insight can be extended not just to an expansion of public deficits but to private deficits as well. Over the past forty years, the rise of free cash and expanded deficits have allowed corporations to cut back on investment growth, funneling the excess cash into mergers, stock buybacks, and expanded dividends to the wealthy. In recent years, this outpouring of cash has accounted for well over fifty percent of corporate fixed investment. I run a simple what if exercise on U.S. corporate tax flows utilizing past U.S. tax rates to calculate the possible absorption of free cash and reduction of federal debt that would have been associated with such an exercise.","Menlo Coll, Econ, Atherton, CA 94027 USA",,"Medlen, C (通讯作者)，Menlo Coll, Econ, Atherton, CA 94027 USA.",,,,,,,,28,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Since its independence in 1829, the Greek government has defaulted four times on its external creditors with striking historical parallels. Each crisis is preceded by a period of heavy borrowing from foreign private creditors. As repayment difficulties arise, foreign governments step in, help to repay the private creditors, and demand budget cuts and adjustment programs as a condition for the official bailout loans; political interference from abroad mounts, and a prolonged episode of debt overhang and financial autarky follows. We conclude that these cycles of external debt and dependence are a perennial theme of Greek history, as well as in other countries that have been addicted to foreign savings. At present, there is considerable evidence to suggest that a substantial haircut on external debt is needed to restore the economic viability of Greece. Even with that, a policy priority for the country should be to reorient, to the extent possible, toward domestic sources of funding.","[Reinhart, Carmen M.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Trebesch, Christoph] Univ Munich, D-81377 Munich, Germany",Harvard University; University of Munich,"Reinhart, CM (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,,,,,,,26,18,19,0,9,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

Among these, Maximized Monte Carlo (MMC) tests or asymptotically valid MMC (AMMC) tests are becoming popular. The MMC type tests have certain advantages as well as disadvantages. This paper introduces a simple way to obtain Approximate Non-Similar (ANS) critical values using a global optimizer called Simulated Annealing (SA). All three methods are applied in the dynamic linear regression model context. As expected the AMMC approach is certainly less time consuming than the MMC approach. Overall the AMMC approach seems best in terms of power properties; however the ANS approach takes negligible time compared to its competitors. Though the ANS approach controls the sizes well it can be slightly less powerful than its competitors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, groups decide differently than individuals, as they rely significantly less on useless outside advice from experts and choose the risk-free option less frequently. Furthermore we document gender differences in investment behavior: groups of two female subjects choose the risk-free investment more often and are marginally more prone to the hot hand fallacy than groups of two male subjects.

Such cycles are observed in (US) data. Similarly, counter-clockwise cycles exist between utilization rate and labor share, and utilization rate and employment rate. This paper presents a critical discussion of two demand-driven frameworks to explain these cycles, namely a Goodwin-Kaldor model and a Goodwin-Kalecki model. The two models share important features. The main difference lies in the approach to the determination of the distribution of income. We argue that the Goodwin-Kalecki model's 'profit squeeze' is the preferable approach.","[von Arnim, Rudiger] Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Barrales, Jose] Univ Utah, Salt Lake City, UT USA; [Barrales, Jose] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion, Concepcion, Chile",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion,"von Arnim, R (通讯作者)，Univ Utah, Dept Econ, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,"Barrales-Ruiz, Jose/Q-2911-2017","Barrales-Ruiz, Jose/0000-0002-6604-2559",,,,,58,37,39,2,12,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

As an illustration, we calibrate the model using sovereign bond and CDS holdings data for 65 major European banks. The model simulation shows that, in case of a sovereign credit event, banks' losses due to direct and correlated bond exposures are significantly larger than losses due to CDS exposures. The main risk for CDS sellers is found to be sudden increases in collateral requirements on multiple correlated CDS exposures. Close-out netting considerably reduces the extent to which contagion may occur. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Tight collateral constraint limits the borrowing capacity of households and drives the equilibrium interest rate level down to the housing price growth rate, which makes housing attractive as a store of value for investors. A housing bubble arises in an equilibrium in which investors hold houses for resale purposes only and without the expectation of receiving a dividend either in terms of utility or in terms of rent. Pension reform that reduces the contribution rate may increase the supply of credit and create the housing bubble.

Otherwise firms can take advantage of workers' immobility and extract rents at their expense. In cultures with strong family ties, moving away from home is costly. Thus, to limit the rents of firms and to avoid moving, individuals with strong family ties rationally choose regulated labor markets, even though regulation generates higher unemployment and lower incomes. Empirically, we find that individuals who inherit stronger family ties are less mobile, have lower wages and higher unemployment, and support more stringent labor market regulations. We find a positive association between labor market rigidities at the beginning of the 21st century and family values prevailing before World War II, and between family structures in the Middle Ages and current desire for labor market regulation.

Our results suggest that wealth inequality has a negative relationship with economic growth, but when we control for the fact that some billionaires acquired wealth through political connections, the relationship between politically connected wealth inequality and economic growth is negative, while politically unconnected wealth inequality, income inequality, and initial poverty have no significant relationship.

Inflation targeting monetary strategy has been pointed as a potential source of the crisis, as its main objective of inflation stabilization might have diverted central banks from financial stability. We consider the case of European Central Bank (ECB) inflation targeting monetary policy since its inception in order to provide evidence of possible changes in its implementation after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 15, 2008. To this end we take into consideration the existence of nonlinearities that may be present in the estimated Taylor rule specification. we contribute to the recent line of research by estimating Taylor rule models with endogenous structural breaks as well as a Markov-Switching VAR model with endogenous coefficients using quarterly data for the ECB for the period 2001:Q1 to 2013:Q4. The main findings of our analysis show that there is a structural break in the implementation of the monetary policy of ECB during the peak of the financial crisis. Furthermore, we show that the ECB monetary policy followed the Taylor principle during the period before the crisis but did not follow the Taylor rule in the post-crisis period. During the post-crisis the ECB acted less inertially, putting a smaller weight on the inflation gap and shifted its focus on output gap to some extent. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Such preference reversals are commonly interpreted as contradicting constant discounting. This interpretation is correct only if baseline consumption to which the outcomes are added, remains constant over time. The difficulty with measuring discounting when baseline consumption changes over time, is that delaying an outcome has two effects: (1) due to the change in baseline consumption, it changes the utility from receiving the outcome, and (2) it changes the factor by which this utility is discounted. In this paper we propose a way to disentangle the two effects, which allows us to draw conclusions about discounting even when baseline consumption changes over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present a model in which such banks cut dollar lending more than euro lending in response to a shock to their credit quality. Because these banks rely on wholesale dollar funding, while raising more of their euro funding through insured retail deposits, the shock leads to a greater withdrawal of dollar funding. Banks can borrow in euros and swap into dollars to make up for the dollar shortfall, but this may lead to violations of covered interest parity when there is limited capital to take the other side of the swap trade. In this case, synthetic dollar borrowing also becomes expensive, which causes cuts in dollar lending. We test the model in the context of the Eurozone sovereign crisis, which escalated in the second half of 2011 and resulted in U.S. money market funds sharply reducing their exposure to European banks in the year that followed. During this period dollar lending by Eurozone banks fell relative to their euro lending, and firms who were more reliant on Eurozone banks before the Eurozone crisis had a more difficult time borrowing.","[Ivashina, Victoria; Scharfstein, David S.; Stein, Jeremy C.] Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Ivashina, Victoria; Scharfstein, David S.; Stein, Jeremy C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Harvard University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Ivashina, V (通讯作者)，Harvard Univ, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",,"Stein, Jeremy/AAA-4003-2019",,Division of Research at Harvard Business School,Division of Research at Harvard Business School,"We are grateful for helpful comments from Stephen Blyth, Martin Oehmke, Michael Palumbo, and from seminar participants at the fourth Paris Spring Corporate Finance Conference, the Banque de France/OSEO Conference, Columbia Business School, the European Finance Association Annual Meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Conference on Bank Structure and Competition, the NBER Corporate Finance Meeting, Northwestern University (Kellogg), Stockholm School of Economics, and the World Bank.

A Causal Analysis of the Effects of Economic Promotion with Establishment Panel Data,KYKLOS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"This study aimed to analyse the impact of public economic promotion on the performance of establishments. Using data from the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) establishment panel from 1996 through 2009, we studied the effect of public funding on a number of indicators that provide insight into the topic. For this purpose, conditional difference-in-differences estimators were derived using a propensity score matching approach. Supported establishments were found to invest more and request more labour when the amount of public funding is considered. However, on average, establishments that have a history of previous investments also have a higher probability to receive funding than other entities. On the other hand, the evidence suggests that funded establishments reduce their investments shortly before funding. This could point to changes in the behaviour of the establishments, because of the expected economic promotion. Also, it seems that the results are permanent, when the analysis is conducted with natural values instead of logarithms. Other effects of economic promotion in Germany include increases in employment, value added and productivity.","HWR Berlin Sch Econ & Law, D-10315 Berlin, Germany",Berlin School of Economics & Law,"Kölling, A (通讯作者)，HWR Berlin Sch Econ & Law, Alt Friedrichsfelde 60, D-10315 Berlin, Germany.",arnd.koelling@hwr-berlin.de,,,,,,,31,6,7,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0023-5962,1467-6435,,KYKLOS,Kyklos,AUG,2015,68,3,,,,,385,411,,10.1111/kykl.12088,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN8JD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358685600005,0

A multi-prize contest model must provide each player's probabilities of winning each prize as functions of all players' efforts. We find that the key notion of hypothetical subcontests in the contest axiomatization literature initiated by Skaperdas (1996) can be appropriately interpreted and precisely defined from a ranking perspective, as well as the relevant axioms of Subcontest Consistency and Independence of Irrelevant Contestants (IIC). When there are less than four contestants (exclusive), a set of axioms properly adapted from those in Skaperdas (1996) and Clark and Riis (1998a) are sufficient and necessary for axiomatizing the widely adopted multi-prize nested lottery contest of Clark and Riis (1996a).

Despite being an increasingly common policy measure that is relatively easy to implement, little empirical evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of such programmes. Based on a study design that randomly assigns treatment eligibility across economics classes, we find that those who were reported for Early Intervention received final grades that were on average almost 4.3% higher than those who were not. The estimated effect of the programme on grade improvement, however, is smaller and not statistically significant. Some evidence exists for heterogeneous treatment effects, most notably the higher estimated effect for students in introductory classes.","[Campbell, Douglas; Hussey, Andrew] Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38104 USA",University of Memphis,"Hussey, A (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Memphis, TN 38104 USA.",ajhussey@memphis.edu,,,,,,,2,2,4,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Depending upon the interaction of these effects, various convergent and divergent South-North growth paths occur: for example, full or partial convergence of the Southern technology level to the Northern one, conditional convergence or divergence depending upon the Southern initial technology level and absorptive capacity, higher or lower as well as decreasing or increasing growth rates during the phase of catching up, and equal or higher growth rates of the South compared to the North after catching up. This set of growth paths can better explain the diversity of the empirical observations for economies at different income and technology levels than those generated by existing models. In this new model, convergence based on North-South trade and associated flows of patents (innovations) is guaranteed if the knowledge effect dominates the productivity effect. A larger Southern market expands the area of convergence and can prevent divergence. Not only a larger Southern market, but also a higher Southern steady state growth rate benefit the North so that convergence is desirable for both, the South and the North.","[Huebler, Michael] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; [Huebler, Michael] Ctr European Econ Res, Environm & Resource Econ, Mannheim, Germany; [Huebler, Michael] Potsdam Inst Climate Impact Res, Sustainable Solut, Potsdam, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW); Potsdam Institut fur Klimafolgenforschung,"Hübler, M (通讯作者)，Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Environm Econ & World Trade, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",huebler@iuw.uni-hannover.de,,,,,,,33,3,3,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Serge-Christophe Kolm presents the Equal-Labour Income Equalization (ELIE) model very explicitly and repeatedly as breaking with the still dominant tradition of welfarism. This paper explores the meaning of this distancing from welfarism found in the ELIE model. After having provided conceptual clarifications concerning both ELIE and welfarism, we discuss various opposing aspects of this model of income redistribution to welfarism. We show that the refusal of welfarism by the ELIE model does not depend mainly on its axiomatic features, but on its deontological perspective.","[Gharbi, Jean-Sebastien] Univ Reims Champagne Ardennes, REGARDS, Reims, France; [Gharbi, Jean-Sebastien] Univ Zurich, GERECO, Zurich, Switzerland; [Meinard, Yves] Univ Zurich, Inst Evolut Biol & Umweltwissensch, Zurich, Switzerland",Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne; University of Zurich; University of Zurich,"Gharbi, JS (通讯作者)，Univ Reims Champagne Ardennes, REGARDS, Reims, France.",jsgharbi@gmail.com; yves.meinard@gmail.com,,"Meinard, yves/0000-0001-5928-8959",A*MIDEX project [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; 'Investissements d'Avenir' French Government program,A*MIDEX project(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); 'Investissements d'Avenir' French Government program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"This work has been carried out thanks to the support of the A*MIDEX project (ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02) funded by the Investissements dAvenir French Government program, managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR).",,37,0,0,0,2,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-178X,1469-9427,,J ECON METHODOL,J.

The results indicate a unidirectional causality from stock prices to exchange rates in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand and from exchange rates to stock prices in Indonesia.

In the case of the upper-middle-income countries, financial crises inflict a negative and statistically significant impact on short-run growth but only a marginally significant effect on long-run growth, while for lower-income countries they only have a short-run influence.

The most popular explanation for such a pattern is the hypothesis of task-biased technological change, where technological progress reduces the demand for routine middle-wage jobs but increases the demand for non-routine jobs located at the tails of the job-wage distribution. However, our estimates do not support this explanation for the 1970s and 1980s. Stronger evidence for task-biased technological change, albeit not conclusive, is found for the 1990s and 2000s. In particular, there is both a statistically and economically significant growth of non-routine jobs and a decline of routine jobs. However, results for wages are mixed; while task-biased technological change cannot explain changes in between-occupation wage differentials, it does have considerable explanatory power for changes in within-occupation wage differentials.","[Adermon, Adrian; Gustavsson, Magnus] Uppsala Univ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Adermon, A (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",adrian.adermon@nek.uu.se; magnus.gustavsson@nek.uu.se,"Adermon, Adrian/H-4646-2019","Adermon, Adrian/0000-0002-7062-4308",Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research,Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)),"We are grateful to Per-Anders Edin, Maarten Goos, Nils Gottfries, Mikael Lindahl, Martin Nybom, to three anonymous referees, and to seminar participants at Uppsala University, the 2010 UCLS workshop, and the 2011 National Conference of Swedish Economists for useful comments.

We find that the accumulation and dynamic of noncore funding differ significantly between subsidiaries in EU vs. non-EU host countries. While the direct impact of home monetary policy is to a certain extent limited it is amplified through several channels. The most potent among them are the characteristics of the parent bank: capitalization, liquidity, loan growth aggressiveness, provisioning policies and its relative size vis-A -vis a subsidiary. Regulation has only marginal effects and seems to be more potent for the subsidiaries operating in the EU countries. At the same time, host bank regulation seems neutral to the dynamics of the noncore funding and risk build-up on the liability side of the subsidiaries operating under those regimes.","[Babin, Adrian] Charles Univ Prague, Frankfurt, Germany; [Babin, Adrian] European Cent Bank, Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"Babin, A (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Frankfurt, Germany.",adibabin@yahoo.com,,,,,,,36,1,1,0,5,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.
