In recent years there has been growing interest about design concepts that seek for solutions that are more eco-effective and develop systems that have more positive output rather than less negative impact. Moreover, design concepts for socially responsible solutions in design and architecture industries are becoming even more complicated, asking for new knowledge and management methods. Research aim is to take a critical look at the design concepts, in order to promote socially responsible solutions and concepts that have different meanings, purposes and approaches depending on their context and origin and to develop structured framework of these concepts. Research method used is content analysis of scientific literature on design concepts that supports socially responsible solutions, abstract modeling and synthesis. Main results and findings of the study are: (1) there are great gaps between different design concept approaches and origins, education and practice in different areas that are involved in design and architecture processes, (2) design concepts and approaches solve only certain level or some parts of social issues, (3) there is a gap between theoretical concepts and actual practices in creative industries, (4) here is a lack of design management methods and assessment tools available for socially responsible design concepts.","[Koklacova, Sabine; Volkova, Tatjana] Banku Augstskola, Riga, Latvia",,"Koklacova, S (通讯作者)，Banku Augstskola, Riga, Latvia.",sabine.koklacova@gmail.com,"Azonnoudo, Seyido/ISU-7505-2023; Volkova, Tatjana/AAD-8257-2019","Volkova, Tatjana/0000-0002-7599-8720",,,,,28,0,0,1,7,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,392,406,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200034,0

Data mining techniques can discover patterns in large databases including relationships considered strategically relevant to the owner of the data. Organizations mine their own data to discover patterns and direct their efforts. These same insights are revealed to outside organizations when they participate in a data sharing agreement. The frequent item set hiding problem is an area of active research to study approaches for hiding the sensitive knowledge patterns before disclosing the data for mining outside the organization. Several methods address hiding sensitive item sets including an exact approach that generates an extension to the original database that, when combined with the original database, limits the discovery of sensitive association rules without impacting the non-sensitive information. To generate the database extension, this method formulates a constraint optimization problem (COP). Solving the COP formulation is the dominant factor in the computational resource requirements of the exact approach. This research developed a heuristic that improves the performance of an exact hiding method by reducing the size of the COP formulation without significantly affecting the quality of the solutions generated. Results of the heuristic processing were compared with an existing exact approach in terms of size of database extension, ability to hide sensitive data, and impact on nonsensitive data.","[LaMacchia, Carolyn] Bloomsburg Univ Penn, Zeigler Coll Business, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA",Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE); Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania,"LaMacchia, C (通讯作者)，Bloomsburg Univ Penn, Zeigler Coll Business, Bloomsburg, PA 17815 USA.",clamacch@bloomu.edu,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,3,BUSINESS & APPLIED SCI ACAD NORTH AMERICA-BAASANA,BLOOMSBURG,"2201 BENTLEY DR, BLOOMSBURG, PA 17815 USA",,,,,,,2016,,,,,,,95,106,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BI1BT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000405497000023,0

The changes brought by post-modern in the media industry mostly reflected on publishing as the oldest category of the media industry. The management of the publishing industry demanded radical reforms and a complete technological shift. The environment of publishing organizations fundamentally changed in only a few years and the business models based on the large ratio of income from advertising demanded a completely new management approach in managing business processes. The global financial crisis, from the beginning of the 21st century, struck the global media industry and accelerated the redistribution from advertising. The economic crisis on the Croatian market had a drastic reflection on the national publishing industry which resulted in a decrease of readership, publishing and income from advertising. The decrease of income from advertising threatened the daily business activities of newspaper industries and magazine industries. The decreasing income from advertising in magazines, which was the fuel in creating new brands, questioned classic advertising as a tradition to modern advertising. While the global media industry transformed and adapted to the post-industrial production system, the Croatian media industry fell into a modernist sleep.","[Lozic, Josko] Univ Appl Sci Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; [Milkovic, Marin] Univ North, Varazhdin, Croatia; [Lozic, Ines] Dignus Savjetovanje Doo, Zagreb, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Lozic, J (通讯作者)，Univ Appl Sci Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia.",jlozic@tvz.hr; mmilkovic@unin.hr; ineslozic1@gmail.com,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,6,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,187,202,,,,,,16,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700022,0

These criticisms assume that the Plan of Chicago was insufficiently progressive, or they evaluate the Plan by reference to the successes and failures of subsequent decades of urban reconstruction in Chicago. This article argues that the key to understanding the Plan of Chicago is to place it in its historical context. Burnham's Plan of Chicago was an expression of the tradition of Chicago civic boosterism and earlier city-building practices as much as it was of the nascent profession of city planning. Finally, while the Plan did neglect housing, poverty, and other social questions, it did possess a social vision based on civic inclusivity, rather than economic inclusivity. The Plan can be read as a reform document based on the assumption that physical environment shapes individual character and social relationships. It assumed the creation of a unified and harmonious physical city would produce a contented and productive citizenry. In short, the Plan of Chicago deployed a transformative vision in the service of conservative goals.","[Mccabe, Matthew P.] Edgewood Coll, Madison, WI USA",Edgewood College,"Mccabe, MP (通讯作者)，Edgewood Coll, Madison, WI USA.",,,,,,,,68,3,3,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Ordinary Least Squares regression technique was adopted. Financial inclusion was measured in the study using loan to deposit ratio (LDR), financial deepening indicators (FDI), loan to rural areas (LRA), and branch network (Bbranch). Measures of financial deepening adopted in the study are ratios of private sector credit to GDP and broad money supply to GDP. Economic growth was proxied as growth in gross domestic product (GDP) over successive periods while per capita income (PCI) was adopted as a measure of poverty and hence an index of development. The main findings are (i) credit delivery to the private sector (an index of financial inclusion) has not significantly supported economic growth in Nigeria (ii) financial inclusion has promoted poverty alleviation in Nigeria through rural credit delivery. The study recommends that the monetary authorities should not only deepen financial inclusion efforts through enhanced credit delivery to the private sector but should also strengthen the regulatory framework in order to ensure efficient and effective resource allocation and utilization.","[Okoye, Lawrence Uchenna; Adetiloye, Kehinde A.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Erin, Olayinka] Covenant Univ, Dept Accounting, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Modebe, Nwanneka J.] Univ Nigeria, Dept Banking & Finance, Nsukka, Nigeria",Covenant University; Covenant University; University of Nigeria,"Okoye, LU (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",lawrence.okoye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; kehinde.adetiloye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; erinolayinka@yahoo.com; modebenwanneka@gmail.com,"Adetiloye, Kehinde Adekunle/P-8608-2018; Erin, Olayinka/D-8669-2019","Adetiloye, Kehinde Adekunle/0000-0002-7171-0793;",,,,,34,1,1,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4384,4394,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700438,0

It takes as the starting-point of analysis the classification systems by which these futures markets were constitutively linked to underlying markets in agricultural commodities. Despite the formal similarity of these systems, their contrasting implementation - i.e. how grading was accomplished and integrated into practice - produced classifications with dissimilar semiotic qualities. This semiotic distinction is shown to have promoted divergent economic behaviours and outcomes on the two markets: high-risk speculation and volatility on the Chicago Board of Trade, low-risk hedging and stability on the New Orleans Cotton Exchange. The paper thus argues that treating classifications in their semiotic capacity yields an analysis that can connect foundational infrastructures and market-level outcomes in meaningful, non-deterministic ways.","[Pinzur, David] Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, 453 Social Sci Bldg,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Pinzur, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Sociol, 453 Social Sci Bldg,9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",DPINZUR@mail.ucsd.edu,,,,,,,71,8,8,0,9,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

These changes can also be observed in Latvia. One of the most often used social media channels in Latvia is Twitter. Twitter has been developing through the years and offers users more communication, advertising and analytic possibilities than ever before. These changes have influenced how customers and companies communicate with each other. That is why systematically researches must be conducted in this field. The aim of this paper was to conduct Twitter account analysis of 100 largest companies in Latvia to determine which Twitter metrics could influence the amount of company websites visitors. To achieve the aim of the paper several research methods were used: 1. Theoretical analysis to determine with Twitter metrics should be analysed; 2. Secondary data research method was used to: a. Collect data from Firmas.lv database to determine which are the biggest companies by turnover in Latvia; b. Collect data from company Twitter accounts, such as: likes per tweet, retweets and other metrics; c. Collect data from company websites, such as: total visitors, visitors from twitter and other metrics; 3. Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse collected data. The main results of the paper were: 1. Authors discovered factors that can influence the number of visitors from Twitter to company website; 2. Authors developed suggestions that can increase amount of company website visitors from Twitter. This paper is both theoretical and practical.

The Republic of Croatia was increasingly confronted with the above phenomenon primarily because of high unemployment rate and other unsatisfactory living conditions. The economic development of a country depends largely on its competitiveness; moreover, a key factor to maintain and increase the competitiveness is the human capital. Long-term development of the economy of the Republic of Croatia depended largely on the quality and expertise of human resources, which entailed the fact that the investment in human resources, their professional development and encouragement of the implementation of measures for their stay in home country should have been highly positioned on the priority list of the Republic of Croatia. This scientific paper conducted an analysis and determined the relationship between competitiveness and brain drain, as well as stated measures and proposals for reducing the brain drain, which should consequently affect the increasing competitiveness of the Republic of Croatia. The research results suggested that the brain drain caused by dissatisfaction in the home country greatly affected the competitiveness of the Republic of Croatia diminishing its importance on global competitiveness ranking. These findings were confirmed by international experiences which indicated that it was necessary to continuously work to prevent emigration of highly educated professionals by giving them satisfactorily working conditions, opportunities for constant development and life in general in their home country.","[Sundac, Dragomir] Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia; [Stumpf, Gorana] Univ Rijeka, Fac Maritime Studies, Rijeka, Croatia",University of Rijeka; University of Rijeka,"Sundac, D (通讯作者)，Univ Rijeka, Fac Econ, Rijeka, Croatia.",sundac@efri.hr; stumpf@pfri.hr,"Mudronja, Gorana/AAY-9492-2020; Mudronja, Gorana/ABD-1173-2021","Mudronja, Gorana/0000-0002-4625-3623",,,,,21,3,3,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,199,206,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500021,0

These comparisons are then used to promote cities as 'cycling capitals' or 'public transport paradises'. However, data-related and methodological issues make comparisons across cities difficult. This paper presents an alternative to the dominant atomistic-residential perspective which takes a random sample of residents in a city as input. We conceptualise cities as concentrations of workplaces and compare the commuting behaviour of employees active in a selection of sectors. This paper presents a new indicator to measure the modal split of cities and explains the level of car use in Belgian cities using mixed models. The presence of a railway station is associated with lower levels of car use, while highway access increases the share of the car. The car is also less popular in city centres, subcentres and in more dense urban areas.","[Vanoutrive, Thomas] Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium",University of Antwerp,"Vanoutrive, T (通讯作者)，Univ Antwerp, Dept Transport & Reg Econ, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium.",thomas.vanoutrive@uantwerp.be,,"Vanoutrive, Thomas/0000-0001-7422-3475",Flemish Policy Research Centre; Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO); Belgian Federal Public Service Mobility and Transport,Flemish Policy Research Centre; Belgian Science Policy (BELSPO)(Belgian Federal Science Policy Office); Belgian Federal Public Service Mobility and Transport,"Part of this research is funded by the Flemish Policy Research Centre for freight and passenger mobility.

Therefore, the present study aims to determine the impact of different policy decisions on the resource requirements of a DRT system, in terms of vehicles and drivers required and kilometers traveled. A number of policy scenarios are analyzed in the case study of Flanders for the prediction years 2015, 2020 and 2030: a base scenario assuming a geographically covering subsidized DRT system; a more economical scenario limiting the subsidized DRT services; a more accessible public transport; more flexibility of the users of the DRT system; an increase in the service area of the DRT service providers; and a doubling of the current supply of transport by volunteers. A microscopic simulation of the demand of elderly and PWD for transportation was performed in order to obtain a detailed overview of all transportation requests that need to be processed. Next, each simulated transportation request was assigned to a specific service provider and a separate vehicle routing plan was created, taking into account heterogeneous users (persons with different severity and type of disabilities), heterogeneous vehicles (regular and wheelchair adapted vehicles) and multiple geographically distributed depots. Resource requirements were calculated for each of the considered scenarios. The results show that changing the modal split (the mix between the different DRT providers), as well as the realization of adequate public transport and an improved flexibility, seem to be key elements in Flanders to minimize the resource requirements of a DRT system. Our applied methodology can easily be transferred to other regions or areas, as the flexibility of the model allows to easily modify the input criteria based on the specific context. This information can be used by governments for the optimization of their DRT system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies have shown how current transportation planning practices are dominated by the notion of planners as experts that produce the knowledge of future transportation needs using a series of analytical steps and computer modeling. Consequently, existing practices such as transport modeling perpetuate barriers to mobility and lack of accessibility, and therefore, there is a need to make explicit how these existing practices exclude particular population groups. Using the Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metropolitan Area as a case study, this paper makes a stronger connection between the assumptions planners make regarding transportation needs and goals with everyday travel experiences of a variety of residents.

The paper draws upon theories of the development gift which focus upon the ethics and moralities of corporate giving and the ways in which development gifts extend capitalist power, re-embed morality in the market and bind recipients into hierarchical positions of unequal exchange. In contrast, we know significantly less about the moralities and motivations of the populations to whom the gifts are offered. Aiming to fill the lacunae, the paper shows how at Bibiyana the community engagement' programmes take place in a specific moral terrain which pre-dates the arrival of Chevron and has profoundly affected how their development goods are perceived, utilized and contested. Whilst Chevron's community engagement' programme is underlain by ethics of detachment and aims to create disconnection via discourses of empowerment and sustainability, this is at odds with the local moral economy of connection, which is underlain by the ethics of Islamic charity and patronage, and in which hierarchical differences are explicit.","[Gardner, Katy] Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Gardner, K (通讯作者)，Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Anthropol, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",K.J.Gardner@lse.ac.uk,,,ESRC-DFID; ESRC [ES/F026641/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/F026641/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC-DFID; ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),This work was supported by the ESRC-DFID.,,72,10,10,0,23,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This article investigates a possible compensation mechanism between balanced skills and cities and how this compensatory measure relates to performance. Specifically, we test and find support for the idea put forward by Helsley and Strange that high market thickness, such as that found in cities, can compensate for a lack of entrepreneurial skill balance.

The study focuses on China, where substantial regulations are still present in the aviation market, particularly in areas such as route entry, airport slot allocation, input supply, and aviation support services. These regulations limit the ability of entrant airlines to compete in hub airports, and allow dominant airlines to strengthen their market power and achieve substantial growth at the expense of their competitors. Current Chinese regulations assist major state-owned carriers by suppressing domestic competition, particularly in markets linked to hub airports. If national policy in China continues to be guided by requirements created to support the dominant airlines, in the short term there will be limited liberalization on routes linked with hub airports. Promoting LCC services in the region is one practical alternative for the short term which could prevent major disruption to network carriers. This investigation suggests that Chinese airlines would be less resistant to bilateral liberalization with ASEAN, Oceanian or European nations than they would with other regions, as they are well positioned in these markets, and may be able to develop their hub airports into Asia's gateways to Europe. In the long term, however, there is no substitute for full liberalization if NEA governments want their nations to fully benefit from enabling their carriers and hub airports to achieve global competitiveness.

An issue that has emerged is whether there is a level playing field (LPF) between the carriers of the two nations that are party to a bilateral air services agreement. While the International Civil Aviation Association (ICAO) has drafted a model LPF clause for air services agreements and the European Commission has negotiated a few agreements with LFP clauses, the issues involved are at best vaguely specified and often ignore key elements of economics. This paper represents an initial attempt to develop a more comprehensive discussion of aspects of LPF definition. The paper categorises issues as either legitimate concerns or as issues that are matters of comparative advantage in international trade or that can and should be dealt with by competition or general international trade law rather than by sector specific bilateral trade treaties. The topic of subsidies in LPF assessments is particularly addressed as economic welfare optimization can justify subsidies in some cases and because subsidy to infrastructure is more widespread than some stakeholders may realize.

Moreover, none of these papers addresses some elementary and fundamental questions concerning the optimal features of the tariff in the presence of heterogeneous users: (1) How does the overage price (and thus marginal benefit for a high-demand user) compare to the marginal cost of the service? (2) How does marginal benefit compare to marginal cost for a low-demand user consuming at the allowance level? (3) How large is the access fee relative to benefits from the service? The purpose of this paper is to answer these questions by using a simple model with two types of consumers and a constant marginal cost. The analysis is carried out for a monopoly provider and then for the duopoly case, with the outcomes under the two market structures compared.","[Baek, Ji Won] Korea Telecom, Econ & Management Res Inst, Seoul 110777, South Korea; [Brueckner, Jan K.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Brueckner, JK (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Econ, 3151 Social Sci Plaza, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",zhiyuan7@gmail.com; jkbrueck@uci.edu,,"Baek, Ji Won/0000-0003-1268-9725",,,,,10,6,7,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

The paper presents the basic economic concepts that apply to vertical restraints, and identifies the efficiency reasons and the anticompetitive effects that may motivate their adoption. Then, the relevant economic literature is surveyed in order to understand how e-commerce influences retail competition, taking into account its impact on search costs, distribution costs, and information asymmetry. The paper examines the legal treatment of vertical restraints on e-commerce in the case of selective distribution; it summarizes the position expressed by the European Commission in the Block Exemption Regulation and the accompanying guidelines, and then discusses some cases decided by National Competition Authorities, National Courts, and the European Courts. From this overview emerges the risk that the antitrust analysis of vertical restraints on e-commerce in selective distribution systems may be guided by presumptions that do not have solid economic grounds. The paper argues that it is unwise to adopt a formal approach for the legal assessment of these vertical restraints and calls for a more economic effect-based approach.",,,,paolo.buccirossi@learlab.com,,,,,,,33,4,4,1,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Arrangements commonly require parties to make sunk-cost investments that the arrangement partner cannot observe, to disclose private information, and to make financing commitments. The requirements of efficient contracting-individual rationality, incentive compatibility, and budget balance-are difficult to satisfy in arrangement contexts, so that, as the literature suggests, parties' best response is to form firms. We show, in contrast, that flexible and efficient contracting is possible for arrangements. With the arrival of new information, each party is asked to pay-to -play which requires the firms to agree to future terms of exchange that are mutually beneficial. When properly negotiated, these payments to play support the efficient multistage joint development of the new product, with hybrid relationships that are governed by conventional control rights and legal enforcement.","[Lewis, Tracy R.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA; [Schwartz, Alan] Yale Univ, Sch Law, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Schwartz, Alan] Yale Univ, Sch Management, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Duke University; Yale University; Yale University,"Lewis, TR (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Fuqua Sch Business, Durham, NC 27706 USA.",tracyl@duke.edu,"Schwartz, Alan/G-2814-2010",,,,,,27,3,3,0,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

If they get the defendant convicted, this helps them advance their careers. If the odds of winning on the main charge are low, prosecutors have a second option. They can exploit the ambiguity of legal doctrine and charge the defendant for vaguely defined crimes, like conspiracy. We model the situation as a signaling game and test it experimentally. If we have participants play the naked game, at least a minority play the game theoretic equilibrium and use the broad rule if a signal indicates that the defendant is guilty. This becomes even slightly more frequent if a misbehaving defendant imposes harm on a third participant. By contrast if we frame the situation as a court case, almost all prosecutors take the signal at face value and knowingly run the risk of losing in court if the signal was false. Our experimental prosecutors behave like textbook legal idealists, and follow the urge of duty. The experiment demonstrates the strong behavioral force of a legal frame. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this respect, the Court tenure serves as a screening device for politicians to ascertain the justices' personal independence. The empirical strategy is two-step. First, we estimate a logit fixed-effect model to evaluate the personal degree of independence for each justice reporter. This justice-effect is based on the proneness of a justice to declare the constitutional illegitimacy of a law controlling for the environmental conditional phenomena. Second, we verify to what extent this degree of independence affects the probability of obtaining a politically controlled post after the end of the mandate at the Court. Our results, obtained by a variety of estimators to check their robustness, strongly support the revisionist view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

And with good reason: it is clear from the evidence that such 'standard' vertically integrated launderers exists. Because professionals and institutions are also routinely prosecuted for money laundering transgressions, however, it appears that the market for money laundering is also supplied by third party, 'professional' launderers, whose core business lies outside the criminal sector, but who chooses to spend time supplying the market for money laundering. In this paper we introduce the professional launder to the literature, and consider the process by which the launderer and the criminal bargain, to agree on a price for the money laundering service. We then consider the effects of three anti-crime, or anti-money laundering measures - namely, (1) increasing the probability that the criminal is caught, (2) increasing the probability that the launderer is caught, and (3) increasing the probability that the bargaining process itself is detected - on the way in which the negotiation is concluded. Of the various combinations available to the policy maker, we conclude that more resources should be spend on specialized police-units to tackle money laundering and, when the budget is fixed, less should be spent on financial scrutiny. Current approaches, we find, do not deter money launderers from supplying the market, but simply increase the profitability of money laundering and decrease the profitability of legitimate business.

It is known that Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) does not perform well in this framework, because inversions of large covariance matrices are required. We propose a method that combines the richness of reduced-rank regression with the simplicity of naive univariate forecasting methods. In particular, we suggest the usage of a proper shrinkage estimator of the autocovariance matrices that are involved in the computation of CCA, in order to obtain a method that is asymptotically equivalent to CCA, but numerically more stable in finite samples. Simulations and empirical applications document the merits of the proposed approach for both forecasting and structural analysis. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters.

We hypothesize that courts were more likely to make the switch when their appellate caseloads are relatively high. To examine this, we estimate hazard models, showing that states with appellate courts where caseloads grew relatively faster made the switch more quickly, and the effect was more pronounced for the switch to the pure, as opposed to the modified, form of comparative negligence.

Until 1998, the Netherlands had a permissive attitude towards cartels-cartels were required to register. The Netherlands' cartel register provides an opportunity to study the effects of cartelization on productivity growth. By using cartel and industry data on productivity growth, we estimate the impact of cartel formation, cartel presence, and cartel termination on the total productivity growth in the Netherlands between 1982 and 1998.

Exploiting policy variation across Russian regions and firm-level survey data, we show that private land rights facilitate credit access and promote investment.","[Karas, Alexei] Univ Coll Roosevelt, Middelburg, Netherlands; [Pyle, William] Middlebury Coll, Middlebury, VT USA; [Schoors, Koen] Univ Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium",Ghent University,"Karas, A (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Tjalling C Koopmans Res Inst, Sch Econ, NL-3508 TC Utrecht, Netherlands.",,"Karas, Alexei/IWM-4431-2023; Schoors, Koen/N-7059-2019","Schoors, Koen/0000-0002-4159-8083; Karas, Alexei/0000-0002-6149-1208",National Council for Eurasian and East European Research; International Research and Exchanges Board; Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition,National Council for Eurasian and East European Research; International Research and Exchanges Board; Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition,"Karas is a guest fellow at the Tjalling C.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been little discussion in the literature of the minimization of forecast outliers when combining forecasts. It would appear to have gone unnoticed that robust combining, which often improves the predictive accuracy (under square or absolute error losses) when innovation errors have a tail that is heavier than a normal distribution, may have a higher frequency of prediction outliers. Given the importance of reducing outlier forecasts, it is desirable to seek new loss functions which can achieve both the usual accuracy and outlier-protection simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a synthetic loss function and apply it to a general adaptive combination scheme for the outlier-protective combination of forecasts. Both the theoretical and numerical results support the advantages of the new method in terms of providing combined forecasts with fewer large forecast errors and comparable overall performances.

Acknowledging this situation, the European Landscape Convention (ELC) was approved in 2000 with the explicit objective of protecting, managing and planning European landscapes. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence on the suitability of the Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) methodology for valuing multidimensional landscapes under the ELC. An application in the Basque Country, Spain, serves as an example to illustrate that the DCE methodology may be suitable for supporting the aims of the ELC because: (i) it is a tool for public consultation; (ii) it offers an insight into the relative attractiveness of key landscape attributes, such as native forests and farming activities; and (iii) it provides policy-makers with quantitative information on the public preferences for potential future landscape protection, management and planning programmes. The results highlight the important role that the conservation of native forests and the promotion of organic farming may play in the management of European landscapes, which in turn is found to be strongly culturally dependent.

This is despite the fact that some varieties of agglomeration distinguished in the literature appear to come close to what previously were regarded as industrial enclaves and despite frequent allusions to the enclave nature of economic spaces produced by contemporary processes of globalization. Bringing the literature on agglomeration and enclaves into dialogue, we revisit the concept of the enclavea concept that has been largely neglected since it enjoyed a popularity in connection with the study of particular (notably extractive) industries and particular (notably dependencia) theories of national economic development during the 1960s and 1970s. Much has changed since this time, which suggests that the concept of the enclave ought to be ripe for reevaluation. In this article we take an initial step in this direction, identifying analytical dimensions to the enclave and illustrating different manifestations of enclaves in the mining industry, drawing on the case of Chile. We conclude by advocating the renewed study of industry enclaves within contemporary economic geographic analysis.","[Phelps, Nicholas A.; Arias, Martin] UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, London WC1H 0NN, England; [Atienza, Miguel] Univ Catolica Norte, IDEAR, Dept Econ, Antofagasta, Chile",University of London; University College London; Universidad Catolica del Norte,"Phelps, NA (通讯作者)，UCL, Bartlett Sch Planning, 14 Upper Woburn Pl, London WC1H 0NN, England.",n.phelps@ucl.ac.uk; miatien@ucn.cl; martin.loyola.11@ucl.ac.uk,"Miguel, Atienza/D-1492-2013; Arias-Loyola, Martin/C-1759-2018; Arias-Loyola, Martín/ABH-6177-2020","Arias-Loyola, Martin/0000-0001-8740-6326; Atienza, Miguel/0000-0003-3202-574X",CONICYT [80130003],CONICYT(Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica (CONICYT)),"The authors are grateful for the support of CONICYT through its program Attraction of Advanced Human Capital (project number 80130003), under which Nicholas Phelps was a visiting scholar at the Departamento de Economia, Universidad Catolica del Norte during summer 2014.

It argues that the process of convergence innovation is a continuous disequilibrium between reference technology and its matching technology, which adjusts optimal balance between the functions of the two technologies. The process of convergence innovation is also featured as a learning process that requires both vertical and horizontal convergence. Types of convergence innovation such as outside-in and inside-out, depending on market situation are discovered in some case explorations. Convergence innovation has been taking place mainly by applying IT technologies to vast areas of conventional technologies. This is because individuals or firms get benefit from the convergence between IT and conventional technologies. Such innovations made possible by convergence ultimately improve the welfare of human beings as companies can solve diverse problems or increase employment. Many examples are found in Asian industries, for instance, biochemical companies of Indonesia were able to increase their market shares in biofertilizer and biopesticide products through bio-based technological convergence. Textile machinery firms of Korea have survived by achieving convergence innovation on their core competences.","DGIST, Dalseong Gun 711873, Daegu, South Korea",Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science & Technology (DGIST),"Lee, KR (通讯作者)，DGIST, 333 Techno Jungang Daero, Dalseong Gun 711873, Daegu, South Korea.",leekr@dgist.ac.kr,"Lee, Kong-Rae/AAG-8986-2021",,,,,,13,17,19,6,68,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

First, our analysis makes it possible to highlight that pool patents are more litigated than non-pool patents presenting the same characteristics. Second, we underline that the difference in the likelihood to be involved in an infringement case, with the patent holder as plaintiff, is due to a pool effect per se, on top of the impact of the pool on the market size of the patent. Third, we explore several tracks that could explain this positive pool effect on litigations. We underscore that the patent inclusion in a pool, by reducing the uncertainty on the patent essentiality, facilitates dispute resolution by settlement. We also show that the pools' size, as measured by the number of members, has a positive effect on the number of cases which could be due to a transmission of information between members. We emphasize and discuss such other factors that affect the incentives to litigate as the size of the firm and whether the patent holder is vertically integrated. From a public policy standpoint, our results underscore the need for a higher scrutiny of the real functioning of modern I.C.T. pools by the antitrust authorities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We develop a model where the legislator's knowledge of the increase in passage probability from including a sunset provision influences the legislator's choice to do so. Because legislators may either include a sunset provision to increase passage probability, or observe low passage probability and respond with a sunset provision, the choice to include a sunset provision is endogenous. Consequently, the causal effect of temporary enactment is identified by using the legislator's number of offspring as a source of exogenous variation in the choice to include a sunset provision. Employing recursive bivariate probit, we find that the average causal effect of including a sunset provision is sixty percent. We also find that the average causal effect of including sunset provisions in bills that already include them is about twenty percent.

These foregrounded how in the eighteenth century the population emerged as a 'natural-cultural reality' resulting from an integration of biological and economic knowledge. Subsequent research on biopolitics and governmentality has tended to separate the concepts, differentiating into distinct research traditions each with different intellectual pathways. We propose to bring these conceptual innovations together to understand contemporary problems of the government of life, that is, of managing, controlling and optimizing a living population. In this domain, the natural/biological continues to intersect with the social/cultural in novel and unexpected ways. Straddling the specter of biopolitics, we examine four dimensions of the concept: vital threats and the resurrection of death power, the interplay of sovereignty, discipline and security, governmentalization through medical normalization, and 'securitization' of life as circulations and open series. The article also introduces this special feature on the government of life in which significant scholars explores issues of population management by drawing upon, debating, and developing the conceptual heritage of Foucault.","[Villadsen, Kaspar] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Wahlberg, Ayo] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Anthropol, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark",Copenhagen Business School; University of Copenhagen,"Villadsen, K (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Management Polit & Philosophy, Porcelaenshaven 18B, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",kv.mpp@cbs.dk; ayo.wahlberg@anthro.ku.dk,"Villadsen, Kaspar/S-7118-2019","Wahlberg, Ayo/0000-0001-6862-5208; villadsen, kaspar/0000-0002-9966-942X",,,,,50,23,23,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This research builds on earlier work which studied the competition in a small tolled network meant for private modes of transport which have a choice of route. The earlier work showed that while both cities have an incentive to charge alone, once they begin, they are likely to fall into the 'Nash Trap' of a prisoner's dilemma where the incentive to defect is higher than that to cooperate thus eventually leading to a 'lose-lose' situation. The current paper extends the idea of competition between cities by setting up a system dynamic model of two cities which includes modes such as car, bus, train and walking and cycling. This paper innovates by integrating the simulation of land use transport interactions with a class room style experimental game and analyses the gaming strategies from a continuous repeated prisoner's dilemma involving setting of tolls to maximise the welfare of residents. The aim is to test (a) whether the strategies adopted are as theory predicts and (b) whether the players recognise the benefits of lower tolls when given information about the regulated solution and collaborate or continue to play to win. The results show that players respond to the information and maintain a collaborative solution which may have significant implications for regulation and the development of cities within regional partnerships.

This study employs a new endogenous growth model for theoretical support, auto-regressive distributive lag model and rolling window regression method in order to determine long run and short run association between trade openness and economic growth. Further granger causality test is used to determine the long run and short run causal direction. The results reveal that human capital and physical capital are positively related to economic growth in the long run. On the other hand, trade openness index negatively impacts on economic growth in the long run. The new evidence is provided by the rolling window regression results i.e. the impact of trade openness index on economic growth is not stable throughout the sample. In the short run trade openness index is positively related to economic growth. The result of granger causality test confirms the validity of trade openness-led growth and human capital-led growth hypothesis in the short run and long run.","[Hye, Qazi Muhammad Adnan] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Econ, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia; [Lau, Wee-Yeap] Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Lau, WY (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Appl Stat, Kuala Lumpur 50603, Malaysia.",adnan.economist@yahoo.com; wylau@um.edu.my,"LAU, WEE YEAP/B-2772-2010; Hye, Qazi Muhammad Adnan/A-1698-2013","LAU, WEE YEAP/0000-0002-3447-9895; Hye, Qazi Muhammad Adnan/0000-0003-1595-0992",,,,,45,66,70,5,52,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Focusing on the effects of macro externality and state-dependence on viewer behavior, the authors construct a hierarchical Bayesian model and derive an individual utility function. Applying their method to the choice of TV programs in Japan, they estimate the effects of macro externality and state dependence on an individual's viewing behavior, and illustrate the distribution of these effects. The authors find that macro externality has a strong overall effect on the total number of viewers and the state-dependence effect has a slightly positive effect. Moreover, comparing the attributes revealed that male viewers tend to show a lower effect of ratings and higher state dependence than females. They find that the older the viewers are, the higher the effect of state dependence. Further, using utility function data obtained by our estimation, they conduct a simulation to measure the dynamic effects of macro externality and state dependence.","[Kinjo, Keita] Okinawa Int Univ, Fac Econ, Ginowan City, Okinawa, Japan; [Ebina, Takeshi] Shinshu Univ, Fac Econ, Nagano 380, Japan",Shinshu University,"Kinjo, K (通讯作者)，Okinawa Int Univ, Fac Econ, 2-6-1 Ginowan, Ginowan City, Okinawa, Japan.",to1307kk@gmail.com,"; Ebina, Takeshi/E-2239-2014","Kinjo, Keita/0000-0001-5907-3501; Ebina, Takeshi/0000-0002-1902-4788","JSPS [25780272, 24500183, 24730224, 24530264]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [24500183, 24530264, 25780272, 24730224] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))",Keita Kinjo acknowledges the financial support of JSPS Grant-in-aid for Young Scientist (B) 25780272 and Grant-in-aid for Scientific Research (C) 24500183.

Soft facts are basic facts and features which are not available as figures or formulas. For the management of networked production structures and its participating enterprises both incentive and sanction mechanisms are useful and applicable. The operationalization of sanctions is primarily based on control and supervision management systems. This is founded on the assumptions of the New Institutional Economics, e.g. asymmetrically distributed information among the actors. In that context a comprehensive approach for the measurement, assessment and evaluation of the service performance of enterprises operating in networked organisation structures has been developed. That approach involves besides hard facts also soft facts into the analysis procedure and methodology. The description of possibilities for integration of soft facts in the approach of the performance analysis of enterprises involved in networked cooperation structures is focused. At first a number of relevant soft facts for the performance analysis must be identified. Then the basic procedure is described in a detailed manner in form of a mete-model. This procedure results in a fixed algorithm and allows a high degree of flexibility. The individual working steps of this algorithm and possibilities of quantifying soft facts, checking differential and preferential independence of the influence factors and the idea of the ideal positioning are explained. Furthermore the subsequent application of the cost-benefit analysis and the Analytic Hierarchy Process are described in detail.","[Jaehn, Hendrik] Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Econ Sci, Prod & Ind Management, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany",Technische Universitat Chemnitz,"Jaehn, H (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Chemnitz, Dept Econ Sci, Prod & Ind Management, Thuringer Weg 7, D-09126 Chemnitz, Germany.",hendrik.jaehn@wirtschaft.tu-chemnitz.de,,,,,,,16,0,0,0,0,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,286,296,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000029,0

The research finds that despite much attention being placed on the issue of optimism bias over the last decade it still remains prevalent. It also finds that there is a clear need to improve the quality and consistency of ex ante analysis particularly in the areas of capital cost estimation, travel demand modelling and risk analysis. Additionally our research identifies the limited role that formal decision making tools such as cost benefit analysis and multi-criteria analysis play in the decision making process of the countries surveyed. The benefit of undertaking ex post cost benefit analysis is maximised when a set of schemes are analysed - thereby allowing patterns in outcomes and weaknesses in ex ante methodologies to be identified.

This is also in-line with the objectives to practice a good Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to support environmental friendly initiatives including within their office premises. For that, PAM Council endorsed and approved the formation of the new Sustainability Committee, in August 2008, who was tasked primarily to develop and set-up the GBRT become first tropical green tool, known as Green Building Index (GBI). Singapore's Green Mark had practicing mandatory rules for minimum Certified Rating to all new buildings or works on existing buildings exceeding floor area 2,000 m(2) starting from 2005.

The proposed test does not require the probabilities to be converted to binary forecasts before testing, and it accommodates serial correlation and skewness in the forecasts. We find that the number of forecasters making valuable forecasts decreases sharply as the horizon increases. The beta-transformed linear pool combination scheme, based on the valuable individual forecasts, is shown to outperform the simple average for all horizons on a number of performance measures, including calibration and sharpness. The test helps to identify the good forecasters ex ante, and therefore contributes to the accuracy of the combined forecasts. (c) 2014 International Institute of Forecasters.

Unfortunately, most students find it difficult to follow all the activities involved in the orientation program. Some students either misplace the program, do not understand the program or in most cases find the program uninteresting to go through. Taking into account that the youth of today are technology centered, providing the orientation program as an electronic application could help improve the availability, usability and even the appearance of the orientation guide. This highlights the necessity to determine which HCI principles can be applied in the design of an interactive guide for orientation week. Using HCI principles could enhance the experience of the interaction between the student and the computer which could result in a better response to the orientation guide.

Its negative effects were also exacerbated by the existing level of globalization. This added to mutual dependence of the regional and local economies, making them more susceptible to various exogenous shocks. Thus, a question of their ability to withstand such shocks has come into the centre of attention of both, academicians and politicians. The notion of resilience is mainly associated with a capacity of a territorial unit to bounce back and/or to recover after being hit by a negative economic shock With a rising interest in how to reinforce such a capacity at various territorial levels, a necessity arises of its operationalisation at the same time. Various indices of economic resilience have been compiled similar to those for competitiveness, usually in the national and regional level. Based on this, long-term strategies fostering the characteristics essential for economic resilience might be formulated subsequently. At lower territorial units, a measuring of economic resilience is still in its infancy, though. This paper begins with a brief introduction to the concept of economic resilience and various methods of measuring it Then, difficulties associated with gauging local economic resilience in the Czech Republic are discussed. Drawing on existing approaches, possible indicators of local economic resilience are suggested followed with their application on selected Czech municipalities.","[Lungova, Miroslava] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Lungová, M (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Studentska 2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",miroslava.lungova@tul.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,10,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,89,100,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000009,0

Economic reasoning suggests that rising incomes with expansions in GDP enhance the quality of life and subjective well-being. This paper examines the influences on individual happiness, using ordinal logistic regression and chi-square analyses. Based on the findings of a small case study, the chi-square test indicated that a significant relationship exists between gender, education, ethnicity, children, marital status, employment relations, income and self-reported happiness. The study also found that, on average, happier people tended to be educated, married with children, and treated fairly at work. But having too many children produced a decrement in individual happiness. The ordinal regression results indicate that an individual's education, gender, age distribution and work environment are influential in producing higher levels of happiness. Entrepreneurs were found to have a significantly higher mean level of happiness than employees. In the workplace, individuals who experienced personal growth and were able to contribute their ideas tended to be happier, relative to others who perceived themselves to be 'restricted'.","[Mahadea, Darma] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa; [Ramroop, Shaun] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Math Stat & Comp Sci, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal; University of Kwazulu Natal,"Mahadea, D (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Sch Econ & Finance, Durban, South Africa.",,"Ramroop, Shaun/N-4956-2013","Ramroop, Shaun/0000-0001-9305-6967",,,,,62,13,15,1,38,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

This has also been the case in Spain, where several legal initiatives have promoted the presence of women on decision-making bodies of companies. These important and pioneering legislative initiatives focus on the recommendation of positive discrimination in favour of women in large firms. This measure is justified not only for reasons of ethics or social justice, but also for the purposes of efficiency and rational economic behaviour. These laws have created an open debate in Spain and in other countries where they have been enacted and they have attracted the attention of researchers. In this context, the majority of the studies have attempted to analyse the effect of gender diversity among top managers on corporate performance of listed firms. On the contrary, this paper analyses the influence of gender on some financial decisions, using a sample of 12,376 Spanish small and micro start-up firms. Unlike previous papers, this manuscript examines not only the level of debt but also the cost and maturity of the debt. To control the endogeneity of the variables, a system of simultaneous equation with Three Stage Least Squares methodology is employed. The results show that companies run by women and boards with gender diversity tend to borrow less, have lower costs for debt and longer term debt, reinforcing the hypothesis that females are more risk averse. These results are robust for diverse measures of gender diversity (the presence of a woman as CEO, the percentage of female directors and Blau and Shannon diversity indexes).","[Maria Hernandez-Nicolas, Carmen; Francisco Martin-Ugedo, Juan; Minguez-Vera, Antonio] Univ Murcia, Dept Org Empresas & Finanzas, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Hernandez-Nicolas, CM (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, Dept Org Empresas & Finanzas, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",cm.hernandeznicolas@um.es; juanfran@um.es; minver@um.es,"Minguez-Vera, Antonio/Z-5658-2019",,Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain) [FEM2013-40578-P]; Fundacion CajaMurcia,Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain); Fundacion CajaMurcia,This research is part of the project FEM2013-40578-P financed by the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad (Government of Spain).

One of the possible ways of incorporating the process dynamics into the model is to describe the model by functional equations. The paper is based on the assumption that the balance between the demand and supply can be successfully expressed by a model described by differential equations, even if the goods are supplied with a certain delay. The equation is solved by modern theory. Theoretical results are illustrated by an example, with concrete results presented in graphical form. The solution is presented by modern computer simulation and the Maple system is used. The authors come to the conclusion that a delay in the supply of goods can cause an oscillation in the price. On the other hand, it is possible to define conditions under which the solution is monotonous. (C) 2015 The Authors.

A correlation is then introduced between the transformed innovation and the latent process in an attempt to improve the statistical fits of the models. In order to perform one-step-ahead in-sample and out-of-sample duration forecasts, an auxiliary particle filter is used to approximate the filter distributions of the latent states.

The objective of this study is mainly to analyse the performance of REITs in Malaysia for the period of 2001 until 2010. This research has been conducted to reveals the information on the REITs performance in Malaysia. The topic is important which serve as reliable information to investors in order to give knowledge and valuable information to them on which REITs is the market leader. The information should be highlighted to the public to give clearer picture to the investors on the trends the REITs market are heading for. The potential investors love this type of information beforehand. The scope of this study covers 14 REITs funds in Malaysia from 2001 to 2010. The data used had been gathered from DataStream and Thomson One Banker website. The analysis on the performance used the traditional Finance method from Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) which is Sharpe Index. Based on the findings, it shows that seven REITs outperformed FBM KLCI for the study period of 2001 to 2010. Four REITs possess lower degree of overall risk or volatility as compared to the FBM KLCI. In terms of correlation of returns, there is statistically significant but low correlation between REITs with the market portfolio. Additionally, REITs also provide an effective mean of hedging during the sampling period.","[Mohamed, Suhana; Jambari, Abdul Razak] UiTM City Campus, RMI, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Mohamed, Suhana; Jambari, Abdul Razak] UiTM City Campus, FBM, Johor Baharu, Malaysia; [Sham, Rohana; Yusop, Haslenda] UiTM Johor, RMI, Segamat, Malaysia; [Sham, Rohana] UiTM Johor, FBM, Segamat, Malaysia; [Yusop, Haslenda] UiTM Johor, FSKM, Segamat, Malaysia",,"Mohamed, S (通讯作者)，UiTM City Campus, RMI, Johor Baharu, Malaysia.",suhan291@johor.uitm.edu.my; rohana320@johor.uitm.edu.my; haslenda381@johor.uitm.edu.my; abdul625@johor.uitm.edu.my,"Sham, Assoc Prof Dr Rohana/GSE-2462-2022; Mohamed, Suhana/AAQ-8295-2021; Sham, Rohana/A-7450-2010; Sham, Rohana/AAE-9916-2019","Sham, Assoc Prof Dr Rohana/0000-0003-2000-7448; Sham, Rohana/0000-0001-7173-3007;",,,,,21,0,0,1,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3477,3486,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700365,0

In common practice, estimating is a solo activity carried at pre construction phase using the construction drawings. The engineering drawing specifications, the past experience, and previous records references help the quantity surveyors to produce the bills of quantities manually. However the market available estimating software need manual key-in about the drawing elements as the automation of estimating directly from the construction drawings is critical. This is due to various issues namely no algorithm to recognise the primitive symbols of the two dimensional (2D) drawings into construction elements, random practice of drawing specifications, and lack of standardized specificatons in 2D drawings and so on. This study developed a prototype in-built with a new knowledge based algorithm to recognize the drawing primitive symbols of lines, arcs, text and other sysmbols into construction elements in 2D drawings. The beam element drawing is selected randomly for this element recognition. The element recognition method follows namely i) extraction of the drawing attributes from the 2D drawing; ii) identification of the construction elements from the extracted drawing attributes; iii) classification of the construction element's attributes into parametric values; and iv) interpretation of the parametric values into bills of quantities. The prototype has been validated with real time commercial drawing for its element recognition performance to produce the bills of quantities. In conclusion, the prototype being developed by this research produces bills of quantities through auto element recognition from the 2D drawing successfully.","[Muthuveerappan, Chitrakala; Mohammed, Abdul Hakim] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Realestate, Utmjohor 81310, Malaysia; [Minhans, Anil; Samsudin, Shahit; Abd Majid, Muhd Zaimi] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Civil Engn, Utmjohor 81310, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Muthuveerappan, C (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Realestate, Utmjohor 81310, Malaysia.",,"Abd.

Current values, which are mostly provided by the use of Impact Assessment Models, can vary up to six orders of magnitude (from $-10.00/tC to $7,243.73/tC). Within this range, the choice of an adequate monetary value is extremely difficult. In this paper, we create a database with nearly 700 different observations coming from 60 studies on the economic valuation of GHG emissions. Subsequently, we use a meta-analysis to investigate the variation in emissions costs in order to significantly reduce the overall uncertainty. The results of the meta-regression analysis are then tested to assess three possible transport policies that can be implemented at 2050 European levels. A specific unitary economic value of GHG emissions is provided for each policy, thus aiding policy-makers to valuate the real economic impact of transport due to global warming.

The primary research of the managerial competences was conducted through the structural survey. The survey included 50 general questions, case studies, relating to the key competences. The independence was examined through the standard chi-square test of independence. From the results cannot be deduced that there is a part of a competence to be directly dependent on the highest education level received.

As shown by a number of studies, employee engagement can significantly influence company performance. Employee engagement, its appraisal and measurement have become quite topical recently. The objective of this research was to provide empirical validation in the region of whether there is a relationship between the positive perception of the region and perceived employee engagement The research was conducted in all districts of the Usti Region. The sample comprised 151 respondents - businesses as well as state and public administration organisations. The conclusions explicitly show that respondents who positively perceive their region also show a higher engagement rate of their employees at the same time. The research also focused on finding out whether there are differences in the appraisal of the employee engagement rate by their employers. The conclusions of this research study surprisingly showed that respondents from state and public administration organisations appraise their employees as more engaged than those from companies. It was also established that there were differences in employee engagement with respect to the size of the business. A lower engagement rate was established in large businesses (above 250 employees) as opposed to smaller companies. In terms of human resource management, our businesses pay more attention to all standard personnel activities. Companies quite recently have started making inquiries into employee satisfaction, for example. However, companies show big differences in establishing the engagement rate in practice. Organisations looking for a way to increase their performance should focus exactly on this issue.","[Reissova, Alice; Sivicek, Tomas; Jilek, Josef] Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Management, Dept Econ, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic",University of Jan Evangelista Purkyne,"Reissová, A (通讯作者)，Jan Evangelista Purkyne Univ Usti Nad Labem, Fac Social & Econ Studies, Dept Management, Dept Econ, Moskevska 54, Usti Nad Labem 40096, Czech Republic.",alice.reissova@ujep.cz; tomas.sivicek@ujep.cz; josef.jilek87@gmail.com,"Reissová, Alice/P-6050-2019","Reissová, Alice/0000-0002-5095-051X",,,,,17,0,0,0,7,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,353,364,,,,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000036,0

Nevertheless, safety issue is still lacking of emphasize amongst employees on construction site where safety culture is still lacking of application. Organization X is a project based company which is specialized in the installation of scrubber and other air pollution control equipment in Malaysia. In year 2013, 39 cases of incidents have been recorded during scrubber installation activities at construction sites. This situation has not only affected the economic burden due to increased medical expenses but has also affected the work efficiency, resulting in deterioration of company's performance and reputation. At risk behaviors of workers are identified as the main contributor for accidents at construction sites. In order to control and mitigate the accidents at site during installation of scrubber, the behavior based safety approach has been used by implementing the use of Safety Behavior Checklist (SBC), which is customized for use specifically within Organization X, the selected case study of this paper, during installation of scrubber. The paper was done to investigate the at risk behaviors that construction workers may posed and performed during installation activities of scrubber. This paper also assesses further on the impacts of implementing the customized SBC and observation during the installation of scrubber at site. To achieve such improvements, analysis was accomplished effectively and efficiently by using the result from customized SBC and comparing the results of the three month observations. This paper found that the implementation of customized SBC contributes to the improvement of worker's safe behavior modification.","[Sanusi, Khidir; Ismail, Syuhaida; Shariff, Nor Mawati Mohd.] Univ Telcnol Malaysia, UTM RAZAK Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Sanusi, K (通讯作者)，Univ Telcnol Malaysia, UTM RAZAK Sch Engn & Adv Technol, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",khidirsanusi@ymail.com; syuhaida.kl@utm.my; mawa.kl@utm.my,"Ismail, Syuhaida/K-6892-2019","Ismail, Syuhaida/0000-0001-6058-7497",,,,,22,0,0,0,1,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,505,514,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700052,0

However, the adoption of IT governance has a problem of low adoption in developed and developing countries. Therefore, the problem needs to be examined from political, cultural, social and technological perspective. To evaluate the significant factors correlated with IT Governance adoption, a questionnaire survey of 150 Albanian citizen was subjected in a case study interview at Epoka University. Each of the administered structured questionnaires consisted of knowledge question demanding the respondent to answer with yes, no and don't know options. Also, the questionnaire consisted of questions regarding perceived tax compliance and fairness where the answers ranged from strongly agree to disagree strongly. The liability functions in the SPSS 13 were used to test the correlation matrix and multiple regression of the survey measure. There is a positive relationship between knowledge, age, and income in citizen's attitude towards IT governance.

For this purpose, research investigating the relationship between retailers and their retail environment, consumers, competition, and sourcing in an attempt to estimate the impact of the mentioned factors on clothing retailing in the Czech Republic was conducted in 2014. There were more than 400 clothing retailers contacted in selected towns representing all five town population categories in different regions of the Czech Republic The research included different formats of clothing shops - department store and hypermarket, mid-range clothing store, boutique, discount and second-hand stores located, in small and large towns. Consumer income and social factors were considered to have the greatest impact on changes in clothing retailing followed by the mix of factors related to retail competition and consumers' needs, behaviour and store perception. Major factors influencing activities of clothing retailing in 2007-2012 identified by factor analysis were consumers, political and legislative environment, social and economic environment, and competition (domestic and foreign). The impact of these factors on clothing retailing varied to some extent by town categories and retailers' background characteristics. The development of clothing retailing was influenced by consumers, political, legislative, social and economical factors to a great extent mainly in small and medium-size towns. In terms of the retail characteristics used in the analysis, it seems that different retail formats perceived different factors to have the main impact on their retail operations. Large retailers with more than 100 employees considered consumers to affect their business to a great extent Retailers employing 26-50 employees stated that consumers, social and economical environment and competition had influenced their activities to the great extent Small clothing retailers with annual turnover of less than CZK 2 million considered social and economic factors to influence their business to the greater extent than other clothing retailers.","[Simova, Jozefina] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Simová, J (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt & Trade, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",jozefina.simova@tul.cz,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,122,131,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000012,0

The appearance of new markets and the diversification and increase in food demand entailed, on the one hand, higher earnings for merchants and, on the other hand, the need to identify new suppliers or the increase in the quantities delivered by the traditional processors. Comtition on the food market becomes manifest mainly in price evolution, the decrease in prices being achieved by legal or illegal means and by compromises made in point of product quality. For the consumer, especially the uneducated one, the appearance of new suppliers or products may be risky, especially if the main purchasing criterion is the price of the product. For national or regional authorities the increase in the quantity of food from the market and in the number of players imposes the finding of new ways to comply with the law and protect the consumer. Although there have already been taken a series of measures at a regional or national level, the food market is still facing a series of problems regarding product fraud. The fraudulent undertakings in the food domain may bring important financial benefits for those who practise them, but they are illegal and they can affect consumer safety and may lead to a number of risks both for the consumer and for the food market. Except the horse meat scandal, which was an important issue, Romania is characterised by minor incidents in the food fraud domain. The article proposes a comprehensive analysis of the food incidents from Romania in the last few years and an adequate analysis of the international context. Although joining the EU led to a number of benefits for Romania and to a complex legislative system in the food safety domain, there have still been some critical situations in the food chain.","[Stanciu, Silvius] Univ Galatzi, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Stanciu, S (通讯作者)，Univ Galatzi, Galati, Romania.",silvius.stanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968",,,,,7,0,0,0,19,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2418,2426,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700249,0

Previous papers have already addressed the limitations of the FAA's uni-dimensional method, and proposed new approaches that take into account the two dimensions of hubbing activity, i.e., traffic generation and connectivity. However, these studies are biased by the lack of detailed demand data on international connections. Using an MIDT dataset comprising a sample of domestic and international markets served by US airports during the first quarter of 2013, this paper aims at providing a full picture on the pitfalls of the existing FAA method, as well as addressing the impact of international connectivity in characterising the airports' hubbing profiles. Hierarchical clustering is used to provide alternative criteria for hub classification within the context of US National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). This new typology of primary US airports can help to optimize AIP funding by allowing for further differentiation in the FAA allocation criteria. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Firms in emerging economies are increasingly looking towards internationalisation since they are faced with rising competition in their domestic markets and attracted to opportunities in foreign markets. This article investigates international entrepreneurship by examining how the influence of entrepreneurial intensity and capabilities at the firm level influence performance, while at the same time considering environmental influences on this relationship. Based on past theoretical and empirical findings, hypotheses are formulated and then tested using correlational and regression analysis. Generally, the results support the hypotheses where both entrepreneurial intensity and capabilities are positively related to internationalisation and firm performance, while weak evidence is found for environmental hostility as a moderating influence. Several recommendations are made in light of the findings, where it is suggested that firms foster higher levels of innovativeness, risk-taking and proactiveness while developing human, social and technology related capabilities in order to enhance their performance and increase their levels of internationalisation.","[Urban, Boris; Sefalafala, Mpho R.] Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Urban, B (通讯作者)，Wits Business Sch, Johannesburg, South Africa.",,"urban, boris/Q-1768-2019","Urban, Boris/0000-0002-6212-0169",,,,,52,8,9,0,35,AOSIS,Durbanville,"Postnet Suite 110, Private Bag x 19, Durbanville, SOUTH AFRICA",1015-8812,2222-3436,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We utilize a pure multiple mean break model to identify the possibility of structural breaks in the daily realized volatility series by employing the intraday high-frequency data of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and the five sectoral stock indices in Chinese stock markets for the period 4 January 2000 to 30 December 2011. We then conduct both in-sample tests and out-of-sample forecasts to examine the effects of structural breaks on the performance of ARFIMAX-FIGARCH models for the realized volatility forecast by utilizing a variety of estimation window sizes designed to accommodate potential structural breaks. The results of the in-sample tests show that there are multiple breaks in all realized volatility series. The results of the out-of-sample point forecasts indicate that the combination forecasts with time-varying weights across individual forecast models estimated with different estimation windows perform well. In particular, nonlinear combination forecasts with the weights chosen based on a non-parametric kernel regression and linear combination forecasts with the weights chosen based on the non-negative restricted least squares and Schwarz information criterion appear to be the most accurate methods in point forecasting for realized volatility under structural breaks. We also conduct an interval forecast of the realized volatility for the combination approaches, and find that the interval forecast for nonlinear combination approaches with the weights chosen according to a non-parametric kernel regression performs best among the competing models.

Secure house was the most prominent sustainable housing concept used by housing developers, mostly through the development of gated and guarded housing. The developments were concentrated in Johor Bahru City Centre, and mostly in the form of double storey houses with prices above MYR200,000.

This research assesses the geographic distribution of cycling infrastructure with regard to community demographic characteristics to assess claims that cycling investment arrives in tandem with incoming populations of privilege or is targeted towards neighborhoods with existing socioeconomic wealth. Using census and municipal cycling infrastructure data in Chicago and Portland from 1990 to 2010, we create demographic and cycling infrastructure investment indices at the census tract level. Linear regressions estimate the extent to which existing community demographics and change in demographics associated with gentrification are related to cycling infrastructure investment. In both cities, we identify a bias towards increased cycling infrastructure investment in areas of existing or increasing privilege. This paper suggests that marginalized communities are unlikely to attract as much cycling infrastructure investment without the presence of privileged populations, even when considering population density and distance to down-town, two motivators of urban cycling. To alleviate the continuation of inequitable distributions of cycling investments, planning processes may actively seek out diverse stakeholders and be sensitive to citywide community input and stated needs in future transportation projects.

While much attention has been paid to negative experiences of minorities in the workplace, it also has the potential to be an important site of prejudice reduction. In response, drawing on original quantitative and qualitative data, this article explores the encounters of socially different groups in the workplace. It demonstrates that workplaces can promote meaningful encounters. However, cases of positive encounter with difference were often discussed at the level of the individual, with reference to specific people and friendships, rather than towards the minority group to which the individual belonged. As such, these positive encounters were often superficial with underlying tensions still existing between different groups in the workplace.","[Harris, Catherine] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Valentine, Gill] Univ Sheffield, Dept Geog, Winter St, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",University of Birmingham; University of Sheffield,"Harris, C (通讯作者)，Univ Birmingham, Birmingham Business Sch, Birmingham, W Midlands, England.",c.e.harris@bham.ac.uk; G.Valentine@Sheffield.ac.uk,,"Harris, Catherine/0000-0002-3636-3650",European Research Council [249658],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),"Our thanks go to Aneta Piekut for her analysis of the survey material, and to the two anonymous reviewers for their very helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.

The research model is examined via mail survey data of adult consumers using structural equations modelling. The findings indicate that perceived benefits and moral intensity significantly influence attitudes, while the impact of performance risk is negligible. The attitude and moral intensity significantly predict the purchase intention. Our analyses confirm rationalization as a salient factor moderating the relationship between attitude and behavioral intention. Based on this pattern of results, we discuss study implications in three areas: the perception of positive consequences for oneself, the perception of consequences for others, and the use of previously rarely examined consumer justifications. The finding that performance risk is not significant in affecting consumer attitude calls into question various appeals featuring adverse effects of buying counterfeits for an individual.","[Kos Koklic, Mateja; Vida, Irena] Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia",University of Ljubljana,"Kos Koklic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Ljubljana, Fac Econ, Kardeljeva Ploscad 17, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia.",mateja.kos@ef.uni-lj.si; irena.vida@ef.uni-lj.si,"Koklic, Mateja Kos/N-5778-2017",,,,,,42,1,1,2,21,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

To achieve this goal, they are looking to maintain or even improve their level of service. This is very hard, since traffic congestion is normally increasing. As a result, bus travel times are higher and less reliable, which makes harder to predict travel times and avoid bunching. Being able to accurately predict bus travel speeds and update this prediction with real-time information could improve the quality and reliability of the information given to users, and increase the effectiveness of control schemes. In this work we implement and compare different machine learning methods (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines and Bayes Networks) to predict bus travel speeds using real-time information about traffic conditions. The proposed algorithms are compared against two common approaches used to predict travel speeds. In order to feed our models, we apply traffic shockwaves theory to select our predictors. The input data used in each model was the speed obtained and processed from GPS devices installed in each of the buses from Transantiago, the public transportation system from Santiago, Chile. Two types of speed were available: historical speed and a real-time speed, each for a given route segment and day period. Our results show that machine learning algorithms can outperform naive predictions that use either only historical data or only real-time data with a 10-min delay. In particular, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm achieved the best results, obtaining improvements of up to 23% in the root mean square error (RMSE) compared with the best benchmark model, and up to 3.3% in the RMSE versus the second best machine learning algorithm studied. Moreover, we validated our hypothesis that real-time data helps improve the accuracy of predictions up to 35% in the RMSE. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Many organizations are developing campaigns and activities to promote bicycle riding. However, most Thai people do not enjoy riding bicycles. Thus, this study aims to understand the motivational components and compare the different motivations for bicycle riding in various areas using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Six factors were considered: self-development, contemplation, exploration, physical challenge, stimulus seeking, and social interaction. The samples used in this study were 798 Thai tourists. The results of the second-order CFA indicate that six factors indicated motivation to ride bicycles at these tourist attractions at a statistical significance of 0.01. Moreover, the invariance analysis of the model parameters for the two areas through chi-square difference testing shows that factor loadings, intercepts, and the structural path have different values for tourist attractions in the mountains and those by the sea at a statistical significance of 0.01. Thus, models for tourist attractions in the mountain and those by the sea should be developed separately to determine suitable policies for these areas. Consequently, the government sectors and other involved organizations should use these indicators to develop more precise and suitable policies to promote bicycle riding for targeted groups. The CFA loadings obtained from this study can be used for ranking the priority of improving motivation for riding bicycles. Regarding mountain tourist attractions, contemplation was the factor having maximum CFA loading (beta=0.935), followed by exploration (beta=0.900). For sea tourist attractions, contemplation was the factor having the highest CFA loadings equal 0.992 followed by stimulus seeking (beta=0.937). (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We test our theoretical conjectures by drawing on the population of sequels that were running in the US between 1992 and 2011. The empirical results point to the explanatory power of the proposed framework. Film executives may use our findings to improve the profitability of their sequel productions. From a theoretical point of view, consumption capital theory allows for a more refined analysis of sequel performance along different dimensions.

In this paper we analyze the results of a discrete choice survey administered to members of a leading North American carsharing organization. We quantify how carsharing users value price, distance from them, schedule and vehicle type. We find that for an average user, traveling one mile for a vehicle or rescheduling a trip by up to one hour are each approximately equivalent to a US $2/hour increase in vehicle price. We find that carsharing acts as a conduit to introduce users to new vehicle technology: more than half users report having driven a Hybrid vehicle through carsharing, representing 400 users exposed for every one Hybrid vehicle in service. All else being equal, users most prefer Hybrid vehicles. Users who report driving longer distances prefer not to take either electric vehicles or Plug-in Hybrids, despite the fact that Plug-in Hybrids do not have significant range limitations.

We find that the welfare only hypothesis has little explanatory power. The district demand model explains the investment volume in rail projects, while the swing voter model explains road investment better. Lobbying does not seem to have any impact on the investment volume.

At the same time, transport continues to be a major source of harmful emissions. Telework has been suggested as a means to reduce unnecessary work-related travel, including the daily commute. Telework occurs when Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are applied to enable work be accomplished at a distance from the location where results are needed. However, despite its promising nature and early optimist predictions, telework has largely failed to capture management and workers' attention and imagination. Using a multi-level perspective (MLP) on sociotechnical transitions approach, this study reveals why telework continues to remain a 'niche' practice dominated by a small set of industries, managers and workers. The paper builds on MLP thinking with a view to highlighting behavioural, cultural, and political aspects of socio-technical transitions and their interactions, which are frequently limited in classical MLP thinking. The failure to enrol additional niche-actors, the dominance of traditional forms of working and automobility, and the absence of policy and lack of legitimacy, all act negatively to keep telework from emerging from the niche to the regime level and becoming established as a more mainstream practice.

Literature, however, doubts these positive expectations because arbitration uses an adversarial intervention mode and does not allow consumer control of process and outcome. The results of a field experiment in the context of the Dutch Foundation for Disputes Committees diminish some of the doubts raised about arbitration: (1) complainants are more committed to the decision after the hearing, even though they are less convinced the decision is going to be in their favor, (2) complainants remain intent on never visiting the service provider again, but (3) complainants feel more in control, even though they have ceded control to the third party.","[Joosten, Herm; Bloemer, Josee M.

It also studies how actual accesses to the judiciary result, in turn, in the establishment of further precedent that is able to affect the behavior of new prospective plaintiffs. The analysis is based on a micro-founded Bayesian learning model. The dynamic model shows that precedent, indeed, can rectify biased beliefs. However, the rectification power significantly depends upon both the merit of the case and the stickiness of subjective beliefs. The results highlight that although plaintiffs learn from precedent, under some circumstances meritorious causes of action hardly proceed through the court, or can even disappear from the court after an initial positive trend; on the other hand, frivolous claims can continue to flourish.","[Rampa, Giorgio] Univ Pavia, Pavia, Italy; [Saraceno, Margherita] Univ Milano Bicocca, Milan, Italy",University of Pavia; University of Milano-Bicocca,"Saraceno, M (通讯作者)，Univ Milano Bicocca, Dept Econ Management & Stat, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi 8, I-20126 Milan, Italy.",margherita.saraceno@unimib.it,,"SARACENO, MARGHERITA/0000-0003-3461-4863","Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme at the Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics, University of Amsterdam [298470]","Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme at the Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics, University of Amsterdam","This research was supported by a Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship within the 7th European Community Framework Programme (grant no. 298470, at the Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics, University of Amsterdam).

The provision requires judges to recognize homemakers' contribution to their marriages in dividing marital properties at divorce. I model the marital decisions of couples as a sequential game, in which the potential wife's decision in whether to marry and specialize in home production depends on whether she is legally protected by the homemaking provision, as the law would reinforce her post-divorce property rights and therefore increase her bargaining power within the marriage. I use the variation in the timing of the passage of the homemaking provision to identify its effect on marriage.

However, the empirical evidence on the effects of EM on recidivism (relative to prison) is very scarce worldwide. Our empirical strategy exploits the incremental rollout of EM in France, which started as a local experiment in four courts in 2000-2001 and was later adopted by an increasing number of courts. Our instrumental variables estimates show that fully converting prison sentences into EM has long-lasting beneficial effects on recidivism, with estimated reductions in the probability of reconviction of 6-7 percentage points (9-11 percent) after 5 years. The presence of heterogeneous effects suggests that both rehabilitation and deterrence are important factors in reducing long-term recidivism and that EM can be a very cost-effective alternative to short prison sentences.","[Henneguelle, Anais] Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, Paris, France; [Monnery, Benjamin] Univ Lyon, Lyon, France; [Kensey, Annie] Minist Justice, Lyon, France",Universite Paris Saclay,"Henneguelle, A (通讯作者)，Ecole Normale Super Paris Saclay, Paris, France.",,,,,,,,40,27,35,2,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

This paper argues that exploring this optimal span and its influence on local synergy creation calls for understanding the interaction between cluster actions, local conditions for collaboration, and heterogeneity requirements over time. For this purpose, a longitudinal case study is conducted, tracing the development of a digital creative cluster that has experienced the initiation, rise, and decline of local technological heterogeneity exploitation. By applying institutional logics as a sensitising device, the analysis explores how actors interact with local and theme structures in this process. Findings show how hub-firms draw on creative norms and technologies to produce situated heterogeneity requirements. These are assessed with co-location factors and accumulated experience of local collaboration to produce local organising rationales that guides decisions to engage in local collaboration.","[Skog, Daniel A.] Umea Univ, Dept Informat, Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Skog, DA (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Informat, Umea, Sweden.",daniel.a.skog@informatik.umu.se,"Skog, Daniel A/AGL-2922-2022","Skog, Daniel A/0000-0003-2492-4171",,,,,44,6,6,2,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

In 1996, Congress enacted welfare reform legislation, which imposed strict restrictions on welfare eligibility for noncitizens. However, a number of states restored access to welfare benefits to immigrants that had been cut out in the federal welfare reform law. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we examine whether immigrant women adjusted their childbearing in response to changes in the generosity of welfare benefits at the state-level. We find that noncitizen women reduced their fertility in response to cutbacks imposed by the legislation. Our findings, which prove robust to a number of identification and robustness checks, underscore how immigrants respond to state-level policies and provide insight into the potential impacts of comprehensive immigration reform, particularly the components related to the path to citizenship and access to public benefits.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, 5500 Campanile Dr,Nasatir Hall 310, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] IZA, 5500 Campanile Dr,Nasatir Hall 310, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Averett, Susan L.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Econ, 111 Quad Dr, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Averett, Susan L.] IZA, 111 Quad Dr, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Bansak, Cynthia A.] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Bansak, Cynthia A.] IZA, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; Lafayette College; Saint Lawrence University,"Bansak, CA (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA.;Bansak, CA (通讯作者)，IZA, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; averetts@lafayette.edu; cbansak@stlawu.edu,"Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020; Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X;",,,,,30,4,5,0,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Prices of goods and services have declined in similar magnitudes. We highlight that the channel through which the price declines take place is the informal labor market. Syrian refugees supply inexpensive informal labor and, thus, substitute the informal native workers especially in informal-labor intensive sectors. We document that prices in these sectors have fallen by around 4 %, while the prices in the formal labor-intensive sectors have almost remained unchanged.

The financially mediated restructuring of Detroit, through the imposition of emergency management by the state of Michigan and subsequently through the federal bankruptcy code, has been portrayed as an extreme event, with deep roots in histories of deindustrialization, racial exclusion, and suburban flight. It is not to downplay the significance of this experience to suggest, however, that the Detroit case also represents an ordinary crisis of a faltering regime of financialized urbanism. Compounding a shift toward entrepreneurial urban governance, cities now find themselves in an operating environment that has been constitutively financialized. Bondholder-value disciplines have become systemic in reach, along with an amplified role for financial gatekeepers like credit rating agencies; technocratic forms of financial management have been spreading and deepening, both in supposedly normal times and under externally imposed emergency measures; and in some cities the routinized play of growth-machine politics is being eclipsed by a new generation of debt-machine dynamics. While the ultimate focus of this article is on Detroit, its chief concern is with the framing of the city's storied financial crisistheoretically and then institutionally.","[Peck, Jamie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada; [Whiteside, Heather] Univ Waterloo, Dept Polit Sci, 200 Univ Ave West, Waterloo, ON N2L 3G1, Canada",University of British Columbia; University of Waterloo,"Peck, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",jamie.peck@ubc.ca; h2whiteside@uwaterloo.ca,"Peck, Jamie/A-9072-2009",,SSHRC; Canada Research Chair programs,SSHRC(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); Canada Research Chair programs(Canada Research Chairs),"For helpful discussions and suggestions around the issues in this article, we are especially grateful to Josh Akers, Brett Christophers, Lucas Kirkpatrick, and Bob Lake, as well as to Jim Murphy and the reviewers at Economic Geography.

Unlike container ships, most trampers have no regular schedule and sailing route; therefore, tramp shipping companies rarely rent berths for their trampers. It is common for trampers to queue at the anchorage while waiting for vacant berths for loading and unloading. This is inefficient for both the shipping company and the port authority. To solve this problem, this study establishes an optimal pricing model under the condition of shared-use berths. In the proposed model, the frequency and headway at which trampers arrive at the anchorage follow the Poisson and Exponential distributions, respectively. In addition, the confidence interval is calculated to obtain an accurate number of arrivals during the queuing period.

Five macroeconomic variables are included in affine term structure model, derived under the arbitrage-free restriction, to evaluate their role in the in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting of the term structure. We show that the relationship between the macroeconomic factors and yield data has an intuitive interpretation, and that there is interdependence between the yield and macroeconomic factors. Moreover, the macroeconomic factors significantly improve the forecast performance of the model. The affine Nelson-Siegel type models outperform the benchmark simple time series forecast models. The out-of-sample predictability of the affine Nelson-Siegel model with macroeconomic factors for the short horizon is superior to the simple affine yield model for all maturities, and for longer horizons the former is still compatible to the latter, particularly for medium and long maturities.

Expected utility theory holds that an intelligent and well-informed agent ('economic man') will make choices that maximize his expected utility, which by implication means avoiding choice patterns that would make him (her hereafter) vulnerable in competitive markets-for instance, to be money pumped, or make intransitive choices or choices that could be reversed by reframing. Research in two disparate schools has found that people commit a number of apparent violations of the maximizing principle. These traditions have formed the two legs on which BE stands: behavioral and cognitive. During the 1970s and 1980s, both schools found anomalies in expected utility theory that called for new approaches. The behavioral school revealed anomalies in choice as a function of intertemporal differences in motivation, thus creating the topics of dynamic inconsistency and hyperbolic and quasihyperbolic delay discounting. The cognitive school revealed anomalies in choice as a function of cognitive framing, which are summarized in prospect theory. These anomalies have remained the cardinal phenomena of BE. Critics have called the resulting literature 'a ragbag', but I argue that the 12 best-known framing effects have coherent motivational roots. Most anomalies that persist after reflection can be understood as strategies in intertemporal bargaining, for maximizing hyperbolically discounted utility (or reward). Published 2015.

Entrepreneurs enter a market and then make investment decisions to capture value. Payoffs depend on both strategic risk (i.e., the investments of other entrepreneurs) and natural risk (i.e., luck). Absent natural risk, participants endogenously sort themselves into entrepreneurial and safe types, and returns from the two paths converge. Adding natural risk fundamentally changes these conclusions: Here we observe excessive entry and excessive investment so that entrepreneurs earn systematically less than the outside option. These payoff differences persist even after many repetitions of the task. With a risky outside option, entry further increases and about one-third of entrepreneurs adopt a passive strategy, investing little or nothing. Finally, we examine an environment where an individual must become an entrepreneur but chooses the stakes over which she will compete. Due to under-entry and under-investment in the high stakes setting, the returns gap grows to over 15 percentage points. A two-factor model incorporating loss aversion and love of winning can rationalize these returns patterns.","[Morgan, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Morgan, John] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Orzen, Henrik] Univ Mannheim, Dept Econ, D-68131 Mannheim, Germany; [Sefton, Martin] Univ Nottingham, Sch Econ, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Sisak, Dana] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Sisak, Dana] Erasmus Univ, Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of California System; University of California Berkeley; University of Mannheim; University of Nottingham; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Tinbergen Institute,"Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Haas Sch Business, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.;Morgan, J (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Econ, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",morgan@haas.berkeley.edu,,"Sefton, Martin/0000-0002-1327-7311; Sisak, Dana/0000-0001-5358-4511",National Science Foundation; Swiss National Science Foundation; ESRC [ES/K002201/1]; ESRC [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K002201/1] Funding Source: researchfish,National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Financial support from the National Science Foundation and the Swiss National Science Foundation is gratefully acknowledged.

Panel data approach and Bayesian techniques are employed to solve the problem of a short set of data (2008-2014). The panel data approaches (panel vector-autoregressive model and Bayesian random effect models) identified a reciprocal and positive relationship between FDI and economic growth in EU-28 starting with 2008. The individual approach based on Bayesian linear regressions identified this tendency as being specific for most of the EU-28 countries. However, there are some countries for which higher FDI did not generate economic growth and some countries where higher GDP did not attract more FDI and FDI did not bring economic growth. According to cluster analysis, the disparities among countries regarding the FDI distribution according to GDP growth and GDP rate distribution according to FDI diminished in 2014 compared to 2008. The basic conclusion is that on overall in the European Union there was a reciprocal relationship between economic growth and FDI since the beginning of the crisis with a tendency of reducing disparities between countries in attracting FDI.","[Simionescu, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ Cybernet & Stat, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Simionescu, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania; [Simionescu, Mihaela] Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania",Romanian Academy of Sciences; Romanian Academy of Sciences; Romanian Academy of Sciences,"Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ Cybernet & Stat, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.;Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Econ, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.;Simionescu, M (通讯作者)，Romanian Acad, Inst Econ Forecasting, Calea 13 Septembrie 13,Dist 5, Bucharest 050711, Romania.",mihaela_mb1@yahoo.com,"Simionescu, Mihaela/AAP-7639-2021; Simionescu, Mihaela/L-1249-2016","Simionescu, Mihaela/0000-0002-6124-2172",,,,,37,40,42,0,23,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

One way to address this problem is to enhance the performance of the transport system by means of sound public transportation that is capable of appropriately addressing the demand of travelers, especially in highly urbanized areas of the world. The implementation of shared-ride transportation has been a viable transportation solution in many areas. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the market demand potential of a Shared-Ride Taxi (SRT) service in an organization-based context. It presents an integrated choice and latent variable modeling framework for modeling the number of times per week a Shared-Ride Taxi would be used if it were implemented at an organization. The study involves extensive analysis of practical policy scenarios through which the impact of cost incentives (subsidies) and multiple SRT attributes on travelers' behavior is examined. Using stated preference data, the model is applied to a case study of the students at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon. Research results are expected to provide an initial evaluation of the market potential for a Shared-Ride Taxi in a university setting in Lebanon. Results reveal that 30-50% of the students are willing to utilize the Shared-Ride Taxi service under practical scenarios and that subsidies are likely to play a key role in increasing the SRT ridership.

To obtain a more frequent measure, I present a state space method that uses time-stamped survey responses as its daily measurements and the population distribution of expectations as the latent state. Augmenting the method with financial variables that measure expectations indirectly (e.g., bond yields) facilitates measurement at times when no responses are observed. An application to a survey of German financial experts shows that my method is successful for forecasting future responses. Additional analyses show that its daily estimates react in economically plausible ways to both major events, such as the September 2008 crash of Lehman Brothers, and regular releases of economic indicators.

This is a critical point in the lifecycle, as a generic form of the product is then introduced into the market, while the branded form is still available for prescription. Forecasting the numbers of units of branded and generic forms of pharmaceuticals dispensed is becoming increasingly important, due to their huge market value and the limited number of new 'blockbuster' branded drugs, as well as the imposed cost for national healthcare systems like the NHS. In this paper, eleven methods are used to forecast drug time series, including diffusion models (Bass model & RPDM), ARIMA, exponential smoothing (Simple and Holt), naive and regression methods. ARIMA and Holt produce accurate short term (annual) forecasts for branded and generic drugs respectively, while for the more strategic horizons of 2-5 years ahead, naive with drift provides the most accurate forecasts.

J,"Nyström, J; Nilsson, JE; Lind, H",,,,"Nystrom, Johan; Nilsson, Jan-Eric; Lind, Hans",,,Degrees of freedom and innovations in construction contracts,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Contracting; Innovation; Design and build; Design; Bid and build,PERFORMANCE; AUCTIONS,"DB (Design and build) and DBB (Design-bid-build) represent two different contracting forms in construction. The first provides the contractor degrees of freedom in design, which enables innovation. DBB is the safe and traditional contracting form, where the client is responsible for the design and the contractor builds accordingly. Using a case study approach of five Swedish road construction projects, the present paper compares these contracting forms in terms of innovation. In this, the client's labelling of a contract being DB or DBB is taken at face value. It is established that the actual degrees of freedom for the contractors are highly restricted and that no important difference can be seen between the contracting forms regarding innovation. This implies that it is no reason to expect more innovation simply by labelling contracts as DB. Rational explanations for the usage of DB-contracts with bounds on the degrees of freedom are also suggested. Policy implications for promoting innovation in infrastructure contracting finalise the study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show that efficiency measures at aggregate level reflect both the student's effort and the characteristics of the institution to which they belong, suggesting that they might lead to ambiguous results.

First, the theory of urban/local governance is introduced, based on an urban co-governance matrix. A new type of regulatory system is then described that aims at transforming people in distributed nodes of collective action. Citizens and institutions can be myriad nodes of designing and problem solving in the public interest. Urban co-governance aims at taking advantage of this galaxy of networks. I then examine design principles and a methodology to implement the urban co-governance matrix. The concluding question concerns the need for a new research methodology to investigate the ongoing process of state transformation and institutional genesis at the urban level.","[Iaione, Christian] Guglielmo Marconi Univ Rome, Publ Law, Rome, Italy; [Iaione, Christian] Fordham Univ, Urban Law Ctr, Bronx, NY 10458 USA",Guglielmo Marconi University; Fordham University,"Iaione, C (通讯作者)，Guglielmo Marconi Univ Rome, Publ Law, Rome, Italy.;Iaione, C (通讯作者)，Fordham Univ, Urban Law Ctr, Bronx, NY 10458 USA.;Iaione, C (通讯作者)，LUISS, Governance Commons, LabGov Lab GOVernance Commons, Rome, Italy.",,,,,,,,75,54,56,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

From out of the 336 law firms in our sample, we determine the top law firms based on their popularity with informed plaintiffs as well as their proven ability to obtain large attorneys' fees awards. We find that the presence of a top plaintiffs' law firm is significantly and positively associated with a higher probability of lawsuit success. These results hold even after instrumenting for unobserved case quality, given that top law firms likely can obtain better cases with higher chances of success. This success appears to stem from the fact that top plaintiffs' law firms are significantly more active in prosecuting cases than other plaintiffs' law firms: they file more documents in the cases they litigate and they are more likely to bring injunction motions to enjoin a transaction. Defendants are also less likely to file a motion to dismiss cases filed by top plaintiffs' law firms. Our results inform the debate over shareholder litigation as well as provide courts guidance for selecting lead counsel in shareholder class action litigation.","[Krishnan, C. N.

The authors advance that the primary similarities between these three style of leadership is the importance of the positive moral vision and the focus on the follower's development. Transformational leadership allows the development of commitment to organizational goals and the empowerment of followers to achieve the objectives. The main objective of the servant leadership is to serve and meet the requirements of others. The authentic leadership recognizes the importance of the role of internalized moral perspective and its development. Thereafter, several distinguished differences between these three styles of leadership are advanced.

By using micro-level longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we apply a wide variety of discrete choice static and dynamic panel models to analyse the decision to remit. Our results provide evidence in favour of an intertemporal strategy. The persistence in remittance decisions is significantly influenced by true state dependence: migrants that remitted in the previous year have a significantly higher propensity to remit this year as well. We also show that remittance time patterns depend on both observable and unobservable individual socioeconomic characteristics, and in particular, that the household's transnational composition plays an important role in determining remittance behaviour.","[Bettin, Giulia; Lucchetti, Riccardo] Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, I-60123 Ancona, Italy; [Bettin, Giulia; Lucchetti, Riccardo] Univ Politecn Marche, MoFiR, I-60123 Ancona, Italy",Marche Polytechnic University; Marche Polytechnic University,"Bettin, G (通讯作者)，Univ Politecn Marche, Dipartimento Sci Econ & Sociali, Ple Martelli 8, I-60123 Ancona, Italy.",g.bettin@univpm.it; r.lucchetti@univpm.it,"BETTIN, GIULIA/AAF-4345-2021; Lucchetti, Riccardo/O-9754-2015","BETTIN, GIULIA/0000-0001-6711-0253; Lucchetti, Riccardo/0000-0002-0401-3445",,,,,88,8,8,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

Granger causality test also confirm the co-integration results indicating the existence of causality between agricultural output and economic growth in Nigeria. The nature of the causality however depends on the variable used to measure Agricultural output. The paper therefore recommends that government should further strengthen agricultural policies in the area of funding, storage facilities, and market access to enhance agricultural production.

The results presented in charts describe that there are two types of Brazil, and education in Brazil presents the best results in the early school years and decreases according to the years advance. Another important point is that the best results are concentrated in the South, Southeast and Midwest, and education issues in Brazil has been discussed in two apparently contradictory ways: as a solution to the major issues of the country and as a problem that kill remains. In this scenario, pledges of change and solutions to the historical bottlenecks and barriers to the development of education in Brazil are proposed. However, strategies to move towards solutions cannot be derived from established general formulas, and results will be superficial and not achievable if there is not a well-structured planning or well-targeted resources.","[da Silva, Luciano Ferreira; de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo Jose] Pontificia Univ Catolica Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Fernandes, Karina Ribeiro; Braga, Paloma Lima; Moreira, Eline Dias; da Silva, Luciano Ferreira] Univ Nove Julho UNINOVE, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo; Universidade Nove de Julho,"Fernandes, KR (通讯作者)，Univ Nove Julho UNINOVE, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",karinapagani@uninove.br; paloma240692@hotmail.com; eline@uninove.br; lf_silvabr@yahoo.com.br; arnoldodehoyos@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,21,0,0,1,1,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,1280,1288,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400214,0

The analysis was conducted on the basis of the decomposition of the rate of return on sales and in conjunction with the system of indicators linking the return on sales to return on assets and equity. In addition, in order to identify the significance of individual components of the ROE system, ordered logit regression models were estimated. The proposed in the paper system of decomposition of the return on equity has allowed a multidimensional analysis of profitability determinants. Its implementation in the food industry sectors, using the logit regression models of ordered categories, has proven that the reasons for different ROE in the food industry sectors should be primarily sought in the ability to create value added, labour costs, rational management of financial expenses, efficient use of assets as well as in more aggressive shaping the capital structure, determining the level of financial leverage. In conclusion, the applied in the paper ordered logit model of the return on equity has proven to be a very good tool to assess the significance of the factors affecting the level of ROE rates in the food industry sectors. In addition, the proposed model apart from its applicability also possesses a practical value. It allows predicting probable scenarios of transition from a very low level of the return on equity to more favourable financial results measured with this profitability category.","[Golas, Zbigniew; Kurzawa, Izabela] Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Life Sciences,"Golas, Z (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Life Sci, Fac Econ & Social Sci, Poznan, Poland.",zbyszekg@up.poznan.pl; kurzawa@up.poznan.pl,,"Kurzawa, Izabela/0000-0003-1446-1417",,,,,29,1,1,2,11,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

These concepts are very important in today's inter organizational business world, and therefore in supply chains. In theoretical part of this article we presume that establishment and development of relationships in supply chain depends on development of trust. Trust is defined as a willingness to rely on a partner in a supply chain in whom one has confidence. The stress is on expectation that another partner can be relied on to fulfill obligations and at the same time previous experience with partners in exchange relationships are taken in the consideration. Collaborative behavior is defined as a concept where two or more organizations, which work together in a supply chains, can through complementary characteristics gain shared means and goals that could not be achieved individually. Logistics managers, purchase and sales managers, project managers and employees in logistics department were included in our survey made on primary, secondary and tertiary sector of Slovene economy. We included companies of all sizes, both local and foreign companies present in Slovenia. 118 questionnaires were completed and involved in our research. According to the demographic data, our sample is comparable to population in terms of economy branch and size of companies. The Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis demonstrate statistically significant strong correlation between trust, shared values and communication and strong negative correlation between trust and opportunistic behavior. At the end we can confirm that there is a statistically significant influence of trust on collaborative behavior in supply chains. The results clearly indicate that all factors included in research are very important for today's supply chain management.","[Kac, Sonja Mlaker; Gorenak, Lrena] Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Maribor, Slovenia; [Potocan, Vojko] Univ Maribor, Fac Econ & Business, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor; University of Maribor,"Kac, SM (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Logist, Maribor, Slovenia.",sonja.mlaker-kac@um.si; irena.gorenak@um.si; vojko.potocan@um.si,,,,,,,44,6,7,2,32,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of religiosity on Islamic brand purchase intention as compared with the effect of product involvement and value consciousness. To investigate the relationship between the variables: religiosity, value consciousness, and product involvement, an explanatory research design was employed that involved an online survey of 176 Muslim women. The final questionnaire was made up of 30 items that consisted of the measures for product involvement (10 items), value consciousness (7 items), religiosity (10 items), and purchase intention (3 items). Based on a study of Indonesian consumers in the context of toiletry product purchases, the study found that religiosity and product involvement have no significant influence on Islamic brand purchase intention. Meanwhile, it is only value consciousness that has positive and significant influences on Islamic brand purchase intention.

A certain discrepancy existing in the requirements of the information on fair value and measurement thereof, has promoted to introduction of different approaches in the practice and, reduced a comparability of the information provided in the financial reporting, which contradicts to the reliability - one of the basic principle of drafting the financial reports. Introduction of new forms of financial instruments and financial institutions during the last decade, has preconditioned a determining role of the estimated economic benefit in terms of measurement of the elements of financial reporting. This role is realized in the IFRS-13 Fair Value Measurement, by which a significant changes were made in the measurement of the elements of financial reporting. Definition of the Fair Value emphasizes that fair value is a measurement which is based upon the market data, where a priority is given to the information about the principal market, because it is characterized by the highest level and volume of the assets and the liabilities. In addition to the above, IFRS-13 Fair Value Measurement defines the meaning of the principal and convenient markets, reviews the recording of the operational and transport costs, describes in details the fair value measurement methods, introduces a concept of the fair value hierarchy, etc. It should be noted that as to the standard assets, which are the high-liquid assets, it is comparably easier to determine a fair value. But, in line with the standard assets, there exist also the unique (rare) assets, for which neither the active market nor a single deal may exist.

The RTW fault line, drawn in the 1940s and 1950s, was for a long time the sharpest spatial indicator of the divide between the union staging grounds of the industrial heartland and the much less organized and characteristically 'deregulated' South. After 1958, something like a cold war stalemate prevailed for half a century, however, with only an incremental drift to the RTW side, even as a new pattern of 'flexible' growth was incubated in the Sun Belt, as deindustrialization and trade displacement struck the Rust Belt, and as the political climate, post-Reagan, skewed decisively in favor of corporate interests. Nevertheless, the RTW line essentially held, that is, until the abrupt renewal of hostilities after 2008, following a Republican resurgence at the state and local level, coupled with a concerted, cross-country attack on a weakened labor movement led by an ideologically aligned coalition of business organizations, free-market think tanks, legal activists, and heavily bank-rolled conservative advocacy networks. The former union strongholds of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin have since gone RTW; practically every non-RTW state in the nation has witnessed the advance of this signature antiunion legislation; and a new generation of local RTW ordinances has been hatched. This article explores the implications of this sudden movement in the tectonic plates of the U.S. labor-relations system and the labor geographies that are being made (and broken) in its wake.","[Peck, Jamie] Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Peck, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",jamie.peck@ubc.ca,"Peck, Jamie/A-9072-2009",,Ford Foundation,Ford Foundation,"I am grateful to Economic Geography, Clark University, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and the Economic Geography Specialty Group of the AAG for the invitation to present the Roepke Lecture.

Problems occurring therein cannot be tracked down merely to a lack of funds. Institutional analysis based on the achievements in various fields can reveal a number of reasons for inefficiency of the system by referring to transaction costs, agency costs and costs associated with the transfer of property rights. This applies not only to relationships and contracts between the patient and the doctor, but also between all the actors involved in the process of redistribution and service. System optimization and reducing inefficiencies should be applied to contract analysis and is based on the comparative approach to indicate the best possible solution in terms of efficiency. It is important to adopt a holistic approach, draw on the achievements of different scientific disciplines, and expand the economic analysis of qualitative factors that relate to the sociological phenomena of human behavior and psychology. The identified institutional shortcomings of the current health care system cannot be remedied without applying complementary solutions that shall reduce the formation of the so-called externalities. Today, it is difficult to talk about the health services market, since many of these services are contracted without taking into account the criterion of quality and the results achieved. The existing health care system's asymmetry of information reveals a number of opportunistic behaviors and phenomena characteristic of the agency problem. An attempt to identify and assess the magnitude of transaction costs and agency costs seems to be a challenge. However, it seems to be, in addition to the governance structure and managerial competencies, the main source of inefficiency in health care in Poland.","[Plichta, Jaroslaw] Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland",Cracow University of Economics,"Plichta, J (通讯作者)，Cracow Univ Econ, Krakow, Poland.",plichtaj@uek.krakow.pl,"Plichta, Jarosław/AAC-3497-2019","Plichta, Jarosław/0000-0001-9969-9832",,,,,15,0,0,0,4,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,249,261,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_15,0.0,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100015,0

As this old golden rule of financial policy had been misused for decades, a strong majority both in the Bundestag (the Parliament) and in the Bundesrat (the second chamber) voted in favor of a provision according to which the budgets of the Federation and the Lander shall in principle be balanced without revenue from credits. The analysis begins by clarifying that the Federation, the individual Lander and also the municipalities enjoy constitutionally guaranteed budgetary autonomy. Next, an overview of the objects and procedures of budgetary planning follows, which includes an explanation of the formal requirements for incurring debt. After that, the author analyzes in detail the limits to borrowing. There are three exceptions to the principle that indebtedness is prohibited. First, the Federation - unlike the States - is afforded a structural indebtedness when revenue obtained from borrowing does not exceed 0.35 % of the nominal GDP. Second, under abnormal economic conditions, both the Federation and the Lander may finance fiscal stimulus through the financial market (but have to reduce indebtedness or create surpluses in cyclical upturns). Third, the Basic Law permits the Federation and the States to borrow in case of natural catastrophes and other unusual emergency situations. These rules do not apply to the municipalities. Separate law restricts their borrowing. Finally, the author discusses the shortcomings of the new debt brakes and the risk that the restrictive regulations will be circumvented in practice.","[Puender, Hermann] Bucerius Law Sch, Chair Publ Law Sci Publ Adm & Comparat Law, Hamburg, Germany",,"Pünder, H (通讯作者)，Bucerius Law Sch, Chair Publ Law Sci Publ Adm & Comparat Law, Hamburg, Germany.",hermann.puender@law-school.de,,,,,,,7,1,1,1,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,101,138,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_5,0.0,,,38,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000005,0

In 2009, the G20 leaders agreed to reforms in the OTC derivatives markets to achieve central clearing and, where appropriate, exchange or electronic trading of standardized OTC derivatives, along with reporting of all transactions to trade repositories and higher capital as well as margin requirements for non centrally cleared transactions. Within the European Union, these objectives have been implemented through the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR). EMIR entered into force on 16 August 2012. Reforms in the U.S. were being carried out under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reforms and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law by President Obama. Regulatory reforms have already had an impact on OTC derivatives market structures and volumes. In this paper we take a brief look at the currdent state of the OTC derivatives market reforms and analyse their potential impact.

Control charts are one of the powerful tools often used by management to achieve cost savings by minimizing process variation and reducing rework, scrap and the need for inspection. However, most of the control charts were proposed based on a deterministic shift size while in reality, practitioners may not know the shift size due to a lack of data. Therefore, this paper develops a variable sampling interval (VSI) chart to monitor the coefficient of variation (CV) with unknown shift size, thereby allowing practitioners to select optimal parameters without specifying the shift size. Optimization design strategies based on the expected average time to signal (EATS), subjected to constraints in terms of the in-control average time to signal (ATS) and in-control average sampling interval (ASI) is presented. The EATS of the chart is numerically compared with its competing charts. The VSI CV chart outperforms the Shewhart CV and synthetic CV charts, while the EWM-gamma(2) chart outperforms the VSI CV chart.

This paper seeks to shed light on the WIR money, a local money that has been in existence in Switzerland since the 1930s. We argue that it provides a shield against crises for two significant and connected reasons. First, from a 'horizontal' perspective, the WIR is a coherent economic, as well as social, project that relies on the 'melting money' principle. Second, from a 'vertical' perspective, it is based on a banking model that is anchored to a specific 'attitude' designed to manage the monetary common good. The mix between these 'horizontal' and 'vertical' perspectives is likely to be insightful for other projects like the WIR.","[Vallet, Guillaume] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Dept Econ CREG, 1221 Rue Residences, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Vallet, G (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Dept Econ CREG, 1221 Rue Residences, F-38400 St Martin Dheres, France.",guillaume.vallet@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr,,,,,,,52,7,8,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

The main purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the importance of supplier involvement in NPD, buyer-supplier relationships and their effects on buyer's NPD process, highlighting the benefits of supplier involvement, the barriers, the strategic aspects and industry aspects. These issues are addressed with a case study from the semiconductor industry. Besides helping to understand NPD in the semiconductor industry, the contribution and findings of this work are clear: the results achieved confirm the findings of studies referred in the literature review, and confirm that the semiconductor industry sector requires a closer and more complex relationship structure with suppliers, given the specificities and challenges of the sector, such as rapid technological changes, permanent innovation, global competition, reduction of cost and time-to-market cycle, increased capacity, among other.

The advantage of picture fuzzy set is easily reflecting the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments because the picture fuzzy sets are suitable for capturing imprecise, uncertain, and inconsistent information in the multiple attribute decision making analysis. Thus, the cross entropy of picture fuzzy sets, called picture fuzzy cross entropy, is proposed as an extension of the cross entropy of fuzzy sets. Then, a multiple attribute decision making method based on the proposed picture fuzzy cross entropy is established in which attribute values for alternatives are picture fuzzy numbers. In decision making process, we utilize the picture fuzzy weighted cross entropy between the ideal alternative and an alternative to rank the alternatives corresponding to the cross entropy values and to select the most desirable one(s). Finally, a practical example for enterprise resource planning system selection is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.","[Wei, Guiwu] Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China",Sichuan Normal University,"Wei, GW (通讯作者)，Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Business, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China.",weiguiwu@163.com,"Wei, Guiwu/M-4177-2015","Wei, Guiwu/0000-0001-9074-2005","National Natural Science Foundation of China [61174149, 71571128]; Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China [14YJCZH082, 15XJA630006]; construction plan of scientific research innovation team for colleges and universities in Sichuan Province [15TD0004]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China; construction plan of scientific research innovation team for colleges and universities in Sichuan Province,"The work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61174149 and 71571128 and the Humanities and Social Sciences Foundation of Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China (No. 14YJCZH082, 15XJA630006) and the construction plan of scientific research innovation team for colleges and universities in Sichuan Province (15TD0004).",,33,281,285,10,111,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Ghana actively pursues such an agenda with its ICT4AD programme that aims at developing a knowledge economy. This paper concentrates on the Ghanaian efforts to attract foreign outsourcing firms and develop local firm capacity. While the ambitions are pointed towards servicing Western markets, it is rather the domestic and regional market that attracts foreign investors to invest in the Ghanaian outsourcing sector.

There has been considerable expansion in international maritime container based trade that is requiring substantial investment in seaport capacity. The growth in demand for port services has, however, neither been even over time nor across ports making the defining of appropriate investment policies challenging. Most studies of port choice, a major factor in the demand for any individual port, focus on relatively easily quantified measures, such as financial costs, to the neglect of less tangible factors that also influence decision-making. Here we examine the role played by subjective factors, namely the preference rates in port choice, by focusing on the optimal port of call of shipping lines serving South-east Asian and European ports drawing upon trade-offs between generalized costs and preference rates. An analytic hierarchy process is employed to ascertain the subjective element. The findings confirm that subjectivity does matter in influencing port choice, and thus failure to incorporate it in policy-making can involve leaving out an important element in the management of port investment and financing.

The service area was located within the central area of Nagoya and covered 1.5 km from north to south and 2.5 km from east to west. A rental frequency model was developed using data of actual demand as well as latent or unsatisfied demand when all bicycles were rented out. The results suggested that greater activity in the central city area could be expected because of the induced travel for shopping or sightseeing. Travel behaviour changes were observed with competition between CCSs and public transit in areas with high levels of public transit service. The model results suggest that the number of trips around a station and the distance between transit stations and CCS stations are important factors in planning station locations. The calculated latent demand is about 2.8% of the explicit demand, suggesting that latent demand needs to be considered when actual data from CCSs are analysed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, there exists no pre-defined framework to guide developing countries in formulating civil aviation strategies matching their macro-environment and competitiveness levels while addressing their future vision for growth or sustainability. Instead, civil aviation planning over-look these priorities and is often dictated by local political pressures, and mostly influenced by uncoordinated foreign aid assistance. Hence, developing countries use dissimilar and un-structured approaches to reach what is known as civil aviation master plan or draft civil aviation policy. Recognizing that a problem exists in the mechanism for civil aviation planning in this part of the world, research is encouraged to highlight this substantial topic. This paper uses a scenario-based approach to study the roles played by the macro-environment and industry-level performance in realizing best-fit national civil aviation strategies. The goals are achieved through utilizing a two-stage performance benchmarking technique named Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) on country level data on a sample of 52 countries in different stages of development, followed by truncated regression. Results of the best performing countries in terms of output efficiency, indicate that the country's macro-environment and air transport sector's performance serve as guidelines to identify aviation policy elements that are considered to impact efficiency. The regression results indicate that a more liberal air services approach is said to be of positive influence on efficiency levels. Further, we show that private airports are more efficient, while public airports are even less efficient than those with mixed ownership/management model. Hence, policy makers are encouraged to adopt an efficient peer analysis approach based on influential policy elements to bridge performance gaps, achieve better operating capacity, direct and prioritize investments in the civil aviation sector.

Our results show that households hit by negative job or income shocks and without any asset to pledge are less likely to be financially included, especially in Eastern Europe.

On the one hand, this calls for identifying the decision-making processes that make the agents involved choose multi-local living arrangements to achieve their intentions. On the other hand, the socio-economic framework conditions need to be explored that induce people to select residential multi-locality as option to practise the good life'. Last but not least, the impact of the material world on the implementation of these arrangements must be considered. To the author's knowledge, a social theory comprising all aspects of residential multi-locality is still lacking. He discusses various conceptual fields that seem appropriate to provide theoretical approaches to the complexity of the phenomenon and that should be related to one another.

We make the case for the existence of disparate varieties of entrepreneurship by exploring and analyzing three distinct varieties of entrepreneurship that are prevalent but typically analyzed separately in the entrepreneurship literature: new firm start-up, self-employment, and early stage entrepreneurial activity. Using 5 years of data from 44 countries, we highlight the variation in both the conceptualization and the measurement of entrepreneurship across time and geographic context. Our results suggest that institutional factors influence the disparate varieties of entrepreneurship differently: property rights, freedom from corruption, and fewer start-up procedures are significantly positively related to nascent/new firm ownership. Property rights protection is significantly positively related to new firm start-up; tax and regulatory burden have significant positive impacts on self-employment but significantly negatively related to new firm start-up. Our findings suggest that the disparate varieties of entrepreneurship are not at all substitutes and are related in very different ways to institutional factors.","[Chowdhury, Farzana; Audretsch, David] Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA; [Terjesen, Siri] Indiana Univ, Kelley Sch Business, Dept Management & Entrepreneurship, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington; Indiana University System; IU Kelley School of Business; Indiana University Bloomington,"Chowdhury, F (通讯作者)，Indiana Univ, Sch Publ & Environm Affairs, 1315 East Tenth St, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",fchowdhu@indiana.edu; terjesen@indiana.edu; daudrets@indiana.edu,,"Audretsch, David/0000-0002-3815-7762",,,,,74,62,69,1,47,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Moreover, mixed predictions of the personality-tactic relationship have been derived from prior studies. One possible explanation is the influence of other intervening factors. In this regard, this study examines the role of withdrawal, as an intervening variable, in the negotiator personality-tactic relationship. State of withdrawal refers to the level of interest to continue with a negotiation. In a state of complete withdrawal, the interest to continue no longer exists and breakdown of the negotiation is inevitable. With the participation of practicing professionals, an experiment was used to collect data for the study. It was found that competitors are prone to withdraw and use more distributive tactics. However, this pattern changes with the composition of the dyad. If the negotiating counterpart is a cooperator, a competitor will adopt a more integrative approach. This finding reminds the importance of the personality factor in selecting members of a negotiating team.","[Chow, Pui Ting; Cheung, Sai On; Young, Chiu Yan; Wah, Chi Kit] City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",City University of Hong Kong,"Chow, PT (通讯作者)，City Univ Hong Kong, Coll Sci & Engn, Dept Architecture & Civil Engn, 83 Tat Chee Ave, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",ronnie.chow.pt@hotmail.com; saion.cheung@cityu.edu.hk,"Cheung, Sai On/B-1954-2009","Cheung, Sai On/0000-0002-8470-5192","Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China [111707]","Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China(Hong Kong Research Grants Council)","The work described in this paper was fully supported by a Grant from the Research Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project no. 111707).",,23,0,1,0,11,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

We propose to target specific elements of firms' behavior that facilitate tacit collusion by providing quantitative evidence that links these actions to an anticompetitive market outcome. We apply our approach to incidents on the Italian gasoline market, where the market leader unilaterally announced its commitment to a policy of sticky pricing and large price changes that facilitated price alignment and coordination of price changes. Antitrust policy must distinguish such active promotion of a collusive strategy from passive, best-response, alignment.

We show that in the absence of regulation, a first-best outcome is unattainable unless third-party accident costs are zero and worker effort is contractible. The optimal standard produces suboptimal solutions and depends on factors such as safety effort costs, accident technology, the distribution of accident costs across firms, workers, and third parties, and whether or not worker effort is contractible.

Previous studies attempted to resolve the paradox looking separately at the gold standard, changing monetary regimes, inflation expectations, risk and uncertainty. Our study shows Gibson paradox holds for the Netherlands 1800-2012 with real long interest rates and prices diverging after 2008. This paper offers empirical evidence (nonlinear cointegration) on the integrity of the Gibson paradox. Single factor cannot explain the paradox itself (because of its nonlinear nature) as previous studies attempted. Empirical link between long interest rates and prices is caused by complex interaction between purchasing power, liquidity, gold prices, market turnover, stocks accumulation, productivity, short-term interest rates. This approach analysis the purchasing power and price relation, resulting in firms' turnover and liquidity shifts, leading to short-term borrowings changes and pressures on interest rates in the short as well as in long-term. Actually, the model enables us to track the series of price change effects finally resulting in interest rates shifts, via a set of microeconomic and financial laws, which taken at the aggregate level could offer the Gibson paradox explanation. Further studies must explore nonlinear nature of the paradox in order to explain it. Study results have important implications for policy makers and firm governance policy.","[Skare, Marinko; Mosnja-Skare, Lorena] Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Pula 52100, Croatia",University of Juraj Dobrila Pula,"Skare, M (通讯作者)，Juraj Dobrila Univ Pula, Fac Econ & Tourism, Preradoviceva 1-1, Pula 52100, Croatia.",mskare@unipu.hr; lmosnja@unipu.hr,"Škare, Marinko/L-5504-2019; Mošnja-Škare, Lorena/ADX-5732-2022","Škare, Marinko/0000-0001-6426-3692; Mošnja-Škare, Lorena/0000-0002-0458-5603",,,,,56,2,2,0,38,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Car sharing has developed alongside significant intellectual currents exploring the attributes and effectiveness of the diverse strands of transport policy. These debates include the efficacy of behaviour change programmes to shift transport practice, the imprints of neoliberalism on transport policy, and the withdrawal of the state as active agent in shaping policy privatisation. Despite its emergence amid these debates, car sharing has largely escaped their due consideration. This paper brings car sharing and transport policy scholarship into explicit conversation. It suggests that thinking car sharing through the broader lens of transport policy can produce a richer understanding of why car sharing works, and demonstrates that the case of car sharing sheds unique light onto key contemporary debates in transport policy. We present empirical data from an in depth content analysis of car sharing policy in Sydney, Australia. This data is used to explore the ways transport policy can, and does, facilitate successful car sharing. We draw upon two key theoretical frameworks to explain this success-practice theory and public-private partnerships. We conclude with a discussion of the way this unique analysis contributes to ongoing debates about the broader contours of transport governance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the idea is more often celebrated than critically interrogated. Analysis shows the concept circulates as an idea and ideal, exemplified by industrial symbiosis and extended product life. Yet, its actual enactment is limited and fragile. Instead, circular economies are achieved mostly through global recycling networks which are the primary means by which wastes are recovered as resources. European policies eschew these circuits. Resource recovery through global recycling networks is regarded as a dirty and illegal trade. In its place, EU circular economies attempt to transform wastes into resources within the boundaries of the EU. Through an analysis of two case studies of resource recovery in the United Kingdom, we highlight the challenges that confront making circular economies within the EU, showing that these are borne of a conjuncture of politically created markets, material properties and morally defined materials circuits. We show resource recovery in the EU to be framed by moral economies, driven by discourses of ecological modernization, environmental justice and resource (in)security, the last of which connects to China's resource-intensive development.","[Gregson, Nicky; Crang, Mike] Univ Durham, Dept Geog, Durham DH1 3LE, England; [Fuller, Sara] Macquarie Univ, Dept Geog & Environm, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia; [Holmes, Helen] Univ Sheffield, Dept Phys & Astron, Sheffield S10 2TN, S Yorkshire, England",Durham University; Macquarie University; University of Sheffield,"Gregson, N (通讯作者)，Univ Durham, Dept Geog, South Rd, Durham DH1 3LE, England.",nicky.gregson@durham.ac.uk; m.a.crang@durham.ac.u; sara.fuller@mq.edu.au; h.holmes@sheffield.ac.uk,"Crang, Mike/C-8178-2011; Fuller, Sara/A-4640-2014; Gregson, Nicky/E-2167-2014","Crang, Mike/0000-0001-7678-8496; Holmes, Helen/0000-0002-4918-2007; Fuller, Sara/0000-0002-9830-1615; Gregson, Nicky/0000-0002-2796-389X",UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [RES 000-23-0007]; UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap' [EP/J501323/1]; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: researchfish; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/J501323/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/E002196/1] Funding Source: UKRI,UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap'(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),Research for this paper was supported by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) [grant number RES 000-23-0007] (The Waste of the World) and by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Council (EPSRC) 'Bridging the Gap' [grant number EP/J501323/1].,,100,356,368,8,330,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

There are two tests in transferring title, the transformation test and the disparity-of-value test. France stipulates one test; the US requires either test to be satisfied; and Germany requires both. Furthermore, not all jurisdictions award compensation to unauthorized improvers who do not gain title. The prior literature has not explored, in detail, under what conditions the accession doctrine is most efficient, nor which version of the doctrine is economically superior. This article argues that the accession doctrine is most likely to be welfare-enhancing if designed in the following ways: improvers have to conduct cost-justified verification so that bad-faith and negligently good-faith improvers do not gain title to the chattel in question. Both the transformation test and the disparity-of-value test have to be satisfied.

Hyundai had to surrender a 10% equity stake to receive technology transfer from Mitsubishi Motors in 1982. Surprisingly, this situation reversed 20 years later, in 2004, when Mitsubishi came to license Hyundai's engine technology. As of 2013, Hyundai is the 5th largest automobile manufacturer in the world, while Mitsubishi is the 14th. To explain this reversal, this study investigates the technological capability gap between Hyundai and Mitsubishi by analysing patents data (and related citations) for Hyundai and Mitsubishi to assess their technological capabilities. The study finds that Hyundai not only narrowed the technological capability gap with Mitsubishi, but also recently overtook Mitsubishi. The results suggest that Hyundai's success in the market would not be possible without its ceaseless accumulation of technological capabilities.","[Oh, Chul] Sangmyung Univ, Dept Int Trade & Business, Seoul 110743, South Korea; [Joo, Si Hyung] Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Gwangju 550757, South Korea",Sangmyung University; Chonnam National University,"Joo, SH (通讯作者)，Chonnam Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, 77 Yongbong Ro, Gwangju 550757, South Korea.",innovation@jnu.ac.kr,,,"Chonnam National University [2011-0683, 2012-1575]",Chonnam National University,"The second author acknowledges financial support received from Chonnam National University, 2011-0683 and 2012-1575.",,38,6,7,1,21,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

The consistency over countries and the causal direction of RR's so called 'stylised fact' is considered. Using multilevel models, we find that when the effect of debt on growth is allowed to vary, and linear time trends are fully controlled for, the average effect of debt on growth disappears, whilst country-specific debt relations vary significantly. Additionally, countries with high debt levels appear more volatile in their growth rates. Regarding causality, we develop a new method extending distributed lag models to multilevel situations. These models suggest the causal direction is predominantly growth-to-debt, and is consistent (with some exceptions) across countries. We argue that RR's findings are too simplistic, with limited policy relevance, whilst demonstrating how multilevel models can explicate realistically complex scenarios.","[Bell, Andrew] Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England; Univ Bristol, Ctr Multilevel Modelling, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England",University of Bristol; University of Bristol,"Bell, A (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Geog Sci, Univ Rd, Bristol BS8 1SS, Avon, England.",andrew.bell@bristol.ac.uk,"Jones, Kelvyn/ABE-8689-2020; Bell, Andrew/B-9851-2014; Johnston, Ron/A-4741-2011; Jones, Kelvyn/A-3939-2011","Jones, Kelvyn/0000-0001-8398-2190; Bell, Andrew/0000-0002-8268-5853; Johnston, Ron/0000-0003-3031-8573; Jones, Kelvyn/0000-0001-8398-2190","Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I025065/1, 1099939] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/I025065/1] Funding Source: UKRI",Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,50,25,26,0,22,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

We first show that the higher-status litigants indeed mobilized stronger legal representation and obtained more victories than the lower-status litigants. However, we submit that that the party capability theory cannot fully explain the advantages the haves enjoyed over the have-nots. Further analysis reveals that the TSC's exercise of discretionary jurisdiction also played an important role by strongly favoring the governmental litigants at the agenda-setting stage. We argue that the TSC's preference in this regard was induced by the TSC judges' self-identification as part of government.

We use a unique dataset that includes corporate governance variables related to the board size, interlocking directorships and variables related to companies' performances. The network analysis showed only some effectiveness of these reforms in slightly dispersing the web of companies.

Using a case study of Nike's CSR approach in the football manufacturing industry of Pakistan, we explore the extent to which the measures advocated in a new, emerging policy paradigm on CSR in GPNs enabled labour agency at Nike's main football supplier factory in Pakistan. We argue that while such CSR policies can create enhanced space for labour agency, that potential agency is also shaped (i) by wider economic forces within the global economy and (ii) relationships with local/national actors and regulatory frameworks. Understanding the intersection of these dimensions becomes vital to interpreting the potential for, and activation of, labour agency within CSR-influenced GPNs.","[Lund-Thomsen, Peter] Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Coe, Neil M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore",Copenhagen Business School; National University of Singapore,"Lund-Thomsen, P (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Dept Intercultural Commun & Management, Ctr Business & Dev Studies, Ctr Corp Social Responsibil, Porcelaenshaven 18 A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",plt.ikl@cbs.dk,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061",Danish Social Science Research Council [275-07-0285],Danish Social Science Research Council,"This work was supported by the Danish Social Science Research Council through a grant entitled 'Global Value Chains, Industrial Clusters, and Corporate Social Responsibility in the International Sporting Goods Industry' [Grant # 275-07-0285, 2007].

We consider a unique approach using GIS-generated county-level panel data (1993-1999 and 2010-2012) of Federal Firearms Licenses to sell small arms (FFLs) to estimate the realized demand for firearms based on the distance by road from the nearest point on the US-Mexico border. We use a time-series negative binomial model paired with a post-estimation population attributable fraction (PAF) estimator. We do so to control determinants of domestic demand. We are able to estimate a total demand for trafficking, both in terms of firearms and dollar sales for the firearms industry. We find that nearly 2.2% (between 0.9% and 3.7%) of US domestic arms sales are attributable to the US-Mexico traffic in the period 2010-2012, representing 212,887 firearms (between 89,816 and 359,205) purchased annually to be trafficked.","[McDougal, Topher L.; Shirk, David A.; Muggah, Robert; Patterson, John H.] Joan B Kroc Sch Peace Studies, San Diego, CA 92110 USA; [McDougal, Topher L.; Muggah, Robert] Grad Inst Int & Dev Studies, Ctr Conflict Dev & Peacebldg, CH-1211 Geneva 21, Switzerland; [Muggah, Robert] Inst Relacoes Int, Rio De Janeiro, RJ, Brazil",,"McDougal, TL (通讯作者)，Joan B Kroc Sch Peace Studies, 5998 Alcala Pk, San Diego, CA 92110 USA.",tlm@sandiego.edu,,"Shirk, David/0000-0002-9433-5009; McDougal, Topher/0000-0002-1079-0670",,,,,47,14,14,2,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

It does so through an analysis of the illicit commercial practices that mushroomed in postrevolutionary Iran and the ambivalent participation of established merchants (bazaaris) in the import and export of commodities through these circuits during the 1979-2005 era. Following two independent research projects on the Tehran and Qum bazaars, we adopt a multidisciplinary and relational approach to bazaars and smuggling to decipher the multiple logics. This process is assembled through networks of established bazaaris, new commercial actors, far-flung transnational buyers and diverse state officials, who both regulate trade and facilitate exchanges that are at times interpreted as smuggling by the participants themselves. Building on the growing literature on smuggling in cultural anthropology and political economy, our account demonstrates how commodities travel through channels that ultimately transgress categories such as licit and illicit, state and society, and 'honorable bazaari' and 'smuggler'. The postrevolutionary Iranian regime is a case that challenges us to examine this quasi-formal economy in the context of an institutionalized and centralized state that has adopted both state-led and neoliberal economic policies. It also forces us to situate the phenomenon of smuggling within the context of existing commercial networks and moral orders. We further reveal how bazaaris have been subjects of and subjected to the hybrid commercial order, which has both displaced the social networks that underpin bazaaris' communal obligations and norms and cast doubt on the merchants' claim to ethical standing in the eyes of one another, and left them vulnerable to criticism by leaders of the Islamic Republic.","[Erami, Narges] Yale Univ, Dept Anthropol, MacMillan Ctr Int & Area Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Keshavarzian, Arang] NYU, New York, NY 10012 USA",Yale University; New York University,"Erami, N (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Dept Anthropol, MacMillan Ctr Int & Area Studies, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",narges.erami@yale.edu; arang.keshavarzian@nyu.edu,,,Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant; Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) Grant; Yale University Junior Faculty Fellowship; Columbia University's Department of Anthropology; Niehaus Center for Governance and Globalization at Princeton University,Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant; Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) Grant; Yale University Junior Faculty Fellowship; Columbia University's Department of Anthropology; Niehaus Center for Governance and Globalization at Princeton University,"This paper draws upon research supported by a Wenner-Gren Dissertation Fieldwork Grant, a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Abroad (DDRA) Grant, a Yale University Junior Faculty Fellowship and fellowships from Columbia University's Department of Anthropology and the Niehaus Center for Governance and Globalization at Princeton University.",,76,24,26,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It shows that the hypothesis of rationality does not imply a one to one correspondence between illegal behavior and expected benefits and costs of the criminal action, since two different regimes may ensue from the threat of racketeering. These two regimes will be respectively characterized by acquiescence and no private protection activities, and by optimal private protection that will push OC into a zone of inaction. The latter outcome will correspond to a Stackelberg equilibrium of a preventive type in the sense that the action of the firm as a leader will confine OC in a zone of temporary inaction. Since the extent to which private protection will succeed in deterring the criminal is lower the higher is uncertainty, and the higher are public protection activities, switching from one regime to the other may thus be determined even by small changes in uncertainty or public protection. If public protection is below a critical level, the threat of extortion also creates incentives for the firm to enter an agreement with the criminal, by negotiating an acceptable rate of extortion. At the same time, however, higher public protection will favor a better deal for the victim in such a negotiation.","[Scandizzo, Pasquale L.] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Ventura, Marco] Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, I-00185 Rome, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Ventura, M (通讯作者)，Italian Natl Inst Stat, ISTAT, Pzza Indipendenza 4, I-00185 Rome, Italy.",scandizzo@uniroma2.it; mventura@istat.it,"Ventura, Marco/AFV-7975-2022; Scandizzo, Pasquale/HIZ-8395-2022","Ventura, Marco/0000-0003-3388-7122; Scandizzo, Pasquale/0000-0002-8824-3589",,,,,52,1,1,0,13,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The main reason for such mixed results is the choice of a single aggregate list of countries, regardless of the disparities in levels of development. This study therefore fills the development gap by disaggregating the African data into a panel of 20 middle-income and 19 low-income African countries over a period of 15 years between 1995 and 2010, and employing a dynamic generalized method of moments (GMM) model to address the dynamic nature of economic growth as well as the problems of endogeneity. The results of this study support the theoretical hypothesis that a positive relationship between aid and GDP growth exists, but only for low-income African countries, not middle-income ones. On the other hand, the study reveals that middle-income African countries tend to experience a greater impact on their economic growth from foreign direct investment (FDI) and natural resources revenues, mainly oil exports. This implies that the frequent criticism that foreign aid has not contributed to economic growth is flawed, at least in the case of low-income African countries. In fact, foreign aid has played a critical role in stimulating economic growth in such countries through supplementing domestic sources of finance such as savings, thus increasing the amount of investment and capital stock in them.","[Alemu, Aye Mengistu] SolBridge Int Sch Business, Daejeon, South Korea; [Lee, Jin-Sang] Duksung Womens Univ, Seoul, South Korea",Duksung Women's University,"Alemu, AM (通讯作者)，SolBridge Int Sch Business, Daejeon, South Korea.",,,,,,,,38,10,12,2,19,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

One of the most important goals of COT institution was the increase of economic justifiability for the distribution of profits tax revenues across the territories of the Russian Federation.

Now it has been a new era for the fast development of China's corporate pension. So it is vital to design proper corporate pension products satisfying consumers' diverse demands. From the demands perspective, this paper excerpts numerous factors according to quarterly data, such as macroeconomic factors, enterprise factors, individual factors, social factors and so on. Based on factor analysis, this article picks up several comprehensive factors and designs the sorts of corporate pension hierarchically according to them. Finally, three comprehensive factors are extracted, representing macroeconomic & individual factor, corporate factor, and substitution factor separately with decreasing importance. And then this paper classifies corporate pension into three levels: firstly, providing simple or diverse plan according to region economic development level; secondly, classifying the diverse plan into collective pension plan or industry pension plan and unique plan; thirdly, providing corporate pension plans linked both with interest rate or not. Thus, there are five different sorts of corporate pension plans in total.

Why did rural villagers adopt these forms and to what effect? Using oral history interviews conducted in the town of San Pedro Necta, this paper compares local development brokers' narratives of the DIGESA programme with village level perceptions and reactions. In order to deepen understandings of how governing assemblages gain traction in postcolonial contexts, I draw on theories that view development as a governing assemblage that operates by inciting a will to improve and as an entanglement between heterogeneous social worlds, and bring these into dialogue with theories about strategic subaltern appropriations of development. I then critically examine these perspectives in light of events in San Pedro. I describe how indigenous villagers adopted assimilationist market-oriented development as an alternative to racism, poverty and authoritarianism, and how this produced contradictory effects on grassroots political imaginaries, organizational practices and community solidarity. I argue that 'Indian advancement' wove together local empowerment with the formation of market subjectivities and the privatization of politics and social life.","[Copeland, Nicholas] Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Sociol, 225 Stanger St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Copeland, N (通讯作者)，Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Sociol, 225 Stanger St, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",ncopel@vt.edu,,,,,,,49,6,7,2,7,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

Specifically, I first explain how pro-market reforms lead to the emergence of EMNCs via international competitiveness, upgrading needs, and escape; I then explain how the global expansion of EMNCs leads to a deepening of pro-market reforms at home via learning, spillovers, and lobbying.

With the help of a qualitative methodology, the results of the analysis show that firms headquartered in countries where corruption is high have an advantage when operating in a foreign country with a similar institutional environment. The reason for this advantage is that such firms may possess knowledge of how to cope with the arbitrary and pervasive dimensions of corruption at home. On the other hand, firms from countries with lower corruption levels than the host country are more affected by corruption in a highly corrupt host country. Finally, even though this study found evidence that all firms operating in a highly corrupt country might participate in corrupt deals, those headquartered in highly corrupt countries are more willing to do so. This claim is based on the fact that firms from less corrupt countries might face stronger pressures from their headquarters to not engage in corrupt deals, whereas firms from more corrupt countries might not encounter such pressures.","[Godinez, Jose] Merrimack Coll, Management, N Andover, MA 01845 USA; [Garita, Mauricio] Univ Valle Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala",Merrimack College; Universidad del Valle de Guatemala,"Godinez, J (通讯作者)，Merrimack Coll, Management, N Andover, MA 01845 USA.",,,"Garita, Mauricio/0000-0001-6716-7719",,,,,74,4,4,0,8,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,297,326,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028014,0.0,,,30,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300013,0

In the Slovak Republic, the number and locations of stations are specified by the Ministry of Health for the whole state territory. In the Czech Republic, the network of stations is established by the local authority for each administrative region. Due to geographical and population diversity, there are significant differences in population served by individual ambulances. Assuming that the number of ambulances is given, we want to investigate whether a different location of the ambulances might result in a more even distribution of their workload and, consequently, shorter response time. The problem is modelled as a capacitated p-median problem and solved using mathematical programming. The capacitated p-median problem is known to be NP-complete. As a consequence, it cannot be solved to optimality even for moderate-sized problem instances. However, we face a large-scale problem instance consisting of almost 3,000 demand nodes. Therefore heuristic approaches need to be used to get a sufficiently good solution in an acceptable time. Two decomposition mathematical heuristics are described in the paper and a new heuristic method based on previously developed approaches is presented. A redeployment of existing EMS stations in the Slovak Republic is calculated using these methods. The results are compared mutually and with the current deployment. The benefits and limitations of the presented methodology are discussed.","[Janosikova, L'udmila; Gabrisova, Lydia] Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Zilina, Slovakia; [Jezek, Bruno] Univ Hradec Kralove, Fac Informat & Management, Dept Informat & Quantitat Methods, Kralove, Czech Republic",University of Zilina; University of Hradec Kralove,"Janosíková, L (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Management Sci & Informat, Dept Math Methods & Operat Res, Zilina, Slovakia.",Ludmila.Janosikova@fri.uniza.sk; Lydia.Gabrisova@fri.uniza.sk; Bruno.Jezek@uhk.cz,"Jánošíková, Ľudmila/C-9712-2010","Jánošíková, Ľudmila/0000-0003-3983-6713",Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0760-11],Slovak Research and Development Agency(Slovak Research and Development Agency),This research was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under project APVV-0760-11 Designing of Fair Service Systems on Transportation Networks.,,24,6,6,1,20,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The analysis and observation of the communication among project team members are mainly based on the subjective and mostly linguistic interpretation of statistics and communication intensity features. This type of information can be partially captured by the project environment software; it includes a number of exchanged messages, submitted files, and responses registered as systems logs; yet, the data are unfit to be directly incorporated into the project management methods. It can be concluded that there is a need for a comprehensive aggregated model for evaluating project performance, which could not only use data captured by teamwork software, but also accumulate and effectively utilize experiential knowledge of project managers and external experts. The authors of this paper suggest to modify the classical analytical hierarchical process (AHP) model. The modification includes a method for defining probability values corresponding to each alternative outcome of project quality by using the hierarchical structure of variables acquiring linguistic values, and calculation of compound value of project quality. The authors of this article explored the performance evaluation possibilities by using the modified AHP (mAHP) model for IT projects experimental data. The experimental research shows high compatibility of evaluations defined by the project managers and the results of the proposed mAHP method, and enables to significantly improve project evaluation reliability.","[Kriksciuniene, Dalia; Sakalauskas, Virgilijus; Strigunaite, Sandra; Masteika, Saulius] Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Informat, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania",Vilnius University,"Kriksciuniene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Dept Informat, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.kriksciuniene@khf.vu.lt; virgilijus.sakalauskas@khf.vu.lt; sandra.strigunaite@gmail.com; saulius.masteika@khf.vu.lt,"Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/G-7293-2011; Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/KCY-0973-2024; Kriksciuniene, Dalia/G-7292-2011; Kriksciuniene, Dalia/AAK-3095-2021","Sakalauskas, Virgilijus/0000-0002-5572-8889; Kriksciuniene, Dalia/0000-0002-0730-3763; Masteika, Saulius/0000-0002-1770-670X",,,,,19,3,3,2,33,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Commonly used methods of eliminating traffic accidents are described in the aforementioned chapters, such as variable-message signs and RDS-TMC. Other telematic methods that are elaborated upon are the eCall and WAZE methods which are expected to be used on a much larger scale in the nearest time period, although mostly the eCall procedure since starting this year, all newly made cars should be equipped with it. More attention is directed upon the System for Automated Forewarning of Vehicle Crashes, the concept of which assures fully automated transfer of warning messages into vehicles approaching the location of a traffic accident. Automated transfer of warning messages is facilitated by forced broadcasting. The main idea behind this article is to design a real time early warning system using data mining models. The main advantage of this concept is that it tries to prevent accidents as opposed to dealing with the results of accidents which other models do. For predicting dangerous situations and forewarning the driver early enough and in real time, models which are created using data mining methods, are employed. The prerequisite of this concept is the usage of a traffic accident database.","[Kubat, David; Lamr, Marian; Skrbek, Jan] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Kubát, D (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Informat, Studentska 1402-2, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic.",david.kubat@tul.cz; marian.lamr@tul.cz; jan.skrbek@tul.cz,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,4,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,392,401,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000040,0

The attention is paid to applying integration theories, respectively theory of European Integration, in the countries of Central Europe. The fundamental research question is what theoretical models could explain the development of Central Europe, particularly their mutual coincidence. From the methodological point of view, the authors did not choose an exact theoretical concept but a set of theoretical concepts which are adequate for the research issue. The European integration phenomenon was formed by three basic theoretical directions at the very beginning: federalism, communication theory and functionalism. A different portfolio of paradigms has been chosen for the analysis of central European integration process after the fall of communism. The present situation is different to the situation after the Second World War. Theory of Europeanisation is applied besides traditional theoretical concepts. It seems significant due to central European facts. The contribution clarifies why, regarding the aim of the article, some theoretical directions are not relevant according to the authors. Using examples of real development and cooperation of Central European countries the authors conclude that the best concept to describe the development of Central Europe in the view of functionalism is neo-functionalism and particularly the theory of Europeanisation. Post-functionalism is only to certain extend adequate respectively ad hoc on national levels but not in Central European Cooperation. The theoretical framework explains the position of Central European countries generally and concretely.","[Kucerova, Irah] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Dept INt Relat, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic; [Nedomlelova, Iva] Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Liberec 46117 1, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Technical University Liberec,"Kucerová, I (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Dept INt Relat, U Krize 8, Prague 15800 5, Czech Republic.",irah.kucerova@fsv.cuni.cz; iva.nedomlelova@tul.cz,"Nedomlelová, Iva/AAD-1593-2022; Kucerova, Irah/GXW-3202-2022; Kucerova, Irah/J-7041-2012; Nedomlelova, Iva/HLP-5065-2023","Nedomlelová, Iva/0000-0001-9038-6610; Kucerova, Irah/0000-0001-7256-6204; Kucerova, Irah/0000-0001-7256-6204;",,,,,19,1,1,0,5,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,65,77,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000007,0

Doing research in emerging markets context is additionally complicated by the lack of transparency and inherent negative attitude to share information (Puffer & McCarthy, 2011). However, if researchers consider the weak points at a design stage, a survey method can be an effective means for initial exploration of the subject allowing to gain pre-understanding especially in the environment, where management accounting is still in a search of its identity, as, for example, is in a case of Russia (Lebedev, 2014).

Although the concept has been used for some time in ecology and psychology, it is now invoked in diverse contexts, both as a perceived (and typically positive) attribute of an object, entity or system and, more normatively, as a desired feature that should somehow be promoted or fostered. As part of this development, the notion of resilience is rapidly becoming part of the conceptual and analytical lexicon of regional and local economic studies: there is increasing interest in the resilience of regional, local and urban economies. Further, resilience is rapidly emerging as an idea 'whose time has come' in policy debates: a new imperative of 'constructing' or 'building' regional and urban economic resilience is gaining currency. However, this rush to use the idea of regional and local economic resilience in policy circles has arguably run somewhat ahead of our understanding of the concept. There is still considerable ambiguity about what, precisely, is meant by the notion of regional economic resilience, about how it should be conceptualized and measured, what its determinants are, and how it links to patterns of long-run regional growth. The aim of this article is to address these and related questions on the meaning and explanation of regional economic resilience and thereby to outline the directions of a research agenda.","[Martin, Ron] Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England; [Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Sch Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1IB, Hants, England",University of Cambridge; University of Southampton,"Martin, R (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Geog, Downing Pl, Cambridge CB2 3EN, England.",rlm1@cam.ac.uk,"Martin, Ronald/JPW-9668-2023",,UK Economic and Social Research Council [ES/1035811/1]; ESRC [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/I035811/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The research for this article forms part of a larger project on How Regions React to Recession: Resilience, Hysteresis and Long Run Impacts, funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (Grant ES/1035811/1), whose support is gratefully acknowledged.

It has been realised that, the growth and money supply explain more to the inflation in Tanzania than the interest rate and the current depreciation, The exchange rate and inflation were positively significant to the money supply, while the growth has a significant negative effect to it. The study also shows that, the depreciation and growth have the negative relation to inflation. Since Money supply seems to have indirect influence to the inflation, it is recommended that more effort should be made to find other factors which may influence more the Tanzania Economy.

Although none of the frameworks seems to be universal enough on its own, a few propositions and adjustments have been employed to diminish the drawbacks. A model based on one of the presented frameworks has been developed in view of the need for a reliable and explanatory model of electric vehicle charging demand. Several economic principles were taken into account during the development of the model, namely the utility-based decision-making of the consumer and the repetitive nature of human behaviour which express itself as habits, i.e. travelling behaviour in terms of electric vehicle usage. These were incorporated into the proposed model to ensure that the model is explanatory and realistic. Examples of the use of the model have been suggested, as well as several topics for future research.","[Pekarek, Jan] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Informat, Brno 61200, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Pekárek, J (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Dept Informat, Kolejni 2906-4, Brno 61200, Czech Republic.",pekarek@fbm.vutbr.cz,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1211,1220,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700119,0

There are several theories of rural tourism development based on the supply and demand factors. The main demand factors of rural tourism are based on the motives of consumers. The main supply factors of rural tourism development are based on the local tourism resources and the application of evolutionary approach in rural tourism development. The evolutionary approach of tourism development means that the rural tourism development can be seen as a process, and the tourism development should be defined as a natural process of change. A proper understanding of this process helps to understand the dynamism of rural tourism development better and allows identifying the main factors that have an impact on the changes in rural tourism and selecting the proper methods for their identification and assessment. The paper presents the concept of rural tourism development using in-depth analysis of various theories and theoretical frameworks developed to explain the trends of tourism development.","[Streimikiene, Dalia] Vilnius Univ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Kaunas Fac Humanities, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Bilan, Yuriy] Univ Szczecin, Dept Microecon, PL-70453 Szczecin, Poland",Vilnius University; University of Szczecin,"Streimikiene, D (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Dept Business Econ & Management, Kaunas Fac Humanities, Muitines Str 8, LT-44280 Kaunas, Lithuania.",dalia.streimikiene@khf.vu.lt; yuriy_bilan@yahoo.co.uk,"Streimikiene, Dalia/AAD-7762-2020; Streimikiene, Dalia/AAF-2180-2020; Bilan, Yuriy/B-3119-2012; Bilan, Yuriy/ABC-6948-2021","Streimikiene, Dalia/0000-0002-3247-9912; Bilan, Yuriy/0000-0003-0268-009X;",,,,,45,31,33,19,173,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

In the paper we compare the level of employee motivation in the Slovak enterprises before the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008 and in 2013 when the impact of the crisis has already been felt intensely. The year 2008 was chosen as the starting point of the analyses since the level the level of motivation was not affected by the economic crisis. The reference period was the year 2013 when the crisis, on the basis of the macroeconomic indicators, continues. Basic research sample is formed by employees of the enterprises (manufacturing and non-manufacturing) operating in the Slovak Republic. Considering the size of the basic sample we could not analyse the motivation of each item of the basic sample. The random sampling was used to choose items from the basic sample. The motivation questionnaire was created on the basis of the knowledge acquired through the long-term research and through the communication with personnel clerks in the enterprises. Motivation factors that affect the employee productivity the most were used in the questionnaire. Following the sizes of selected samples and their independence we used a two-sample t-test to determine the significance. The null hypothesis testing about equality of means of individual motivation factors in the particular period of time was carried out at the significance level alpha = 0.05. Following the results of analyses we state that employees need to stay motivated also from a long-term point of view However, essential changes occur in order of importance.

Drivers have been the crisis of Fordism, political-economic changes in Europe and the world, and the emerging dominance of fashion on the markets, all of these factors unfolding at different times and speeds. The paper takes stock of the sector's shifting geography by reviewing relevant literature on footwear districts in the European Union, augmented by document analyses. Upgrading footwear to a fashion industry generated an altered intra-European spatial division of labour under the double imperative of investing in market access and achieving low production costs. A variety of footwear companies have emerged that have affected the dynamics of former and actual footwear districts by increasingly creating production networks between different production spaces in Europe. As a result, a dynamic and complex production network, connecting a diversity of places across the EU, has emerged.","[Schamp, Eike W.] Goethe Univ Frankfurt M, Inst Human Geog, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany",Goethe University Frankfurt,"Schamp, EW (通讯作者)，Goethe Univ Frankfurt M, Inst Human Geog, Theodor W Adorno Pl 6, D-60629 Frankfurt, Germany.",schamp@em.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,,,71,3,3,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

J,"Smyth, E",,,,"Smyth, Emer",,,Social Relationships and the Transition to Secondary Education,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,SCHOOL; ADOLESCENCE; INVOLVEMENT; TEACHERS; STUDENTS; CHILDREN; ANXIETY; NEEDS,"International research has pointed to the social and academic adjustment required of young people moving to secondary education and the importance of social support in easing this transition. However, studies have rarely looked at the simultaneous impact of different social networks on this process and how these networks may mediate the influence of social background. This paper draws on Growing Up in Ireland data to look at the influence of parents, peers and teachers on two dimensions of the transition process, which capture social, socio-emotional and academic aspects of the adjustment: the ease of settling into secondary education, as measured by parents' reports of transition difficulties among their children, and academic adjustment to secondary education, as reflected in changes in young people's academic self-image. Parental support is found to play a crucial role in helping young people adjust to the new school setting but, contrary to much previous research, formal involvement in their children's schooling, especially in helping with homework, plays a much less important role. Over and above supportive relations, parental cultural, economic and social resources are found to play a direct role in improving young people's confidence as learners and in enhancing transition experiences. Peer networks typically grow larger over the transition to secondary education but those young people who were more socially isolated at primary level experience greater difficulties. In keeping with previous research, the quality of relations with teachers emerges as a key driver of academic and social adjustment to secondary education.","[Smyth, Emer] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI),"Smyth, E (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",Emer.Smyth@esri.ie,"Smyth, Emer/AAE-6450-2019",,Government of Ireland through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association; Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Social Protection (DSP),Government of Ireland through the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association; Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Social Protection (DSP),"The article is based on analysis of the Growing Up in Ireland data and the author would like to thank the GUI study team, the DCYA and CSO for providing access to the data.

Our results provide some support for the polarisation argument, with the largest increases in absolute percentage point terms occurring towards the bottom of the socio-economic hierarchy. However, this was accompanied by sharp attenuation of socio-economic inequalities in stress and a dramatic increase in the heterogeneity of economically stressed households. The analysis shows that the reality is more complex than either the class polarisation or middle class squeeze hypotheses would suggest. The results create a new set of challenges for policy that require a careful balancing of issues of legitimacy, the need to meet very broad-based needs for services and the more traditional targeted assistance to vulnerable groups.","[Watson, Dorothy; Maitre, Bertrand; Williams, James] Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland; [Whelan, Christopher T.] Univ Coll Dublin, Dublin, Ireland",Economic & Social Research Institute (ESRI); University College Dublin,"Maitre, B (通讯作者)，Econ & Social Res Inst, Dublin, Ireland.",bertrand.maitre@esri.ie,,"Williams, James/0000-0001-5940-7348",Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association; Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Social Protection (DSP),Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association; Central Statistics Office (CSO); Department of Social Protection (DSP),"Growing Up in Ireland has been funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA) in association with the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and the Department of Social Protection (DSP).

The analysis addresses innovations in the traditional electricity-related technologies, but keeping aside renewable energy technologies. Findings show an increase in patenting activities following market deregulation, measured along three factors: entry barriers, public ownership and vertical integration. In particular, econometric results suggest that policies aimed at reducing vertical integration - i.e. to unbundle networks from energy generation and supply - have a positive impact on innovation activity.

Chapter 1 reviews two competing forms of environmentalism: one that accommodates business interests by giving public resources to them, and one that sacralizes the bond between society and nature by protecting both environmental quality and social equity. Chapter 2 discusses problems around the world that can be traced to mismanagement of natural resources, including land grabs and poverty. It also reveals a natural confluence between environmental, economic, and social concerns. Chapter 3 shows problems created by California's water tenure laws. California's 19(th) century equitable solution (the Wright Act) is examined, along with inequities in legal regimes of India, Pakistan, South Africa, and the Philippines. Chapter 4 is a case study of how water laws have affected one river in California's Central Valley by preventing efficient water use. Chapter 5 shows why water markets, the standard panacea offered by most economists, have failed to improve either the efficiency or equity of water allocations in California and why such schemes are likely to fail for other natural resources. The missing element in such plans is a method of creating reciprocity by compensating the public, as the original owners of all natural resources. Chapter 6 concludes with four principles derived from the foregoing analysis.","[Gaffney, Mason] Univ Calif Riverside, Econ Emeritus, Riverside, CA 92521 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Gaffney, M (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Econ Emeritus, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",m.gaffney@dslextreme.com,,,,,,,141,2,2,0,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

J,"Spandonide, B",,,,"Spandonide, Bruno",,,UNDERSTANDING TRANSPORT COSTS IN REMOTE AUSTRALIA,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,transport; economy; costs; access; remote Australia,,Transport systems are vital to remote Australia's communities and enterprises. Supplying small and scattered population centres with transport infrastructure and services over great distances and in extreme climatic conditions for areas characterised by high supply chain costs and low median incomes represents a considerable challenge. Yet transport costs are underexplored in remote Australia. This article aims at studying the specificities of transport costs in remote Australia including a comprehensive evaluation of transport externalities. A methodological framework specific to the remote Australian context is designed and used to classify well -established secondary data. The sampling includes eight sites across remote Australia reflecting a wide range of communities in terms of population sizes and geographic conditions. Transport costs are then evaluated for different modes. The results are discussed and identify a critical aspect of transport systems characterising of remote Australia: not having access to effective transport magnifies externalities. In this sense the research shows the real magnitude of the current transport disadvantage currently affecting a large number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living remotely. Furthermore studying externalities can successfully provide some quantitative indication of accessibility costs. Eventually it illustrates the complex hierarchy of transport access which defines the geography of remote regions: monetised indicators could be used to determine remoteness level as opposed to some of the stereotyping linear formulas currently used derived from distances or population centre size.,"[Spandonide, Bruno] Flinders Univ S Australia, Transport Syst Ctr, Ninti Ltd 1, Cooperat Res Ctr Remote Econ Participat, POB 3971, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia",Flinders University South Australia,"Spandonide, B (通讯作者)，Flinders Univ S Australia, Transport Syst Ctr, Ninti Ltd 1, Cooperat Res Ctr Remote Econ Participat, POB 3971, Alice Springs, NT 0871, Australia.",bruno.spandonide@nintione.com.au,,,Ninti One; Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation (CRC REP) through the Australian Government Cooperative Research Centres Program,"Ninti One; Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation (CRC REP) through the Australian Government Cooperative Research Centres Program(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and ScienceCooperative Research Centres (CRC) Programme)",This research has been supported by Ninti One and the Cooperative Research Centre for Remote Economic Participation (CRC REP) The CRC-REP receives funding through the Australian Government Cooperative Research Centres Program.

This article seeks to advance understanding of the law-like activities of these associations. Residential community associations and sports leagues, for example, make rules and levy fines on members who violate them. The NewYork Diamond Dealers Club and the Writers Guild of America, like many other associations, have established internal arbitral panels for the resolution of member disputes. Courts are highly likely to defer to the outcomes of these arbitrations. The article's central positive thesis, hedged with qualifications, is that a private association tends to engage in social control when it is the most cost-effective institution for addressing the issue at hand. This thesis is used to illuminate some otherwise puzzling associational practices, such as the efforts of the National Football League and other professional sports leagues to control players' domestic violence off the field of play.","[Ellickson, Robert C.] Yale Univ, Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT 06520 USA",Yale University,"Ellickson, RC (通讯作者)，Yale Univ, Yale Law Sch, New Haven, CT 06520 USA.",robert.ellickson@yale.edu,,,,,,,109,8,11,1,5,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",1465-7252,1465-7260,,AM LAW ECON REV,Am.

The empirical results confirm our main hypothesis on the endogeneity of money in the Eurozone as they show that the commonly accepted neoclassical relations between monetary variables, inflation and economic activity are reversed in case of Eurozone and that the direction of influence goes from loans to deposits and from real sector of the economy towards the monetary sector.

Despite a large literature body analysing private car energy use, there has been very little published analysis on freight transport, which itself has largely been limited to one aspect of freight transport, namely heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). This paper focuses on the energy and related CO2 emissions associated with light goods vehicles (LGVs) in Ireland, which contributes to addressing the knowledge gap in freight transport energy use. Low carbon pathways for LGV transport in Ireland, which align with an 80% CO2 emissions reduction by 2050 (relative to 1990), were developed using scenario analysis and a multi-model approach, which included i) the Irish TIMES energy systems model a least cost optimisation model of the Irish energy system - and ii) an LGV stock model for Ireland a sectoral simulation model of LGVs in Ireland. The introduction of energy efficiency measures and indigenous gaseous biofuels were found to be key elements in a technically feasible roadmap, which can meet the required CO2 emissions reduction target.

While revenues are readily observed, the variable cost is calculated using the Uniform Rail Costing System (URCS) that was developed by the Interstate Commerce Commission. We characterize the properties of the URCS rail costing methodology and its role in rate regulation, and we assess whether it produces an economically valid estimate of the cost caused by a rail shipment. We find that the URCS methodology is an accounting cost allocation procedure that does not recover an estimate of the cost of a rail shipment that a rational railroad operator would use to make pricing or operating decisions. We then explain why in the post-Staggers Act regime, even if an economic meaningful shipment cost measure were available, this information would not come any closer to solving the problem of determining what is an unreasonable price for a railroad to charge. We conclude by arguing that the use of the URCS methodology should be abandoned in railroad rate reasonableness regulation and replaced with a price benchmarking approach.","[Wilson, Wesley W.] Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA; [Wolak, Frank A.] Stanford Univ, Dept Econ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",University of Oregon; Stanford University,"Wilson, WW (通讯作者)，Univ Oregon, Dept Econ, Eugene, OR 97403 USA.",wwilson@uoregon.edu,"Wilson, Wesley W/A-4256-2013",,,,,,21,4,6,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Differently from previous studies in the literature, considering that causal relationship between financial development and economic growth might change depending on time, time-varying causality test developed by Balcilar, Ozdemir and Arslanturk (2010) has been used. The results show that there is a unidirectional causal relationship from financial development to economic growth and this relationship changes depending on time. It is seen that unidirectional causality from financial development to economic growth emerged during the periods of financial turmoil and political crisis.

However, all previous studies do not consider the types of gun-carry laws in place prior to the adoption of shall issue laws. Using difference-in-difference methodology, findings of this study imply that considering the type of regulations that states had prior to passing shall issue laws matters and shall issue laws do have a deterrence effect under certain circumstances. Adopting shall issue laws only reduces the crime rate in states with no issue laws in place, and shall issue laws are redundant to may issue (restricted concealed carry) laws in terms of crime reduction.

In the natural gas field, there are various types of anomalies, each of which is induced by a range of causes and sources. The causes of a set of anomalies are examined and categorized, and a Bayesian maximum likelihood classifier learns the temporal structures of known anomalies. Given previously unseen time series data, the system detects anomalies using a linear regression model with weather inputs, after which the anomalies are tested for false positives and classified using a Bayesian classifier. The method can also identify anomalies of an unknown origin. Thus, the likelihood of a data point being anomalous is given for anomalies of both known and unknown origins. This probabilistic anomaly detection method is tested on a reported natural gas consumption data set. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The distinctive elements of our analysis are the consideration of: (i) the vertical structure of the rail sector, (ii) operators that compete in prices and number of services, and (iii) access charges for the use of the rail infrastructure that are endogenous. We provide simulation results for three Spanish HSR routes. The socioeconomic viability of entry is found to depend on whether infrastructure and rail operations are integrated or separated, and also on the policy rule to set rail access charges. Firstly, separation without entry is not an appropriate good policy: the reduction in prices is followed by a reduction in the number of services that leads to lower consumer surplus and lower industry profits. Secondly, marginal cost pricing, that would entail losses to the infrastructure manager, would make entry profitable because access charges are much lower; welfare gains would be in the range of 6-9% higher than in the pre-entry scenario. This conclusion holds for large increases in rail traffic. Thirdly, the consideration of a more realistic scenario (where the entry of a new operator would lead to a modest rise in the whole rail traffic), while encouraging entry, would imply welfare losses yet consumer surplus would go up as long as access charges are set to marginal cost pricing.

We focus on the initial inspiration phase that theoretically defines the attainable reach of individuals considering moving. Using a case-based approach, we distinguish how online information and social contact influence an individual's early considerations and desires to move elsewhere. We draw on indepth interviews with young adults in Sweden. Our findings characterise how Internet-based information influences the spatial, social, and temporal horizons of inspiration with potential implications for subsequent plans. We find that virtual practices spatially expand these horizons and promote a shift towards insider information. Results further suggest that a flow of information and background knowledge regarding opportunities in other places drives the inspiration phase, extending its duration until it is more or less continuous. Reduced information friction increases the scope for impulsiveness to spark migration inspiration and intentions.","[Thulin, Eva; Vilhelmson, Bertil] Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Unit Human Geog, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 630, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Thulin, E (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Dept Econ & Soc, Unit Human Geog, Sch Business Econ & Law, Box 630, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",Eva.Thulin@geography.gu.se; Bertil.Vilhelmson@geography.gu.se,"Vilhelmson, Bertil/HMD-8759-2023","Vilhelmson, Bertil/0000-0002-4548-4059; Thulin, Eva/0000-0003-4867-4824",Swedish Research Council,Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council),The research was funded by the Swedish Research Council.

In addition, it reports an empirical application of this concept to two different food products (cured ham and cured sausage). The authors used a mixed-effects multi-nomial logistic regression model and show that in the cured pork product agribusiness, a low frequency of consumption favours the acceptance of high TC products. The results also confirm that marketing high TC products in stores with a large assortment decreases the chances of success for agribusiness companies that produce cured pork food products. These finding can be used by the managers for designing complementary attributes that improve their product portfolio. Besides, advertising expenditures associated with introducing new products could be reduced if companies strengthened their presence in specialty stores.","[Cotes-Torres, Alejandro] Univ Nacl Colombia, Ciudad Univ,Edificio 561, Bogota, Colombia; [Antonio Munoz-Gallego, Pablo] Univ Salamanca, Campus Miguel Unamuno,Edificio FES, Salamanca 37007, Spain; [Miguel Cotes-Torres, Jose] Univ Nacl Colombia, Calle 59A 63-20,Bloque 11, Medellin, Colombia",Universidad Nacional de Colombia; University of Salamanca; Universidad Nacional de Colombia,"Cotes-Torres, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nacl Colombia, Ciudad Univ,Edificio 561, Bogota, Colombia.",acotest@unal.edu.co; pmunoz@usal.es; jmcotes@unal.edu.co,"Cotes Torres, José Miguel/JNR-9654-2023; Muñoz-Gallego, Pablo Antonio/L-4904-2014","Cotes Torres, José Miguel/0000-0002-2211-846X; Muñoz-Gallego, Pablo Antonio/0000-0003-4531-2051; Cotes-Torres, Alejandro/0000-0002-1036-7899",European Union Programme of High Level Scholarships for Latin-America [E06D100306CO]; Catedra Jovenes Emprendedores de Bancaja-Universidad de Salamanca (Espana),European Union Programme of High Level Scholarships for Latin-America(European Union (EU)); Catedra Jovenes Emprendedores de Bancaja-Universidad de Salamanca (Espana),"This research was supported by the Programme Al beta an, the European Union Programme of High Level Scholarships for Latin-America, scholarship No. E06D100306CO.

J,"Lee, SI",,,,"Lee, Se-In",,,HOW PASS-ON THEORY SHOULD BE APPLIED IN KOREAN ANTITRUST LITIGATION,JOURNAL OF COMPETITION LAW & ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this article, I analyze and support the Korean Supreme Court's acceptance of pass-on theory in the recent flour price-fixing case decided in 2012. Since Korea belongs to the civil law system that aims at making actual damage compensation by private litigation, I agree with the court that a defendant should not be required to pay more than the actual damage suffered by plaintiffs. The Supreme Court stated that a defendant should establish a causal link between the alleged overcharge and any recovery made to plaintiffs through pass-on, but concluded that the required causal link was not established in the present flour price-fixing case. However, a notable feature of the judgment was that the Supreme Court allowed a reduction of the final damages awarded anyway, not on the basis of pass-on theory, but based on the notion of fairness. I support the Korean Supreme Court's decision to allow the pass-on defense to run, with burden of proof to establish it resting on the defendant. However, I suggest that the Korean courts should not calculate a reduction of damages according to the notion of fairness when a defendant cannot establish the pass-on causal link. It is time for the Korean courts to rely on a more concrete way of calculating damages than selecting some arbitrary numbers based on the notion of fairness.","[Lee, Se-In] Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Law, Pusan, South Korea",Pusan National University,"Lee, SI (通讯作者)，Pusan Natl Univ, Sch Law, Pusan, South Korea.",silee@pusan.ac.kr,,,Financial Supporting Project of Long-Term Overseas Dispatch of PNU's Tenure-Track Faculty,Financial Supporting Project of Long-Term Overseas Dispatch of PNU's Tenure-Track Faculty,"This article was supported by the Financial Supporting Project of Long-Term Overseas Dispatch of PNU's Tenure-Track Faculty, 2013.",,11,0,0,0,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

In the research panel sample of the selected OECD countries has been used with the data for the time period from 2000 to 2011. The empirical analysis reveals that there is a long-term relationship between the variables, that economic growth and regional disparities move in the same direction and that the impact of economic growth on regional disparities is statistically significant. Consequently, in order to reduce regional disparities, it is necessary to increase the share of less developed regions in the total output. In this matter, it should be helpful to adequately coordinate policies about regional development from all levels of governance.","[Obradovic, Sasa; Lojanica, Nemanja; Jankovic, Olivera] Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Djure Pucara 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia",University of Kragujevac,"Obradovic, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kragujevac, Fac Econ, Djure Pucara 3, Kragujevac 34000, Serbia.",sobradovic@kg.ac.rs; nlojanica@kg.ac.rs; ojankovic@kg.ac.rs,"Obradovic, Sasa/A-6998-2010","Obradovic, Sasa/0000-0001-9918-7271; Lojanica, Nemanja/0000-0003-1460-8466; Stancic, Olivera/0000-0001-7219-9029",Ministry of Science and Education of Republic of Serbia [179015],Ministry of Science and Education of Republic of Serbia,"This paper is a part of research project No. 179015, financed by the Ministry of Science and Education of the Republic of Serbia.",,36,5,5,2,25,"UNIV RIJEKA, FAC ECOMOMICS",RIJEKA,"IVANA FILIPOVICA 4, RIJEKA, 51000, CROATIA",1331-8004,1846-7520,,ZB RAD EKON FAK RIJE,Zb.

These are fought by pastoral groups over scarce water, land, pasture and livestock resources. Now oil has been found in Turkana, fuelling both hopes for a resource blessing and fears of a resource curse. The discovery of oil coincides with four other major developments, namely the process of devolution, the large-scale infrastructure project LAPS-SET (Lamu Port Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport), the discovery of significant aquifers and the Gibe III dam in Ethiopia. The aim of this paper is first to give an overview of these developments, and second to explore their interactions and their effects on existing and potentially new resource and conflict dynamics. The article is based on a review of the academic literature as well as newspaper articles, government records and company publications. Further, we analyze security data and draw on extensive field research conducted in northwest Kenya over the past five years. To illustrate potential pathways, we draft a worst and best case scenario. Our results suggest that the described developments will strongly affect the existing water, land and livestock resources and create new ones in the form of revenues, business opportunities, employment and infrastructure. To decrease the conflict potential and to maximize benefits, it is highly important for any project to closely include the local communities in a fair and transparent manner.","[Schilling, Janpeter; Weinzierl, Thomas] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CLISEC, Grindelberg 7, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany; [Schilling, Janpeter] Int Alert, London, England; [Lokwang, Augustine Ekitela] Secur & Conflict Expert, Turkana, Kenya; [Opiyo, Francis] Global Policy Ctr, United Nations Dev Programme, Nairobi, Kenya",University of Hamburg,"Schilling, J (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, Inst Geog, CLISEC, Grindelberg 7, D-20144 Hamburg, Germany.;Schilling, J (通讯作者)，Int Alert, London, England.",janpeter.schilling@uni-hamburg.de,,,,,,,85,7,8,0,32,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",0044-3751,2365-7693,,Z WIRTSCHAFTSGEOGR,Z.

When property is fully protected, some potential buyers with valuation higher than that of original owners are inefficiently excluded from trade because of transaction costs. When property rights are weak, low-valuation potential buyers inefficiently expropriate original owners. The trade-off between these two misallocations implies that the protection of property will be stronger the more heterogeneous the potential buyer's preferences are. This implication holds true when part of the population has more political influence on institutional design, when transaction costs are determined by either market power or asymmetric information, and when the disincentive effect of weak property rights is taken into account. Moreover, it is consistent with the relationships between measures of ethnolinguistic, genetic, and religious diversity and novel data on the rules on adverse possession and on government takings of real property in 126 jurisdictions.","[Guerriero, Carmine] Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy",University of Bologna,"Guerriero, C (通讯作者)，Univ Bologna, I-40126 Bologna, Italy.",,"Guerriero, Carmine/IAM-8930-2023; Guerriero, Carmine/AAI-7596-2020","Guerriero, Carmine/0000-0003-4046-1082;",,,,,53,15,15,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

Oligopolies also increase total surplus relative to monopoly, and consumer surplus makes up a larger portion of total surplus in oligopoly than monopoly.

Using quarterly data for the period of 2000:Q1-2013:Q2, we include two measures of real exchange rate volatility (GARCH(1,1) and mean-adjusted relative change measures) for comparison purposes. The results show that real income is a crucial determinant of maritime export volume in both the short- and long run, implying that Australia's maritime exports are predominantly driven by the economic growth in its major Asian trading partners. This paper finds evidence that exchange rate volatility has a significant long-run effect in the majority of cases, suggesting that exchange rate volatility appears to be an important factor affecting maritime export volume. The effects of exchange rate volatility are found to vary across country-pairs, and hence confirming the importance of using disaggregate data to uncover the differential effects on maritime exports by country. This study also reveals that the two measures of exchange rate volatility can produce different effects and thereby, it is important to select an appropriate measure of exchange rate volatility.

Most research on maternal mortality focuses on factors during pregnancy and delivery. However, consistent with the fetal programming hypothesis, a woman's maternal survival may also be related to conditions she experienced while in utero. I examine this hypothesis in 14 African countries by relating rainfall when a woman was in utero with her maternal survival later in her life. High levels of rainfall, representing better in utero conditions, decrease the probability of maternal death by 1.1 percentage points, a 58 % decrease from a mean of 1.9 %. Higher rainfall while in utero reduces the probability of anemia during pregnancy, a risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage. Another plausible pathway is through a reduction in body mass index, a predictor of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Improving conditions for pregnant women will have inter-generational effects, benefiting pregnant women today and improving their daughters' maternal survival.","[Comfort, Alison B.] ABT Associates Inc, Social & Econ Policy, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",ABT Associates,"Comfort, AB (通讯作者)，ABT Associates Inc, Social & Econ Policy, 55 Wheeler St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",Alison_Comfort@abtassoc.com,"Comfort, Alison/AAC-1449-2020",,Harvard Graduate Society Dissertation Completion Fellowship; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Abt Associates; Development and Dissemination Grants,Harvard Graduate Society Dissertation Completion Fellowship; Institute for Quantitative Social Science; Abt Associates; Development and Dissemination Grants,"This research was conducted while I received support from Harvard Graduate Society Dissertation Completion Fellowship, Institute for Quantitative Social Science, and Abt Associates, including the Development and Dissemination Grants and the Journal Authors Support Group.

Existing evidence, however, is mostly based on inadequately aggregated data sets, making its interpretation less than straightforward. Using tract-and county-level U.S. Census panel data, I decompose county-level income inequality into its within-and across-tract components and examine the extent to which county-level crime rates are influenced by local inequality and economic segregation. I find that the previously reported positive correlation between violent crime and economic inequality is largely driven by economic segregation across neighborhoods instead of within-neighborhood inequality. Moreover, there is little evidence of a significant empirical link between overall inequality and crime when county-and time-fixed effects are controlled for. On the other hand, a particular form of economic inequality, namely, poverty concentration, remains an important predictor of county-level crime rates.","[Kang, Songman] Hanyang Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Wangsimni Ro 222, Seoul 04763, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Kang, S (通讯作者)，Hanyang Univ, Coll Econ & Finance, Wangsimni Ro 222, Seoul 04763, South Korea.",songmankang@hanyang.ac.kr,,,Hanyang University [HY-201400000001597],Hanyang University,"I am grateful to two anonymous referees, Seth Sanders, Phil Cook, Peter Arcidiacono, Joe Hotz, and Chris Timmins for valuable comments.

The parameters are updated using the score of the forecasting distribution, which allows the parameter dynamics to adapt automatically to any non normal data features, and increases the robustness of the subsequent estimates. The new approach nests several of the earlier extensions to the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) scheme. In addition, it can be extended easily to higher dimensions and alternative forecasting distributions. The method is applied to Value-at-Risk forecasting with (skewed) Student's t distributions and a time-varying degrees of freedom and/or skewness parameter.

Rational decisions are more precise but create higher costs, though these costs may decrease over time. We find that intuition will outperform reason in the long run if individuals are sufficiently ambitious. Moreover, intuitive decisions are prevalent in the early and late stages of a learning process, whereas reason governs decisions in intermediate stages.

Many of the extant approaches require considerable manual pre-processing of the textual data, making the methods prohibitively expensive to implement and difficult to scale. In contrast, our approach uses a bag-of-words method that requires minimal pre-processing and parsing, making it efficient and scalable. However, a key implementation challenge with the bag-of-words approach is that the number of predictors can quickly outstrip the number of degrees of freedom available. Furthermore, the method can require impracticably large computational resources. We propose a random projections approach for dealing with the curse-of-dimensionality issue that afflicts bag-of-words models. The random projections approach is computationally simple, flexible and fast, and has desirable statistical properties. We apply the proposed approach to the forecasting of sales at Amazon.com using consumer reviews with an attributes-based regression model. The model is applied to produce of one-week-ahead rolling horizon sales forecasts for existing and newly-introduced tablet computers. The results show that the predictive performance of the proposed approach for both tasks is strong and significantly better than those of either models that ignore the textual content of consumer reviews, or a support vector regression machine with the textual content. Furthermore, the approach is easy to repeat across product categories, and readily scalable to much larger datasets. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It tests the rationality of the forecasts, assuming a possibly asymmetric loss function. The results indicate considerable evidence of asymmetry. The 15-month forecasts are overpredicted, irrespective of forecaster identity or the target variable. However, the biases in the three-month forecasts vary among forecasters: the IMF provides prudent short-term forecasts for output growth and inflation, while private forecasters provide unbiased inflation forecasts. The government uses the information provided in the IMF and consensus forecasts efficiently when making its own forecasts. A comparison with the projections for the German economy indicates that the biases of the Japanese government may be attributable to its debt-to-GDP ratio, which is the highest among advanced economies.

This paper addresses a gap in the literature by examining all three dimensions of salesperson deviance (i.e., organizational deviance, interpersonal deviance and customer-directed deviance) and the moderating role of customer orientation. More specifically and using a sales personnel sample, this research extends current understanding of deviant behavior in two key areas. Our findings show (1) a negative relationship between job satisfaction and each dimension of salesperson deviance, and (2) customer orientation moderates the relationship between job satisfaction and salesperson deviance. Thus, we present a more holistic view of salesperson deviance and, in practical terms, confirm that organizational stakeholders should proactively manage the job satisfaction together with the customer orientation of their sales staff in order to avoid and/or minimize deviant behaviors.","[Lo Iacono, Joseph; Weaven, Scott K.; Griffin, Deborah] Griffith Univ, Dept Mkt, Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia",Griffith University; Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus,"Lo Iacono, J (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Dept Mkt, Parklands Dr, Southport, Qld 4215, Australia.",j.loiacono@griffith.edu.au; s.weaven@griffith.edu.au; deborah.griffin@griffith.edu.au,"weaven, scott K/C-9937-2016","Weaven, Scott/0000-0001-9150-7111",,,,,41,13,14,2,34,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

In recent years, technological and legal developments, as well as changes in the business strategies of larger banks and non-bank financial service providers, have purportedly made it more difficult for community banks to attract and retain customers, and hence to survive. Indeed, the number of community banks and the shares of bank branches, deposits, banking assets, and small business loans that are held by community banks in the U.S. have all declined substantially over the past two decades. Nonetheless, many community banks have successfully adapted to their changing environment and have continued to thrive. This paper uses data from 1992 through 2011 to examine the relationships between community bank profitability and various characteristics of the banks and the local markets in which they operate. We divide these characteristics into two categories-those that are exogenous to the control of bank managers and those that reflect the decisions or actions of bank management. We find that variables from both categories significantly influence bank profitability. Statistical tests indicate that variables within managers' control account for between 70 and 97 % of the total explanatory power of regression equations that explain variations in performance across community banks, which suggests that managers are extremely important to community bank performance.","[Amel, Dean F.; Prager, Robin A.] Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA,"Prager, RA (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Syst, Board Governors, Washington, DC 20551 USA.",damel@frb.gov; robin.prager@frb.gov,,,,,,,24,2,5,1,29,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

In job assignment models with asymmetric information, unexpected promotions send a signal to the external labor market to revise upward their assessment of a worker's ability. The employing firm must then increase wages to prevent the worker from being bid away. Less educated workers are assumed to come from a group with lower average ability. Their promotion is hypothesized to induce a larger positive update of the assessment of their ability than the promotion of more educated workers. Promotions of less experienced workers, with less known about their abilities, should also result in strong signaling effects. We obtain regression results consistent with our hypotheses, although the size and significance of the estimates hinge on the promotion definition. Inexperienced workers gain more from promotions that entail new managerial responsibilities, whereas less educated workers gain more from nonmanagerial promotions. This sensitivity to the definition of promotion suggests that promotions reveal information on different dimensions of ability for different types of workers.","[Bognanno, Michael] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, IZA Inst Study Labor, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA; [Melero, Eduardo] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Bognanno, M (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Econ, IZA Inst Study Labor, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.;Melero, E (通讯作者)，Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Business Adm, E-28903 Getafe, Spain.",bognanno@temple.edu; eduardo.melero@uc3m.es,"Melero, Eduardo/H-4517-2015","Melero, Eduardo/0000-0001-7230-1433",Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2012-333012],Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government),"We are grateful to Emre Ekinci, Jed DeVaro, Jaime Ortega, Neus Palomeras, Michael Waldman, and two anonymous referees for their valuable suggestions.

High inequality of market incomes in Ireland by international standards appears to be driven by both ends of the income distribution. An analysis of income mobility over time shows it has been low at both ends of the income distribution, although it increased at the low end once the crisis began, reflecting the sharp deterioration of the labour market. The data confirms that the income tax system is highly progressive at the high end of income distribution and the welfare system provides the most significant support to lower income deciles in Ireland. The redistributive function in the tax and benefit system was enhanced during the last decade, not only because more income support was necessitated with the crisis, but also due to reforms which made the statutory tax rate more progressive.","[Kennedy, Sean] Revenue Commissioners, Dublin, Ireland; [Jin, Yosuke; Haugh, David; Lenain, Patrick] Org Econ Cooperat & Dev, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Kennedy, S (通讯作者)，Revenue Commissioners, Dublin, Ireland.",,,,,,,,21,2,2,0,1,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

Capacity and readiness for change are most highlighted issues in continuous change practices. This provoked for inbuilt quality and capacity in an organization to change. Many researchers and scholars tried to investigate that what features or qualities are required in an organization to cope with continuous change and an ideal organization named as learning organization concept emerged as a probable solution in this scenario. This paper attempts to summarize the discussion by identifying key features of a learning organization which has consensus. Secondly, this paper explains that how a learning organization behaves and interacts in a continuous change process. To explain this process a conceptual model is presented which is composed of four parts: learning organization, change capacity and readiness, transformation, and antecedents of change. Most of the literature on this topic discusses 'what to be' for learning organization but 'how to be' a learning organization there is a literature gap. The most important contribution of this paper is to address this gap. It is identified that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) can play an important role. This paper proposes a system based on ICT which can help in development of a learning organization named as learning organization support system (LOSS). The system is based on a simple idea that feedback, discussion and flow of information about current scenario with the memory of past through ICT-based knowledge sharing processes, knowledge assessment and development system can develop an organization into a learning organization. A pilot test was conducted to test one of its parts (knowledge assessment and development system) by using STUDIO, an e-learning platform developed by Corvinno Technology Transfer Center. The test verified the effectiveness of ICT-based assessment and development system. Results positively encourage the idea of LOSS.","[Akhtar, Naveed] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest,"Akhtar, N (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Budapest, Hungary.",almra_mn@yahoo.com,"AKHTAR, NAVEED/AAT-1283-2020","AKHTAR, NAVEED/0000-0003-3406-673X",,,,,23,0,0,0,3,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,45,55,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254500006,0

Every country has its own requirements of financial reporting. Estonia has had market economy for 25 years. Through that time, financial statements have changed a lot. The aim of the current paper is to show how the balance sheet and income statement as the main financial statements have changed from 1991 to 2015. The authors provide analysis of layouts of balance sheet and income statements (years 1991; 1995; 2003 and 2015). Quite different from others are 1991-year statements. This can be explained by the fact that there was a lack of experience how to prepare financial statements under conditions of market economy. The layouts of statements introduced in 1995 and 2003 are quite similar. The 2015-year statements are shorter, because many items have been moved to notes. There is a positive and negative effect on that. It is positive that financial statements have been simplified and include only essential information. At the same time, the main financial statements have lost a lot of information. To get this information, it is necessary to look at the notes. Not all changes have been correct: some terms have been incorrectly used and some important words have been removed. In the paper, the two-factor variance model is used to estimate the changes in the number of words in financial statements. The indicators of rate variance and usage variance (volume variance, quantity variance) are calculated. From 1991 to 2015, the balance sheet and income statements have both lost approximately 100 words. During the last 10 years, the layouts of income statement have not changed as much as the balance sheet.","[Alver, Jaan; Alver, Lehti; Alver, Lehte] Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia",Tallinn University of Technology,"Alver, J (通讯作者)，Tallinn Univ Technol, EE-19086 Tallinn, Estonia.",jaan.alver@ttu.ee,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,2,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,46,55,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200004,0

The main goal of policy-makers related to this issue is decreasing the consumers' concern regarding information privacy (CFIP) and increasing the willingness to provide personal information (WPI). However, there is no consensus as to which factors affect both variables, and how. Based on consumer survey data, this paper compares the relative effects of demographic variables, consumer attitudes and the institutional framework on CFIP and WPI. Results from two regression models show that CFIP and WPI are both affected by the perceived risk, institutional framework, and confidence in privacy protection. Other variables related to CFIP are education and employment, while WPI is additionally influenced by age and gender, Implications for privacy policy and approaches to reducing CFIP and increasing WPI are discussed in the paper.","[Anic, Ivan-Damir; Budak, Jelena; Rajh, Edo] Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",Institute of Economics Zagreb (EIZ),"Anic, ID; Budak, J; Rajh, E (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Zagreb, Trg JF Kennedyja 7, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",danic@eizg.hr; jbudak@eizg.hr; erajh@eizg.hr,"Rajh, Edo/C-7557-2011",,Croatian Science Foundation [7913],Croatian Science Foundation,this work was supported by Croatian Science Foundation under the project 7913.,,39,3,3,0,13,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The resulting ontological representations help in identifying (i) relationships that have been tested in one context but have not yet been tested in others, (ii) gaps of the usage of variables and their relationships from one context to another, and (iii) developing link between existing datasets and enhance integration of business analytics with behavioural research through DL queries.","[Ansari, Junaid; Fasih, Tayyaba; Ramish, Muhammad Sufyan; Yasir, Muhammad; Hyder, Syed Muhammad Irfan] Inst Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Ansari, J (通讯作者)，Inst Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan.",junaidansari_pak@live.com; tayyaba.fasih@iobm.edu.pk; smsufyan@gmail.com; std_17690@iobm.edu.pk; irfan.hyder@iobm.edu.pk,"Fasih, Dr. Tayyaba/JPK-9137-2023; Yasir, Muhammad/HPC-7061-2023; Ansari, Junaid/AAE-9831-2021; Hyder, Syed Irfan/AAP-7829-2020; Yasir, Muhammad/HHC-1474-2022","Fasih, Dr. Tayyaba/0000-0002-8523-023X; Ansari, Junaid/0000-0003-1603-7038; Hyder, Syed Irfan/0000-0002-4429-0535;",,,,,41,0,0,1,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3735,3747,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700376,0

This paper adopts a mechanism design approach to identify some essential features of different payment systems that implement and improve the constrained optimal resource allocation in Germany. Bitcoin is a digital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by German or any government or other legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity. Bitcoin relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity. Compared to most currencies or online payment services, such as PayPal, bitcoins are highly liquid, have low transaction costs, and can be used to make micropayments in Germany. Although the Bitcoin economy is flourishing, Bitcoin users are anxious about Bitcoin's legal status. This paper examines a few relevant legal issues. The research question is to investigate how supplementary digital terminating currency Bitcoin can provide a superior fallback position as e-gold standard in Germany and worldwide. Digital self-liquidating e-Gold ounce could be distributed immediately to voters by using swipe cards used by some governments for transit facilities.

Stitt Wilson (1868-1942) was a leading American Christian Socialist. When he was elected Mayor of the City of Berkeley in 1911 he had to shift focus from the broad moral and economic case for socialism to the specifics of municipal reform. He drew on the ideas of Henry George, feminist urban reformers in the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and the settlement house movement, and progressive and socialist mayors who preceded him. He became a leader in both the Socialist Party and the single-tax movement in California from 1911 to 1917, working with the shared belief that society, as a society, creates tremendous value that should be used for public benefit rather than taken as private profit. His story illustrates the creativity that can result when people are active in and learn from multiple social movements as well as the difficulties that can result from the tensions within and between movements. It illustrates, as well, some of the varied strands of the urban reform movement that helped create modern city government in America.","[Barton, Stephen E.] City Berkeley, Rent Stabilizat Program, Berkeley, CA USA",,,,,,,,,,45,1,1,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

To answer this question, this paper analyses the changing temporal and spatial orientation of economic valuations in increasingly digitalized economies, in which markets can no longer be understood as locally bound and closed sites of valuation and exchange. Drawing on ethnographic material from the fishing industry, the paper shows how digital tracking technologies link and synchronize auction markets with real-time information on fishing activities. Hence, 'scopic media' such as chart plotters and computer screens are not only deployed by skippers to monitor one another, but are also used as valuation devices that recontextualize local knowledge for the purpose of coping with economic uncertainty. As a consequence of this panoptic valuation regime, fishermen control their virtual identities by disciplining harvesting practices according to their buyers' expectations.","[Dobeson, Alexander] Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 624, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Dobeson, A (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Dept Sociol, Box 624, S-75126 Uppsala, Sweden.",alexander.dobeson@soc.uu.se,,,European Research Council [ERC 263699-CEV],European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)),This research was funded by the European Research Council Starting Grant [grant number ERC 263699-CEV].,,65,10,10,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

At the extensive margin, factors common to siblings account for 24 % of the variation in criminal convictions and 39 % of the variation in incarceration. At the intensive margin, these factors typically account for slightly less than half of the variation in prison sentence length and between one third and one half of the variation in criminal convictions, depending on crime type and gender. Further analysis shows that parental criminality and family structure can account for more of the sibling crime correlation than parental income and education or neighborhood characteristics. The lion's share of the sibling correlation, however, is unaccounted for by these factors.

Sustainable development of public transport is a goal of almost every city in Poland provided for in the strategy documents. Local authorities take efforts to make public transport more attractive and competitive as well as to improve urban facilities for cyclists and pedestrians. At the same time the motorization rate in Poland is known to be growing very fast, traffic congestion is becoming more common and many Polish cities are undergoing rapid development with increasing urban sprawl. This raises some doubts concerning the effectiveness of local authorities. A comparative analysis of the degree of sustainability of public transport development in Polish cities can provide guidelines for further action plans in this area. Various authors try to compile a list of indicators measuring the degree of transport sustainability. In Poland, such measurement is relatively complex primarily due to a varied approach.

It is essential for life and integral to virtually all economic activities, including energy and food production and the production of industrial outputs. The availability of clean water in sufficient quantities is not only a prerequisite for human health and well-being but the life-blood of freshwater ecosystems and the many services that these provide. Water resource intensity measures the intensity of water use in terms of volume of water per unit of value added. It is an internationally accepted environmental indicator of the pressure of economic activity on a country's water resources and therefore a reliable indicator of sustainable economic development. The indicator is particularly useful in the allocation of water resources between sectors of the economy since in water-stressed countries like South Africa, there is competition for water among various users, which makes it necessary to allocate water resources to economic activities that are less intensive in their use of water. This study focuses on economy-wide changes in South Africa's water intensity using both decomposition and empirical estimation techniques in an effort to identify and understand the impact of economic activity on changes in the use of the economy's water resources. It is hoped that this study will help inform South Africa's water conservation and resource management policies.","[Kohler, Marcel] Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Econ, Durban, South Africa",University of Kwazulu Natal,"Kohler, M (通讯作者)，Univ KwaZulu Natal, Dept Econ, Durban, South Africa.",kohler@ukzn.ac.za,,,Economic Research Southern Africa,Economic Research Southern Africa,The author acknowledges the financial support of Economic Research Southern Africa without which this study would not have been possible.,,24,4,6,2,16,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The study was undertaken in the Malaysian context using a sample of 174 public listed family businesses. The data were obtained through questionnaire survey conducted over a period of six months. The results show that innovation is significantly related to business performance and positively mediated the family culture-business performance.

Pingree was a remarkable civic leader. In his four terms as mayor of Detroit from 1889 to 1897, Pingree lowered the cost of vital public utilities, including gas, lighting, and transit; modernized the city's sewage system; and rooted out corruption and dishonesty in municipal government. He successfully spearheaded the movement for the three-cent streetcar fare and brought Detroit to the brink of public ownership and operation of its own transit system. Pingree's social reform program for Detroit centered around two interrelated urban reform movements gathering steam at the turn of the 20th century: the movement for municipal ownership and the movement to equalize taxes by increasing taxes on corporate property. Both of these movements drew heavily from Henry George's single tax. In particular, Pingree's efforts to secure a municipally owned and operated street railway system and effort to increase taxation on corporate property illustrate the ways in which turn-of-the-20th-century civic leaders drew from the rhetoric and substance of George's ideas to implement progressive urban reforms.","[Lough, Alexandra W.] Brandeis Univ, Amer Hist, Waltham, MA 02254 USA; [Lough, Alexandra W.] Henry George Birthplace, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Lough, Alexandra W.] Hist Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA USA",Brandeis University,"Lough, AW (通讯作者)，Brandeis Univ, Amer Hist, Waltham, MA 02254 USA.;Lough, AW (通讯作者)，Henry George Birthplace, Philadelphia, PA USA.;Lough, AW (通讯作者)，Hist Res Ctr, Philadelphia, PA USA.",,,,,,,,39,1,1,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

The purpose of this research paper was analysis of the business environment in Kazakhstan's bakery market and justification of SME's competitive strategies. Research shows that this market tends to be a monopolistic competition market, especially in larger cities of Kazakhstan. Further SWOT analysis allowed us to estimate the surrounding of business and recommend differentiation as the basic model of competitive strategy for SMEs in the bakery market. The main finding is as follows. First of all bread-baking plants should maintain the mass production of tinned bread made from wheat flour of first and second grade. At the same time it is recommended to produce and increase new types of dietary bread and bread enriched with various micronutrients, and bakery products for curative, prophylactic and functional purposes.

Distinctions between approaches are made, illustrating the diverse conceptual angles with empirical data from degree programs of Human Resource higher education in Europe. The HR Four-Fold approach model emerges as a tool for considering different epistemic identity options in HRE and simultaneously for suggesting a basic systemic view of the HR educational episteme. The assumption is that, independently of the HR educational epistemic focus, HR educators should endeavor to set HR contents in context by providing a basic and comprehensive approach of the complete HR field of study.","[Meirinhos, Viviana Andrade] Polytech Porto, ISCAP, Ctr Human Resources Res & Dev NID RH, Oporto, Portugal",Instituto Politecnico do Porto,"Meirinhos, VA (通讯作者)，Polytech Porto, ISCAP, Ctr Human Resources Res & Dev NID RH, Oporto, Portugal.",vivivanameirinhos@eseig.ipp.pt,"Meirinhos, Viviana/L-6028-2017",,,,,,62,0,0,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,92,108,,,,,,17,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700011,0

The announcements are classified according to: language of the job announcement; geographical area of the employer; the controller's tasks; the controller's professional requirements; education and qualification; practical experience; personal attributes; age; salary etc. The results of the research consist in the current profile of a controller in a Romanian bank and in an overview of its evolution over time.

State and local debt and deficit issues are equally serious. The debate is ongoing as to what reforms will effectively address these pressing concerns. On the federal level the proposed solutions include a balanced budget amendment, elimination of the debt limit altogether, and consideration of failure to pay the US debt a constitutional violation based on the Public Debt Clause, which, it is argued, allows violations to be justiciable, on the one hand, and focusing on growth rather than debt and deficit on the other. On the State and municipal level proposals range from relying on market mechanisms, imposing constitutional limits on debt, tying the debt threshold to annual revenue, and submitting issuance of bonds or other indebtedness to the electorate for approval.

Two independent samples representing the 9-year period preceding the 2005 banking consolidation exercise and the corresponding 9-year post consolidation period were analyzed. Performance assessment indicators analyzed in the study are non-performing loans ratio (asset quality), return on assets (earnings/profitability), capital adequacy ratio (long-term liquidity) liquidity ratio (short-term liquidity), bank loans and advances ratio (credit delivery) and bank assets ratio (bank size). Levene's independent sample t-test was used to determine evidence of significant difference in banking sector performance between the pre- and post-consolidation periods. At 5 per cent level of significance, the study shows evidence of significant differences in asset quality, capital adequacy ratio and loans and advances ratio. However, there is no evidence that return on assets, liquidity ratio and bank asset ratio differ significantly between the pre- and post-consolidation periods. Based on the above results, we conclude that banking consolidation significantly impacted on banking sector performance in Nigeria. We therefore recommend introduction of adequate regulatory measures, by the relevant authorities, in the sector as well as implementation of robust human capital development initiatives as imperatives for nurturing and sustaining the gains of the exercise.","[Okoye, Lawrence Uchenna; Adetiloye, Kehinde A.; Evbuomwan, Grace O.] Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria; [Erin, Olayinka] Covenant Univ, Dept Accounting, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria",Covenant University; Covenant University,"Okoye, LU (通讯作者)，Covenant Univ, Dept Banking & Finance, Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria.",lawrence.okoye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; kehinde.adetiloye@covenantuniversity.edu.ng; olayinka.erin@stu.cu.edu.ng; grace.evbuomwan@cu.edu.ng,"Adetiloye, Kehinde Adekunle/P-8608-2018; Evbuomwan, Grace/D-6423-2019; Erin, Olayinka/D-8669-2019","Adetiloye, Kehinde Adekunle/0000-0002-7171-0793;",,,,,34,2,2,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4395,4407,,,,,,13,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700439,0

The study applied a multilevel SEM technique to investigate a research question that had not been previously studied. The results from the model indicated that service quality has a positive influence on satisfaction, which was found to be significantly and positively related to loyalty at both the individual and school levels. The quality of bus services was measured using three factors: type of vehicle, driver response, and bus management. These factors were determined to be priorities for bus businesses in developing user loyalty and satisfaction.

J,"Rossouw, J",,,,"Rossouw, Jannie",,,PRIVATE SHAREHOLDING: AN ANALYSIS OF AN ECLECTIC GROUP OF CENTRAL BANKS,SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,central banks; shareholders,,"Although the title seems to be a contradictio in terminis, this paper identifies a small, eclectic number of central banks with private shareholders about which little has been published. It is shown that only the central banks of Belgium, Greece, Italy, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States (US) Federal Reserve Banks allow shareholding other than by the government of the respective countries, although not in all instances by the general public. This paper considers private shareholding in this eclectic group of central banks, despite the trend of nationalising central banks that commenced in 1935. Private shareholding is defined as shareholding in a central bank by any party other than the respective government or governments (e.g. the European Central Bank) where the central bank is located. Large differences in the classes of shareholders of these eclectic central banks and differences in their approaches to dividend payments are highlighted in the paper. The conclusions reached are, firstly, that investment only in the shares of the central banks of Belgium and Greece (albeit only for residents in the latter instance) can be regarded as growth investments. Secondly, shareholding in the Italian central bank has been used to recapitalise ailing commercial banks. Thirdly, shareholders play no role in the formulation and implementation of monetary policy. Lastly, the shareholding structure of these banks contributes to improved governance in the case of the central banks of Belgium, Greece, Italy, South Africa, Switzerland and Turkey, but no evidence can be found that central banks with shareholders in any way outperform central banks without shareholders.","[Rossouw, Jannie] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Witwatersrand,"Rossouw, J (通讯作者)，Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Econ & Business Sci, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa.",,,"Rossouw, Jannie/0000-0001-6200-1621",Economic Research South Africa (ERSA),Economic Research South Africa (ERSA),The author wishes to acknowledge Economic Research South Africa (ERSA) for financial assistance with this paper.,,17,4,6,0,4,"UNIV PRETORIA, DEPT ECONOMICS",PRETORIA,"TUKKIEWERF 1-11, PRETORIA, 0002, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

University campuses are one of the affected environments involved in this issue as a high dependency on private vehicles causes traffic congestion in the campus area particularly during peak hours leading to concerns about parking especially for the established universities. Therefore, alternative transport solutions should be considered in minimizing the environmental consequences specifically within the campus area. With an adapted technological means, at minimal cost that best suits student capacity, a feasible mode of transport for use within the campus area was visually developed. The emphasis of this new mode of transport is on short journeys around the campus area as well as short commutes from home to campus. The electric bike (E-Bike) will provide an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to getting around campus. The objectives of this research are to study the relevance of E-Bike usage within the campus area and to examine the factors that might encourage students to use the E-Bike. A set of questionnaire with the visually developed E-Bike was randomly distributed to 100 students in Universiti Teknologi MARA(UiTM), Alor Gajah, Malaysia campus and data analysis was conducted by using SPSS version 20. The findings revealed that the proposed E-Bike was relevant with the expected benefits perceived by the students. This feasible commuting mode can get people out of their cars, reduce the number of vehicles on campus with lower carbon emissions, promote a healthy lifestyle among students and staff, reduce travel costs and fuel consumption as well as save parking space in campus area to avoid traffic congestion.

Partnership of three higher education institutions from three countries was organized to implement LEARNIT research project: WSEI (University of Economics and Innovation, Poland), KVK (Klaipeda State College, Lithuania), and TSI (Transport and Telecommunication Institute, Latvia). The key project outcomes are supposed to be the properly equipped Learning Lab and software for mobile devices intended for enhancing the effectiveness of the learning process by stimulating students' concentration. LEARNIT is a complex multidimensional research project that involves people of different professions and positions: researchers, managers, teachers, IT specialists and students. Therefore, the management of LEARNIT is a complicated process that requires strong integration of various resources, as well as different pedagogical and managerial procedures. The aim of the paper is to address the main challenges faced by the LEARNIT management in the project implementation process, and to describe key focus areas of this project. The analysis provided in this paper is based on the academic literature review on the major educational and project management issues; it is also based on the author's experience as the project leader from Transport and Telecommunication Institute. The analysis performed in this paper allows the author to conclude that the implementation of a cross-disciplinary research project demands using the holistic approach to the management of heterogeneous organizational resources. The success of a cross-disciplinary research project is directly related to the accomplishment of a synergistic effect; the expected synergistic effect arises from strong cooperation between main functional domains of a university, so the project should be aligned with the appropriate management functions carried out in the agenda of functional area-specific strategies implementation. The author hopes that whatever lessons this analysis provides would be helpful to managers responsible for implementing a complex research project in a modern university.","[Stukalina, Yulia] Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia",Transport & Telecommunication Institute - Latvia,"Stukalina, Y (通讯作者)，Transport & Telecommun Inst, Riga, Latvia.",Stukalina.J@tsi.lv,"Stukalina, Yulia/AAU-2859-2020","Stukalina, Yulia/0000-0002-2660-4975",,,,,40,0,0,0,4,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,789,800,,,,,,12,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200068,0

By 2008, IAPs were estimated at the national level to cover an area of 1 813 million condensed hectares in South Africa. A market has formed around their use for value-added products (VAP) like charcoal, firewood and timber in the Kouga, Kromme and Baviaans River catchments in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The net economic return from these value-added industries was estimated for the purpose of several management scenarios, and was then used to estimate the opportunity costs if they were not used. A system dynamics model was used to value and analyse the Net Present Value of clearing in the study area and to estimate the opportunity cost of the non-use of VAP. The study showed that the inclusion of VAPs in the project would yield higher net present values for clearing. The findings from this study suggest that a co-finance option of the total economic returns from VAP for clearing costs is the best management scenario for reducing the costs of clearing and maximising the net economic returns from clearing. The net economic returns of VAPs by 2030 are estimated at R23 million without the co-finance option and R26 million with the option. The cumulative net income from VAPs with co-financing over the period of valuation is estimated to be R609 million.","[Vundla, Thulile; Nkambule, Nonophile; Morokong, Tshepo; Mudavanhu, Shepherd] ASSET Res, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James] South African Environm Observat Network, Pretoria, South Africa; [Nkambule, Nonophile] Univ Swaziland, Dept Agr Econ & Management, Kwaluseni, Swaziland; [Mudavanhu, Shepherd] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Agr Econ, Stellenbosch, South Africa",University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); Stellenbosch University,"Vundla, T (通讯作者)，ASSET Res, Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017","Morokong, Tshepo/0000-0003-4559-6103; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010",DEA:NRM programme,DEA:NRM programme,"This study was funded by the DEA:NRM programme, who have supplied the data for this analysis.

The paper focuses on the Visegrad Group countries whose regions are less developed in the EU context. The aim of the research is to assess the development of disparities in regional economic performance of the Visegrad Group countries, to identify how the factors of economic growth determine these disparities, and partly to assess whether the integration of the Visegrad Group countries into the EU influenced the development of regional disparities in these countries. For the analysis of disparities during 2000-2013 we selected an approach of measuring real convergence (sigma-convergence). Disparities were measured in the context of a breakdown of the GDP per capita into sub-components, reflecting on the development of disparities in productivity and employment. The results show that, although regions of the Visegrad Group countries converged towards the EU average and also in terms of the Visegrad Group as a whole, regional disparities within countries rather increased. This led to a paradox where, although the objective of reducing regional disparities across the EU was satisfied, from a national perspective disparities increased. The Labour productivity factor, with its dominant yet steadily growing contribution, is the main determinant of disparities in the performance of the Visegrad Group regions. Other sources of disparities are characterized by a stable development or convergence. Only Polish regions deviated from the general conclusions, since the extent of disparities among them grew constantly, and the nature of disparities was the Labour participation rate. In terms of the impact caused by accession into the EU, the measured changes were rather minor and the identified trends had mostly been in place before the Visegrad Group countries entered the EU.","[Zdrazil, Pavel; Applova, Petra] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Zdrazil, P (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Reg & Secur Sci, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",Pavel.Zdrazil@upce.cz; Petra.Applova@upce.cz,"Zdražil, Pavel/AAM-2505-2020",,"University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration [SGSFES_2015001]","University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration","The University of Pardubice, Faculty of Economics and Administration, Project SGSFES_2015001, financially supported this work.",,47,19,19,1,15,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

It is believed that villages without a primary school will no longer be attractive to families with children, which could strengthen the process of population decline. This research examines to what extent the absence and closure of a primary school in a village influence the inward and outward flows of families with children in rural villages. We used population register data to acquire the flows at village level for the period 1996 to 2011. Data on primary schools were provided by the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. Linear regression analyses of relative inward and outward flows show that villages without a primary school, and villages that have experienced the closure of a primary school, have similar influx, but larger outward flows of families with children compared with villages with a primary school.","[Elshof, Hans; Haartsen, Tialda; Mulder, Clara H.] Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands; [Elshof, Hans] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Groningen, Netherlands",Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts & Sciences; Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute (NIDI-KNAW); University of Groningen,"Elshof, H (通讯作者)，Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demog Inst, Postbus 11650, NL-2502 AR The Hague, Netherlands.",elshof@nidi.nl; t.haartsen@rug.nl; c.h.mulder@rug.nl,"Haartsen, Tialda/AAP-2399-2020","Mulder, Clara/0000-0003-0152-2225",,,,,26,14,14,2,17,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

These conditions imply that the agreements need to realize benefits for consumers that could not otherwise be realised. Together, we call them efficiency defence. Initiated by a societal debate in the Netherlands, we analyze how environmental benefits can be included in this framework. We apply this analysis to a proposed agreement among electricity producers to jointly advance the closure of a number of coal-fired power plants. Using shadow prices as developed in environmental economics, we assess the environmental benefits of this proposed agreement. We conclude that the environmental benefits for the consumers involved are significantly smaller than the loss of consumer welfare resulting from the increase in the electricity price caused by the closure of power plants. Hence, such an agreement would infringe competition law. This case, however, shows that it is feasible to incorporate environmental effects into an efficiency defence of an anticompetitive agreement made for the purpose of sustainability.","[Kloosterhuis, Erik; Mulder, Machiel] Author Consumers & Markets, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Mulder, Machiel] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Kloosterhuis, E (通讯作者)，Author Consumers & Markets, Amsterdam, Netherlands.",erik.kloosterhuis@acm.nl; machiel.mulder@rug.nl,,"Mulder, Machiel/0000-0003-4175-6915",,,,,40,11,11,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Limits on D&O insurance are related to settlements in only the weakest cases (those without allegations of accounting violations or institutional lead plaintiffs) where proxies for cases' merits play a minimal role.

In my earlier paper, Locking the Doors to Discovery, I argued that in doing so, special care is required in formulating the object of empirical study. Taking party behavior seriously, as Locking the Doors does, leads to empirical results suggesting that Twombly and lqbal have had substantial effects among cases that face Rule 12(b)(6) motions post-lqbal. This paper responds to potentially important critiques of my empirical implementation made by the FJC's Joe Cecil and Professor David Engstrom. An additional contribution of the present paper is to elucidate some important challenges for empirical work in civil procedure. First, researchers should carefully consider which covariates belong in statistical models, while also taking care in assessing the empirical importance of controlling for covariates. Second, data collection protocols should be designed with behavioral assumptions in mind. But third, researchers should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good: even data protocols that are less than perfectly designed may be broadly useful. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A least squares-based statistical test has been proposed in the literature. However, previous studies on univariate time series analysis show that classical nonlinearity tests are often not robust to additive outliers. The outlier problem is expected to pose similar difficulties for multivariate nonlinearity tests. In this paper, we propose a new and robust MTAR-type nonlinearity test, and derive the asymptotic null distribution of the test statistic. A Monte Carlo experiment is carried out to compare the power of the proposed test with that of the least squares-based test under the influence of additive time series outliers.

In this paper, we explore whether expansions in such laws are indeed associated with reductions in teen birth rates. In order to codify statutory-rape-law expansions, we use a national micro-level sample of sexual encounters to simulate the degree to which such encounters generally implicate the relevant laws. By codifying statutory rape laws in terms of their potential reach into sexual encounters, as opposed to using crude binary treatment variables, this simulation approach facilitates the use of multi-state difference-in-difference designs in the face of highly heterogeneous legal structures. Our results suggest that live birth rates for teenage mothers fall by roughly 4.5% (or 0.1 percentage points) upon a 1 standard-deviation increase in the share of sexual activity among a given age group that triggers a felony for the elder party to the encounter. This response, however, is highly heterogeneous across ages and weakens notably in the case of the older teen years. Furthermore, we do not find strong results suggesting a further decline in birth rates upon increases in punishment severities.","[Frakes, Michael D.] Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Law, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Harding, Matthew C.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC 27706 USA",Northwestern University; Duke University,"Frakes, MD (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Law, 375 East Chicago Ave, Chicago, IL 60611 USA.",michael.frakes@law.northwestern.edu,,,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Public Health Law Research Program,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Public Health Law Research Program(Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)),"We would like to thank the following people for their helpful comments: David Abrams, Glenn Cohen, Einer Elhauge, Jonathan Gruber, Michael Heise, Sheri Johnson, Ted Joyce, Mitchel Lasser, Anup Malani, Thomas Miles, Emily Owens, J.

Regular public road transportation traditionally uses fixed routes and schedules, which can be extremely expensive in rural areas and certain periods of the day in urban areas due to low and unpredictable demand. Demand Responsive Transportation systems are a kind of hybrid transportation approach between a taxi and a bus that try to address these problems with routes and frequencies that may vary according to the actual observed demand. Demand Responsive Transportation seems to have potential to answer the sustainability and social inclusion challenges in a context of austerity. However, DRT projects may fail: it is not only important to solve the underlying model in an efficient way, but also to understand how different ways of operating the service affect customers and operators. To help design DRT services, we developed an innovative approach integrating simulation and optimization. Using this simulator, we compared a real night-time bus service in the city of Porto, Portugal, with a hypothetical flexible DRT service for the same scenario. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The microdata are drawn from the 9-year-old cohort of the Growing Up in Ireland Study. We estimate regression models to identify the factors associated with internet use in the classroom and students' scores on standardised reading and mathematics tests, and we check whether internet use is endogenous in the test score models. We find that provision of broadband service under the government scheme is associated with more than a doubling of teachers' use of the internet in class after about a two year lag. Better computing facilities in schools are also associated with higher internet use, but advertised download speed is not statistically significant. Internet use in class is associated with significantly higher average mathematics and reading scores on standardised tests.

In investor owned firms, if the contract allows for flexible wages, the employer may have an incentive to opportunistically claim low demand and cut wages. Anticipating the employer's opportunism, workers may demand a fixed-wage contract, which may lead to inefficient layoffs in the presence of negative demand shocks. In contrast, in cooperatives, where the employer does respond to workers, the risk of employer's opportunism diminishes and results in an equilibrium characterized by more flexible wages and fewer layoffs. By developing these arguments we challenge the traditional explanation of workers' preference for fixed wages based on risk aversion. To support our claim, we develop a principal agent model in which there is incomplete information on both sides of the employment relation. We model both the case of investor-owned firms and worker cooperatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Insights from the Los Angeles Metro bus system,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Public transit; Ridership; Service reliability; On-time performance,TRAVEL-TIME RELIABILITY; QUALITY; ROUTE; STOP; UNRELIABILITY; VARIABILITY; VALUATION,"We explore whether improving service reliability can be effective in increasing transit patronage. Survey data shows that reliability is highly valued by passengers, because unreliability results in unpredictable wait times, missed transfer connections, and penalties associated with arriving at the destination earlier or later than desired. Consequently, transit planners have devoted significant effort towards measuring unreliability, exploring factors that cause unreliability, and developing strategies to increase reliability. However, we still know very little about how service reliability influences demand - i.e. whether reliability can be used as a tool to increase patronage. We use data from the Los Angeles Metro bus transit system to analyze the variation in boardings across lines and find service reliability to be a significant determinant of patronage. The reliability effect appears to be stronger in the weekday peak relative to the off-peak. Our results suggest that better schedule adherence can potentially promote patronage of fixed-route fixed-schedule transit systems. Reliability improvements may lead to productivity gains for transit agencies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

To promote efficiency, ACOs sign contracts under which they keep a fraction of the savings from keeping costs below target provided they also maintain quality levels. To promote integration and facilitate measurement, ACOs are required to have at least 5000 enrollees and so must coordinate across many providers. We calibrate a model of optimal ACO incentives using proprietary performance measures from a large insurer. Our key finding is that free-riding is a severe problem and causes optimal incentive payments to exceed cost savings unless ACOs simultaneously achieve extremely large efficiency gains. This implies that successful ACOs will likely rely on motivational strategies that amplify the effects of underpowered incentives.

Neither depiction predicts that the structure of institutions meant to control corruption should vary across autocratic regimes. If corruption results from moral hazard between politicians and citizens, then all unaccountable governments should eschew anticorruption bodies. If rent-seeking stems from moral hazard between politicians and bureaucrats, all governments should create anticorruption bodies. We offer an explanation for why unaccountable governments vary in their willingness to create anticorruption institutions. Autocrats create such bodies to deter ideologically disaffected members of the populace from entering the bureaucracy. Anticorruption institutions act as a commitment by the elite to restrict the monetary benefits from bureaucratic office, thus ensuring that only zealous supporters of the elite will pursue bureaucratic posts.

Given that SMEs are rarely able to make such a transition, we elaborate this dynamic process by performing case studies on eight Korean SMEs. These SMEs created their own paths instead of following their forerunners. These paths are neither entirely new nor take the form of leapfrogging, but are characterized by new combinations of existing paths. We identify several risk factors, such as counterattacks and intellectual property lawsuits, that latecomer SMEs face from incumbent SMEs. In addition, we emphasize the importance of cultivating firm-specific knowledge by engaging in a continuing process of trial and error type in-house experiments.","[Lee, Keun] Seoul Natl Univ, Econ, Seoul, South Korea; [Song, Jaeyong; Kwak, Jooyoung] Yonsei Univ, Sch Business, Seoul 120749, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Yonsei University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",kenneth@snu.ac.kr,"Lee, Keun/AAU-8046-2020","Lee, Keun/0000-0002-0403-6348",Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2013S1A3A2053312],Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea),The first author acknowledges the support from the Korean government through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF-2013S1A3A2053312).,,46,34,35,2,48,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

However, there is a lack of empirical research which examines the relationship between CVC investment and the corporate investors' technological diversification. In this study, we investigate the effects of CVC investments on corporate investors' technological diversity by using 20 years of panel data from corporate investors in five high-tech industries. As a result, we find that the total amount of CVC investments and the industrial diversity of portfolio companies exhibit curvilinear (inverted U-shape) relationships with the corporate investors' technological diversity. Moreover, the empirical results show that the absorptive capacity of corporate investors positively moderates the effects of CVC investments on the technological diversity.","[Lee, Simon U.; Kang, Jina] Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program TEMEP, Seoul, South Korea; [Kang, Jina] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Seoul, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Seoul National University (SNU),"Kang, J (通讯作者)，Seoul Natl Univ, Technol Management Econ & Policy Program TEMEP, Seoul, South Korea.",profkang@snu.ac.kr,,,National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [NRF-2013S1A5A2A01019872],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant(National Research Foundation of Korea),This research has been supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant [grant number NRF-2013S1A5A2A01019872].,,84,30,33,11,123,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using a well-known database, maintained by Robert Shiller, we implement a forecasting competition that imposes different layers of PVM restrictions. Our exhaustive investigation of several different multivariate models reveals that better forecasts can be achieved when restrictions are applied to the unrestricted VAR.

Although the Internet reduces many distance-related frictions, local and distant funders exhibit different funding patterns. Local funders appear less responsive to information about the cumulative funds raised by an artist. However, this distance effect appears to proxy for a social effect: it is largely explained by funders who likely have an offline social relationship with the artist (friends and family). Yet, this social effect does not persist past the first investment, suggesting that it may be driven by an activity like search but not monitoring. Thus, although the platform seems to diminish many distance-sensitive costs, it does not eliminate all of them.

In three experiments, we investigate the influence of loyalty rebates on consumers based on the alternative Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT). CPT predicts that loyalty rebates could harm consumers by impeding rational switching from an incumbent to an outside option (for example, a market entrant). In a repeated trading task, participants decided whether or not to enter a loyalty rebate scheme and to continue buying within that scheme. Meeting the condition triggering the rebate was uncertain. Loyalty rebates considerably reduced the likelihood that participants switched to a higher-payoff outside option later. We conclude that loyalty rebates may inflict substantial harm on consumers and may have an underestimated potential to foreclose consumer markets. Our findings therefore provide additional arguments why a dominant firm using target rebates may monopolize a market or abuse its market power. They also provide arguments why target rebates may raise consumer protection concerns.","[Morell, Alexander; Gloeckner, Andreas; Towfigh, Emanuel V.] Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Gloeckner, Andreas] Univ Gottingen, Bonn, Germany",Max Planck Society; University of Gottingen,"Morell, A (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Res Collect Goods, Kurt Schumacher Str 10, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",morell@coll.mpg.de,"Glöckner, Andreas/B-8897-2011; Towfigh, Emanuel V./I-8564-2012","Glöckner, Andreas/0000-0002-7766-4791; Towfigh, Emanuel V./0000-0001-6323-8540",,,,,48,0,0,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

There are two ways that this training can lead to new growthjust as there are two ways that existing biological DNA can lead to the growth of bio-mass, namely, (1) existing organisms getting bigger or (2) by spinning out offspring who in turn can spin out more offspring. Where growth has been vibrant, e.g., Silicon Valley, it has followed the second route, growth by offspring. This is also the biological principle of plenitude. Conventional ownership structures lessen the incentives for spin-offs since managers do not want to reduce the empire under their control. The biological principle of plenitude is best implemented with employee-owned or cooperative firms (e.g., as in the Mondragon cooperative group). Inspired by ideas first proposed by Henry George and Jane Jacobs, this article explores the social benefits of applying the biological principle of plenitude by encouraging the proliferation of enterprises. This poses a conundrum for societies organized around the private business model: How can the social benefits of spin-offs be realized when managers do not have an incentive to foster new businesses? We conclude with ways to address this problem.","Univ Calif Riverside, Riverside, CA 92507 USA",University of California System; University of California Riverside,"Ellerman, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, 4044 Mt Vernon Ave, Riverside, CA 92507 USA.",david@ellerman.org,"Ellerman, David/AAI-9466-2020","Ellerman, David/0000-0002-5718-618X",,,,,8,2,2,0,14,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Much has been written, pro and con, on George's single tax and on Jacobs's battles with urban planners, and while I don't directly address either here, what I say does have implications for those controversies. In particular, I show how and why their views on the nature of economic progress, and of cities in that progress, fundamentally differ. I trace the difference to George's essentially classical approach to economics in contrast to Jacobs's subjectivist approach, which more radically transcends the economics of her time.","[Ikeda, Sanford] SUNY Coll Purchase, Econ Program, Purchase, NY USA; [Ikeda, Sanford] NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; New York University,"Ikeda, S (通讯作者)，NYU, New York, NY 10003 USA.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

J,"Siren, A; Sorensen, CH",,,,"Siren, Anu; Sorensen, Claus Hedegaard",,,Immense changes in traffic - Considerable stability in discourses. Road speed in Danish parliamentary documents 1900-2010,TRANSPORT POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Road speed; Policy; History; Parliamentary; Qualitative methods,SAFETY; POLICY; LIMITS,"Research on road safety acknowledges speed as having a major impact on both the number and severity of road crashes, and this seems to have been translated into policies. However, a closer look reveals that the societal debate and political context also seem to play a major role in the way road safety policies are shaped. Yet, the knowledge on the political discourse regarding speeding and speed management is scarce. In this paper, we analyze the ways speed has been managed and legislated in transport policymaking by studying Danish parliamentary documents from 1903 through 2010. Analyzing the material qualitatively in two phases, first, we looked for notable policy shifts in the material, and consequently identified five historical periods. Second, we analyzed these periods in more detail, and identified and analyzed four repetitive discourses about speed across them, which were as follows: speed, individual rights and responsibilities; speed and safety; speed, policy measures, and law enforcement; and speed and other societal goals. While the transport system has undergone a massive change during the last 100 years, we found a considerable stability in the discourses regarding speed policies. The themes and patterns we distinguished in the documents occurred repeatedly. Certain discourses are strongly connected to the way speed is discussed and governed, and these are likely to emerge when speed policies are taken up in the parliamentary context. We conclude that in addition to the current prominent discourses, past discourses may have a strong influence on the way safety measures and policies are being understood and accepted.

A central tenet of the new paradigm was that a central bank which acts in a transparent and predictable manner reduces uncertainty for economic actors and will be better able to control inflationary expectations. Thus, central bankers set out to enhance their institution's transparency. In this paper, I argue that transparency is not limited to the release of economic data or information about decision-making procedures. It entails producing a new type of market order and results in a new agencement. This paper focuses on the European Central Bank (ECB) and on one actor it relies on: the media. Based on ethnographic data, I analyse the role of the media in the production of a transparent market order. I find that prevailing new rules, new frames and reward systems preclude journalists from playing the role the ECB would like them to play: the instrumental role of a neutral transmitter of information. The struggle between the two actors is a struggle with words, in which both journalists and central bankers want to manipulate markets with their communicative utterances, albeit in different and frequently opposing ways.","Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, NL-1012 DK Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Velthuis, O (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Sociol & Anthropol, OZ Achterburgwal 185, NL-1012 DK Amsterdam, Netherlands.",O.J.M.Velthuis@uva.nl,,,,,,,68,20,22,1,31,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

This service, providing advanced, personalized and flexible demand-responsive PT, is offered to specific clientele, especially commuters. The present work analyzes, for the first time, the evolution of this new PT concept across 30 Chinese cities where CB systems are currently in operation or under construction. Unlike conventional bus transit service, CB users are actively involved in various operational planning activities. CB personalizes PT service by using interactive and integrated information platforms, such as internet website, telephone and smartphone. The analysis comprises three components: first, a comprehensive examination of the background of CB and its temporal and spatial distribution in China; second, an analysis of the operation-planning process, including elements of online demand collection, network route design, timetable development, vehicle scheduling, crew scheduling, real-time control, and fare design and collection: third, a summary of the results of the examination and analysis, presenting pros, cons and recommendations. The successful implementation of CB in China demonstrates that this new PT service concept can effectively meet the ever-increasing mobility needs of large populations nation-wide. Similarly, the present work can provide a valuable reference for policymakers, academic researchers, PT practitioners and others worldwide. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A prominent application of this is the concept of the information coefficient (IC). Not only can the IC be used as a tool to rate analysts and fund managers but it also represents an important parameter in the asset allocation and portfolio construction process. Nevertheless, a theoretical understanding of it has typically been limited to the partial equilibrium context where the investing activities of each agent have no effect on other market participants. In this paper we show that this can be an undesirable oversimplification and we demonstrate plausible circumstances in which conventional empirical measurements of IC can be highly misleading. We suggest that improved understanding of IC in a general equilibrium setting can lead to refined portfolio decision making ex ante and more informative analysis of performance ex post.

For Baker, Pauly redefined moral hazard fundamentally, shifting the term from an insurance industry definition which centred on character and temptation to an economics definition that emphasized maximizing agents and incentives. This paper takes issue with that assessment and instead presents a revisionist genealogy of the term. The paper makes two critical observations of Baker. First, it questions the linearity of Baker's history by demonstrating empirically that Pauly's influence only took hold in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This finding suggests that the history of the term should be understood as a process of perpetual discovery and reordering, rather than as a linear, forward progression towards greater clarity and rationality. Second, drawing on archival material, it questions the idea that the meaning of moral hazard was ever clear and unitary either before or after Pauly. The paper argues that moral hazard, in contrast to other forms of economic knowledge, is 'fuzzy', not 'precise'. Finally, in an attempt to theorize this 'fuzziness', the paper argues that moral hazard is both mutable and mobile, characterized by constancy and variance. It concludes that this mutability in part explains the ubiquitous appeal of the term across the political spectrum.","Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change, Manchester M15 6PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Leaver, A (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester Business Sch, Ctr Res Sociocultural Change, D26 MBS East,Booth St East, Manchester M15 6PL, Lancs, England.",adam.leaver@mbs.ac.uk,,"Leaver, Adam/0000-0001-6199-6057",,,,,43,12,12,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

It presents motives, conditions and forms of expansion and is comprises of three parts. In the first one, the theoretical aspects of a company's internationalization are discussed, with stress on motives and forms of entering foreign markets. The second part is concerned with the complex problems regarding methodology of research goals, hypotheses, methods and description of study sample are the main focus here. The synthetic, summation of the results of the study are presented in the third part. The study verifies the hypotheses regarding motives of internationalization and concrete forms of entering foreign markets. The most powerful premises to internationalize Polish companies are market motives. The relationship between the size of the company, decision to start export goods and the nature of expansion (offensive, as well as defensive) has been ascertained. One of the strong motives for internationalization among companies belonging to SME group, were encouragements and invitations for cooperation from foreign partners. However, the main strategy was direct export, complemented by other forms of expansion, of lesser importance. In the expanding process Polish exporters took advantage of direct investments, via establishing divisions and subsidiary companies that deal with distribution of products. The waterfall strategy proved to be the most common in entering foreign markets used by roughly 70% of the examined exporters. The research could be a contribution into the process of scientific examination and development of international business practice. It can also provide a ground for further discussion on marketing internationalization, methodology of formulating marketing strategies, their nature and assessing their effectiveness on international markets. Last but not least it can encourage more such scientific studies and research conducted by international teams of scholars.","[Dad'o, Jaroslav] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Wiktor, Jan W.; Zbikowska, Agnieszka] Cracow Univ Econ, Fac Management, Dept Mkt, Krakow, Poland",Matej Bel University; Cracow University of Economics,"Dad'o, J (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",jaroslav.dado@umb.sk; jan.wiktor@uek.krakow.pl; zbikowska@uek.krakow.pl,,"Wiktor, Jan Wladyslaw/0000-0001-6353-7620; Zbikowska, Agnieszka/0000-0003-4216-1817",,,,,27,3,3,4,30,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

In addition to this, rural development policies have to promote measures especially for semi-subsistence farms that can be applied in all member states with a special focus on reducing farm income inequality.","[Dona, Ion; Toma, Elena; Dobre, Carina; Balan, Aurelia Vasilica] Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, Bucharest 011464, Romania; [Vlad, Mihaela Cristina] Inst Agr Econ & Rural Dev, Bucharest 011464, Romania",University of Agronomic Science & Veterinary Medicine - Bucharest,"Dona, I (通讯作者)，Univ Agron Sci & Vet Med Bucharest, 59 Marasti Blvd,Dist 1, Bucharest 011464, Romania.",ion_dona@yahoo.com; elenatoma2001@yahoo.com; dobrecarina@yahoo.com; cristinamiha@yahoo.com; balanaureliav@yahoo.com,"TOMA, ELENA/B-1263-2012; Dobre, Carina Andreea/HZJ-3666-2023","TOMA, ELENA/0000-0002-5716-9486; Dobre, Carina Andreea/0009-0004-6194-6913",,,,,13,0,0,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,648,656,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700066,0

The aim of the Paper is to detect the level of sustainability in the EU and its countries by means of the Ecological Footprint, its comparison with the available resources, as well as its relations to the standard of living and the level of human development. Regarding the investigation of regions the highest Ecological Footprint per capita is typical of North America followed by the EU region. The results of the countries vary according to the varying levels of factors affecting the Ecological Footprint and their different biocapacities. The Northern countries dispose of largest biocapacities and are thus the largest resource creditors. The worst results of the Ecological Footprint - biocapacity relations are typical of Cyprus, Belgium, Netherlands and Italy. In addition to other factors, at least in the sample of the developed countries, the positive relations exist between the Ecological Footprint on the one side and standard of living / state of the human development on the other side.","[Drastichova, Magdalena] VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Drastichová, M (通讯作者)，VSB TU Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Reg & Environm Econ, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",magdalena.drastichova@vsb.cz,"Drastichová, Magdaléna/ABE-6264-2020",,,,,,14,5,5,0,3,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,31,39,,,,,,9,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800005,0

Therefore, our empirical survey examines talent management practices from the perspective of different sized enterprises in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The findings are based on data collection from 174 enterprises in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Overall, the survey indicates that talent management is not of primary concern to most organisations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. These findings are not particularly surprising, as talent management is not a key issue for most organisations, particularly SMEs. Nevertheless, we argue that talent management is a crucial challenge for all organisations aiming to enhance their competitive advantages. This study's major findings prove that enterprise size is a relevant determinant of approaches to talent management and its practice within the enterprises. Several important differences between SMEs and large organisations were found. First, SMEs adopt a more exclusive approach to talent than do large firms, where an inclusive approach dominates. Furthermore, SMEs' strategic approach to talent management is limited, with most adopting an ad hoc approach to talent management practices. Thus, the shift towards holistic and strategic approaches to talent management constitutes one of the most important challenges for those organisations. The research survey raises a number of important issues that should be considered by enterprises when they engage in talent management. The survey has added to our understanding of the talent management implementation in different types of enterprises.","[Egerova, Dana] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Plzen, Czech Republic; [Lancaric, Drahoslav; Savov, Radovan] Slovak Univ Agr, Nitra Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Nitra, Slovakia; [Eger, Ludvik] Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Mkt Trade & Serv, Plzen, Czech Republic",University of West Bohemia Pilsen; Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Egerová, D (通讯作者)，Univ W Bohemia, Fac Econ, Dept Business Adm & Management, Plzen, Czech Republic.",egerova@kpm.zcu.cz; drahoslav.lancaric@uniag.sk; leger@kmo.zcu.cz; radovan.savov@uniag.sk,"Lancaric, Drahoslav/AAD-8710-2019; Eger, Ludvik/C-1330-2016","Lancaric, Drahoslav/0000-0002-1262-6698; Eger, Ludvik/0000-0002-5437-3297; Egerova, Dana/0000-0003-1824-9288; Savov, Radovan/0000-0002-4882-0978",,,,,41,16,16,0,29,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

This paper focuses on the basic function, the development of human capital, only, due to the importance of this function for the performance of the other two functions. In the light of the important role that South Africa plays in the regional innovation system of Southern Africa, it is the aim of this paper to determine to what extent the universities in South Africa fulfil the function of developing human capital. Criteria for the evaluation of the human capital development roles of universities are identified from literature.

In fact, the effects overlaid the effects of the labour system's crisis in the Romanian mining sector existing for over 20 years. There were identified those who considered themselves affected by this crisis, the solutions they used or were going to use in the future in order to overcome it, what was the institutional responsible for taking the measures to overcome the crisis. The hypothesis of the paper was confirmed: that those who consider themselves affected by the crisis are more afraid for their jobs than the others. The job as an economical and social safety element affords them the psychological comfort that they will be able to overcome the crisis.

The key tenet of the REV is that the heterogeneity and imperfect mobility of strategic factor markets and institutions across countries explain how firms based in different countries would likely both create and sustain a competitive advantage. In particular, our study introduces the notion of the paradox of environmental embeddedness. The paradox lies in the fact that the same environmental conditions - in terms of strategic factor markets and institutions - that enable firms to create a competitive advantage can paradoxically also create a situation in which it is more difficult for these firms to sustain an advantage. Another important aspect of our study is that, to enhance our understanding of how firms manage the paradox of environmental embeddedness, our study specifies the resource environmental conditions under which firms' internal and external resource-oriented strategies - that is, the development of dynamic capabilities and interventions in the country resource environment - are more beneficial when managing the environmental paradox. Overall, our theorizing has important implications for strategic management theory and practice.","[Kim, Heechun] Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Int Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA; [Hoskisson, Robert E.] Rice Univ, Jones Sch Business, Strateg Management, Houston, TX USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia State University; Rice University,"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Georgia State Univ, J Mack Robinson Coll Business, Int Business, Atlanta, GA 30303 USA.",,"Kim, Heechun/AAV-4412-2020",,,,,,115,7,7,1,9,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,95,140,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028008,0.0,,,46,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300007,0

As a result, many such entities started investigating their options to offer construction services and products to more economically attractive foreign markets. This necessitates the need to assess the effectiveness of investments into new markets, considering the current developmental trends of the construction sector, which are related to implementation of sustainable construction projects. Close cooperation of Baltic States at the national level and joint activities of several construction market participants predetermine the necessity to assess biggest cities of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia being the potential market of construction sector to be selected as a target segment of efficient development of construction needs. These are the reasons behind the creation of a typical calculation model, which could be adapted for an effective and uncomplicated assessment of investment rationale in new markets while ensuring the adherence to principles of sustainable development. Assessment of potential capabilities of a construction sector of three Baltic capitals (Vilnius, Riga, Tallinn) could provide the opportunity to direct capital and investments of construction market participants in the wore efficient way and create the highest added value for the economy, residents and development of sustainable environments. Identification of project implementation area is a key factor in determining directions of the activity performed by private investors, performed in order to assess the opportunity of efficient realisation of construction project proposed for implementation with particular environment.

The results of poor and/or lack of proper building maintenance are dilapidation of buildings, and thus affecting the building safety, or even the occurrence of accidents which cause fatalities and injuries to occupants and the general public. Due to the discrepancies of the current measures, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) plans to implement the Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS) in near future as one of the effective and ready measures to ensure the property owners to take their responsibility to properly upkeep their properties. This paper aims to provide an overview of the problem of building decay in Hong Kong, the current government measures for dilapidated buildings and the MBIS. Two case studies of accidents occurred in Hong Kong which are the results of poor maintenance or lack of proper building inspection will be explored. In addition, a comparison of MBIS with other similar building inspection schemes across different regions will be highlighted for better understanding of MBIS which can facilitate its implementation in near future.

The aim of this study is to define the differences between management and leadership. Subsequently to provide an overview of previously published studies in the field of leadership theory. The contribution is the identification of the different approaches and schools of thought to obtain holistic view and the ability to perceive leadership as part of management in all its contexts. Identified relations provides better understanding of the topic and are subsequently a basis for processing research in the current state of managerial competencies in Czech corporations.","[Mazanek, Lukas; Konecna, Zdenka] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Mazánek, L (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",mazanek@fbm.vutbr.cz; konecna@fbm.vutbr.cz,"Mazanek, Lukas/F-1450-2018","Mazanek, Lukas/0000-0002-6100-1707",,,,,56,1,1,0,10,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1154,1163,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700113,0

They assume that the us-TFT agent must observe only what occurred in himself/herself and his/her friends. However, when all agents become mutual friends, they observe all other agents, hence us-TFT suffers from the same weakness of related studies. To overcome the weakness, we propose a new us-TFT strategy with which an agent observes a limited number of other agents. A limited number of other agents are selected based on how peacefully they act toward the new us-TFT agent. We performed evolutionary simulations with this strategy and found the emergence of a peaceful state. It means that a peaceful state can emerge without observing all other agent's actions. In addition, we find that the more the limited number is, the less frequently a peaceful state emerge.","[Muto, Masayoshi; Kawachi, Fumiaki; Nakai, Yutaka] Shibaura Inst Technol, Fac Syst Engn & Sci, Minuma Ku, 307 Fukasaku, Saitama, Japan",Shibaura Institute of Technology,"Muto, M (通讯作者)，Shibaura Inst Technol, Fac Syst Engn & Sci, Minuma Ku, 307 Fukasaku, Saitama, Japan.",muto@shibaura-it.ac.jp,,,,,,,10,1,1,0,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-55236-9; 978-4-431-55235-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,53,62,,10.1007/978-4-431-55236-9_5,0.0,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380563900005,0

The study provides empirical proof that a sound knowledge of business, accounting and economic matters is a prerequisite for understanding interim reports in the case of individual shareholders. The results of the study indicate that individual shareholders have a limited understanding of the content of interim reports as a whole, and that a good knowledge of business and economic matters and of accounting results in an improved understanding of the content of interim reports.

Intellectual capital means the information, experience and skills that offer advantage in competition and reveal the values existing within the structure of an enterprise. These values also exist in the relationship between the enterprise and the environment and with the employees. Although some research studies on intellectual capital (IC) have been conducted, to date no research has been carried out on the effects of IC on qualitative and quantitative organizational performance. For this reason, IC and its effects on firm performance (both qualitative and quantitative) were evaluated in this study. Following the evaluation of the intellectual capital and its sub-elements, the differentiation of the sub-elements is made. Then the reliability and validity of these sub-factors are calculated. The intellectual capital model has been tested by the structural equality model (SEM). According to research results, IC explains 92 per cent of a firm's performance. The effect of IC on qualitative performance is 0,84, while on quantitative performance it is 0,72. RC impresses qualitative performance with coefficient 0,94, quantitative performance with coefficient 0,60; HC impresses qualitative performance with coefficient 0,92, quantitative performance with coefficient 0,54 less; SC impresses qualitative performance with coefficient 0,90, quantitative performance with coefficient 0,53.

The scenarios of increasing employment in Lithuania are identified and proposed after a thorough analysis of the global and EU strategic documents. The article states that the employment-friendly macroeconomic policy-making is a fundamental strategic guideline in order to address the problems of employment and social economic inequality. It is necessary to implement the macroeconomic policies aimed at full employment in Lithuania; the macro-economic policies should ensure dignified jobs and expand the employment opportunities, foster to adopt the necessary measures in the labour market and business in order to eliminate the effects of the crisis and at the same time to ensure stability of the public finance and tax bases. Creation of the green economy, organic farming, and green jobs are other strategic guidelines. The green economy and green jobs development are one of the priority directions of increasing employment in Lithuania. It is appropriate to integrate the idea of green jobs in the national employment plan, creating a system of indicators of eco-employment, integration of labour training needs in the region, city, and municipal strategies through such means as active labour market policies and lifelong learning.","[Rakauskiene, Ona Grazina] Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Int Trade, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Okuneviciute-Neverauskiene, Laima] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Lithuanian Social Res Ctr, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Mykolas Romeris University; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Rakauskiene, OG (通讯作者)，Mykolas Romeris Univ, Dept Int Trade, Ateities Str 20, LT-08303 Vilnius, Lithuania.",ona.rakaus@mruni.eu; Laima.Okuneviciute@dsti.lt,,,,,,,49,5,5,0,21,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The impacts of gated communities can be viewed from two different perspectives; firstly, the negative impacts which include social segregations and unhealthy urban development. Secondly, from positives impacts such as increase of property values, sense of community and other.

The key objective of this paper is to explore on the role of the resident association and their experiences in managing and maintaining the gated residential areas in Malaysia. Using a case study of gated communities in Klang Valley, this study revealed that residents association played an important role to maintain the quality of living inside the gated communities. This led to the high satisfaction level amongst the residents who live inside the gated communities' scheme. However, there is still a gap that needs further study especially on residents' behaviour that led to high satisfaction level with the concept of living inside gated communities in Malaysia.","[Tedong, Peter Aning Anak; Abd Aziz, Wan Nor Azriyati Wan; Zyed, Zafirah Al-Sadat] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Ctr Construct Bldg & Urban Studies, Studies Urban & Reg Real Estate SURE,Dept Estate, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Hanif, Noor Rosly] Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Ctr Construct Bldg & Urban Studies, Studies Urban & Reg Real Estate SURE,Fac Built En, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Tedong, PAA (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Fac Built Environm, Ctr Construct Bldg & Urban Studies, Studies Urban & Reg Real Estate SURE,Dept Estate, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",peteraning@um.edu.my; wyati@um.edu.my; nroslyhanift@gmail.com; zafirahzyed@um.edu.mv,"Zyed, Zafirah/AAY-4664-2021; Hanif, noor rosly/B-9280-2010; TEDONG, PETER Aning/I-8107-2015; wan abd aziz, wan nor azriyati/C-1024-2010","TEDONG, PETER Aning/0000-0002-5931-2274; wan abd aziz, wan nor azriyati/0000-0003-3400-4344; Zyed, Zafirah/0000-0002-2457-4637",,,,,34,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3995,4005,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700409,0

Two types of public R&D subsidies, the appropriations and loan interest, are investigated in the effect of public subsidies by applying for a unique micro data set of Chinese manufacturing firms combined with the Innovation Fund for Small and Medium Technology-based Firms (Innofund). The results are consistent with the prediction that loan interest subsidies based on more competitive selective system are more effective for the public R&D subsidies than the appropriations. Firms' heterogeneity, measured by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private-owned enterprises (POEs), is tested for the different impact of public subsidies on corporate R&D investment. The results show that the crowding-in effect is mainly driven by POEs, not by SOEs, which confirms the theoretical assumption by Aghion and Tirole that the agency problem play a dominant role in corporate R&D activities. An improved econometric method, combined propensity score matching with difference-in-differences estimation strategy, is applied for correcting the selection bias.

This paper refers to the case of bus service operations in Malta. Prior to 2011 bus service operations in Malta had not changed fundamentally for four decades. Since 2011, following a major bus service reform, bus service operations have changed a further two times. This paper discusses the four models of bus service operations experienced in Malta: Model 1 - a monopoly, Model 2 - privatisation through competitive tendering, Model 3 - nationalisation, and Model 4 - privatisation through negotiation. The paper aims to provide insights on the four models and applies a stakeholders' approach to identify how these models have affected attitudes towards the bus service in Malta amongst the public. Thirty-four in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Maltese residents and tourists visiting Malta. The main bus service characteristics that influenced the stakeholders' evaluations of the service were identified using thematic analysis. The analysis indicates that bus patrons are primarily interested in service delivery; they are not influenced by how the operator is selected. The paper draws conclusions on the wider relevance of these findings to bus operations at an international level. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses that question by analysing the decision to innovate and the number of innovations introduced. Our findings, which are based on a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms, confirm that R&D is more effective when firms also invest in worker training. Moreover, for some smaller firms, investing in workers' skills (via training programs) boosts innovation even in absence of R&D.

Although the systems have different contexts, design and operational characteristics, they have in common that over the last years their service quality has deteriorated, leading to negative users' perception and consequently decrease in patronage levels. Understanding these problematic factors is key for the mobility of these cities as they are both planning to expand their systems and consolidate multi -modal integrated transport systems in the upcoming years. Through a series of interviews with several stakeholders from institutions related to the mobility sector in each city our analysis identifies aspects of conceptual design, planning and implementation of institutional, operational, financial and management frameworks that might have been preventing the systems from achieving a better performance. Moreover, our analysis highlights two factors embedded at the core of the systems' difficulties: First, BRT technology transfer with limited understanding of context and little adaptation to local user's expectations and preferences; and second, design criteria that address financial requirements at the expense of quality of service for people's needs.

In recent years, central and local governments have taken social benefits into account to support local public transportation, but social benefits calculated in their cost-benefit analyses seem to be insufficient to evaluate them. Especially since the great earthquake in 2011, Japanese people have begun to rethink the importance of network and trust in neighborhoods, which can be called as 'social capital,' based on mobility. Therefore, focusing on 'social capital,' this paper tries to find the role of local public transportation beyond social benefits. Specifically, it makes an empirical analysis on the relationship between the indexes of 'social capital' and local bus services using cross section data. As a result, network and participation indexes standing for 'social capital' in each prefecture positively correlate with the level of local bus services. Also, according to our survey research in Toyama, introduction of a new LRT line is likely to have considerably changed the activities of residents along the line and has tended to promote more opportunities to come into contact with others than before. Those studies shed light on the role of public transportation from the standpoint of 'social capital.' (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In Santiago de Chile, each local government is in charge of providing bicycle infrastructure according to its own technical and financial restrictions. Thus, infrastructure dedicated to bicycles has increased, but its quality and design standards differ across the city. This creates an ideal test-bed for understanding how cyclists' behaviour changes under different cycle path designs. The objectives of this research are (i) to explore the conditions of Santiago's cycle path intersections in terms of speed and urban characteristics and (ii) to understand cyclists' behaviour under different cycle path conditions. Some characteristics of cycle path intersections measured were cycle path's length, slope, lateral clearance, physical segregation, bi-directionality, obstacles, and discontinuities. Also, data taken characterise users by gender and use of helmet. Linear regression models were calibrated to explain cyclists' speed using intersection characteristics. According to our model, relevant characteristics were location of cycle path, physical segregation, percentage of female users, slope, and existence of vertical discontinuities. We hope that our results will serve as a guide for public authorities on the design of cycle paths. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the dispersion of forecasts is correlated positively with the average forecast error for all forecast horizons. Second, at the current and next quarter horizons, the oil price volatility observed through to the end of the forecast horizon statistically explains the disagreement among oil forecasters. Third, we use the disagreement among forecasters to derive a measure of the price volatility which is correlated well with the volatility observed ex post. When the forecast horizon is one quarter ahead, the disagreement-based volatility is equal to the price volatility observed subsequently, plus a small add factor. These results support the view that the disagreement among forecasters reflects the price volatility. (C) 2016 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Econometric results from a sample of 140 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures support the view that the stock of resources accumulated by larger firms, firms' innovation and internationalization investments in the pre-crisis period and firms' cash flow determine the extent of the two changes.

We document, measure, and consider possible explanations for age-specific gender gaps among Hollywood actors, using nearly a century's worth of data on films and film roles. Consistent with reports in the popular press, we find a large and very persistent gender gap: Of the nearly half-million different roles played in more than 50,000 feature films between 1920 and 2011, two-thirds have gone to males, and the average male actor is consistently older (by six to ten years) than the average female actor. Yet the age-based gender differences that we observe cannot be explained by a simple model of discrimination while there are fewer roles for middle-aged women than for middle-aged men, there are more roles for young women than for young men. The fact that these patterns have held steady through major changes in the film industry-and in society as a whole -suggests that correspondingly stable aspects of moviegoer preferences contribute to the age-specific nature of gender gaps.

In contrast to new forms of shared-use mobility, casual carpooling has been in existence for over 30 years and uses no information communication technology, and is entirely run informally by its users. Researchers have been fascinated by this phenomenon and have conducted studies in the past, but there remains a lack of up-to-date quantitative data. This study examines the motivations and behaviors of casual carpoolers in the San Francisco Bay Area to understand user characteristics and motivations. In Winter 2014, the authors observed and counted participants and vehicles at four casual carpooling locations, interviewed participants riding in carpooling vehicles (N=16), and conducted intercept surveys (N=503) at 10 East Bay pickup locations. The results indicate that the motivations for casual carpooling participation include convenience, time savings, and monetary savings, while environmental and community-based motivations ranked low. Casual carpooling is an efficient transportation option for these commuters, while environmental sustainability benefits are a positive byproduct. Seventy-five percent of casual carpool users were previously public transit riders, and over 10% formerly drove alone.

It is offered with a view to help better identify the distribution of the projects costs and benefits and shed greater light on the possible 'winners' and 'losers' over space and time, and under given scenarios. Drawing from an extensive array of public domain literature the paper sets out both the policy and planning contexts for the project plus the business case that led to a decision by UK Treasury to guarantee a El billion loan to Transport for London for the construction of the Northern Line's extension. The paper looks at the scale and nature of the megaproject's features, particularly its line-haul and related real estate developments, especially those in the assigned development opportunity area. The text presents the policy, planning, legislative and regulative dimensions of the project likely to define its revenue generation prospects and environmental and social impacts, with special attention paid to those project outcomes affecting key stakeholders over time and space. The paper also seeks to explain the mechanics of how to employ a policy-led multi-criteria framework together with its associated processes within which stakeholder policies and agendas can be mapped and common/divergent interests identified. This is done with a view to ultimately facilitate stakeholder negotiation decision-making trade-offs in given scenarios under the policy guidance of the Greater London Authority with the support of the Treasury of the UK Government.

J,"Baron, DP",,,,"Baron, David P.",,,SELF-REGULATION AND THE MARKET FOR ACTIVISM,JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,PRIVATE; ORGANIZATION; IMPACT; MODEL,"This paper presents a theory of the market for activism where citizens fund activists, campaigning activists pressure firms to change their practices, and firms self-regulate to forestall or mitigate campaigns. Activists have leverage because firms must self-regulate before they are targeted, and their self-regulation must deter the activists conditional on being targeted. Activists anticipate gaining more from campaigns against soft (more vulnerable) firms than hard (less vulnerable) firms, so it is more costly for soft firms to forestall the activists, and some risk a campaign but self-regulate to mitigate the probability that the campaign succeeds. Campaigns thus can occur in equilibrium. The threat from activism is the probability that a firm is targeted, and the stronger the threat the fewer campaigns there are because more firms self-regulate to forestall a campaign. Radical activists target harder firms than do moderate activists, and the more radical the activists the more costly it is to forestall them. Some firms are too hard to be threatened by activism and maximize their profits. Firms that are too hard to target directly may be vulnerable to campaigns threatening their supply and distribution chains. Activists and their donors have an incentive to maximize the scope of activism; that is, the breadth of the threat from activism.","[Baron, David P.] Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Baron, DP (通讯作者)，Stanford Univ, Grad Sch Business, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",dbaron@stanford.edu,,,,,,,31,12,14,0,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1058-6407,1530-9134,,J ECON MANAGE STRAT,J.

Existing mortality models in the literature tend to project future mortality rates by extracting the observed patterns in the mortality surface. Patterns found in the cohort dimension have received a considerable amount of attention and are included in many models of mortality. However, to our knowledge very few studies have considered an evaluation and comparison of cohort patterns across different countries. Moreover, the answer to the question of how the incorporation of the cohort effect affects the forecasting performance of mortality models still remains unclear. In this paper we introduce a new way of incorporating the cohort effect at the beginning of the estimation stage via the implementation of kernel smoothing techniques. Bivariate standard normal kernel density is used and we capture the cohort effect by assigning greater weights along the diagonals of the mortality surface. Based on the results from our empirical study, we compare and discuss the differences in cohort strength across a range of developed countries. Further, the fitting and forecasting results demonstrate the superior performance of our model when compared to some well-known mortality models in the literature under a majority of circumstances.

We discuss different mechanisms behind the bias and propose to eliminate it by exploiting only the variation within countries of origin. In our application (fertility of immigrants in Germany), the cultural effect survives this more demanding specification; however, the estimated coefficient is smaller compared to estimations that rely on cross-country variation for identification.

To ensure economically, socially and environmentally responsible transportation planning, it is necessary to consider future weather variations driven by climate change. Despite growing evidence that considering climatic changes is an imperative for resilient future infrastructure, management agencies rarely incorporate climate change into decision-making processes. One reason is the lack of tangible information and tools to help predict and plan for future conditions. This paper presents the impacts and cost of climate change on the road infrastructure of Mexico. Climate change is projected to require an extra national expenditure on road maintenance that ranges from $1.5 to 5 billion USD by 2050. The Infrastructure Planning Support System (IPSS), a tool developed by the authors, is used to quantify impacts of climate change for this study. The results reinforce the need to incorporate forward-looking planning to reduce vulnerability by increase road infrastructure resilience to the future weather changes and provide quantified information for decision makers to consider.

Shari'a imposes two main punishments for theft; hadd, a fixed penalty of amputation of the offender's right hand under certain conditions and ta'zir, a discretionary punishment, less severe than hadd. From the viewpoint of marginal deterrence and multiplier principles, lesser crimes with low social harm are punished more severely with hadd whereas crimes with high social harm are punished with ta'zir. Moreover, as the probability of detection and sanction is less in those crimes of high social harm, criminals would have more incentive to commit them. Consequently, if Islamic criminal law is to be applied in its current form, crimes of high social cost are likely to become more frequent.","[Gouda, Moamen] Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea",Hankuk University Foreign Studies,"Gouda, M (通讯作者)，Hankuk Univ Foreign Studies, Grad Sch Int & Area Studies, Seoul, South Korea.",moamengouda@yahoo.com,"Gouda, Moamen/AAJ-5300-2021","Gouda, Moamen/0000-0002-6685-7264",Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund,"I would like to thank Jennifer Arlen, Nora El-Bialy, Matthias Dauner, Shubha Ghosh, Joseb Gudiashvili, Jerg Gutmann, Osman B.

Using a forest and energy sector model with a carbon cycle module we show that the renewability and carbon neutrality arguments do not warrant emission free status of wood use. As a general optimality principle, the release of carbon is penalized by a tax and carbon capture is subsidized. However, under the biomass stock change carbon accounting convention, the land owners pay for the roundwood emissions and, to avoid double counting, the use of roundwood is treated as emission free. Yet, the carbon accounting convention followed does not affect the equilibrium outcome. The bioenergy from harvest residues is not emission free either. Furthermore, we show that an optimal policy subsidizes the production of wood products for their carbon sequestration. Correspondingly, carbon removals by biomass growth are subsidized and the harvest residue generation taxed. Numerical solution of the model shows that, although the use of wood is not emission free, it is optimal to increase the use of wood, possibly also in the energy sector. Before the wood use can be increased, the forest biomass will be increased. This carbon sink decreases the net emissions until the forest resources reach a new equilibrium.

Labour regulation in India differ state-wise and apply differently across types of workers (both regular and contract workers). This paper examines the joint effects of Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) and variable enforcement intensity on the growth in a size of temporary contract workers in the organised manufacturing sector. It uses the state level amendments to Industrial Dispute Act of 1947, and the average size of total number of labour inspectors for each state, as independent variables to capture the variation in labour regulations and enforcement intensity across thirty-one Indian states for the period 2000-2007. This paper argues that, average Indian firms located in strict EPL states hire differentially more temporary contract workers as compare to regular workers in response to variable enforcement intensity. Among other findings, the empirical analysis shows that firms prefer to employ excessive number of contract workers to circumvent firing and overall compliance costs of regular workers as stipulated by the Indian labour laws.

This argument competes with a quite different narrative, in which particular configurations of social forces are essential to any serious progress in either of these realms. (See, e.g., Olson, 1993). My tentative hypothesis is that although the modern force of the document is purely rhetorical it is nonetheless real, and derives in significant part from: (1) its arising at least in part from the sort of pressure contemplated by Olson; (2) its having considerable concrete applicability in the short run (so that it can get practice that is recognized as such); (3) its having in some clauses a degree of generality and aspiration (rhetorical appeal), so that citizens can deploy it for realization of broader, not immediately realizable goals; and (4) its being attached to some kind of institutional framework for its realization. These characteristics made possible the gradual (though to be sure uneven) accretion of a reputation, which, coupled with the drama of its origin, account for its modern substance as persuasive rhetoric.

It includes 193 routes where incumbents react to entrants, estimating the operating costs for each carrier using a multiple-source database based on accounting and industrial engineering procedures. The results reveal that, under airport capacity restrictions, incumbents accommodate in costs more when facing low-cost entrants than formerly regulated ones; while the elimination of such restrictions drives incumbents to greater cost retaliation to low-cost entrants than to formerly regulated ones.

The discussion on this problem should be backed with adequate legal research concerning the actual state of regulations and government actions regarding airline investment. The aim of this article is, therefore, to deliver practical information on these limitations worldwide, along with careful annotations. The paper portrays the world-wide scale and extent of the discussed restrictions by presenting regulations on airline ownership and control in 121 states and territories. Normative characteristics of the airline nationality requirements are discussed based on the above material, key rulings and literature. This includes an analysis of legal construction of the limitations, their sources and addressees, relations of the ownership and control tests and the role of discretionary regulatory policy. The study shows that airline investment rules worldwide generally remain restrictive and that the potential for reform is outside the ownership and control-based system rather than within it.

To address this gap, this study examines how food consumption goals affect consumer reading of this information. On the basis of a qualitative study, eight food consumption goals have been identified and classified into four types of motivations which impact reading behaviors: Food Optimization, Food Regulation, Food Gratification, and Food as Mere Necessity. From this typology, we derive eight on-pack nutrition information reading heuristics as well as specific inference biases resulting from these simplifying reading strategies. This research also provides guidelines for policymakers so that nutritional messages given to consumers will be more targeted in order to promote better reading of on-pack nutrition information at the point of sales.","[Chalamon, Isabelle] INSEEC Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Paris, France; [Nabec, Lydiane] Univ Paris 11, RITM Res Unit, Paris, France",Groupe Inseec; Universite Paris Saclay,"Chalamon, I (通讯作者)，INSEEC Business Sch, Dept Mkt, Paris, France.",ichalamon@inseec.com; lydiane.nabec@u-psud.fr,,,French National Institute of Consumption (Institut National de la Consommation),French National Institute of Consumption (Institut National de la Consommation),The authors wish to thank the French National Institute of Consumption (Institut National de la Consommation) and its technical center for their support of this research which was endorsed by the Region Ile de France.,,55,22,22,1,31,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0022-0078,1745-6606,,J CONSUM AFF,J.

These are all formal (rather than tacit) cartels, with start and end dates as determined by the KFTC; furthermore, our analysis does not address the question of frequency of cartel attempts. Nevertheless, we find that the expected fine imposed, normalized by number of firms and cartel duration, seems to be viewed ex ante as a cost of collusion-limiting duration-while foreign company involvement in cartels generally has promoted greater cartel stability (though perhaps less so in recent years). We also find that a larger number of participating firms generally limits cartel stability, though the statistical significance of this finding is not completely robust to specification choices. While not our primary focus, leniency/amnesty programs have generally expected effects on cartel stability.","[Feinberg, Robert M.] Amer Univ, Dept Econ, Washington, DC 20016 USA; [Kim, Hyunchul; Park, Minsoo] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea; [Park, Minsoo] CERK, Seoul, South Korea",American University; Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU),"Kim, H (通讯作者)，Sungkyunkwan Univ, Dept Econ, 25-2 Sungkyunkwan Ro, Seoul 03063, South Korea.",feinber@american.edu; hchkim@skku.edu; minsoopark@skku.edu,,"Feinberg, Robert/0000-0001-8087-3853",,,,,21,3,4,1,16,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0889-938X,1573-7160,,REV IND ORGAN,Rev.

Invitations to tender or to quote are standard procurement methods for government agencies. Against this backdrop, it is important to be aware that the design of auctions and tenders can affect antitrust risks, with further implications on allocative efficiency and revenues. Further, policymakers should keep in mind that an auction may in certain circumstances create a downstream monopoly, potentially resulting in welfare loss and higher prices downstream.

The article discusses the current controversies, highlights central problems of the debate and subsequently offers a comparative analysis of the case studies Kuwait, Venezuela and Angola.

Within this framework, this paper investigates and models the choice to switch from a private car trip to a carsharing service available in peripheral parks as well as the propensity to choose an electric vehicle for such a service. In particular, three issues are addressed: (i) investigating and modelling the propensity to choose carsharing as a transport alternative within a neighbourhood residential carsharing business model; (ii) estimating the effect of also having an EV option available; (iii) measuring the pure preference, if any, in using electric vehicles over traditional ones, in a context excluding factors that may bias such users preference (e.g. purchase price, energy costs, recharging facilities etc). The analyses are based on a stated preferences survey undertaken on 600 car drivers entering the city centre of Salerno (Southern Italy), and on the estimation of a binomial Logit model with serial correlation. Results allow an interpretation of the main determinants of the short-term choice of carsharing services (i.e. without any car-ownership changes), give general behavioural insights, make it possible to quantify the pure preference for EV and the demand elasticity with regard to different pricing strategies of the carsharing services.

The efficiency of logistics networks, in its turn, depends on government services, investments, and policies. Building infrastructure, developing a regulatory regime for transport services, and designing and implementing efficient customs clearance procedures are the areas where governments play an important role. One of the measures for logistics performance at national level is the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) published by the World Bank Group. LPI is composed of six indicators namely customs, infrastructure, service quality, timeliness, international shipments, and tracking and tracing. This study argues that there is a close relationship between global competitiveness and the logistics efficiency of a country and it analyzes the validity of these relations using an artificial neural network (ANN) and cumulative belief degrees (CBD) approach. For this purpose; initially, a screening process is carried out to find the World Economic Forum's competitiveness indicators that may have an impact on each of the LPI indicators. Subsequently, the relationship between the competitiveness indicators and LPI indicators is analyzed using ANN where the LPI indicators are represented by CBDs. As a case study, this methodology is used to analyze Turkey's logistics performance and to develop the basic strategies to be adopted by the government to achieve a targeted LPI level for the country. Among the many factors relating to logistics performance, it was found that fixed broadband Internet availability is the most important target area for improvement related to sustainable logistics policy.

Currently, there is a limited understanding of the ways in which transportation and QOL intersect, and little is known about how metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the United States are addressing QOL outcomes. This study addressed these gaps by developing a conceptual framework holistically linking transportation to QOL. The proposed framework identified four transportation-related QOL dimensions physical, mental, social, and economic well-being which are predominantly influenced by three components of the transportation system: mobility/accessibility, the built environment, and vehicle traffic. This framework then formed the basis for a content analysis of 148 long-range transportation plans in the United States to evaluate the extent to which QOL is being considered in the planning process. The results of the analysis and a follow-up examination of 13 plans revealed that MPOs are inconsistently addressing QOL. Plans primarily targeted QOL enhancement from the perspective of physical well-being, while mental and social well-being were rarely considered. Policy recommendations were provided to more comprehensively integrate QOL into the transportation planning process.

This is done in a framework in which potential injurers can invest in developing greater capability. I show that the uniform reasonable person standard may induce better or worse investment incentives, depending on whether greater capability is represented by reduced precaution costs or reduced accident costs. In so doing, I show that recent results showing that the reasonable person standard creates better investment incentives are not general, but depend on the model of injurer capacity used. I go on to show the availability of over-tailoring of the negligence standard as a novel form of subsidy for investment in care technology. In some circumstances, holding an injurer to a lower standard of care than would be optimal in a perfectly static world can result in a trade-off between dynamic and static efficiency that is superior to that generated by either a uniform or tailored standard of care.","[Korsmo, Charles R.] Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA",University System of Ohio; Case Western Reserve University,"Korsmo, CR (通讯作者)，Case Western Reserve Univ, Sch Law, 11075 East Blvd, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.",crk64@case.edu,,,,,,,26,2,3,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

However, the European Commission guidelines are vague in terms of the factors that influence the granting and scale of leniency-related penalty reductions. In this paper, the empirical analysis of the penalty reductions that have been granted shows, as expected, that the first reporting or cooperating firms receive generous fine reductions. More importantly, there is some evidence that firms can learn how to play the leniency game, either learning how to cheat or how to report, as the reductions that are given to repeat (and multiple) offenders are substantially higher.

Using a sample of 14 second pillar pension funds for the period from June 2008 till March 2016, it was found that the differences in the use of financial derivatives explain the variations of financial performance across the pension funds. The results of the panel data analysis showed that pension funds employing financial derivatives for risk management exhibit a higher performance than the non-users. The research indicated that a 1% increase in the share of financial derivatives in total assets is associated with the increase of roughly 0.4% of the monthly rate of return. The aforementioned results have significant implications for supervisory authorities in designing new policies, for individual investors in selecting their pension fund, and for fund managers.","[Anton, Sorin Gabriel; Firtescu, Bogdan] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Finance Money & Publ Adm Dept, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania; [Toader, Elena] Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Sch Med, Dept Bioeth & Med Eth, Str Univ 16, Iasi 700115, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University; Grigore T Popa University of Medicine & Pharmacy,"Toader, E (通讯作者)，Grigore T Popa Univ Med & Pharm Iasi, Sch Med, Dept Bioeth & Med Eth, Str Univ 16, Iasi 700115, Romania.",sorin.anton@uaic.ro; toader.elena@yahoo.com; firtescu@uaic.ro,"Anton, Sorin/P-5613-2014; Toader, Elena G/M-5125-2017; Firtescu, Bogdan Narcis/U-5725-2017","Anton, Sorin/0000-0001-7124-9274; Firtescu, Bogdan Narcis/0000-0002-2292-8120",,,,,32,2,2,0,14,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

Kuznets Curve says that as per capita income increases, income inequality also increases at first and then starts declining after a turning point. In the 1990s, Kuznets Curve hypothesis is started to apply the relationship between environmental quality and per capita income. According to this hypothesis which is called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), firstly as per capita income increases, environmental degradation also increase and then starts declining after a turning point. Generally, the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption and environmental degradation has been investigated for testing EKC hypothesis. However, some sectors stimulate economic activity. Tourism sector is one of the most important sectors which not only contribute to an economy, but also other sectors. Tourism development has increased energy demand and urbanization. These activities cause environmental pollution. As a result, the relationship between tourism and environmental pollution is significant for policymakers and researchers. In this study, it is examined the relationship between per capita CO2 emissions, real per capita GDP, per capita energy consumption, trade openness rate and the number of international tourists who visit BRICTS countries over the period from 1995 to 2011 in order to test connection between tourism and carbon emissions using the EKC framework. Pedroni (2009) cointegration test is used to determine the relationship. The results reveal that there is a cointegration relationship with between CO2 emissions and independent variables. Tourist arrivals and economic growth have a negatively effects on CO2 emissions. In contrast, trade openness decreases the emissions in BRICTS countries.","[Bozkurt, Cuma; Okumus, Ilyas] Gaziantep Univ, Gaziantep, Turkey; [Akan, Yusuf] Ataturk Univ, Erzurum, Turkey",Gaziantep University; Ataturk University,"Bozkurt, C (通讯作者)，Gaziantep Univ, Gaziantep, Turkey.",cbozkurt@gantep.edu.tr; yusufakan@atauni.edu.tr; iokumus@gantep.edu.tr,"BOZKURT, Cuma/AAG-4879-2020; Okumus, Ilyas/R-6128-2019; Okumus, Ilyas/AAA-4736-2022","BOZKURT, Cuma/0000-0002-4303-2147; Okumus, Ilyas/0000-0003-2225-4215",,,,,25,7,7,0,7,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,59,65,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700007,0

The studies of the theory of Complexity are the bases of the reflections on the management activities, enabling articulation toward the self-organization of the group. It is observed by many researchers that the action of the manager usually encompasses the role of a planner of the work, with rational use of the resources and articulation of the means to reach the targets of the institution, in addition to the role of coordination and control of people's work. That has shown not to be enough to meet the challenges of the world nowadays. The processes of management may get different meanings: under a more technical view where management is often centralized, decisions come from the top without participation of the other levels; under a more democratic conception, the process is more participative, and decision is collective. In this view, the manager is expected to promote collective work, encourage the participation of the different subjects of the team and institution community, establish co-responsibility and assure the construction and implementation of a proposal - a set of intentions - a collective agreement. To be able to do so, the manager should be prepared to perceive the team as a living system, able of self-organization, as well as the linear and systemic aspects in permanent balance.","[Di Grado Hessel, Ana Maria; Arantes Fazenda, Ivani Catarina] Pontifical Catholic Univ Paulo, Dept Educ Curriculum Interdisciplinar, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo Jose] Pontifical Catholic Univ Sao Paulo, Dept Econ & Business Adm, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil",Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo,"Hessel, AMD (通讯作者)，Pontifical Catholic Univ Paulo, Dept Educ Curriculum Interdisciplinar, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.",digrado@uol.com.br; jfazenda@uol.com.br; arnoldodehoyos@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,20,0,0,0,1,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,1500,1505,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400252,0

In the last 25 years (following the period of Communism) Kosice has passed through several waves of transformation involving economic, social and urban changes. Kosice was awarded the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) in 2013. The winning project was based on the city transformation through culture and support of the creative economy (startup and spin-off firms). Big cultural events have not only cultural and social benefits, but also an indisputable economic impact on the hosting city. These events represent an opportunity to not only attract visitors from outside the region but also for them to spend money on accommodation, food, transport etc. Visitors' expenditure presents additional income for the local economy and stimulates a considerable amount of economic activity and growth. The assessment of the economic impact of events has become popular of late and combines the economic approach with spatial marketing and tourism studies. A coherent methodology has also been developed to evaluate the economic impact of events in the geographical area. This paper aims to estimate the local economic impact of the biggest cultural event organised in Kosice, the White Night festival, a spin-off of the Kosice European Capital of Culture 2013. This impact empirical study was done in three stages. Firstly, the measurement of attendees using appropriate methods for ungated events. Secondly, the estimation of the visitors' impact related to private spending generated by the event's visitors and thirdly, through estimating the overall economic impact by calculating the multiplying effects on the local economy (induced impacts). The study was based on research conducted during 2012 and 2013 in Kosice. The result shows the attendance hyperbole and impact of visitor spending that was due to the festival in the local economy.","[Dzupka, Peter; Sebova, Miriam] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Dzupka, P (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Reg Sci & Management, Kosice, Slovakia.",Peter.Dzupka@tuke.sk; Miriam.Sebova@tuke.sk,"Dzupka, Peter/AAD-7166-2019; Dzupka, Peter/AAE-3199-2020; Šebová, Miriam/AAE-3080-2020","Šebová, Miriam/0000-0002-5157-5299; Dzupka, Peter/0000-0001-8947-6555",project VEGA [1/0548/14],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This paper was created within the project VEGA 1/0548/14 Analysis of differences in innovation performance of spin-off and start-up firms in Slovakia,,37,5,5,2,43,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The results indicate that the four antecedents affect customer loyalty, and customer satisfaction acts as a mediator in all three service industries. However, the strength of the relationship between the constructs varies markedly across the industries, implying that competitive environment importantly determines the elements of service offering that lead to satisfaction and loyalty in a particular industry.

Assuming that the responsible banking strategies are different in the Romanian banks compared to the international banking groups to which they belong, the paper highlights the main trends of the Romanian banking system by identifying both the similarity and the contradictions in the analyzed CSR policies. The methodologically approach is based on the appropriate use of the case study, outlining the most important aspects that differentiates the domestic banking environment and the international one, in order to validate the research hypothesis. It will be considered a rigorous selection of the research variables, depending on the theoretical CSR approach, the CSR e-communication results or other relevant criteria.

The results show that the housing price index is the most significant variable, followed by base lending rate, unemployment and gross domestic product. House pricing index and gross domestic product show positive relationships with household debt, which indicates that the rise of household debt is determined by the rise of these explanatory variables.

While impact products are also available for institutional investors, regulations governing fiduciary responsibility prohibit institutional investors from making certain impact investments. Furthermore, the regulatory environment makes it difficult and costly to structure impact products for retail investors, and consequently, there are relatively few retail products available. Impact investment products are offered across a wide spectrum of asset classes, and offer a range of risk and return profiles. Impact investments should affect the product portfolio of each included participant in every important sector. For this reason it is more than important to focus our view on description of product variety in the alternative investing possibilities.

A set of factors determining competitiveness of tourism is introduced, that is, capacity of tourist accommodation establishments, arrivals at tourist accommodation establishments, average expenditure of tourism trips (1 night or over) - domestic trips, average expenditure of tourism trips (1 night or over) - outbound trips, tourism domestic trips (1 night or over), tourism outbound trips (1 night or over) and their impact on levels of competitiveness is determined. Considerable geographical variation of availability of accommodation establishments in the European Union member states and high, statistically significance correlations between availability of accommodation establishments and numbers of tourists arriving in a given states and between competitiveness of the EU states and tourism expenditure are identified.","[Marakova, Vanda] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia; [Dyr, Tadeusz; Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna] Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Radom, Poland",Matej Bel University; Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Maráková, V (通讯作者)，Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystrica, Fac Econ, Dept Tourism & Hospitality, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia.",vanda.marakova@umb.sk; t.dyr@uthrad.pl; awt@uthrad.pl,"Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/AAK-6383-2021; Marakova, Vanda/AAX-9759-2021","Wolak-Tuzimek, Anna/0000-0002-2998-909X; Marakova, Vanda/0000-0002-1148-8393",,,,,31,40,42,5,20,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

To redress this imbalance a conceptual framework was developed to test the relationship between these variables. Our methodological approach utilized quantitative method and a cross-sectional study. We employed a structural equation model (SEM) to test our conceptual model using questionnaire data from a large technical university from Romania. As expected, we found that the relationship between transformational leadership and student performance is mediating by effect of teaching and learning processes. The results highlight that transformational leadership was positively related to teaching and learning processes, and that this variable was positively related to student performance.

The knowledge they offer needs to correspond to both economic (preparing students for the labour market) and social (solving various social problems) development of their communities. Although universities have three mission, the third one, also known as civil mission, is very often neglected by many of them. For far too long universities believed that, since they are public institutions, they do not have to put more effort in building a stronger cooperation with their community and developing a stronger sense of social responsibility among their students. However, in order to become socially aware and responsible students need guidance and there is no better guidance than by setting an example. Universities that support sustainable economic and social development of their community prove to their environment that they too are entrepreneurial, proactive and more socially responsible. This paper gives an overview of the university social responsibility model (USR model) analysing two of the four core components of the model: social and educational impact. These two components are an essential part of entrepreneurial university that manifests social responsibility through its autonomy and its entrepreneurial culture. The USR model, presented in this paper, points out to the responsibility of universities to anticipate and recognize the needs of society. Universities must become a platform for exchange of ideas, experiences, resources and information and thus help young people to become active participants in creating positive social change. By applying the USR model on the example of J.J. Strossmayer University of Osijek, Croatia, this paper provides an overview of what J.J.

The first and foremost threat to future adequacy and overall sustainability of pension systems is population ageing. On the second place the experts from the Baltic States put the problem of labour market globalisation, leading to emigration of working-age population and further worsening of dependency ratio. The third place in this rating is taken in the Baltics by shadow economy with a significant amount of persons' earnings not covered by social insurance. With the growing importance of the funded pillars, the sustainability of future pensions can be undermined also by poor performance of private pension funds, not able to generate sufficient levels of profitability. All the experts have also agreed that the sustainability may be threatened by disadvantageous labour market patterns: unemployment, part-time employment, spread of freelance and self-employment not properly secured by social insurance schemes.

Other variables (slogan language, brand consuming frequency and sympathy towards the brand) did not show a significant impact on the recall/recognition of slogans.

During after-crisis period transition to sustainable economic model has happened, where exports and manufacturing were the key drivers of growth. It shall be mentioned that debate on the necessity of industrial policy was initiated comparatively late after the independence, i.e., in 2008/2009, when the first analytical studies concerning necessity of the concept of industrial policy in Latvia were conducted, thus defining the role and activities of the State in fostering economic development. Similarly, to development of Latvia's economy it is possible to look on development of industrial policy thinking, because it has gone through several changes in its fundamentals during last century including rapid changes in the set of necessary actions for successful industrial policy. Most recent trend within economic policy of the EU, is usage of so called smart specialization concept. The idea of smart specialisation has two sides. Firstly, it is important to focus on certain domains in order to realise the potential for scale, scope and spillovers in knowledge production and secondly, it is important to focus on certain domains in order to develop distinctive and original areas of specialisation for the future. This paper discusses the development of industrial policy and economy of Latvia, discusses the smart specialization concept, and analyses the possibility of applying this concept within industrial policy of Latvia.","[Soms, Kristaps] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Soms, K (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",kristaps.soms@gmail.com,,,,,,,33,0,0,0,5,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,703,712,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200061,0

Creative industries sector, distinguished by its active performance in the area of innovation, is a leader in creating innovative business models and new consumer-involvement strategies. Creative industry enterprises face more complex market conditions and usually take place in very small firms, which are based on continuous networking and diverse managerial practices and models. The market of creative industries' goods is constantly changing and is unpredictable, therefore managerial practices are being constantly developed. The enterprises of creative industries need more creativity than traditional businesses, as they need to meet the requirements in order to create an original product, whose nature must be different from previously produced products. The article analyses various business process improvement methods such as LEAN (PDCA), Theory of Constraints (TOC), Six Sigma (DMADV and DMAIC). The strengths and weaknesses of these methods are identified to improve the creative industries enterprises development.

Managers know quite well which areas their companies should focus on in order to achieve greater competitiveness. Yet deficiencies in systems thinking often prevent the company from truly differentiating itself from the competition. Implementing a systems approach is also a key to success in the area of performance measurement and management. A performance management system's requirements arc altered by constant change in business conditions - e.g., changes in the competition, technical and technological development, the values held in the working world or society, or even the attitude towards the environment, which is marked by pressure for a decrease in resource demand. The changes in these requirements are seen primarily in management's conception and methods, the acquisition of information, and managers' professional qualifications. Because of the topicality and importance of this subject, this paper is concerned with proposing a systematic process for performance management that incorporates not only a performance measurement and management system but also the factors influencing its quality and a set of tools whose implementation would support the constant improvement of the system as a whole. Subsequently, the possibility of implementing a systematic process of performance management that has been designed in this manner is examined for Czech businesses. A deeper analysis is conducted using case studies in the form of semi-structured interviews at three selected companies.","[Striteska, Michaela; Jelinkova, Lucie] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic",University of Pardubice,"Striteska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Pardubice, Czech Republic.",michaela.striteska@upce.cz; ljelinkoval@seznam.cz,"Lendelova, Lucie/IAQ-9945-2023",,[SGS_2016_023],,This article was created with the support of SGS_2016_023 project - Economic and social development in private and public sector.,,50,0,0,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,2342,2356,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700236,0

The conventional measure of military spending has been augmented by a comprehensive index-The Global Militarization Index. We observed cointegration among military expenditure, interest rate, trade openness, growth in GDP and stock market capitalization. Hence, the long run relationship among the variables has been verified. A negative and significant association has been established between military spending and stock market capitalization. The study concludes that military expenditure is a vital determinant of stock market capitalization in Pakistan.

The paper proposed a R120/tCO(2)-equiv. levy on coal, gas and petroleum fuels. Here, we model the possible impacts of such a tax on the South African economy using the computable general equilibrium (CGE) 53-sector model of the University of Pretoria's Department of Economics. The model shows that the carbon tax has the capacity to decrease South Africa's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by between 1 900MtCO(2)-equiv. and 2 300MtCO(2)-equiv. between 2016 and 2035. The extent of emissions reductions is most sensitive to the rate at which tax exemptions are removed. Recycling of carbon tax revenue reduces the extent of emissions reductions due to the fact that economic growth is supported. The manner in which carbon tax revenue is recycled back into the economy is therefore important in terms of the extent of emissions reductions achieved, but not as significant as the influence of different exemption schedules. The model shows the carbon tax to have a net negative impact on South Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) relative to the baseline under all exemption regimes and all revenue recycling options assessed. The negative impact of the carbon tax on GDP is, however, greatly reduced by the manner in which the tax revenue is recycled. Recycling in the form of a production subsidy for all industries results in the lowest negative impact on GDP.","[van Heerden, Jan; Blignaut, James; Bohlmann, Heinrich] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James] South African Environm Observat Network, Pretoria, South Africa; [Cartwright, Anton] Univ Cape Town, African Ctr Cities, Rondebosch, South Africa; [Diederichs, Nicci; Mander, Myles] Futureworks Consulting, Delhi, India",University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON); University of Cape Town,"van Heerden, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",Jan.vanheerden@up.ac.za,"van Heerden, Jan H/C-3298-2019; Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017","Cartwright, Anton/0000-0002-2033-9162; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010; Bohlmann, Heinrich/0000-0002-1509-0243",World Bank's Partnership for Market Readiness on Climate Change Mitigation programme,World Bank's Partnership for Market Readiness on Climate Change Mitigation programme,"The authors acknowledge with thanks the guidance, support and inputs given by Dr Mike Toman and Dr Govinda Timilsina of the World Bank.

Using data from three recent playing seasons, the estimated spectator demand relationship revealed important roles for recent team performance, fixture quality, seasonal and match outcome uncertainty, and a selection of opportunity (and other) cost measures. The estimates confirm the importance of fixture quality for spectator attendance and also reveal evidence of a short-run competitive imbalance within the domestic game. The analysis suggests that modest enhancements to attendance may be achieved through increasing fixture quality and reducing such imbalance. These enhancements are more likely to be secured through reducing rather than increasing the current number of teams in the league's top tier.","[Reilly, Barry] Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England",University of Sussex,"Reilly, B (通讯作者)，Univ Sussex, Brighton BN1 9RH, E Sussex, England.",b.m.reilly@sussex.ac.uk,"Reilly, Barry/AAN-8101-2021","Reilly, Barry/0000-0003-0606-4585",,,,,30,17,17,0,12,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

It shows how public sector activities can inadvertently restrict and crowd out private sector activities, and demonstrates the importance of reducing unnecessarily high transactions costs to facilitate private sector success in biodiversity conservation. It also develops a new argument related to status reversal to explain resistance to institutional change. It illustrates how private sector conservation initiatives may complement, and sometimes even substitute for, conservation activities by the public sector, thus allowing the public sector to focus its attention and resources on other purposes.","[Grolleau, Gilles] SupAgro, Montpellier 1, France; [Grolleau, Gilles] LAMETA, UMR 1135, Montpellier 1, France; [Peterson, Deborah] Victorian Dept Primary Ind, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Institut Agro; Montpellier SupAgro; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Montpellier; Victorian Department of Environment & Primary Industries,"Grolleau, G (通讯作者)，SupAgro, Montpellier 1, France.",grolleau@supagro.inra.fr; deborahcpeterson@gmail.com,,,"French research program GESSOL - Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement durable, des Transports et du Logement; Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie","French research program GESSOL - Ministere de l'Ecologie, du Developpement durable, des Transports et du Logement; Agence de l'Environnement et de la Maitrise de l'Energie","We are grateful for the helpful comments of Douadia Bougherara, Neil Byron, Christophe Depres, Laura McCann and Naoufel Mzoughi, and for research support from Julien Leyre and Amanda Ellery.

Licenses awarded by auctions are tied to post-award network deployment obligations. Using data on 18 countries for the period 2000-2007, this study is the first to empirically forecast aftermarket performance by analysing whether these conditions are met in a timely fashion. The forecasts are conditioned on macroeconomic. and market conditions, and package attributes. The models are evaluated based on Mayer and Wu's (in press) maximum score tests. Traditional probit models are not robust to error misspecifications. However, Manski's (1975, 1985) maximum score estimator only imposes median independence, and allows arbitrary heteroskedasticity. One obstacle to empirical implementation is the fact that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator cannot be used for hypothesis testing. Mayer and Wu address the problem using a 'discretisation' procedure. The tests do not impose additional assumptions on the data generating process, require a shorter computational time than subsampling, and allow the models to be misspecified. The test statistics reflect differences in forecasting accuracy under the null and alternative hypotheses. (C) 2013 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

An important consideration for reducing fuel consumption and improving trucking operations is efficient vehicle routing. Many existing fleet management and routing systems are based on minimizing distance traveled which does not necessarily minimize fuel consumption or emissions, particularly when under traffic congestion and in areas with hilly terrain. This paper describes the development of an eco-routing and navigation system for heavy-duty trucks, including an underlying truck energy and emission model that accounts for vehicle weight, real-time traffic speed, and road grade. Validation results presented in this paper show that the eco-routing system was able to predict fuel consumption within 7.5% over the test routes. In addition, this paper presents an analysis of the tradeoff between the amount of fuel savings and the added travel time relative to the fastest route. The elasticity of fuel with respect to travel time is calculated and a sensitivity analysis with respect to fuel price and the value of travel time is performed which provides the break even conditions between a fuel optimized and a time optimized route.

With the possibility of extremely negative cash inflows, firms may need to curtail operations significantly. Traditional Net Present Value analysis does not allow for efficient management of these problems. In addition, firm managers may behave irrationally by accepting negative Net Present Value projects in the short term. This paper presents a Monte Carlo simulation based model to provide policy insights on how to incorporate extreme cash flows and manager irrationality scenarios into the capital budgeting process. This paper presents evidence that firms with irrational managers and experiencing extremely negative cash flows may, under certain conditions, reap long term rewards associated with the acceptance of negative Net Present Value projects in the short term. These benefits are largest if cost ratios (discount rates) are small, or investment horizons are high. We argue that acceptance of short term negative Net Present Value projects implies the purchase of a long term real option which can generate positive long term cash flows under certain conditions.","[Zhang, Wenqing] Univ Minnesota, Labovitz Sch Business & Econ, Duluth, MN 55812 USA; [Padmanabhan, Prasad] St Marys Univ, Greehey Sch Business, San Antonio, TX USA; [Huang, Chia-Hsing] SolBridge Int Sch Business, Taejon, South Korea",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Duluth,"Huang, CH (通讯作者)，SolBridge Int Sch Business, 128 Uam Ro, Taejon, South Korea.",wqzhang@d.umn.edu; ppadmanabhan1@stmarytx.edu; koreasing@solbridge.ac.kr,"Zhang, Wenqing/D-3581-2016; Zhang, Wenqing/F-5168-2013","Zhang, Wenqing/0000-0002-0170-0805;",,,,,39,4,5,0,20,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Drawing on social capital theory, this study explores how two types of network position (centrality and structural holes) and cross-border collaborative ties affect the cross-border R&D collaborative alliance of the biotechnology firms and how these effects are contingent on exploratory collaboration with their collaboration partners. Analysis of the data collected from 174 cross-border collaboration partners in the emerging biotechnology sector indicates that the two types of network position differ in the extent to which they contribute to the cross-border R&D collaborative alliance. By investigating the contingent role of exploratory collaboration, we find that exploratory collaboration weakens the impact of network centrality on the cross-border R&D collaborative alliance but strengthens the effect of structural holes on the establishment of cross-border R&D collaborative alliance. Results confirm that biotechnology firms' cross-border R&D knowledge resources need to extend beyond their industry and regional boundaries. More specifically, this study contributes to the debate on whether network centrality and structural holes are complementary and thus enrich contextual cross-border alliance literature.","[Tsai, Hsien-Tang; Huang, Shi-Zheng] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan; [Huang, Shi-Zheng] Lanzhou Univ, Inst Management Sci, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chun-Hsien] Natl Chiayi Univ, Dept BioBusiness Management, Coll Management, 580 Sinmin Rd, Chiayi 600, Taiwan",National Sun Yat Sen University; Lanzhou University; National Chiayi University,"Tsai, HT (通讯作者)，Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Business Management, 70 Lien Hai Rd, Kaohsiung 804, Taiwan.",htt@mail.nsysu.edu.tw,"Huang, Shi-Zheng/AGV-3295-2022","Huang, Shi-Zheng/0000-0001-5235-4773",,,,,78,4,4,1,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

Cities hosting financial activities have been severely hit during the crisis; however, they also host hard and soft territorial capital elements-high physical accessibility, access to information and knowledge, advanced functions, agglomeration economies-generating inter-sectoral productivity growth and the ability to adjust to the crisis. A scenario approach is used to capture the long term costs of the crisis, applying a new version of a macroeconometric regional growth forecasting model (MASST), recently updated to take account of the crisis. Results show that cities play a role in the resilience of regions; the quality of production factors hosted, the density of external linkages and cooperation networks and the quality of urban infrastructure give greater economic resilience to cities, and to the regions hosting them.","[Capello, Roberta; Caragliuy, Andrea; Fratesi, Ugo] Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Caragliu, A (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",andrea.caragliu@polimi.it,"Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020; Fratesi, Ugo/IAM-5881-2023","Fratesi, Ugo/0000-0002-0755-460X; Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900",,,,,45,165,171,18,119,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

From a merger policy perspective, this paper's main contribution is twofold. First, it shows that when firms are allowed to price discriminate, the (unique) equilibrium merger gives rise to significant increases in profits for the merging firms (the ones with information to price discriminate), but has no ex-post effect on the outsider firm's profitability, thereby eliminating the so-called (static) free-riding problem. Second, this equilibrium merger is shown to increase industry profits at the expense of consumers' surplus, leaving total welfare unaffected. This then suggests that competition authorities should scrutinize with greater zeal mergers in industries where firms are expected to engage in BBPD.","[Esteves, Rosa-Branca] Univ Minho, Dept Econ, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Helder] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Vasconcelos, Helder] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, CEPR, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Minho; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Esteves, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Minho, Dept Econ, Campus Gualtar, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal.",rbranca@eeg.uminho.pt; hvasconcelos@fep.up.pt,"Esteves, Rosa-Branca/B-5332-2009; Vasconcelos, Helder F/B-5966-2009","Esteves, Rosa-Branca/0000-0001-5063-697X; Vasconcelos, Helder/0000-0002-2584-4352",FEDER funds through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology [PTDC/EGE-ECO/108784/2008]; Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia [PTDC/EGE-ECO/108784/2008] Funding Source: FCT,FEDER funds through the Operational Program for Competitiveness Factors-COMPETE; FCT-Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)); Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),"We are grateful to the Editor, Daniel Spulber, to an anonymous coeditor and to four anonymous referees for their thorough and thoughtful reports.

In this paper, we evaluate the impact of setting up urban tolls on several inequalities indicators. We simulate a cordon pricing with different levels of prices and evaluate its impacts on inequalities using both income and accessibility indices. We adopt a comparison-based approach to reduce the bias resulting from the spatial division. In agreement with the literature, we show that introducing a toll increases inequalities. The greatest increases in inequality are located in both the most central zones (within the boundary), the inner or the outer ring where the timesavings do not offset the increase in travel cost. For spatial inequalities, although we observe an improvement of accessibility, particularly for central zones, the first ring (adjacent to the toll zone) is the most adversely affected by the toll.

We describe the model components, the data generation processes, the maximum likelihood estimation techniques, and the generation of forecasting distributions and point forecasts by resampling techniques. The model is applied to a low frequency weekly time series of skimmed whey powder (SWP). Competing submodels are compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC).

However, few studies have examined the potential impact of P3s on large-scale transportation networks. These studies have focused on modeling rather than on policy analysis. The literature thus does not offer guidance for designing and administering P3s to improve transportation system performance while maintaining profitability. Using Fresno, California's transportation network as a laboratory, we consider the effects of alternative P3 tolling approaches on profit maximization and system performance optimization at full urban transportation network scale. Based on system modeling results, we offer the following recommendations for policy makers to design and promote successful P3s in urban settings: (i) to promote a profitable and a socially beneficial system, toll rates should be set examining both profit-maximizing and system-optimal rates; (ii) even though tolls (i.e., higher travel costs) on a few roads help reduce travel demand they may, counter-intuitively, lead to higher total travel cost for the overall transportation system because of users' decision to travel longer distances to avoid tolls, especially when high toll rates are applied; (iii) lower limit(s) on tolls (in addition to upper limits) may be required to enforce system-optimal tolling and avoid undercutting by private owners; (iv) a variable tolling approach (i.e., temporally- and spatially-varying tolls) significantly reduces congestion and increases profits relative to flat tolls; and (v) public officials should provide a comprehensive plan regarding past, current, and future P3 projects along with a detailed system-wide impact analysis to promote a more sustainable transportation system.

By use of a case study of industrial development in an organizationally thin and rather peripheral region in Norway the article contends that thin regions often need external investments to avoid being trapped in path extension.","[Isaksen, Arne] Univ Agder, Dept Work Life & Innovat, N-4879 Grimstad, Norway",University of Agder,"Isaksen, A (通讯作者)，Univ Agder, POB 422, N-4604 Kristiansand, Norway.",arne.isaksen@uia.no,,,"Research Council of Norway [209769, 207572]",Research Council of Norway(Research Council of Norway),"The Research Council of Norway (Project numbers 209769, 207572).",,39,195,210,12,166,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

This finding is based on the analysis of 64 roll call votes at the federal and state levels between 1995 and 2014. It holds when controlling for legislators' ideology and is particularly strong for term-limited lawyer-legislators. The empirical regularity is consistent with the hypothesis that lawyer-legislators, at least in part, pursue their private interests when voting on tort issues.

Employing a simultaneous equations model and data from 353 U.S. franchise chains in 43 sectors in 2005, we find robust evidence for significant spatial competition and stable interdependence in these two strategic variables. Specifically, we find spatial competition in each strategic variable, and spatial interdependence between the two strategic variables. Each strategic variable and its spatial lag are strategic complements in spatial competition due to the market share effect, while the two strategic variables are strategic substitutes in spatial interdependence due to the market power effect, and the former effect is stronger than the latter effect. Besides, we also find that franchisors are strongly inclined to a combination of a low royalty rate and a high franchise proportion, which evolves and stabilizes in the long-run equilibrium. These findings provide a consistent framework with which to explain many stylized facts in franchising, such as the time-invariance of a uniform royalty rate, the stability of a mixed organizational structure, and the coexistence of head-on competition and diversification of chains of different sizes.","[Chen, Shaoling] Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Coll Econ, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Wang, Susheng] Hong Kong Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Econ, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Haisheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Lingnan Univ Coll, China Inst Econ Transformat & Opening, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",University of Jinan; Hong Kong University of Science & Technology; Sun Yat Sen University,"Chen, SL (通讯作者)，Jinan Univ, Inst Finance, Coll Econ, Jinan, Peoples R China.",crystal.csl@gmail.com; s.wang@ust.hk; yhaish@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,,Guangdong Province Soft Science Research Project [2012B070300029]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [12wkpy63]; Research Innovation Funds for Applied Economics of Jinan University [2013005]; Hong Kong Research Grants Council [RGC C5744],Guangdong Province Soft Science Research Project; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities); Research Innovation Funds for Applied Economics of Jinan University; Hong Kong Research Grants Council(Hong Kong Research Grants Council),"Funding from the Guangdong Province Soft Science Research Project (2012B070300029), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (12wkpy63), the Research Innovation Funds for Applied Economics of Jinan University (2013005), and the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (RGC C5744) are acknowledged.",,44,2,2,1,50,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0013-0095,1944-8287,,ECON GEOGR,Econ.

Case studies analysis is followed by netnographic research of 22 different discussions (1243 records) in online forums related to selected service suppliers. The research findings suggest that value co-creation approach can be effectively used to analyse processes in global online travel service section. The originality of the paper lies in exploring the contribution of co-creation approach which allowed to identify the patterns of actions and behaviour of the online travel service providers and their consumers. As an additional value of the research, it was found that the online travel service providers integrate customer-to-customer interactions as a value co-creation in their platforms using consumers' resources such as time, knowledge and experience.","[Smaliukiene, Rasa; Sizovaite, Indre] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Chi-Shiun, Lai] Natl Yunlin Univ Sci & Technol, Touliu 64002, Yunlin, Taiwan",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University; National Yunlin University Science & Technology,"Smaliukiene, R (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",rasa.smaliukiene@vgtu.lt; laics@yuntech.edu.tw; indre.sizovaite@vgtu.lt,"Smaliukiene, Rasa/L-3577-2019","Smaliukiene, Rasa/0000-0002-5240-2429",,,,,28,34,37,6,140,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

This article reports an event-study analysis of stock prices to determine the impact on U.S. consumers of the Durbin Amendment. Did consumers gain more from cost savings passed on by merchants, in the form of lower prices and better services, than they lost from cost increases passed on by banks, in the form of higher prices or less service? We find that consumers lost more on the bank side than they gained on the merchant side. Our estimate is that, based on the expectations of investors, the present discounted value of losses for consumers as a result of the implementation of the Durbin Amendment is between $22 billion and $25 billion.","[Evans, David S.; Chang, Howard; Joyce, Steven] Global Econ Grp, New York, NY USA; [Evans, David S.] Univ Chicago, Law Sch, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Evans, David S.] Jevons Inst Competit Law & Econ, London, England",University of Chicago,"Evans, DS (通讯作者)，UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England.",devans@globaleconomicsgroup.com; hchang@globaleconomicsgroup.com; sjoyce@globaleconomicsgroup.com,,,,,,,54,4,5,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

Priest in 1971, equity-based decisions issued by state supreme courts led to a decrease in cross-district inequality in per pupil expenditures. In subsequent years, more state supreme courts overturned existing systems of public school finance for failing to provide adequate education to students living in poor school districts. Adequacy-based decisions have not produced measurable changes in cross-district inequality in expenditures, but have led to higher overall levels of funding for public education. The nationwide increase in per pupil expenditures over the past several decades is, however, largely the product of growth in personal incomes and a decline in the relative size of the cohort of school-age children, and not of court-ordered finance reforms. In California, after Serrano and the most far-reaching equalization reforms implemented anywhere in the country, the association between the wealth of a school district and educational quality remains strong and persistent. If one's concern is the quality of education that students receive and not the amount of money spent on them, the victories that reformers have won in the courts have been hollow victories.","[Hill, Sarah A.] Calif State Univ Fullerton, Fullerton, CA 92634 USA; [Kiewiet, D.

In this paper, we account for this shift by showing how a novel epidemiological style of thought emerged in the closing decades of the twentieth century. As is well known, the compilation and tabulation of vital statistics - death-rates, birth-rates, morbidity rates - contributed to the birth of the 'population' in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The population is reformatted from the middle of the twentieth century by 'modified life tables' made up of disability weightings, health state valuations, quality of life scores, disease burden estimates, etc. The problem of morbid death gives way to that of morbid living, made calculable through a metrics of 'severity', 'disability' and 'impairment'. A series of new indices and scales (e.g. the QALY and DALY) has contributed to a governmentalization of living, in the course of which the social and personal consequences of living with disease come to be an object of political concern, and made knowable, calculable and thereby amenable to various strategies of intervention. We conclude by showing how this style of epidemiological thought has generated a new global visibility for brain disorders as their impact on individuals, health care systems and nations are calculated in novel ways.","[Wahlberg, Ayo] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Anthropol, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Rose, Nikolas] Kings Coll London, Dept Social Sci Hlth & Med, London WC2R 2LS, England",University of Copenhagen; University of London; King's College London,"Wahlberg, A (通讯作者)，Univ Copenhagen, Dept Anthropol, Oster Farimagsgade 5, DK-1353 Copenhagen, Denmark.",ayo.wahlberg@anthro.ku.dk; nikolas.rose@kcl.ac.uk,"Rose, Nikolas/A-4229-2013","Rose, Nikolas/0000-0003-4007-5077; Wahlberg, Ayo/0000-0001-6862-5208",Danish Council for Independent Research [10-094343]; ESRC [ES/L003074/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Danish Council for Independent Research(Det Frie Forskningsrad (DFF)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),A grant to Ayo Wahlberg from the Danish Council for Independent Research [grant number 10-094343] made research for this paper possible.,,69,65,71,0,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0308-5147,1469-5766,,ECON SOC,Econ.

R&D decentralization might affect the chance of generating breakthrough inventions in two distinct ways. On the one hand, firms might just search in parallel along diverse technological paths, which augments the probability that at least some trajectories will lead to extremely valuable inventions. On the other hand, firms pursuing diverse paths might also exchange knowledge with each other, for instance through inventors' mobility, and such recombination possibly leads to a higher likelihood of producing breakthroughs. By assessing (a) the impact of R&D decentralization on the share of breakthrough inventions and (b) how this impact changes according to the rate of inventors' mobility in regions, this paper aims at understanding which mechanism, if any, actually operates.","UCP Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Conti, R (通讯作者)，UCP Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, P-1649023 Lisbon, Portugal.",raffaele.conti@ucp.pt,,"Conti, Raffaele/0000-0002-5314-1451",,,,,62,0,0,0,29,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

There is 36 percent of untapped potential to strengthen the cohesion of the community, and the development of Lithuanian rural social infrastructure should be of aspirational high degree of rural sustainability of community assurance.","[Atkociuniene, Vilma; Vaznoniene, Gintare; Pakeltiene, Rasa] Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, LT-53361 Akad, Kaunas District, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Atkociuniene, V (通讯作者)，Aleksandras Stulginskis Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Univ Str 10, LT-53361 Akad, Kaunas District, Lithuania.",vilma.atkociuniene@asu.lt; gintare.vaznoniene@asu.lt; rasa.pakeltiene@asu.lt,"Atkočiūnienė, Vilma/AGE-2435-2022; Pakeltiene, Rasa/T-8179-2018","Pakeltiene, Rasa/0000-0002-4135-728X; Vaznoniene, Gintare/0000-0001-9583-112X",Science Council of Lithuania [MIP-004/2013],Science Council of Lithuania(Research Council of Lithuania (LMTLT)),"The study was financed by Science Council of Lithuania, agreement No MIP-004/2013.",,31,6,7,0,21,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

The excessive smoothness in economic growth is, therefore, prevalent in all simulations, and the underlying technologies can only determine the speed of growth and network formation.

We argue that if this strategy is effective and beneficial, then an emerging market parent firm would seek for higher ownership and control in its later domestic acquisitions. Such benefits would be higher if there are richer knowledge resources in a DM subsidiary or in a DM local network. Such benefits would also increase over time because of the accumulation of new knowledge back home. Using a sample of 1,303 complete domestic acquisitions made by 713 Turkish firms over the period of 1987-2013, including 196 deals involving a springboard FDI strategy, we have found highly supportive empirical evidence. It is found that holding a DM subsidiary by a Turkish parent firm is associated with 33.047% higher ownership in a later domestic acquisition.

This longitudinal field study explored the effects on individual work performance of allocating tellers to teams with supervisors who received hybrid pay incentives, where 60 per cent of their incentive was based on the individual performance of each of their team members and 40 per cent on their own performance. It was conducted on bulk-cash tellers working in 19 centres, using a time-series design. The results, derived from quantitative data collected from 82 individual tellers over 24 months, showed that hybrid pay incentives for supervisors of teams of tellers, some of whom were individually incentivised, were associated with significant increases in the volume, speed and accuracy of deposit processing by all the tellers. The findings empirically demonstrate the long term sustainability of improved performance associated with the introduction of hybrid pay incentive structures within work teams.","[Dlamini, Mbusi; Sutherland, Margie] Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa; [Werbeloff, Merle] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Sch Governance, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Pretoria; University of Witwatersrand,"Dlamini, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Gordon Inst Business Sci, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,,,,,,,58,1,2,1,24,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

The paper is devoted to the study of social concerns related to nanotechnologies. It is concluded that there is no consensus among academia regarding opportunities and risks of nanomaterial implementation. The hazards and consequences of nanotechnology applications have been described. It has been demonstrated that studies of nanotoxicity are frequently carried out in far from reality conditions and tend to be perceived as prognostic. Nevertheless, assuming the results of this kind of studies being popularized through mass media, it can cause the formation of public opposition with respect to nanotechnology application.","[Godymchuk, Anna; Galanina, Ekaterina; Yunda, Elena] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia; [Godymchuk, Anna] Natl Res Technol Univ MISIS, Moscow, Russia",Tomsk Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS),"Godymchuk, A (通讯作者)，Tomsk Polytech Univ, Tomsk, Russia.",Godymchuk@mail.ru; Galanina@tpu.ru; eny@tpu.ru,"Galanina, Ekaterina V/N-8479-2015","Stanco, Anna/0000-0003-0948-0365",,,,,54,3,3,0,9,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,2466,2476,,,,,,11,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700254,0

This is a case study, an analytical approach, which focuses on exploring and analyzing the CSR policies to measure IKEA's ethical behavior in a business environment. IKEA stands out as a multinational company whose CSR policies are ingrained into the business itself as a part of its ethical operations, rather than a marketing event. Whether they be human rights issue or environmental issue, IKEA goes beyond giving mere lip service to the ethical issues that arise in the global environment and seeks solution beyond resolution of bad publicity which affects the bottom dollar.

Accelerated population growth has exacerbated housing issues in Tehran, Iran and contributed to immediate and future demands for housing in the city. Population migration has focused on Tehran rather than other cities, which resulted in the escalation of population growth rate in Tehran capital of Iran. Regarding to the literature review and the questionnaire survey, the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the demographic variables in housing demand linked to the specific conditions of low-income household in Tehran, Iran. Further, this study examines the extent to which these demographic variables affect the housing demand of low-income households. This research involved a questionnaire survey of 380 low-income households in the district 20 of Tehran Municipality (Shahr-e-Rey) located in south of Tehran, Iran. The result of this research shows that most of the respondents in this research migrated to the Tehran city less than ten years ago and they lived with another family in one residential unit. Due to increasing housing prices most of the respondents were renters since they could not afford to purchase of housing. This study also found inappropriate policy control on housing prices in Tehran. In summation, this study presents a new approach to study housing demand linked to the specific condition of low-income households. The finding of the this research can be used by the public and the private sector as a basis for policy and decision making in housing markets, especially in the Iranian context.","[Hatami, Mozhgan; Abu Bakar, A.

Despite the degradation, the gas turbines are the main power transmitters for non-stop production to meet the prevailing market demand. Hence inappropriate strategies in maintaining industrial assets have applying appropriate FEMS to run have failed to run gas turbines successfully to meet the stemming demand. Consequently, they increase the down time of gas turbines, which in turn affects the production of oil and gas. The objective of this article is to unveil the causes that influence down time of gas turbines and their failures, and significant factors that increase longevity of down time of the gas turbines. The downtime causes has been supported by substantial literature reviews and reports from Eleven Production Sharing Contractors (PSC) in Malaysia. Based on the reviewed excerpts, this article posits necessary FEMS initiatives should be taken to curb the redundant failure of gas turbine, thus lead to facilitate the continuous oil and gas production in Malaysia.","[Jaganathan, Siva; Mohamad, Abdul Hakim; Nesan, Lenin Jawahar] Univ Technol Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Nor, Noor Azman Bin Mohamad] Rolls Royce, Singapore, Singapore",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Rolls-Royce Holding Group,"Jaganathan, S (通讯作者)，Univ Technol Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",,"Jaganathan, Siva/AAQ-6207-2021; Lenin, Jawahar Nesan/D-4379-2015","Jaganathan, Siva/0000-0001-7593-7453; Lenin, Jawahar Nesan/0000-0002-4655-7811",,,,,15,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,409,415,,,,,,7,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700045,0

Research is based on analytical approach, there were invoked a systematic, logical and comparative analysis of scientific literature. The transparency of the financial and non-financial information is one of the key factors, which governs the stakeholders trust on a company. Various studies show that business companies tend to reveal only positive non-financial information and conceal not so good news. Thus, social report is used as a mean of advertising. Of course such practice is intolerable because it reduces confidence on given information. Both results of scientific research and practice observations announce about the necessity to get deeper knowledge how to assess the transparency of the business information.

Actually, trend of social innovations is most depending on the changes in the variety of services, flexibility of supplying services and quality of services. All this aspects of social innovations are the main goals of establishing the full-fledged society. On the other hand, the concept of social entrepreneurship was created as a response to the request of society for establishing the bridge between non-profit services and profit enterprises. In many situations, collaboration across and within sectors should result in solutions that are unattainable by each entity working alone. Concept of social enterprises has a relevant influence to the non-profit sector on the basis of establishing the self-financing concept of served organizations and providers of social services. The entrepreneurial identity is for each non-profit organization an important step up in the strategic, financial and risk management aspects. In Visegrad (V4) countries (Slovakia, Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland), there is a significant lack of research concerning social enterprises. Many important strengths and weaknesses of understanding and misunderstanding of concept of establishing social enterprises were identified in Slovakia. Historically, entrepreneurial environment and non-profit sector in Slovakia was established like two unrelated and unsupplemented sectors in one diverse society.","[Majercakova, Daniela] Comenius Univ, Fac Management FM CU, Bratislava, Slovakia",Comenius University Bratislava,"Majercáková, D (通讯作者)，Comenius Univ, Fac Management FM CU, Bratislava, Slovakia.",daniela.majercakova@gmail.com,"Majercakova, Daniela/G-5002-2017","Majercakova, Daniela/0000-0003-4904-4269",,,,,21,9,9,0,17,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1585,1593,,,,,,9,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700160,0

Starting with the economic boom at the beginning of the millennium, going through the economic crisis, which started around the world in the year 2008 and the consequences of which had not deeply hit the Czech economy until the year 2011, and ending with small steps toward the current recovery. The economic Vend is reflected in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector as well. In ICT, the Czech Republic joined the developed European countries, which is demonstrated by the comparison of the percentage of ICT professionals on the total number of the employed population in the Czech economy in this article. Furthermore, using the data of the Czech Statistical Office, this article shows and analyzes the trend in the gross wage of ICT professionals, in particular during the consolidation of the Czech economy from the year 2011 to the year 2013. This article analyses not only the overall trend in wages but also the trend in the wages of two categories of ICT professions - ICT specialists and ICT technicians. Furthermore, this article analyzes the wages of ICT professionals by gender (the wage difference in men and women). The analysis clearly shows the wage disparity in men and women not only in the ICT sector but also in the entire Czech economy. An interesting conclusion is that the gross wage of women - ICT professionals - is higher as compared to the average gross wage of women than that of men, using the same comparison method. The last factor that we analyzed is the gross wage of ICT professionals with respect to sphere employment (business sphere or non-business sphere). Here, we can see that the wage of ICT practitioners in the business sphere is almost double as compared to the average gross wage, while the wage of ICT practitioners in the non-business sphere is almost the same as the average gross wage, For the purpose of this article, we compared both nominal wages and wages adjusted for inflation.","[Maryska, Milos] Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Namesti W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic; Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Syst Anal, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Maryska, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Informat Technol, Namesti W Churchilla 4, Prague 13067 3, Czech Republic.",maryskam@vse.cz; doucek@vse.cz; nedomova@vse.cz,"Doucek, Petr/A-7703-2015; Maryska, Milos/D-5603-2009",,,,,,13,5,5,0,2,"TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC, FACULTY ECONOMICS",LIBEREC,"STUDENTSKA 2, LIBEREC, 46117, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7494-225-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,101,+,,,,,,2,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BD9PL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365053000010,0

It is a means to increase competitiveness of a company. Web usage mining is engaged in data mining of web server log file and it analyzes the user's behavior on the web site. The first step of web usage mining process is data pre-processing obtained from a web log file. Data pre-processing is an important part of web usage mining. Discovering patterns of behavior of web visitors depends on the quality of pre-processing phase. Therefore it is important to understand the used methods. This paper summarizes the pre-processing phases and especially the phases of session identification. There are introduced two algorithms for data cleaning and session identification using the reference length method. The main aim of this paper is to compare a calculation of cutoff time and its influence on discovered useful, trivial and inexplicable rules. Cutoff time is an important part of the session identification using the Reference Length method. The influence of ratio of auxiliary pages on the calculation based on a sitemap and subjective estimation was compared. Statistical methods were used to determine the difference between these two approaches. In this paper was examined the portion of found rules based on quantity and quality. The ratio of auxiliary pages has only an impact on quantity of extracted rules in the files with path completion. It has no impact on portion of extracted useful rules, on the other hand, inappropriate estimation of the ratio of auxiliary pages may cause increasing of trivial and inexplicable rules.","[Munk, Michel; Benko, L'ubomir; Turcani, Milan] Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia; [Benko, L'ubomir] Univ Pardubice, Fac Econ & Adm, Inst Syst Engn & Informat, Pardubice, Czech Republic; [Gangur, Mikulas] Univ West Bohemia Pilsen, Fac Econ, Dept Econ & Quantitat Methods, Plzen, Czech Republic",Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra; University of Pardubice; University of West Bohemia Pilsen,"Munk, M (通讯作者)，Constantine Philosopher Univ Nitra, Fac Nat Sci, Dept Informat, Nitra, Slovakia.",mmunk@ukf.sk; lubomir.benko@gmail.com; gangur@kem.zcu.cz; mturcani@ukf.sk,"Munk, Michal/AAE-7199-2020; Munk, Michal/N-1724-2017; Turčáni, Milan/D-4168-2019; Benko, Lubomir/C-7713-2019; Gangur, Mikulas/V-7131-2017","Munk, Michal/0000-0002-9913-3596; Turčáni, Milan/0000-0003-4606-8724; Benko, Lubomir/0000-0002-1657-395X; Gangur, Mikulas/0000-0002-7731-9146",[VEGA 1/0392113],,This paper is supported by the project VEGA 1/0392113 Modelling of Stakeholders' Behaviour in Commercial Bank during the Recent Financial Crisis and Expectations of Basel Regulations under Pillar 3-Market Discipline.,,32,17,17,0,16,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The question of selected method is always crucial, because the kind of method you select largely influences the form of the result achieved. In this paper, I consider and argue the use of life coaching when working with young people as a method of facilitating the management of risks that arise from countless offers and options, to which the young are exposed (Giddens, 1994). Despite the great possibilities open to young people, we encounter significant failures, and often the criminal activity of young people, whose brutality is sometimes startling. It turns out that adolescence has never been as difficult as it is today (Giant, 2015). This work builds on the assumption that if young people are to be able to face social risks and challenges, they need to cultivate such skills and abilities in themselves that will allow them to not only survive, but primarily organize a life in which they benefit not only themselves, but also contribute to the proper functioning of society. I followed from authors who emphasize the need to develop and cultivate the identity and potential of individuals, which are the source of improved well-being, despite difficult situations (Masten, 1990; Ferguson, 2001; Seligman, 2004; Anderson, 2004; Saleebey, 2006; Lopez and Louis, 2009; Giant; 2015). The aim is to discuss whether life coaching can be regarded as a method for supporting young people in discovering their identity and carrying out safe life projects.","[Navratilova, Jitka] Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Navrátilová, J (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Social Studies, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, Jostova 10, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",jitkanav@fss.muni.cz,"Navratilova, Jitka/AAE-4644-2019","Navratilova, Jitka/0000-0002-6149-1451",,,,,31,2,2,0,5,"UNIV SOUTH BOHEMIA CESKE BUDEJOVIC, FAC ECONOMICS",CESKE BUDEJOVICE,"STUDENTSKA 13, CESKE BUDEJOVICE, 37005, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7394-536-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,93,98,,,,,,6,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF6ZN,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383863800014,0

However, we often observe that the initially high performance of an organization gradually declines. In order to seek for an optimal wage incentive system, we have constructed an agent-based model with a small group of heterogeneous or homogeneous workers. The model has the following features: players' behavior is subject to random shocks; inertia effect is introduced; and players are rewarded on the basis of their performances. The virtual experiment demonstrates that an organization, consisting of homogenous players, is more viable against the erosion than that with heterogeneous players, and that an organization with homogenous players is far more vulnerable to the erosion than that with heterogeneous players when subject to random shocks. Interestingly, an organization with heterogeneous agents can enjoy high morale among players that allows them to maintain high performance. We also show that the reward incentive is remarkably effective in any organization and it is particularly powerful in homogenous organizations. We have compared the two personnel rating systems: one based upon the level of performance relative to other workers' contemporaneous ones and the other upon her own past performance. In inducing higher performance of the workers, the latter system excels the former for the heterogeneous organization, whereas the former system will outperform for the homogeneous one.","[Okada, Isamu; Takahashi, Ichiro] Soka Univ, Dept Business Adm, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan",Soka University,"Okada, I (通讯作者)，Soka Univ, Dept Business Adm, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.",okada@soka.ac.jp,,,,,,,8,0,0,1,1,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-55236-9; 978-4-431-55235-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,131,142,,10.1007/978-4-431-55236-9_10,0.0,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380563900010,0

Hence, via literature review, this paper is emerged with the aim of reviewing the project management in O&G industry by determining the O&& execution phase as well as examining the O&G project management approach based on the typical O&G platform development stage. It is found that in the O&G project execution, a systematic for project management is developed with the aim to improve the decision making process and overall project execution, where typically, the systematic project management consist of five main phases, mainly (1) appraisal; (2) selection and definition, which are both associated with (3) planning phase; as well as (4) execution and first year operation which are associated with (5) control phase. The project management approach is also found to be executed in the typical O&G development stages, namely: (1) conceptual design; (2) Front End Engineering Design (FEED); (3) procurement of long lead equipment; (4) detailed design; (5) construction/fabrication; (6) onshore pre-commissioning; (7) transportation/installation (applicable for offshore platforms); and (8) hook up and commissioning prior to handover to end user.

The aim of this contribution is to capture the most important determinants of the corporate capital structure from the perspective of entrepreneurs on the basis of an empirical inquiry. Although the number of respondents was limited, inquiry results still can be considered as relevant to formulate conclusions for small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the manufacturing and processing sectors with the legal form of the limited liability company. To identify the most important factors affecting corporate decisions concerning the sources of financing, the statistical methods and procedures were used for the research evaluation. With the help of factor analysis, the three key external factors, brought in by the entrepreneurs, were derived: the economic and political development of the country, the market environment of the country, and the levels of tax and interest rates. The effect of internal factors determining the corporate capital structure was perceived by respondents as more important. The inquiry revealed that the most important internal factors were supposed to be: the corporate philosophy, the cost of the capital, and the financial health and indebtedness of a business. The answer to the essential question of this article, whether the final capital structure of a company is the result of its own decision-making, or rather a result of various external factors, thus tends rather to the predominance of the internal factors.","Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic",Technical University Liberec,"Strycková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Liberec, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Accounting, Liberec, Czech Republic.",lenka.stryckova@tul.cz,"Stryckova, Lenka/L-2467-2015","Stryckova, Lenka/0000-0003-1108-4193",,,,,23,6,6,1,22,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Based on the reinsurance and coinsurance, the cooperation mechanisms consider fully the essential features of social health insurance and private health insurance. We design the indicator of mechanism in order to maintain the ratio of Out-of-Pocket (OOP) to total expenditure around 20% and prevent the catastrophic health expenditures. Four mechanisms of critical illness prepayment are empirically simulated with data of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Our findings show that four interactive mechanisms could alleviate the incidence and severity of catastrophic health expenditure, especially the incidence could be reduced to 0.55% through the integration of reinsurance and coinsurance.

Prior research studies claimed a positive relationship between the number and variety of products and sales smoothing. However, they have also argued the limitations of classical portfolio analysis, especially owing to the assumption of independence of portfolio shares and the static nature of the approach. To address this limitation we extend the model to fit the trend and seasonality of sales, and to cover their correlations. The model aims to predict the impact of product width reduction on sales and their volatility. We consider the reduction of a product category in portfolio. The model covers the impact of product category sales on portfolio sales but also on other product category sales. Finally, we verify the model using a wholesaler company's data and compare results. Hence, we recommend the model for the prediction of changes in sales and their volatility due to product category reduction. The model covers the portfolio dynamic approach to product width under the assumption of price taking, unlike in product assortment and variety planning models.","[Brzeczek, Tomasz] Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Strzelecka Str 11, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland",Poznan University of Technology,"Brzeczek, T (通讯作者)，Poznan Univ Tech, Fac Engn Management, Strzelecka Str 11, PL-60965 Poznan, Poland.",tomasz.brzeczek@put.poznan.pl,"Brzęczek, Tomasz/M-9813-2014","Brzęczek, Tomasz/0000-0002-2505-5089",,,,,50,0,2,1,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

The findings show that participation in the type of after-school clubs captured by the GUI data (largely paid care in a group setting) is supporting children with specific educational needs and those with limited family support, as well as being strongly associated with maternal employment and high household income.

In particular, our estimates provide support for the existence of different responses both in terms of sign and magnitude of cyclical self-employment to output growth and of output growth to cyclical self-employment, depending on the value of the threshold variable.

The study uses the hedonic price model to investigate the impacts of BRT on residential property values in Beijing, where BRT has been in service for over 6 years. The empirical analysis suggests that BRT has positive impacts on surrounding property values. The hedonic price model shows that for every 100-m closer to the BRT station, asking prices of residential properties increase by between 1.32% and 1.39%. The study suggests that accessibility improvement, rather than the type of transit system, has certain influence on property values. The paper underscores the importance of considering the application of value-capture tools to help finance BRT investments and calls for complementary investment policies to enhance property value impacts.

We conducted two studies. In Study 1, based on TMT members' responses from a group of Korean companies, we examined a factor structure of TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness and its influence on CE. We identified that TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness is a second-order construct, constituting scanning and searching, association and connection, and evaluation and judgment, which positively influence CE. In Study 2, based on TMT members' responses from another group of Korean companies, we confirmed a second-order structure of TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness. Furthermore, while breadth and depth of learning positively influenced TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness, speed of learning had a negative effect. In addition, TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness partially mediated the relationship between breadth of learning and CE, and fully mediated the relationship between depth of learning and CE. This study contributes to extending the concept of entrepreneurial alertness to a TMT context and identifying TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness as an organizational capability. It helps understand how the three attributes of organizational learning can heterogeneously contribute to TMTs' entrepreneurial alertness and CE in organizations.","[Lee, Kyootai; Koh, Dohyoung] Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Management Technol, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Youngkyun] Incheon Natl Univ, Sch Business, Incheon, South Korea",Sogang University; Incheon National University,"Lee, K (通讯作者)，Sogang Univ, Grad Sch Management Technol, Seoul, South Korea.",kyootai@sogang.ac.kr,"Lee, Kyootai/ABM-9299-2022",,Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01021916],"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea)",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea and the National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2016S1A5A2A01021916].,,73,4,5,3,63,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This paper analyzes how management control systems facilitate organizations to realize their intended strategies. Hypotheses are tested using survey data from CEOs of Spanish hospitals. Partial least squares is used as a statistical technique to test the integral causal path model. Results show that boundary and diagnostic control systems have primarily a positive impact on the realization of deliberate strategies, whereas belief and interactive control systems positively affect emergent strategies. This study tries to clarify the fragmented results of the literature by analyzing the effect of the design (passive role) and the use (active role) of management control systems on both deliberate and emergent strategies. A practical implication of this paper is that managers should focus on both the design and the use of management control systems to implement strategies successfully. This study is among the first to provide empirical evidence on how different levers of control complement each other in crafting realized strategies.","[Naranjo-Gil, David] Pablo Olavide Univ, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Naranjo-Gil, D (通讯作者)，Pablo Olavide Univ, Carretera Utrera Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",dnargil@upo.es,"Naranjo-Gil, David/K-9384-2014","Naranjo-Gil, David/0000-0002-3099-5120",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technologies [ECO2011-24613],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technologies(Spanish Government),"This article has benefited from comments from workshop participants at Pablo de Olavide University, RSM Erasmus University, and 2010 European Accounting Association Conference.

The single line in operation since 2010 stretches only 15 km and transports merely 15,000 passengers daily. This article examines the reasons why Bangkok has (so far) been unable to implement a full BRT system, unlike many counterparts in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which have similar financial constraints. The authors' position is that there is as much to learn from failure as from success. BRT issues are placed in the broader context of urban transport problems in Bangkok. The study indicates that the Bangkok BRT project was curtailed due to a combination of reasons, which confirm the findings of prior studies on BRT planning and implementation worldwide. The crucial issues in this case were the weak and discontinued political leadership and the failure to manage competing modes, the primary of which is the automobile. Nonetheless, creating a however limited BRT system was not a loss for Bangkok and extension plans could always be resumed in the future. Should another attempt be made at creating an integrated and large-scale BRT system, local planners and leaders who care about the city's sustainable future must avoid repeating past mistakes and falling into past behavioral patterns. While this article focuses on a single case study, the findings apply to a number of cities in similar geo-political and economic contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The case of the BRS System (the Brazilian acronym for BHLS) in Rio de Janeiro is used as a contrast case for the traditional BRT projects. The second and main part is dedicated to the Brazilian Capital City Brasilia, where public transport has been for long time neglected, but has implemented a BRT line, which has been source for more trouble than success. The paper discusses not only the circumstances of this investment project, but also other needed measures in order to restore the overall public transport service network that may ensure success of this investment and of others in the time to come. A new system that combines BRT and BRS and other managing reforms is proposed. Unfortunately, after a an auspicious beginning, the initiative stranded in few months.

Experienced consumers learn their valuations for the product in the advance selling season, while inexperienced consumers learn only when the product becomes available in the regular selling season. The retailer is uncertain about the number of inexperienced consumers. Production takes place between the periods. Unsold units are scrapped at a price that is below the retailer's marginal cost, which makes it costly to produce and not sell. I show that when consumers are less heterogeneous in their valuations, the retailer should implement advance selling and offer a pre-order price guarantee. For some parameter configurations a pre-order price guarantee acts as a commitment device not to decrease the price in the regular selling season. In other situations, it enables the seller to react to the information that is obtained from pre-orders by increasing or decreasing the price.

This study aims at determining how different contractual and environmental factors affect cost efficiency, and whether cost efficiency differs between Public Transport Authorities (PTA). A stochastic frontier analysis is conducted using contract-level data for the 21 PTAs and year 2013. The main findings are that cost efficiency is lower if a contract is operating in areas with high population density, or if the traffic is supplied by a publicly owned operator without using competitive tendering. Furthermore, no major differences in cost efficiency are found across PTAs, with the exception of the counties of Stockholm and Skane, both counties with high population density, and the county of Vastmanland, where all public transport is provided without competitive tendering. The finding of lower cost efficiency in high-density areas calls for further investigation into why this is. Potential explanations are the need for higher peak capacity, or more complex transportation systems. Finally, usage of direct-awarding of public transport should be clearly motivated, as this affects cost efficiency negatively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The explicit objective was to increase the number of French-speaking immigrants, with no deterioration in overall labor market performance. To achieve this, points for French and education (specifically bachelor's degrees) were increased. In parallel, points for a subjective assessment of adaptability were decreased. In line with the initial objective, we find more French-speaking immigrants with bachelor's degrees, and no worsening in labor market outcomes after the reform. These results hold in a difference-in-differences and triple differences analysis.

Online dispute resolution (ODR) is transforming the way disputes are being resolved, in particular, in business to consumer (B2C) transactions. ODR offers a more successful means of resolving e-commerce disputes. In fact, there is a new move by the Malaysian judiciary to transform its court system. Previously, the judiciary has been very conventional in its administration of justice, and the system is said to be slow and outdated. The court system in Malaysia has been frequently criticised because of its dilatoriness in resolving disputes, resulting in a large backlog of cases. To overcome these problems, the judiciary has introduced a new system called the e-court.

We first argue that the attributes of the transaction are key drivers of third-party involvement. We then draw on the behavioral theory of the firm to develop arguments regarding the influence of third parties on contract complexity. Our results reveal that the involvement of legal third parties tends to magnify the contract's overall complexity. In contrast, the involvement of technical third parties reduces the inclusion of monitoring provisions and increases the inclusion of coordination provisions.

Previously, the lack of access to broadband Internet connection and teleconferencing software from home has acted as a barrier to telecommuting regularly or at all. However, with advances in information and communication technology in recent years telecommuting is becoming a viable option for employers and employees to undertake. This paper examines the current trends of full day and part day telecommuting in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA), and attempts to ascertain the most influential drivers and constraints related to telecommuting. The research presented estimates of the environmental benefits from individuals that telecommute. Finally, this paper seeks to determine the magnitude of carbon emissions savings from individuals adopting telecommuting and provides a social cost of carbon saving value. The survey results presented suggest that approximately 44% of the population of the GDA telecommute at least once a month. The findings also indicate that needing contact with colleagues is the most influential constraint to telecommuting, while greater flexibility and avoiding travelling in peak periods are the most important drivers in the propensity to telecommute. Finally, this study shows that there are substantial carbon reductions and social cost of carbon savings. Thus illustrating how telecommuting can be a viable and sustainable policy in the GDA or in other similar sized regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We conduct multiple tests which control for the generalized confidence level and employ the bootstrap MHT to design multiple comparison testing. We consider absolute and relative predictive ability to test a range of competing risk models, focusing on value-at-risk and expected shortfall (ExS). In devising the test for the absolute predictive ability, we take the route of recent literature and construct balanced simultaneous confidence sets that control for the generalized family-wise error rate, which is the joint probability of rejecting true hypotheses. We implement a step-down method which increases the power of the MHT in isolating false discoveries. In testing for the ExS model predictive ability, we design a new simple test to draw inference about recursive model forecasting capability.

A key feature of the proposed Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models is the consideration of two novel inputs related to the number of airlines and scheduled routes operating at each airport, in addition to the more common capital non-discretionary inputs (runways, boarding gates and apron). These novel inputs are a way of considering the effects of the air transport market on airports' performance and growth prospects. In particular, a model to estimate the growth in passenger numbers, aircraft movements and cargo that can be achieved by an airport through increasing its number of airlines and routes, and assuming an efficient operation, is presented. Also, a multi-objective DEA model is proposed to explore the possible trade-offs in the output Pareto efficient frontier of a given airport. In addition, a second stage fractional regression model specific for explaining DEA efficiency scores is conducted and the results suggest that ownership structure and hub airport status are significant factors for explaining variations in the operational efficiency of European SMA.

We do so by applying insights from the Multi-Level Perspective on transitions in explaining changes in the safe socio-technical drinking water regime in rural Bangladesh. Data about seven dimensions of regime change were gathered from key actors through in-depth interviews, focus groups sessions, a survey, and a workshop. The findings reveal that with the introduction of deep tube well as an arsenic mitigation technology, the observed changes in the seven dimensions help to transform the existing safe drinking water regime in order to re-stabilise it. Technological attributes, symbolic meaning, industry structures, and techno-scientific knowledge have supported an evolving dominance of the deep tube well. Besides, user practices as well as related infrastructures have adapted to the use of deep tube wells, and new policies stimulated its application. We argue that the dimensions of the technology change in the existing regime are consistent with the features of incremental innovation. By offering such insights, we show the relevance of the Multi-Level Perspective on transitions to analyse socio-technical innovation in a developing world context.","[Kundu, Debasish Kumar; van Vliet, Bas J.

In 2013, Tesco claimed that retrospectively-applied Korean Sunday trading regulations reduced its trading there by 8 per cent. We utilised secondary sources and also conducted an empirical survey of 1,092 consumers in 22 Korean cities to assess reactions to this regulatory change and found evidence of spatial switching back to traditional locations. Our Korean respondents supported the new Sunday trading restraint. Such an outcome would not be expected in those Western countries where further liberalisation is still promoted. Also, the poor trading figures announced by Tesco-Homeplus in 2013 imply that Homeplus never fully adjusted to the Korean market.

Implementing proper control actions, such as tactics, leads to reducing passenger waiting time and preventing missed transfers. These two undesirable features are major contributors to PT's negative image. However, there has been no specific investigation of the effect of implementing tactics on passengers' perceptions and decisions (demand side). This paper presents the results of a qualitative and quantitative study of PT users to obtain a deeper understanding of travelers' attitudes toward transport uncertainty and to explore perceptions of real-time operational tactics on PT service quality. The study is undertaken in two-parts: (a) assessment of the effects of delay on PT users' perception and decision to change route or mode; (b) evaluation of users' decisioh based on various real-time operational tactics. To investigate users' perception and decisions related to various operational tactics, a user-preference survey was conducted at a major terminal in Auckland, New Zealand, and Lyon, France. The survey data was modeled following a Multinomial Logistic Regression and a decision-tree-based method. The statistical analysis emphasized that, in various situations (e.g., waiting at a stop for more than 10 min), more than 60% of the travelers will change their decision and adapt travel behaviors based on a decision-support tool. The findings provide policy makers with an understanding of the behavioral aspect of real-time operational tactics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper discusses the types and impact of regulation on health and safety effort in a simple framework in which workers' beliefs concerning accident risks also play a role.

We extend the analysis by taking into account that private parties often submit evidence during public investigation. Such parties consider private suit as a partial substitute for public prosecution. The trial option might induce these parties to be less willing to contribute evidence to public cases. Private trials crowd out public prosecution. In effect, the probability of prosecution of anticompetitive actions might decrease, while the earlier result that the probability of prosecuted actions being prosecuted is confirmed.

To answer this question, the significant cycles were discovered using the Fourier analysis inside the price series of US stocks; then, the simulation of an agent buying and selling on minima and maxima of these cycles was made. The results were then compared to those of an agent operating chaotically. Moreover, the existing significant cycles were found using more precise methods, suggested in the research, and based on the results of an agent buying and selling on all possible periods and phases. It has been analysed whether these really existing cycles were in accordance with the significant cycles resulting from the Fourier analysis. It has been concluded that the Fourier analysis basically failed. Suchlike failures are expected on similar data series. In addition, momentum and level trading backtests have been used in a similar way. It has been found that the level trading does provide a certain practical value in comparison to the momentum trading method.

It shows how Dutch media constructed an image of the Netherlands and Russia as representatives of conflicting cultural traditions on account of their different attitudes towards LGBTI (Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Intersexual) rights. Advancing from Mouffe's observation that politics is inherently oppositional, this paper aims to nuance such a dichotomous imagery by showing distinct commonalities between Russian and Dutch cultural regimes. In fact, Russian discourses are historically rooted in Soviet conceptions of cultural geography, and appeal to similar associations of anti-colonial and anti-elitist resistance. However, Dutch and Russian popularised discourses of cultural difference should be recognised as one of several dualisms that Europe and the Netherlands have inherited from the Cold War.","[Jansen, Hanna] Univ Amsterdam, Dept Eastern European Studies ARTES, Spuistr 210, NL-1012 VT Amsterdam, Netherlands",University of Amsterdam,"Jansen, H (通讯作者)，Univ Amsterdam, Dept Eastern European Studies ARTES, Spuistr 210, NL-1012 VT Amsterdam, Netherlands.",h.e.jansen@uva.nl,,,,,,,19,3,3,0,3,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

In order to operate such systems efficiently, methods for reliable probabilistic forecasts of future wind power production are essential. It is well known that the conditional density of wind power production is highly dependent on the level of predicted wind power and prediction horizon. This paper describes a new approach for wind power forecasting based on logistic-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The SDE formulation allows us to calculate both state-dependent conditional uncertainties as well as correlation structures. Model estimation is performed by maximizing the likelihood of a multidimensional random vector while accounting for the correlation structure defined by the SDE formulation. We use non-parametric modelling to explore conditional correlation structures, and skewness of the predictive distributions as a function of explanatory variables.

Karl Polanyi referred to this propertization of nature as the great transformation. That land, water, and air was a social commons is now archaic and forgotten, and with it the classical economic concept of rent, which was, in theory, once paid to royalty as the earth's guardian. Garrett Hardin's article, The Tragedy of the Commons, raised alarm about the abuse and loss of this realm, and he recommended constraints and privatization to prevent this. Most people view titles to landed property much as they do their household goods, but Henry George saw that the earth should be seen as a common resource and its value taxed to benefit everyone. This would restore economic equilibrium to market exchanges and pay for government services. The capture of natural resource rents can supplant taxes on wages and capital goods, and it comports with all textbook principles of sound tax theory. This policy can be the modern replacement for the commons, and implementing resource rent capture is both economically and technically feasible.",,,,,,,,,,,96,0,0,0,15,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

In medical malpractice cases, there is both anecdotal and quantitative evidence that policy limits and the insurer's duty to settle are central parts of settlement bargaining. We estimate the model using a Texas database of closed, paid medical malpractice claims. Both the data and our model predict a mass of cases with a settlement offer by the plaintiff exactly at limits; a smaller but still sizeable mass of cases with payout exactly at limits (both in pre-trial settlements and after trial), and substantial haircuts (payout < damages) in tried cases with damages > limits. In counterfactual analysis, we predict that, as duty-to-settle liability becomes stricter, there will be: more at-limits offers, fewer trials, fewer at-limits payments in tried cases, more insurer payments above limits, and smaller haircuts.","[Yousefi, Kowsar] Inst Management & Planning Studies, Tehran, Iran; [Black, Bernard] Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University,"Yousefi, K (通讯作者)，Inst Management & Planning Studies, Tehran, Iran.;Black, B (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Sch Law, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.;Black, B (通讯作者)，Kellogg Sch Management, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",k.yousefi@imps.ac.ir; bblack@northwestern.edu,"Yousefi, Kowsar/ABN-6567-2022","Yousefi, Kowsar/0000-0001-8818-1202",Northwestern Law School; IMPS,Northwestern Law School; IMPS,Partial funding was provided by Northwestern Law School and IMPS.,,22,3,4,0,3,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

While the broad characterization of African-American drivers being more likely to receive a frisk remains accurate, several related factors are identified that create a more nuanced picture of a driver's probability of being frisked. The interaction of the gender of the driver, the time of day of the traffic stop, and the existence of passengers in the stopped vehicle with the race of the driver all impact the probability of receiving a frisk.","[Ryan, Matt E.] Duquesne Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA",Duquesne University,"Ryan, ME (通讯作者)，Duquesne Univ, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 USA.",ryanm5@duq.edu,,,,,,,30,5,6,0,29,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

The three arrows of Abenomics are assumed to be coordination of the monetary, fiscal and structural policies needed to stimulate domestic demand, investments, economic growth to achieve fiscal balance. The research objectives of the article were as follows: to deliver in-depth theoretical context, to make a short-term review; to provide the mid- and long-term scenarios including the key challenges and recommendations for Abenomics. An unprecedented expansionary monetary policy of the Bank of Japan was found as relatively unsuccessful and hazardous. The authors delivered an important context of the Japan's social security system to assess the policy of fiscal consolidation under Abenomics, pointing out the problem of aging society as well as slowing growth of productivity. The importance of structural reforms, starting with the labour market and corporate governance, was stressed.","[Bobowski, Sebastian; Drelich-Skulska, Boguslawa] Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Bobowski, S (通讯作者)，Wroclaw Univ Econ, Fac Econ Sci, Dept Int Econ Relat, Komandorska 118-120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.",sebastian.bobowski@ue.wroc.pl; boguslawa.skulska@ue.wroc.pl,"Bobowski, Sebastian SB/Q-3884-2018; Drelich - Skulska, Boguslawa/P-4518-2018","Drelich - Skulska, Boguslawa/0000-0003-0233-1850",,,,,38,0,0,0,10,VILNIUS UNIV,KAUNAS,"MUITINES G 8,, KAUNAS, LT-44280, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

For this purpose a Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to assess how well the measured variables represent the constructs, which according to several authors of the literature, have been identified as limitations to organizational decision-making. In this study they were classified in three dimensions: limitations on Strategic Management, limitations on Human Resource Management and limitations on Financial Management.The analysis is based on data collected from 229 Mexican companies. The results show that the proposed model is a good measure of inflexibility in decision-making of these organizations. In addition, it was identified that the variable that best predicts the limitations in strategic management is the lack of clear objectives. Furthermore, it was found that the strongest predictor of limitations on human resources management is the presence of conflicts between employees; and regarding limitations on financial management, the best predictor is the falling profits of the organization. It is expected that this model will help organizations to identify and eliminate these limitations that constraint the organizational decision-making, facilitating their capability to adapt to the changing environment.","[Carrasco, Guillermo] Tecnol Monterrey, Management & Int Business Dept, Calle Puente 222, Col Ejidos De Huipulco, Tlalpan, Mexico; [Angeles, Adrianela] Anahuac Univ, Econ & Business Dept, Av Univ Anahuac 46 Col Lomas Anahuac, Huixquilucan 52786, Edo De Mexico, Mexico; [Marroquin-Tovar, Edmundo] Univ Panamericana, Dept Econ & Business, Augusto Rodin 498, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Tecnologico de Monterrey; Universidad Anahuac; Universidad Panamericana - Ciudad de Mexico,"Angeles, A (通讯作者)，Anahuac Univ, Econ & Business Dept, Av Univ Anahuac 46 Col Lomas Anahuac, Huixquilucan 52786, Edo De Mexico, Mexico.",gcarrasc@itesm.mx; adrianela.cit@gmail.com; emarroq@up.edu.mx,"Angeles, Adrianela/L-3895-2019",,,,,,44,2,2,3,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

A further prey, an additional upstream supply sector, namely the iron ore sector, is added to reflect the implications of scarcity and resource limitations for industrial development and economic prospects. We find that capacity constraints in the steel industry could limit the future supply of vehicles, a result exacerbated by the unsustainable use of iron ore reserves. The solution is not for marginal steel industries to close, but for steelmakers to adapt and move to less resource-demanding secondary steelmaking technology rather than focusing on primary steelmaking. The forecasting capabilities of the model are compared with the outputs from a neural-network model. Although the results are comparable over the short term (+/- 10 years), over the long term, results diverge, showing that forecasting steel-industry dynamics is complex and that further work is required to disentangle the drivers of supply and demand. This study indicates the potential advantages of using predator-prey models in modelling the supply chain in economics.","[Crookes, Douglas John; Blignaut, James Nelson] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa; [Blignaut, James Nelson] South African Environm Observat Network, Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria; National Research Foundation - South Africa; South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON),"Crookes, DJ (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, Pretoria, South Africa.",d_crookes@hotmail.com,"Blignaut, James N/U-1755-2017","Crookes, Douglas/0000-0001-9357-5396; Blignaut, James/0000-0001-7059-9010",,,,,34,16,16,4,25,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

We ask how the influence of global and local forces on Mexican maize prices changed during this period. We also explore how the strength of global and local forces varies across maize-producing regions. In general, we expect the influence of global forces to increase and local forces to decrease as markets become more open. We find that the influence of global forces does vary over the study period and, counter to expectation, is the highest at the beginning and middle of the period rather than at the end. This result suggests that even under less open market conditions, buyers and sellers were still following global price signals. In contrast, the influence of local forces follows expectation and decreases over time. However, the estimated pattern of response is not uniform across various maize-producing regions. Taken together, our results suggest that opening agricultural markets can result in regionally distinct outcomes and counterintuitive price behavior.","[Davenport, Frank; Sweeney, Stuart] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Steigerwald, Doug] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Davenport, F; Sweeney, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Geog, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.;Steigerwald, D (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 1832 Ellison Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",frank.davenport@gmail.com; doug@econ.ucsb.edu; sweeney@geog.ucsb.edu,"Sweeney, Stuart H/G-7024-2015","Davenport, Frank/0000-0003-2409-768X","National Science Foundation (NSF) [0826871]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [0826871] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci [0826871] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE)); Division Of Behavioral and Cognitive Sci(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Kirsten Appendini, Hallie Eakin, Miguel Gomez, and the Econometrics Research group at UC Santa Barbara all gave helpful comments on several earlier drafts of this article.

Therefore, I consider that the royalties' calculation model below detailed will guide firms to respect their own attributions. I am proposing a theoretical model that would help determine royalties according to the types of agreed licenses. By monitoring the fluctuation of the net sales of the current year reported to the base year, we can determine each year's royalty per type of license. In support of the theoretical model, I chose a case that reproduces all of the steps that need to be taken for each phase of the framework.

Problematics of small business development turned to one of the most popular areas of study for the Russian researchers in the 1990s. After the market reforms started, large part of population believed that small business will become a source of wealth and prosperity as for them personally so for the society as the whole. This opinion united academic researchers and practitioners-entrepreneurs, so the activities of the latter gave the empirical material for the first. The main economic functions usually attributed to small businesses are the following: innovation, combating monopolies and maintain a competitive environment, combating unemployment and creating jobs, increasing income of the general population and, consequently, the expansion of consumer demand, increase the professional activity, the development of entrepreneurial skills, spirit, and traditions. Social role of small business is considered its being an important institution of civil society and the kernel of the middle class formation as a basis for socio-political stability of the state. In the earlier research of the author it was concluded that in now-day Russia small business does not perform properly the functions attributed to it by economic theory. Its contribution to innovation is modest. Its antimonopoly role does not fit the theoretical position. The role in job creation is noticeable but it is not accompanied by the role in income creation and by the appropriate indicators of business productivity.

PLM is a strategic approach driving organizational change that leads towards operational excellence. However, PLM adoption is not easy but rather complex. This qualitative research, was conducted in a local automotive components manufacturing company that studied its PLM requirements in order to determine the suitable PLM technology components for adoption to improve production lead-time and product quality. The results of this case study showed that change control, improve communication, reduce error, meeting company policy and industry compliance and better decision making were the key challenges to be addressed by company using PLM.

The establishment of regional offices allows multinational companies to have a local insight of the market, competition landscape and customer preferences. With such detailed insight, multinational companies are then able to formulate effective and responsive regional strategies. The importance and value of regional headquarters in the academic literature has generally focused on them in industrialized countries. The result is that we do not yet fully possess an overall framework for understanding how value and decisions are devolved, how location decisions are made and how their structures and strategies are evolving to accommodate the growth in emerging markets. The study examines the dominant criteria used by multinational enterprises to choose their locations for regional headquarters in Africa by examining South Africa as a host country for the continent. We find that the main criteria are linked to the advantages of agglomeration and the accompanying economies of scale, and a sound institutional framework which provides a predictable economic climate. In emerging markets which often suffer from institutional voids and thus higher country risk profiles, multinationals choose to locate in the environment which is most familiar to its home rules and use it as a springboard to do business in more 'hostile' milieus. The implications for managers looking to do business in Africa is to recognize that this is a continent still consolidating its transition to a sounder institutional environment. Given the unique business environment it will be a difficult region to manage successfully from centralized headquarters and thus using regional headquarters with local knowledge has real advantages.","[Luiz, John M.] Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Radebe, Busi] Univ Witwatersrand, Wits Business Sch, ZA-2050 Johannesburg, South Africa",University of Cape Town; University of Witwatersrand,"Luiz, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Grad Sch Business, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa.",John.luiz@gsb.uct.ac.za; radebeb@gmail.com,"Luiz, John/AAU-9761-2020; Luiz, John M/B-5554-2008","Luiz, John/0000-0003-3806-4424; Luiz, John M/0000-0003-3806-4424",Economic Research Southern Africa; National Research Foundation,Economic Research Southern Africa; National Research Foundation,The support of Economic Research Southern Africa and the National Research Foundation is acknowledged.

This context represents a fertile field for the approach and comprehension of the policy-making process towards the complexity science, which has been contributing to the public policy field. In this framework, 'for-benefit' civil society organizations (CSO) have an important role in reaching the desirable ends, also known as the common-good, which here is considered as food and nutrition security.

The conclusion appoints that by making good use of the evolving CSOs' voluntary willingness to cooperate for food and nutrition security, the Chinese policy-makers have the opportunity to innovate, to gain scale and to improve quality, by structuring mechanisms for enhancing the involvement of the 'for-benefit' civil society organizations into this public policy, in a regulated and participative manner.","[Melo, Paulo] Univ Salvador Unifacs, Salvador, Brazil; [Mellao, Victor] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China; [de Hoyos Guevara, Arnoldo Jose] Pontif Catholic Univ, Sch Econ & Business Adm, Sao Paulo, Brazil",Universidade Salvador (UNIFACS); Wuhan University of Technology; Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo,"Melo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Salvador Unifacs, Salvador, Brazil.",paulomsmelo@gmail.com; victor@victormellao.com.br; arnoldodehoyos@yahoo.com.br,,,,,,,24,0,0,0,3,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,1173,1182,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400197,0

An important topic in computational social choice is voting theory. Recently, a new voting method, called Q - Borda Count, has been proposed; the voting scheme (i.e. the matrix of the ordered preferences of the voters over the set of candidates) associated to Q - Borda Count voting method is called Q - voting scheme. When the voters are software agents, the Q - voting schemes must be created automatically, i.e. using algorithms. In this paper we propose a new algorithm for creating Q - voting schemes and we show how this algorithm works on two examples. In addition, we compare our algorithm with an existing algorithm from the literature that solves the same problem and we provide several experimental results.","[Mogos, Andrei-Horia; Florea, Adina Magda] Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania; [Mogos, Bianca] Univ Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania",National University of Science & Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest; University of Bucharest,"Mogos, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Politehn Bucuresti, Bucharest, Romania.",andrei.mogos@cs.pub.ro; broman@fmi.unibuc.ro; adina.florea@cs.pub.ro,"Florea, Adina Magda/AAM-2058-2020; Florea, Adina Magda/G-5326-2016","Florea, Adina Magda/0000-0001-7249-1871",Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development of Ministry of European Funds [POSDRU/159/1.5/S/132397],Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development of Ministry of European Funds,The work has been funded by the Sectoral Operational Programme Human Resources Development 2007-2013 of the Ministry of European Funds through the Financial Agreement POSDRU/159/1.5/S/132397.,,9,1,1,0,0,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,4307,4316,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700430,0

This country with stable growth interested the researchers to know whether this development goes hand in hand with financial inclusion. This paper is an attempt to show the overview of financial inclusion in Rwanda. Secondary data from Rwanda Fin scope survey 2008, 2012 and 2016 were used in this study. Apart from that, this paper uses data from Banque National du Rwanda from 2011 to 2015. Many researches were conducted on financial inclusion in different countries but none of them took Rwanda as a special case. The results show that there is an improvement in fmancial inclusion in Rwanda as the number of financially excluded dropped from 52% in 2008 to 11% in 2016. The problem is that the number of banked adults did not increase from 2008 to 2016. Banked adults in Rwanda were 14% in 2008, 23% in 2012 and 26% in 2016. This shows that many Rwandan adults are not banked. The government should continue to mobilize citizens to join banks. Mobile payment improved tremendously and this should be strengthened and more regulated as it is serving many Rwandans.","[Moise, Bigirimana; Xu Hongyi] Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China",Wuhan University of Technology,"Moïse, B (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ Technol, Sch Management, Wuhan 430070, Peoples R China.",mosebigirimana@yahoo.com; steven64@163.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,0,0,WUHAN UNIV TECHNOLOGY PRESS,WUHAN,"122 LUOSHI RD, WUHAN 430070, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,978-7-5629-5431-6,,,,2016,,,,,,,983,988,,,,,,6,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9JX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393354400162,0

A few of these negative effects are: the change in coastal sediment dynamics, the change in seed dispersal dynamics, and the fact that it is overtaking native plants. However, Rooikrans can also potentially be used as biomass feedstock for electricity generation. Following a system dynamics modelling approach, the feasibility of using woody biomass from Rooikrans was investigated. The RE-model used data obtained from the Department of Environmental Affairs' (DEA) Natural Resource Management (NRM) division, consulted with experts and conducted literature reviews with respect to the subject matter. Three scenarios were tested and the RE-model results showed that all scenarios have a positive cumulative Net Present Values (NPVs), with the exception of the baseline case scenario.

However, the practical powers of Parliament are limited, especially in relation to borrowing and the planning of public expenditure. In the case of borrowing, there is some degree of scrutiny through the EU processes, and the creation of the Office for Budget Responsibility has greatly increased transparency. As regards expenditure, internal controls administered by the UK Treasury, in particular now through the process of the Spending Review, are in practice much more important than advance Parliamentary scrutiny. A striking characteristic of the UK is the near-total absence of substantive legal constraints on the ability of central government to run deficits or increase debt. These currently take the form of provisions in the Charter for Budget Responsibility, but are not legally enforceable and remain largely symbolic. Although the UK has privatised almost all its public enterprises it also has a variety of forms of extended government. Classification as public or private is complex and is the responsibility of the Office for National Statistics; it may have a substantial effect on the size of public debt. The financial autonomy of local government is severely limited. Scotland, after voting to remain part of the UK in September 2014, is being given substantial further taxation and borrowing powers, and further powers are being given to Wales.","[Prosser, Tony] Univ Bristol, Law Sch, Bristol, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Prosser, T (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Law Sch, Bristol, Avon, England.",t.prosser@bristol.ac.uk,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,2,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2214-6881,,978-3-319-41205-4; 978-3-319-41203-0,IUS COMP,,,2016,20,,,,,,299,323,,10.1007/978-3-319-41205-4_11,0.0,,,25,Economics; Law,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law,BI1RQ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406787000011,0

This study examines the moderating role of religion in the relationships between value and customer satisfaction. This paper poses the question: Does religiosity moderate the relationships among traditional value, Islamic value and customer satisfaction with the halal destination? The study aims to test empirically the effect of traditional value and Islamic religious value on customers' satisfaction with a halal destination. Moreover, the study also analyses the moderating role of religiosity in the relationship between Islamic value and customers' satisfaction with a halal destination. A total of 295 questionnaires consisting of 40 items was distributed to Muslim tourists on-line through survey sites and offline at Lombok Island. Lombok was employed because it was chosen as the Best Halal Tourist Destination and the Best Halal Honeymoon Destination during the World Halal Travel Awards 2015 held in Abu Dhabi. The direct relationships and moderation effects of religiosity were assessed using structural equation modeling with AMOS 18.0. The results clearly indicated that it is only traditional value which significantly and directly influences customers' satisfaction with a halal destination while Islamic value has no significant influence on customers' satisfaction. Islamic value, specifically non-physical Islamic attributes, significantly influences customers' satisfaction only under the moderation of religiosity. Thus, destination marketers should deliver highly traditional value to create high customer satisfaction with halal destinations. Marketers should also consider non-physical Islamic attributes such as segregation of service delivery when they target consumers with high religiosity to attract more Muslim tourists.

Trading volume was used as dependent variable where as stock return and volatility as independent variables. Generalized Autoregressive Heteroskedasticity (GARCH 1,1) model was used to check the normality of data. Multiple regression equation and granger causality models were applied to estimate the contemporaneous as well as causal relationship respectively. From contemporaneous perspective, all sectors results were founded significantly positive except Sugar. These results were confirming the Sequential-Arrival of Information-Hypothesis (SAIH) and Mixture of Distribution-Hypothesis (MDH). Finally by applying granger causality test, unidirectional causality was founded among three sectors namely cement, food and composite in both trading volume to return and trading volume to volatility. However bidirectional causality was founded between chemical and food sectors from return to volume and volatility to volume respectively. Investors were recommended to make the investment in all sectors except sugar.","[Tahir, Safdar Husain; Ali, Fahad; Ghaffar, Nouman] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Banking & Finance, Faisalabad, Pakistan; [Sabir, Hazoor M.] Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Business Adm, Faisalabad, Pakistan",Government College University Faisalabad; Government College University Faisalabad,"Tahir, SH (通讯作者)，Govt Coll Univ Faisalabad, Banking & Finance, Faisalabad, Pakistan.",safdartahir@gmail.com; fahad870.pk@gmail.com; noumanmirza786@gmail.com; Hazoor.sabir@yahoo.com,"Tahir, Dr.Safdar Husain/J-8740-2015; TAHIR, SAFDAR HUSAIN/K-5641-2019","Tahir, Dr.Safdar Husain/0000-0002-2186-1518;",,,,,28,1,1,0,4,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,344,358,,,,,,15,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700034,0

We find that cities with higher public housing supplies have a large 'magnetic effect' on the location choice of new immigrants with children. The estimated effect is substantial and quantitatively similar to the effect of the size of the ethnic group in the urban area. In cities with higher public housing supply, these immigrants tend to benefit from better housing conditions, but non-European immigrants are also more likely to be unemployed.","[Verdugo, Gregory] Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France",European Central Bank; Bank of France,"Verdugo, G (通讯作者)，Banque France, 31 Rue Croix des Petits Champs, F-75049 Paris 01, France.",gregory.verdugo@banque-france.fr,"Verdugo, Gregory/AAF-1279-2020","Verdugo, Gregory/0000-0003-0289-5146",French State grant (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees-CASD) [ANR-10-EQPX-17],French State grant (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees-CASD),This research was partially supported by a French State grant (ANR-10-EQPX-17) (Centre d'acces securise aux donnees-CASD).,,51,11,11,2,35,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Expected shortfall and procyclical capital buffers have been proposed by regulatory authorities, but neither is without problems. Bubble VaR - a coherent measure which avoids many of the pitfalls to which other measures have succumbed - was designed to be both forward-looking and countercyclical. Although tested on other markets, here it is applied to various South African prices and the results compared with both international observations and other market risk measures.

The relatively great lack of scientific literature on the topic of management culture, therefore, this article presents the authors analysing the components of management culture. Theoretical and empirical research involves relatively different contexts of corporate social responsibility topics from managerial transformations to corporate social responsibility approach in the aspect of national traditions and international influences. The aim of this article is to determine the level of management culture in order to implement the conception of a socially responsible company in the case of manufacturing companies' group. So in order to implement the set aim the survey was carried out in 2013. The authors' formed the questionnaire 'Determination of management culture level for the implementation of the conception of a socially responsible company' and used it for the survey. The empirical study was carried out in one of the Eastern Europe manufacturing concerns registered in Lithuania. The concern wished to remain anonymous; and 885 employees worked in it during the investigation period, i.e. 91 percent of all employees. When presenting the results, the demographic characteristics of the respondents are detailed according to: company's group divisions, currently occupied positions, work experience, age, gender, education. The results of the empirical research show that management culture is related to the level of social responsibility perception within the organization.

The entrepreneurial intention of women is essential to the development of entrepreneurial activities because it acts as a background for entrepreneurs to be competitive and enhance their abilities to achieve the business objective. The present study serves a ground work to determine the factors that influence women's entrepreneurial intention with a focus on women as microenterprise entrepreneurs in Small and Medium Industries (SMEs) in Kuching, Sarawak. Self-Efficacy and familial factor are looked into to assess their effect on women's entrepreneurial intention. A quantitative approach was adopted whereby a self-administered questionnaire was designed and pre-tested. Questionnaires were distributed to women entrepreneurs in Kuching who registered under the Wawasan Women Entrepreneur Sarawak (SARANITA) program. The data obtained were then analyzed using SPSS 22. The result shows that both dimensions of self-efficacy and familial factor have a positive effect on women's entrepreneurial intention. The result also indicates that self-efficacy is the critical factor followed by familial factor that drives their business intention. Hence, understanding women's entrepreneurial intention towards business could help to strengthen their roles in the developing market and economies.

We test our hypothesis using data on antitrust proceedings in Spain from 1990 to 2003, when the Spanish government undertook intense reforms in several industries. We construct a database of proceedings brought by the Court (Tribunal de Defensa de la Competencia) during that period. Our results show an increase in collusion and trust practices in deregulated industries during that period, which required the government to dedicate additional resources to antitrust policy. We also find that certain regulatory elements and industrial deregulation have positive effects on the number of antitrust proceedings. We also observe that sanctions may induce a learning effect in industries that causes industry participants to modify their behavior. Finally, we find that the existence of a regulatory agency in an industry has no significant effect on antitrust proceedings in that industry.","[Alonso-Nuez, Maria J.; Munoz-Porcar, Antonio] Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain; [Rosell-Martinez, Jorge] Ctr Univ Def, Acad Gen Militar, Barcelona, Spain",University of Zaragoza,"Alonso-Nuez, MJ (通讯作者)，Univ Zaragoza, E-50009 Zaragoza, Spain.",jalonu@unizar.es; jrosell@unizar.es; amunoz@unizar.es,"Alonso-Nuez, Maria J/K-6815-2017; Rosell, Jorge/B-4919-2011","Alonso-Nuez, Maria J/0000-0001-6280-1602; Rosell, Jorge/0000-0002-7133-4425",Gobierno de Aragon; European Social Fund through the research group CREVALOR; European Social Fund through the research group COMPETE,Gobierno de Aragon(Gobierno de Aragon); European Social Fund through the research group CREVALOR; European Social Fund through the research group COMPETE,The author wishes to acknowledge the funding from Gobierno de Aragon and European Social Fund through the research group CREVALOR.; The author wishes to acknowledge the funding from Gobierno de Aragon and European Social Fund through the research group COMPETE.; The author wishes to acknowledge the funding from Gobierno de Aragon and European Social Fund through the research group COMPETE.,,36,2,2,1,7,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

A mesoscopic approach is first of all presented, in order to provide a simple but rather complete model. On this basis, a mathematical and deterministic evaluation formula is presented, as well as a simulation tool able to evaluate the effects of traffic perturbations. All the main parameters which characterise railway operations (with a special focus on single track infrastructure) are taken into consideration and their influence is pointed out, as regards the possibility to realise high frequency periodic timetables. The analysis is subsequently extended for assessing how these timetables can behave in case of traffic perturbations, in order to provide also in these circumstances a sufficient service quality. The influence of the abovementioned parameters on buffer times and hence on timetable stability and robustness is therefore outlined, highlighting the benefits that an effective rescheduling algorithm could play. The presented calculation method is then applied to a real case, i.e. to a part of the railway network of Piedmont, Italy. This case study provides some considerations about the elements that can actually play a determinant role and what measures can be planned for achieving certain service targets. Finally, conclusions are drawn together with some considerations for future work about the possible implementation of effective rescheduling logics within advanced driver advisory systems as well as modern signalling and control systems.

Because quality is nonverifiable and unobservable, investment can still produce low quality; in equilibrium, consumers impose relational sanctions when low quality is delivered. With sufficient relational sanctions, both types of firms produce the same expected quality. However, because the nondistribution constraint reduces the temptation to shirk from investment, the nonprofit firm is subject to shorter relational sanctions, which can make nonprofit status attractive even for the entrepreneur who cares only about the return obtained from the firm. Nonprofit status is preferred as the relationship between investment and quality gets weaker or as stronger market competition reduces the profit margin. The paper also shows how both types of firms can coexist in a market when the legal enforcement against nonprofit status weakens as the number of nonprofit firms increases.","[Choi, Albert H.] Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA",University of Virginia,"Choi, AH (通讯作者)，Univ Virginia, Charlottesville, VA 22903 USA.",,,,,,,,39,2,2,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

I discuss a model of entry thresholds in which market size is a function of both population and geographic space and evaluate implications of this model with a new data set of 127,000 restaurants across 726 cities. I find that geographic concentration of a population leads to a greater number of cuisines and the likelihood of having a specific cuisine is increasing in population and population density, with the rarest cuisines found only in the biggest, densest cities. Further, there is a strong hierarchical pattern to the distribution of variety across cities in which the specific cuisines available can be predicted by the total count. These findings parallel empirical work on Central Place Theory and provide evidence that demand aggregation has a significant impact on consumer product variety.","[Schiff, Nathan] Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Schiff, Nathan] Shanghai Univ Finance & Econ, Sch Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China",University of British Columbia; Shanghai University of Finance & Economics,"Schiff, N (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Sauder Sch Business, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada.",nschiff@gmail.com,,"Schiff, Nathan/0000-0002-7792-2682",,,,,37,62,79,9,54,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

However, estimating empirically that relationship is problematic given a standard endogeneity problem: if lawyers generate litigation, additional litigation attracts more lawyers. According to recent studies, Spain has more litigation and more lawyers per capita than most OECD countries. In this paper we test for the relationship between the number of lawyers and litigation in Spain by making use of instrumental variables, in the period 2001-2010. Specifically, we construct two groups of instrumental variables related to the number of law schools founded in Spain by 1968 and to the distance between the current provincial capitals to the historical capital of their university district (where it was possible to study law) in 1845. The results show that the number of lawyers has a positive effect on litigation. However, from our econometric analysis we do not find an obvious problem of simultaneity for the period considered.

However, there is limited research on R&D collaborations between SMEs and PRIs. This paper examines the role of communications on cooperative R&D between SMEs and PRIs in Korea based on a survey of 173 Korean SMEs. Empirical results show that contract clarity and communication intensity associated significantly with the outcome of cooperative R&D that positively reflected the high-context culture of Korea. Communication intensity showed a significant moderating effect on the relationship between power asymmetry and the performance of cooperative R&D. Communication intensity also exhibited a moderating effect between information asymmetry and the performance of cooperative R&D. Therefore, frequent and intensive communication activities between cooperative R&D partners can facilitate technological knowledge exchanges, such as complex and tacit knowledge, that can help overcome organisational conflict.","[Kim, Byung Keun] Korea Univ Technol & Educ, Sch Ind Management, Cheonan Si, Chungcheongnam, South Korea; [Park, Seong Keun] Policy Planning Agcy, Gyeongbuk TechnoPk, Gyongsan, Gyeongbuk Do, South Korea",Korea University of Technology & Education,"Park, SK (通讯作者)，Policy Planning Agcy, Gyeongbuk TechnoPk, Gyongsan, Gyeongbuk Do, South Korea.",park.songkun@gmail.com,,"Kim, Byung-Keun/0000-0002-6238-0569",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A5B8061859],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the Korean Government [grant number NRF-2014S1A5B8061859].,,47,6,7,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

This follows from recent developments in the theory of multinationals that lead firms are increasingly abandoning peripheral innovation activities that are characterised by low value added operations to focus on branding and associated R&D activities. Any such development will offer opportunities for contract manufacturers, both national and foreign owned, to upgrade and specialise in innovative activities related to manufacturing at distant host-sites as the brand holders at major markets will then specialise on product R&D and design, and branding activities. The results from tobit regressions show that contract firms show higher process technology and innovation capabilities (ICs) than integrated firms in the clothing industry. Hence, there is econometric evidence to support the argument that changes in manufacturing offers tangible opportunities for contract manufacturers in global value chains to upgrade into cutting-edge processes and techniques, and ICs.","[Rasiah, Rajah; Krishna, Vignes Gopal] Univ Malaya, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Ratnavelu, Kurunathan] Univ Malaya, Fac Sci, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Universiti Malaya; Universiti Malaya,"Rasiah, R (通讯作者)，Univ Malaya, Dept Dev Studies, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",rajah@um.edu.my,"Rasiah, Rajah/X-9122-2019; RASIAH, RAJAH/B-9552-2010; Ratnavelu, Kurunathan/A-5463-2009","RASIAH, RAJAH/0000-0002-6654-3011;",University of Malaya,University of Malaya(Universiti Malaya),We wish to thank the University of Malaya research grant for funding the purchase of the data.,,42,0,0,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1976-1597,2158-6721,,ASIAN J TECHNOL INNO,Asian J.

I investigate the determinants of these exclusive contracts and examine how such contracts affect the number of hamburger restaurants and their sales. I show that exclusive contracts are less likely to be adopted in larger malls, in malls that face more competition from other malls, and in malls that opened before 1993, when McDonald's and Burger King entered the Israeli market. I then use the mall's opening yearbefore or after 1993as an instrumental variable to estimate a negative effect of exclusive contracts on the number of restaurants and on total mall hamburger sales.

Using an experimental design, we find the increased salience resulting from modifying the presentation format improved participants' ability to locate important information (accessibility) and to evaluate the relative performance of funds (assessability).

However, mobility plans do not always target GHG reduction for political reasons and a lack of adequate methodologies. Practically, carbon emissions are often considered secondary to mobility planning, which can be addressed indirectly by introducing measures for other purposes, but whose GHG effects are not carefully quantified. This decision is relevant when austerity is called for, when the real costs of transport measures have to be clearly expressed for consistent allocation of scarce funds. In this paper, a method is proposed to include the economic impact of GHG emissions on a mobility plan through a monetization process. The unitary value of GHG emissions has been inferred through a meta-analysis of about 700 studies and a meta-regression function. The case study proposed illustrates the concrete application and the potential of such a method. Moreover, the importance of a long-term strategy in obtaining a consistent GHG reduction and of a congruent valuation strategy to appraise its impacts is confirmed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J,"O'Farrell, R",,,,"O'Farrell, Rory",,,Wages and Ireland's International Competitiveness,ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"At the beginning of the crisis in 2008 it was a widely reported view that Ireland had become uncompetitive, leading to calls for wage cuts. Since then wage rates in the private sector have been largely stable. However, Ireland has shown a strong improvement in exports despite a difficult international trading situation. This presents a puzzle. If wages in Ireland were uncompetitive, how could Ireland improve its export position so rapidly, without a general fall in wages? Ireland can best be described as having moved from a position of super-competitiveness to competitiveness. During the construction boom, exports remained an important driver of growth. Since 2008, the fall in nominal unit labour costs is entirely due to a move away from the labour intensive construction sector. However, while labour costs have been stagnant in Ireland, they have increased amongst our trading partners.","OECD, Paris, France",Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"O'Farrell, R (通讯作者)，OECD, Paris, France.",Rory.OFARRELL@oecd.org,,"O'Farrell, Rory/0000-0001-8873-011X",,,,,27,2,2,0,4,ECONOMIC & SOCIAL STUDIES,DUBLIN 2,"C/O ESRI, WHITAKER SQ, SIR JOHN ROGERSON'S QUAY, DUBLIN 2, 00000, IRELAND",0012-9984,,,ECON SOC REV,Econ.

First, the paper defines assumptions for the model construction from empirically observed processes. Then, the model is implemented in the real simulation environment. Finally, the ability of the model is checked to simulate empirically observed features, e.g. leptokurtic characteristics or skewness of the price distribution. Also, this paper newly defines and implements the resonance effect. FFT analysis is used to support oscillation processes. Finally, selected markets are provided with parameter optimisation of the model based on empirical observations. It was found that the model built under the previously mentioned assumptions was able to explain empirically observed effects that reversely support the correctness of those assumptions. The practical value of the constructed model can be found in many areas, including risk management and asset valuation.","[Stadnik, Bohumil] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Finance & Accounting, Prague 13067, Czech Republic; [Miecinskiene, Algita] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Prague University of Economics & Business; Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Miecinskiene, A (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Fac Business Management, Sauletekio Al 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",bohumil.stadnik@email.cz; algita.miecinskiene@vgtu.lt,,,Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic [VSE IP 100040],"Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic(Ministry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic)",The research was supported by the institutional grant VSE IP 100040 (Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic).,,42,8,8,0,7,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

By exploiting new data on quality of government, we assess how government quality and its components (control of corruption, rule of law, government effectiveness and government accountability) shape patenting across the regions of the European Union (EU). The results of the analysis-which are robust to controlling for the endogeneity of institutions-provide strong evidence of a link between the quality of government and the capacity of regions to innovate. In particular, ineffective and corrupt governments represent a fundamental barrier for the innovative capacity of the periphery of the EU, strongly undermining any potential effect of any other measures aimed at promoting greater innovation. The results have important implications for the definition of innovation strategies in EU regions.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres; Di Cataldo, Marco] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Di Cataldo, Marco/AAK-8373-2020","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Di Cataldo, Marco/0000-0002-2808-1776",European Research Council under the European Union [269869]; ESRC [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/H02123X/1] Funding Source: researchfish,European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),The European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP/2007-2013)/ERC (grant agreement no. 269869).,,79,225,234,13,205,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

Our database covers all software companies undertaking IPOs in these six countries between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2005, and includes data from various sources (the Bureau van Dijk Zephyr database, the Questel-Orbit QPAT patent database, financial documents available on the company websites and specialised websites). Survival analysis follows a semi-parametric approach, based on the stratified Cox competing risk model, controlling for other determinants of survival. We find that, after controlling for the firms' main entry characteristics (experience, size, sales, profitability and solvency, together with market conditions), the influence of the size and the quality of the firms' patent portfolios is different according to the type of exit and the type of software firm. In particular, the number of patents reduces the risk of failure and acquisition for software developers, while quality increases their attractiveness as an acquisition target.","Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Pessac, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Bordeaux,"Useche, D (通讯作者)，Univ Bordeaux, GREThA UMR CNRS 5113, Pessac, France.",diego.useche@u-bordeaux.fr,"Useche, Diego/Z-2724-2019; Useche, Diego/GQZ-8540-2022; Useche, Diego/GLS-8202-2022","Useche, Diego/0000-0002-0759-234X;",GREThA-CNRS Bordeaux,GREThA-CNRS Bordeaux,Financial support from GREThA-CNRS Bordeaux is gratefully acknowledged.,,74,4,5,3,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Using a simple evolutionary game approach, we fuse endogenously derived socio-economic system dynamics from Human Development (HD) Theory with Prisoner's Dilemma spatial intra-societal economic transactions. We then explore a new human development dynamics (HDD) model behavior via quasi-global simulation methods to explore technological progression on economic development, cultural plasticity, social and political change. Using network analysis, we then investigate the impact of technology proliferation on communications ease and the resulting compression of social space on individual wealth and political preference formation. As economic and social capital is created, past transaction histories tend to reinforce future success, and networks emerge and solidify at different rates depending on technology. Increasing social connectivity in small populations has an immediate and positive impact on wealth creation, yet those effects become negative as technology proliferates and population size increases. This suggests not only diminishing marginal returns to increasing communications' payoffs to individuals but moreover crowding out effects. We believe complex adaptive or evolutionary systems approaches are necessary to understand both near and potentially catastrophic, far-from-equilibrium behavior and societal outcomes across all human scales of modernization.","[Abdollahian, Mark; Yang, Zining; Neal, Patrick deWerk] Claremont Grad Univ, Sch Polit & Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Kaplan, James] Harvey Mudd Coll, Dept Comp Sci, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate School; Claremont Colleges; Harvey Mudd College,"Yang, ZN (通讯作者)，Claremont Grad Univ, Sch Polit & Econ, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",mark.abdollahian@cgu.edu; zining.yang@cgu.edu; patrick.neal@cgu.edu; jek@purelyfunctionalcapital.com,,,,,,,42,6,7,0,2,SPRINGER-VERLAG TOKYO,TOKYO,"37-3, HONGO 3-CHOME BONKYO-KU, TOKYO, 113, JAPAN",,,978-4-431-55236-9; 978-4-431-55235-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3,14,,10.1007/978-4-431-55236-9_1,0.0,,,12,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF3PA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380563900001,0

Literature analysis led to the formation of fixed income portfolio risk assessment model assumptions. It has been found that, although fixed income portfolio management is studied quite a lot in the academic literature, the risk assessment methodology is used to measure only the market risk without the credit risk separation. According to the characteristics of the selected methods, the risk assessment model consists of combining the VaR methodology, modified duration measure and the use of future contracts for portfolio hedging. In risk assessment model, the interest rate risk is converted in to the future contracts, and the risk assessment is made by portfolio open interest rate position. The back testing results of fixed income portfolio risk assessment model has shown that there were no deviations; or they did not exceed I percent of the permissible limit for more than one year.

When seniors see these elements in the process of buying new products, they present a less positive attitude toward innovation. These results imply the need to limit by marketers the seniors' perception of risk and novelty which seems to be critical to spread innovation more widely among 'old' consumers.

Negative developments after 2008 still verify the ability of monetary policy to mitigate its impacts. In EMU, it can be seen in the case of the effects of single monetary policy and the deepening of the asymmetries between member countries. This can be compared to the case of the monetary policy efficiency in small and open non-member country and its influence on macroeconomic developments. This paper is focused on the analysis of transmission process of monetary policy through the interest rate channel in EMU as well as in a non-member country, namely in Czech Republic. The aim of the analysis was to verify the similarity of reaction in case of monetary policy shock. The results for Czech Republic were compared to results for overall EMU. The focus was predominantly on interest rate channel of monetary transmission process and its impact on inflation, nominal effective exchange rate and gross domestic product, the variables that are typically used in central banks' monetary rules. We also assumed that negative developments related to the crisis can distort the transmission of monetary policy effects on macroeconomic variables and that the impact of monetary policy changes is transmitted to the economic variables only partially or significantly lagged. The effects of interest rate shocks on selected variables were identified by estimating VAR model that uses Cholesky decomposition of innovations; the most widely used empirical methodology for analysing the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. The results show that the reactions of the product and the price level to positive interest rate shock are very similar for Czech Republic as well as for EMU throughout the investigated period 1999-2013. However, we cannot definitively affirm that the crisis disrupted the transmission process from monetary measures to analysed macroeconomic variables as shown in the cases of Czech Republic and EMU. Interest rate channel has not shown particularly strong and stable influence on the observed variables neither for Czech Republic, nor for EMU.","[Bartokova, Ludmila; Durcova, Julia] Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Kosice, Slovakia",Technical University Kosice,"Bartóková, L (通讯作者)，Tech Univ Kosice, Fac Econ, Dept Econ Theories, Kosice, Slovakia.",ludmila.bartokova@tuke.sk; julia.durcova@tuke.sk,"Ďurčová, Júlia/AAH-4286-2019; Bartokova, Ludmila/AAA-7128-2020","Bartokova, Ludmila/0000-0001-8662-660X",project VEGA [1/0892/13],project VEGA(Vedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA)),This article was elaborated within the project VEGA no. 1/0892/13.,,35,2,2,2,16,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Enterprises strive to benefit from these incentives as they endeavour to innovate products and services with the aspiration to become the 'leading edge' within their respective industry. To meet the demands and challenges of a global market, many multinationals have established Research and Development centres throughout their territory. This specific part of the enterprise copes not only with several knowledge-related issues but also the risks that stem from a diversity of cultural dimensions; let alone the impact of virtual teams. In many cases, these issues are unique and depend largely on the nature and context of the business.

A differential gravity model of bilateral trade flows was developed and estimated with panel data for the bilateral trade between 12 euro countries from 1988 to 2013, for commodity groups HS44 (wood and articles of wood), HS47 (pulp of wood, fibrous cellulosic material, waste, etc.), HS48 (paper and paperboard), and their sum. The parameters were estimated by ordinary least squares and fixed-effects methods. The results showed a positive or neutral effect of the euro on trade, for all products and countries, with both estimation methods. According to the most general result, the introduction of the euro had increased the average annual rate of growth of the bilateral trade of forest products by 6.5 +/- 1.3% from 2002 to 2013.

In this sense, a neglected research topic is understanding what users say during an IT adoption process. To contribute to this issue, we analyzed the discourses of three Chilean lecturers of first-year engineering courses during a training session of an online quiz system. Methodologically, we used discourse analysis to understand and classify the rhetoric of the users. The findings show some meaningful differences between the speech of users who adopted the system, and the user who did not. The first two users expressed themselves in the first person singular, showing commitment and assertiveness. The other lecturer used neutral and passive statements and was lacking in commitment. His communication was based on asymmetrical and intimidating power relationships. These findings show that understanding the differences in rhetoric between users could help to predict their willingness to either use IT or not. The present paper contributes by giving an answer to prominent scholars, who claim that new methodological perspectives are needed to understand better why users adopt or reject a new system. We would strongly encourage researchers and practitioners to analyze what the users say during an IT adoption process.","[Cataldo, Alejandro; Alvear, Sandra; Vargas, Hector] Univ Talca, Talca, Chile; [Munoz, Natalia] Univ Atacama, Copiapo, Chile",Universidad de Talca; Universidad de Atacama,"Cataldo, A (通讯作者)，Univ Talca, Talca, Chile.",acataldo@utalca.cl; salvear@utalca.cl; hvargas@utalca.cl; natalia.munoz@alumnos.uda.cl,"Cataldo, Alejandro/AAN-9868-2020","Cataldo, Alejandro/0000-0002-8183-591X; Alvear Vega, Sandra Jacquelinne/0000-0002-2249-0720",,,,,31,0,0,0,2,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,974,986,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700094,0

The research of prices has been undertaken for seven groups of organic food: Legumes, cereals, dairy products, meat, eggs, beverages, sweet and sweeteners and vegetables. The price of more than 80% of sorts of organic food and of almost 75% of items included in the research exceeded the level that is acceptable for most respondents.

This paper provides debt sustainability analyses for the Czech Republic and Slovakia by estimating their public debt to GDP, and primary balance to GDP ratios up until 2022 under three different projections. The first, labelled the baseline projection, predicts their debt ratios to 2022, if neither their public debt to GDP ratios nor their primary balance to GDP ratios change. This projection uses the official forecasts of the key variables. The second projection answers the question of how much the two counties have to consolidate, measured by their primary balance to GDP ratios, if they want to hold their public debt to GDP ratios at their current levels. The third projection answers the question of how much the countries have to consolidate if they aim to reattain their December 2008 pre-crisis public debt to GDP ratios. All three projections are made for the same five scenarios, which cover a status quo case, where official forecasts are realized, and both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for growth and consolidation outcomes. The paper's novelty lies in its development of an existing non-parametric methodology to encompass iterative numerical solution methods to assess public debt sustainability. This allows a richer set of results to be obtained, for example estimates for the required level of the public debt to GDP ratio, and the primary balance to GDP ratio, taking account of variables such as nominal interest rates, yields to maturity on public debt, inflation rates and average maturities of debt.","[Lawson, Colin William] Univ Bath, Dept Econ, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,,vlastimil.farkasovsky@umb.sk; hsscwl@bath.ac.uk; emilia.zimkova@umb.sk,"Zimková, Emília/ABA-2577-2022","Zimková, Emília/0000-0003-1648-8103",Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica [ITMS 26110230082]; European Social Fund [018/2012/1.2/OPV],Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica; European Social Fund(European Social Fund (ESF)),"The paper was prepared as a partial fulfilment of the Operational Program Education project ITMS 26110230082 Mobility - Support of Science, Research and Education at Matej Bel University in Banska Bystrica (Mobility - podpora vedy, vyskumu a vzdelavania na UMB) co-financed by the European Social Fund within the bounds of financial subsidy contract No. 018/2012/1.2/OPV.",,17,2,2,1,19,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

The respondents answered questions about their employers and the IT projects they work on and assessed the utility of main courses for their professional career. The Exploratory Factor Analysis suggested that there exist two latent factors related to the course utility, and these factors were compared to the popular IT skills classifications in IS literature. Based on the factor loadings, two scores were computed for each observation and compared at the sample level. The results suggested a higher ranking of technical content in IS curricula, which is different to what has been generally emphasized in western IS programmes curricula.","[Fotache, Marin; Dumitriu, Florin; Greavu-Serban, Valerica] Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Iasi 700505, Romania",Alexandru Ioan Cuza University,"Fotache, M (通讯作者)，Alexandru Ioan Cuza Univ, Fac Econ & Business Adm, B Dul Carol 1 22, Iasi 700505, Romania.",fotache@uaic.ro; fdumi@uaic.ro; valy.greavu@feaa.uaic.ro,"Dumitriu, Florin/AAF-8268-2021; Fotache, Marin/E-1439-2018; Greavu-Serban, Valerica/A-5633-2013","Greavu-Serban, Valerica/0000-0003-2619-4598",,,,,53,1,1,0,209,VILNIUS UNIV,VILNIUS,"UNIVERSITETO ST 3, VILNIUS, LT-01513, LITHUANIA",1648-4460,,,TRANSFORM BUS ECON,Transform.

A referential mechanical testing machine will be placed into this place in the near future. Two methods are discussed: use of a model in augmented reality (AR) and placing a CAD model in a laser scanned point cloud. The advantages, disadvantages, effects and problems of these two solutions are described and compared in this paper. The augmented reality method uses a Vuzix STAR 1200XLD glasses with transparent head-mounted display (HMD). The machine is projected into the user's field of view in the actual factory hall. The point cloud method involves laser scanning the hall first, then placing a CAD model into the point cloud.

We enrich research by collecting and analyzing FDI motivation data at the firm-level for a very important but less researched developing country: Turkey. Content analysis of text material on the foreign investments made by 211 Turkish firms reveals that Turkish firms primarily perform FDI in European developed countries for reasons other than conventional, namely, market- and strategic-asset-seeking motivations. More importantly, Turkish firms seem to be using the European countries to (1) present themselves as a European Union company, (2) make use of special features of these countries to expand their businesses within and to other countries and, (3) make use of the favorable tax treatment policies available to foreign investors. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that in spite of its small size, the Netherlands is a preferred destination for Turkish FDI over other Western European countries due to its strategic location and favorable investment policies.","[Gubbi, Sathyajit R.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Int Business, Groningen, Netherlands; [Sular, Sinan A.] Univ Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen,"Gubbi, SR (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, Int Business, Groningen, Netherlands.",,"Gubbi, Sathyajit/JVY-8381-2024",,,,,,66,1,1,1,3,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,BINGLEY,"HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY, W YORKSHIRE BD16 1WA, ENGLAND",,,978-1-78441-739-0; 978-1-78441-740-6,,,,2015,,,,,,,441,470,,10.1108/S1571-502720150000028019,0.0,,,30,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF2QT,,Green Published,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380491300018,0

The study relies on qualitative methodology, i.e. its findings are based on 16 in-depth interviews with experts in the field of private label management. In order to achieve dual perspective experts were representatives from retailer and manufacturer companies. The research findings support the assumption that general principles of the PLC concept are implemented in the private label management. The main contribution stems from the finding that developing market follows the same private label development principles like developed markets in the growth stage of the PLC. The findings can help managers from developing markets to understand how to successfully manage private labels by focusing on their quality and promotion and how to use private labels to achieve higher level of consumers' satisfaction.","[Horvat, Sandra; Ozretic-Dosen, Durdana] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia",University of Zagreb,"Horvat, S (通讯作者)，Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb, Croatia.",shorvat@efzg.hr; dozretic@efzg.hr,"Horvat, Sandra/I-2130-2018",,,,,,23,1,1,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-20182-5; 978-3-319-20181-8,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,53,62,,10.1007/978-3-319-20182-5_6,0.0,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF1YX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380446600006,0

The new economic and political climate has affected all major processes within the supply chain leading to high risks such as supply crises - paused or stopped production caused by delayed, incomplete or incorrect deliveries. These new risks led to focusing on supplier care and changes in the way companies interact with their suppliers but also called for understanding the important role of supply chain risk management. Risk management is a proactive process and can be applied both vertically (hierarchically) and horizontally for each process of the supply chain. Supplier invoice management is one of the top impacting processes affecting business with suppliers. In case invoices or merchandise do not correspond with the demand, the companies' electronic management systems prevent supplier invoices from payment leading to supplier dissatisfaction.

Under this concept, increased quality positively influences customer satisfaction, which in turn leads to better financial results through increased customer loyalty. We demonstrated that there are significant differences among the three size classes of car servicing companies. At the same average level of customer satisfaction, there is a strong negative dependence between increases of customer satisfaction and financial results for the small-sized car servicing companies, and a positive dependence between those two for the medium-sized and large-sized car servicing companies, which is moderate for the former and very strong for the latter, It seems that the relationship between the overall customer satisfaction and financial results is largely dependent on the level of competition in the local environment. Bigger car servicing companies are usually located in cities, where there are often other authorised same brand car servicing companies. Hence, it is not that difficult for customers to switch to a different car servicing company if they become dissatisfied with the services. In those circumstances it makes sense to invest more into high customer satisfaction, because it leads to high customer loyalty. Loyal customers are namely less likely to change a car servicing company and are less susceptible to higher hourly rates. The results also suggest that a certain optimal level of customer satisfaction exists and whe n this level of satisfaction is surpassed, the financial results actually do not improve any more. Moreover, they usually deteriorate.","[Novak, Ales; Sparl, Petra; Azman, Slavko] Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia",University of Maribor,"Novak, A (通讯作者)，Univ Maribor, Fac Org Sci, Maribor, Slovenia.",ales.novak@fov.uni-mb.si; petra.sparl@fov.uni-mb.si; slavko.azman@porsche.si,"Ažman, Slavko/AAV-9088-2020",,,,,,45,1,1,0,28,TECHNICAL UNIV LIBEREC,LIBEREC 1,"FAC ECONOMICS, STUDENTSKA 2, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,2336-5064,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

There is lower purchasing power from the net average wage in the Czech Republic than in the OECD countries of Mexico, Hungary, Slovak Republic, Turkey and Poland. The importance of the contribution of this paper is to assess interrelationships of the minimum wage, average net wage and labor productivity in the Czech Republic versus the European comparison. 112, To complete this paper there have been used methods of analysis, comparison, induction and deduction. Data sources include the Czech Statistical Office, the European Statistical Office, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of the Czech Republic and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The comparison of OECD countries concerning the level of average net wages and data on labor productivity in terms of GDP per hour and per person revealed differences, in average annual net wage expressed in purchasing power parity in OECD countries, with the Czech Republic adjacent match about differences in labor productivity in terms of GDP per hour and per person in USD. The theory that the differences in average net annual wage expressed in purchasing power parity matches the level of labour productivity per hour and person (also expressed in purchasing power parity) is not true. For example, in the case of Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway or Switzerland. These countries have much higher minimum wage levels, both when comparing absolute values, and when expressed in purchasing power parity. A higher minimum wage leads to an increase in other wage levels, which affects the amount of the average gross wage. Higher wages bring higher levies on premiums and taxes. Raising the minimum wage can be seen as a way of fostering economic growth and the path to raising living standards.","[Pernica, Martin] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Finance, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Brno University of Technology,"Pernica, M (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, Inst Finance, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",pernica@fbm.vutbr.cz; f.janac@seznam.cz,,,,,,,16,1,1,0,5,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,1221,1230,,,,,,10,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700120,0

Linear regression model analyzes was run to test the relationships between variables. Though evaluations of selected obstacles differ among Eastern EU member states, none statistically significant relationships were observed and thus none regression models, explaining impacts of selected external factors on firms' competitiveness were built. It is concluded that either governmental regulations related factors do not influence firms' competitiveness or firms' representatives do not associate performance with the analyzed external country-specific factors. That the competitive advantages of manufacturing firms in Eastern EU countries may be based on firm specific advantages. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Reports and statistical reviews were examined in order to determine the tendency of development of agriculture in Kazakhstan. Evaluation of the current level of technological development in crop production and animal husbandry shows that agricultural innovations in Kazakhstan are not developed enough. Government and public authorities are well aware of the need for innovative agricultural development, and take the necessary programs and measures. Despite this, researchers have identified problems in this sphere and proposed their solutions. The transition to sustainable economic growth in the agricultural sector of the country is impossible without promoting the use of science and technology, the introduction of high technology, activation of all economic entities of scientific and technical sphere of agriculture.

Lithuanian dairy market is highly concentrated with powerful companies, which are able to compete and increase the volume of export in foreign markets. Currently, the political tension restricts the global trade including and Lithuanian export in Ukraine and in the Middle East The development of Ukrainian conflict is very dynamic and may affect Lithuanian export supply and demand in different channels. Widely discussed additional restriction on trade between Russia and the EU will have both direct and indirect effects on the development of Lithuanian exports. This article aims to analyse and evaluate how will change milk processors companies indicators of final performance while changing the structure of export and direction from East to West and / or refuses the export to East. Such econometric methods as correlation regression analysis and lag - analysis method allow to determine the relationship and format between the final performance indicators and export volume and direction of current company. It was found that there is a strong link between export, directions of the export and companies income. The results of this analysis show that Lithuanian milk processors income will change while changing the structure and direction of export This article reveals what kind of loss companies will suffer while reorientating the export from East to West and how long it takes to smooth the income.

The Slovak Republic is one of the transition countries, which since 1989 has transferred to a market economy and, in this context, it was necessary to build a new system of economic instruments and legislative changes and thus create conditions for the development activities as well as the entry of foreign investors. Solutions that are represented by unilateral interests of developers and investors due to improper implementation of development projects on green meadows by grabbing quality agricultural land may have a negative impact on the development of the area. On the other hand, they are marked by efforts trying to catch up with development and join the latest trends with all the associated risks. Mostly imported models are implanted into our country with its distinctive historical development and economic, social and cultural context.

The dynamic model with movement of stocks absolutely determined is part of the theory of stocks. This software is developed by using Microsoft Excel 2013 and the programming language Visual Basic for Application (VBA). The main goal is to create a simple, user-friendly interface designed to calculate the optimum amount of delivery of some goods, the duration of the delivery cycle and the number of deliveries and total costs per year. The contribution of this article is based on the assumption that small and medium sized enterprises do not use complicated IT systems, but mainly use Microsoft Excel to cater for their needs. The result of the article is the developed application. The main contribution is the application which allows for the calculation of the aforementioned variables in a short-term period. The created application is also designed for educational purposes (e.g. aimed to assist university students in absorbing the practical implementation of the dynamic model with movement of stocks absolutely determined).

They pose great risks to human life and structures that get in their way. Hillside developments in landslide-prone areas are particularly vulnerable to these damaging forces. Although the landslide damage is potentially disastrous, there are no published studies that document its effects on property values. This paper examines the impact of 2 major landslides in 2002 and 2008 on residential property values in the affected area, Bukit Antarabangsa. Transaction price trends of condominiums and terraced houses were analyzed from 2000 - 2009 and compared to the Malaysian House Price Index and Kuala Lumpur House Price Index on an annual return, risk and risk-adjusted basis.Despite both landslides, the average returns of BA terraced houses exceeded both indices while condominium returns were slightly higher than the said indices. The annual risks of both types of properties were much higher, reflecting the risk from landslides. On a risk-adjusted basis, terraced houses in BA exceeded both indices while BA condominiums fared better than KLHPI but lower than NHPI. Property returns in BA were also affected by nearby landslide in 2006. Property prices in BA recovered very quickly, indicating that the recurrent landslides had only a temporary effect on property prices. The quick recovery and persistence of superior performance in BA properties indicate other positive factors that overwhelm the negative effects of landslides. This could possibly be attributed to the attractive hillside topography in BA, its comparatively lower property prices despite its close proximity to Kuala Lumpur city centre.","[Yee, Tan Zao; Lee, Janice Y.

Two hypotheses focused on both knowledge about and application of system archetypes are tested. The results prove that there are inconsistencies tied to forms of system archetypes insight and knowledge. Moreover, there is an inadequate level of attention identified in investigated organisations. Results imply various potential research pathways that are outlined in the final section of the paper.

As a consequence, the management of such forests should be based on a joint management of all their different uneven-aged stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of uneven-aged forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of uneven-aged stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of uneven-aged forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint uneven-aged forest management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent uneven-aged forest management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint uneven-aged forest management model. Second, we find that the independent uneven-aged forest management model poorly approximates the optimal multi-stand harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.

In particular, our contribution to the literature is in the comparison between regular and low-cost airline companies. We run a set of fixed-effect regressions where the dependent variable, the stock daily return of the airline company (observed between 2008 and 2014) is regressed over three sets of explanatory variables (financial, company-specific and time variables). While large and small companies provide similar results, we find that the company price return - among different variables - correlates only with the jet fuel return and the stock market return. Our work also suggests that there is a difference between regular and low-cost companies. We speculate that this possibly arises because low-cost companies stock-pile in a more efficient way, which depends less on current jet fuel price. Our evidence then sheds light on the efficiency of the low-cost model and may suggest to export part of its practice among regular airline companies.","[Gaudenzi, Barbara] Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Cantarane,24, I-37129 Verona, Italy; [Bucciol, Alessandro] Univ Verona, Dept Econ, Via Cantarane,24, I-37129 Verona, Italy",University of Verona; University of Verona,"Gaudenzi, B (通讯作者)，Univ Verona, Dept Business Adm, Via Cantarane,24, I-37129 Verona, Italy.",barbara.gaudenzi@univr.it; alessandro.bucciol@univr.it,,"Bucciol, Alessandro/0000-0001-8163-7617",,,,,39,4,4,2,17,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Relatively little attention has been paid to the effects of the competitive environment on the quantity, quality and customer focus of the services provided and on the resultant patronage impacts. This paper contributes to addressing this knowledge gap, focussing on assessment of the service and demand-side effects of introducing competitive tendering for bus services in two Australian metropolitan areas - Adelaide and Perth. In both areas, a government monopoly operator was replaced (in the late 1990s) by competitively-tendered gross cost (area) contracts with operator incentives to enhance service quality and increase patronage. The following aspects of experience with these contracts are addressed: Contract design aspects, focussing on performance standards and operator incentives, and their effectiveness in influencing the quantity, quality and customer focus of the services provided, leading to increases in patronage. Roles and responsibilities of the public authorities and operators relating to these aspects. Views of operators and authorities on the effectiveness of the contract incentives in 'driving' service enhancements and patronage increases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering industry and home country peers, the analysis suggests that positive effects dominate for manufacturing firms whereas service firms are negatively affected.

This novel innovation system has a distinct set of context specific actors and intra- and inter-firm structures that have aided the technology innovations and the development of new business models. This paper employs a case study method and uses qualitative data to explore how innovations emerge in new mobile technologies and the innovation system that supports their emergence. It examines the Shanzhai mobile phone industry as a case and provides a first attempt to map the innovation system that has developed. The results suggest that the distinctive characteristics of the Chinese innovation system contribute to the innovations around the product and the production processes.

The Goldilocks principle' of optimal distance in innovation networks postulates that the best firm-level innovation results are achieved when the partners involved in the network are located at the right' distance, i.e. not too close and not too far' from one another, across non-geographical proximity dimensions. This principle is tested on a survey of 542 Norwegian firms conducted in 2013, containing information about firm-level innovation activities and key innovation partners. The results of the ordinal logit regression analysis substantiate the Goldilocks principle, as the most innovative firms are found among those that collaborate with partners at medium levels of proximity for all non-geographical dimensions. The analysis also underscores the importance of the presence of a substitution-innovation mechanism, with geographical distance problems being compensated by proximity in other dimensions as a driver of innovation, while there is no support for a potential overlap-innovation mechanism.","[Fitjar, Rune Dahl] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway; [Huber, Franz] Univ Seeburg Castle, Dept Innovat Management, Seekirchen Am Wallersee, Austria; [Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Geog & Environm, London, England",Universitetet i Stavanger; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Fitjar, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, Stavanger, Norway.",rune.d.fitjar@uis.no,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008; Fitjar, Rune Dahl/C-2580-2013","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856; Fitjar, Rune Dahl/0000-0001-5333-2701",Norwegian Research Council under the programmes Demosreg [209761]; VRI [233737]; European Research Council [269868]; European Research Council (ERC) [269868] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),Norwegian Research Council under the programmes Demosreg(Research Council of Norway); VRI; European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"The research for this paper was benefited from the generous funding of the Norwegian Research Council under the programmes Demosreg (grant no. 209761) and VRI (grant no. 233737), and from the European Research Council (grant no. 269868).

It provides them with flexibility to change the outcome of a deductive legal decision if they regard it as absurd. The principle of good faith thus empowers the judiciary to deviate. It can be used for an indefinite number of cases and might lead to almost all conceivable legal consequences. For instance, the judge can invalidate the contract, change the price, suspend or change a clause in the contract, or grant injunctive relief, compensation of damages, the disgorgement of profits or a removal claim. We argue that if the principle of good faith is used to develop contract law into an instrument for redistributing wealth in favor of poor parties, this can destroy the concept of contract as a social mechanism for generating mutual gains for parties, which might lead to unwanted economic consequences in terms of efficiency losses. We argue that the principle of good faith must be carefully and reluctantly used to reconstruct the fully specified contract and that well-informed judges, who understand the factual environment of a contract well should ask how fair bur self-interested parties would have allocated the risk in a pre-contractual situation. If the courts restrict the application of the good faith principle to these functions, this provides elasticity that otherwise would not exist if courts would strictly use the rules laid down in black letter law. Moreover, it saves transactions costs and is therefore in line with economic reasoning. We look at the most important Turkish cases and find that the Turkish Supreme Court following Continental European doctrines of good faith actually uses this principle to curb opportunistic behavior of parties and not to achieve redistribution from the rich to the poor by way of interfering into contract law.","[Schaefer, Hans-Bernd] Bucerius Law Sch, Hamburg, Germany; [Aksoy, Huseyin Can] Bilkent Univ, Fac Law, Ankara, Turkey",Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University,"Aksoy, HC (通讯作者)，Bilkent Univ, Fac Law, Ankara, Turkey.",hans-bernd.schaefer@law-school.de; hcaksoy@bilkent.edu.tr,"Aksoy, Hüseyin Can/V-7785-2019","Aksoy, Hüseyin Can/0000-0002-9243-189X",,,,,56,0,0,1,16,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

Currently, innovation is a source of competitive advantage for firms and interest in identifying its driving forces has increased from the perspective of industrial clusters. In this paper, we explore the innovation process of industrial cluster towards innovative clusters in developing countries. Based on prior studies, we developed a driving forces model incorporating three main factors - cluster resources, cluster networks, and cluster environment - to simulate and analyse industrial cluster innovation using the Cellular Automata method. Our findings validate the positive relationships between our three factors and industrial cluster innovation. These findings reveal that firms with more resources, higher knowledge sharing, and better networking accelerate their innovation process more effectively.

This study analyses this phenomenon from a geographic perspective. In contrast to the prevalent use of electoral volatility, as a method for comparison of national political systems, the differences within a single national context are examined. Electoral volatility in seven national elections (1994-2012) is calculated at the municipal level. The resulting geographical pattern is mapped, analysed, and explained through the use of (geo-) statistical methods. Significant differences are identified within the country, with particular concentration of high volatility in the south of the country, and low volatility in the north. The results of the research demonstrate the relevance of geography in explaining political behaviour as well as improving the understanding of recent Dutch electoral volatility. Furthermore, the national-scale focus of electoral volatility research is critiqued.","[Van Laake, Thomas] Univ Utrecht, Fac Geosci, Heidelberglaan 2, NL-3584 CS Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"Van Laake, T (通讯作者)，Blekerstr 51, NL-7513 DR Enschede, Netherlands.",thomas.vlaake@gmail.com,,"van Laake, Thomas/0000-0002-9884-277X",,,,,27,0,0,0,13,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0040-747X,1467-9663,,TIJDSCHR ECON SOC GE,Tijdschr.

Yet little research analyzes how urban spatial structure evolves under this system. We develop a model to examine how urban residents' collective decisions on annexations and property taxes and their interactions with agricultural landowners affect municipal structure under popular determination. We find that the evolution process of an urban area can be divided into four stages similar to human life stages (infancy, juvenile, adulthood and maturity), characterized by the pace of development. The key parameters that determine urban spatial structure include agricultural rents, construction costs, interest rate, and the rate and uncertainty of income growth. Cities tend to be more spread-out and consist of a large number of smaller municipalities, in regions with lower agricultural land rents, lower construction costs, and lower rate and uncertainty of income growth.","[Wu, JunJie; Chen, Yong] Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 307C Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA; [Wu, JunJie] Resources Future Inc, Washington, DC 20036 USA",Oregon State University; Resources for the Future,"Wu, JJ (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, 307C Ballard Extens Hall, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",junjie.wu@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,,18,4,4,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1468-2702,1468-2710,,J ECON GEOGR,J.

On the basis of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm and a kernel density estimator method, this paper presents a general framework for the probabilistic forecasting of renewable energy generation, especially for wind power generation. It is a direct and non-parametric approach. Firstly, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm is used to find the k closest historical examples with characteristics similar to the future weather condition of wind power generation. Secondly, a novel kernel density estimator based on a logarithmic transformation and a boundary kernel is used to construct wind power predictive density based on the k closest historical examples. The effectiveness of this approach has been confirmed on the real data provided for GEFCom2014. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach can provide good quality, reliable probabilistic wind power forecasts. (C) 2015 International Institute of Forecasters.

This study focuses on perceptions of Danish practitioners in policy-making organizations regarding the perceived challenges, opportunities and policy initiatives for the majority-market adoption of electric commercial vehicles (ECVs) in commercial sector in Denmark. We propose a new four-step expert-based technique, named COPE-SMARTER, for evaluating the market diffusion of environmental friendly technologies by combining SWOT analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) techniques. We focus on the perceptions regarding: (i) the potential promotional strength of motivators for ECV market penetration, (ii) the severity of the technological, financial, physical and operational challenges, (iii) the efficiency of policy initiatives in encouraging the market diffusion of ECVs, (iv) the expected market penetration rates for ECVs by target year. The results show the strength of the COPE-SMARTER approach in generating a clear, coherent, and tractable evaluation. Severe challenges are financial, operational and technological, with high purchase prices being by far the most severe. The opportunities are financial and environmental, with overall savings in the long-term as the opportunity with the highest promotional strength. Effective policy initiatives are low registration fee for ECVs, state subsidies for the purchase or use of ECVs, and emission-based taxes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

When the insured has negligently misrepresented a fact prior to contracting, common law allows the insurer to rescind the contract if the misrepresentation was material, while civil law countries apply more lenient rules. The article compares the efficiency of the common and the civil law rules in an adverse selection model in which the insurer separates types of risk not only through a deductible but also by requiring the insured to represent their type. A strict rule of misrepresentation increases the incentive for policyholders to represent truthfully but also exposes them to risk when they may misrepresent by mistake. While the economic literature has tended to defend the strict common law rule, because it makes it easier for the insurer to separate types, the present article demonstrates that the more lenient civil law rules may be more efficient, especially when the cost for the insurer of auditing types is low.

We propose to empirically compare the efficiency of a hierarchical cluster analysis and a fuzzy clustering in reducing discrete skill data. The outcomes of both methods are subsequently used to measure the impact of skills on earnings in addition to human capital. The proposed methodological comparison was made using an original dataset of retail bankers' skills assessed by supervisors. Empirical evidence shows that the fuzzy approach is more efficient than the hierarchical clustering: the resulting clusters are fewer and easier to interpret. Furthermore, the earnings equation enriched with skill variables allowed us to correct the education premium, and provides information on monetary incentives related to individual skills.

The decision rule used for group decision making within TEBA is the individual non-compensatory model of choice elimination by aspects (EBA). TEBA is designed to bring out the decision rule employed by decision makers when ranking the options presented, incorporate various criteria types and ease communication of relevant information related to options and criteria for multiple stakeholder groups. It is a platform for democratizing the decision making process. The TEBA framework was tested using a case study investigating alternative land connections between Beirut and Damascus. Key results showed that (1) stakeholders have employed EBA in making decisions, (2) a defined group of decision makers will rank options differently when provided with modified sets of criteria, (3) the public sector and general public groups ranked Impact on Employment among the top criteria, (4) the most important criterion per group from EBA was as expected; (5) the EBA analysis suggested that only 3-4 criteria are significant in reaching a decision; (6) aggregation of user assigned weights masked relative importance of criteria in some cases; and (7) analysis of user assigned weights and Minimum Threshold (MT) values suggest higher risk perception with increased criterion importance. Policy implications include recommendation to reach out to stakeholders for input on decisions, including the people but refrain from relying on criteria weights assigned by experts and reduce the experts' role in decision making. Also, it is recommended to model the decision making in a probabilistic framework rather than a deterministic one score approach, seek to identify a consensus ranking, place particular attention on determining the values of the criteria that emerged as top at the evaluation stage and continue to emphasize risk measures.

Using panel data (pre- and post-refugee inflow), we estimate the labour market consequences of hosting those refugees. Results are consistent with immigration affecting the allocation of natives across economic activities. Greater exposure to the refugee shock resulted in Tanzanians having a higher likelihood of working in household shambas or caring for household livestock and a lower likelihood of working outside the household as employees. The latter effect was particularly strong for Tanzanians doing casual work before the shock. This coincides with anecdotal evidence of refugees concentrating in casual waged work in Tanzania and competing directly with Tanzanians for those jobs.","[Ruiz, Isabel] Univ Oxford, Harris Manchester Coll, Econ, Oxford OX2 6QS, England; [Vargas-Silva, Carlos] Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc, 58 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Vargas-Silva, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Ctr Migrat Policy & Soc, 58 Banbury Rd, Oxford OX2 6QS, England.",carlos.vargas-silva@compas.ox.ac.uk,"Ruiz, Isabel/ACI-7611-2022; Ruiz, Isabel/AAG-4308-2022",,UK Department for International Development (DFID); Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA),UK Department for International Development (DFID); Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA),This document is an output from a project funded by the UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) for the benefit of developing countries.

While the modern economies are associated with the proliferation of regulatory laws which are rooted in the national economic and social policies, the loosening of the national borders and globalisation has led to conflicts of economic regulations. Such developments have posed various risks of violations of national economic regulations by the economic actors and could lead to tension among national states which have jurisdiction over multinational enterprises in one way or another. The private parties involved in such a situation could somehow avoid such risks by their own initiatives and contractual arrangements but in most cases such measures do now work and the conflict has to be resolved through the cooperation between the countries involved. The paper investigates the potentials for public international law to come up with rules, principles and norms to resolve such complex disputes which touch up issues such as non-intervention, equality of sovereign states, state immunity, self-determination and other principles of international law. Unlike certain area of international law such as law of sea where a few factors involved and the disputes could be resolved by relying on simple facts and rules, the application of national economic regulations extraterritorially creates tensions among the nation states in respect of the demarcation of national jurisdictions. It is here that public international faces a new challenges and need to come up with new approaches such a balancing of interests of the states involved in the conflicts.","[Bagheri, Mahmood] Univ Tehran, Fac Law & Polit Sci, Tehran, Iran; [Bagheri, Mahmood] Univ London, Inst Adv Legal Studies, London, England; [Jahromi, Mohammad Jafar Ghanbari] Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Law, Tehran, Iran",University of Tehran; University of London; Shahid Beheshti University Medical Sciences,"Jahromi, MJG (通讯作者)，Shahid Beheshti Univ Med Sci, Fac Law, Tehran, Iran.",mahbagheri@ut.ac.ir; m-ghanbari@sbu.ac.ir,,,,,,,201,0,1,1,32,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0929-1261,1572-9990,,EUR J LAW ECON,Eur.

This paper builds on earlier literature via a structured value assessment of the data provided by Google Trends. This is done through two empirical exercises related to the forecasting of changes in UK unemployment. Firstly, economic intuition provides the basis for search term selection, with a resulting Google indicator tested alongside survey-based variables in a traditional forecasting environment. Secondly, this environment is expanded into a pseudo-time nowcasting framework which provides the backdrop for assessing the timing advantage that Google data have over surveys. The framework is underpinned by a MIDAS regression which allows, for the first time, the easy incorporation of Internet search data at its true sampling rate into a nowcast model for predicting unemployment.

How should administrative agencies choose among these policymaking strategies? I develop a model which captures the idea that rules are inherently incomplete, and focuses on the strategic interaction between agencies and firms. Unlike rulemaking, adjudication allows for a policy that is narrowly tailored to firms' circumstances. However, since adjudication takes place after firms have already acted, two time-inconsistency problems arise: the hold-up and the leniency problems. Advance ruling eliminates the hold-up problem, but not the leniency one. Licensing eliminates both problems, but only by requiring socially costly licenses even in cases where neither problem arises. Agencies' choice of policymaking strategy depends on firm heterogeneity and the social cost of preapproval procedures.","[Givati, Yehonatan] Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Law, Jerusalem, Israel",Hebrew University of Jerusalem,"Givati, Y (通讯作者)，Hebrew Univ Jerusalem, Sch Law, Jerusalem, Israel.",givati@huji.ac.il,,,I-CORE program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation [1821/12],I-CORE program of the Planning and Budgeting Committee; Israel Science Foundation(Israel Science Foundation),"I am grateful to the editor, Abraham Wickelgren, and two anonymous referees for helpful comments.

We choose model parameters to fit San Francisco as a test city and simulate different scenarios. The results provide insight on potential changes to the San Francisco EV ecosystem as a result of changes in rebates, availability of workplace charging, public awareness of lower EV operational costs, and denser EV batteries.

This includes the strategic capacity of stakeholders to couple not only locally available assets with the needs of global flows, but also to provide meaning through the constitution of symbols, frames and discourses. We propose the application of a relational perspective to port regionalisation, which allows us to analyse how various actors engage strategically in actor-networks and coalitions across scales to stimulate growth based on logistics.

Firstly, the article discusses that SMEs are more successful tool to accelerate job creation process and to distribute economic resources efficiently. SMEs' flexibility is also mentioned as a key characteristic that allows them to adapt quickly to the changes in market and institutional conditions. Then, we stress on the SMEs capability to deepen the technological diffusion, which can be crucial for developing countries' economic prosperity. It is also shown that, competitive markets, as an essential determinant of sustainable economy, can be achieved only by the high presence of SMEs. And this competition can bring the innovative production and management strategies and cost-efficiency to the economies of developing countries. Finally, the paper introduces the necessary policy steps that governments of developing countries must follow to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the SMEs and to create a satisfactory business environment for them.","[Abbasov, Ahliman; Alizada, Tahmasib] Azerbaijan State Univ Econ UNEC, Baku, Azerbaijan",Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan Republic; Azerbaijan State University of Economics (UNEC),"Abbasov, A (通讯作者)，Azerbaijan State Univ Econ UNEC, Baku, Azerbaijan.",ahlimanabbasov@gmail.com; tahmasib.alizada@yahoo.com,,,,,,,12,3,3,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,453,460,,,,,,8,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700048,0

The objective of this empirical study was to examine the factors that influence the career selection choice of the student. The survey method was adopted to get the responses from 120 students of BBA/MBA who are enrolled in the universities at Karachi. The result of the survey was analyzed using SPSS. The study result revealed that Interest in the subject is the most Influential variable for the graduates in choosing career option, while financial outcome and future job opportunities are less significant and have minor impact. The study results are indicative of the importance of students counseling sessions and other interventions to provide the students updated knowledge, and information to create their interest in the right choices and available options.","[Ahmed, Kazi Afaq; Sharif, Nimra; Ahmad, Nawaz] Inst Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan",,"Ahmed, KA (通讯作者)，Inst Business Management, Karachi, Pakistan.",afaq.kazi@iobm.edu.pk; nimra.sharif@iobm.edu.pk; nawaz.ahmad@iobm.edu.pk,"Sharif, Nimra/L-6148-2019; Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/J-5017-2019","Ahmad, Dr Nawaz/0000-0002-6029-7868",,,,,24,0,0,1,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,3079,3092,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700315,0

The value and effectiveness of the human-technology partnership which is manifested in the virtual forms of business is accepted as an economically viable way of doing business. The concept of such an organization is based on the knowledge, especially that which is deposited in the minds of talented individuals, known as tacit knowledge. Knowledge organisations are more likely to adapt to the virtual forms of business, in comparison to the ones neglecting this aspect. Successful virtual management is reflected in the ability to create knowledge management systems to harness the intellectual capital and create value. A new form of association is relying on people and virtual work can only be realized if team leaders and team members are motivated to share their unique knowledge with each other. However, virtual organisations are usually short-lived (lasting until the end of the set business objectives) and the people who are involved in virtual social networks do not have enough time to realize the mutual connection of trust and experience, so there is concern that such a network does not lead to the exchange of knowledge, experiences and beliefs.","[Baltezarevic, Vesna] John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia; [Baltezarevic, Radoslav] Amer Univ Middle East Kuwait, Fac Business Adm, Kuwait, Kuwait",American University of the Middle East,"Baltezarevic, V (通讯作者)，John Naisbitt Univ, Fac Culture & Media, Belgrade, Serbia.",vbaltezarevic@nezbit.edu.rs; Radoslav.Baltezare@aum.edu.kw,,,,,,,17,0,2,0,5,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-7535,,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,365,371,,,,,,7,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700037,0

The cereal production is an important sector of domestic agriculture and represents a traditional activity for Romanian farmers as well. The cereals outputs harvested on the national territory have made important progress in these past years, concretized in the growth of quantities exported especially to the extra-EU economic space and in enabling the exporters to earn substantial revenues. The record outputs of cereal production obtained in the past years have led to a positive economic growth for Romanian economy, which exhibits one of the highest GDP growth rates in the European Union. Although there has been an increase in the quantity of agricultural products exported, this was done mainly under the form of unprocessed vegetal produce, having a lower price compared to the finished products. Romania depends on the fluctuations of grain prices on the international market, and consequently it is necessary to construct a national strategy to ensure the integrated development of the domestic food industry and to reduce the dependence on food imports. The results obtained from the research are useful for academics, for the Romanian companies and for the national administration in view of reducing Romania's dependency of external food markets.","[Cristu, Cristian; Cristu, Mihaela Scurtu; Stanciu, Silvius] Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania",Dunarea De Jos University Galati,"Cristu, C (通讯作者)，Dunarea de Jos Univ Galati, Galati, Romania.",cristucristian@yahoo.com; cristu.mihaela@yahoo.com; sstanciu@ugal.ro,"STANCIU, SILVIUS/R-8246-2017","STANCIU, SILVIUS/0000-0001-7697-0968",,,,,23,2,2,0,3,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-8-3,,,,2016,,,,,,,1501,1514,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG8XT,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392785700152,0

However, there is a dearth of evidence concerning whether alternative JFM intervention with improved market linkages for non-timber forest products has similar implications. In this study, we evaluated the income and distributive effects of a JFM program in Ethiopia in which additional support was provided for improved market linkages for non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Exploiting exogenous variation in customary rights across eligible groups of communities that participate in JFM programs, as well as using heteroskedasticity-based instrumentations, we identified the income and distributive effects of the program. Our analysis shows that the program has raised the income of the households who chose to participate by approximately 400 Ethiopian Birr or 26% of per capita expenditure; that result was robust to various specifications. We also found that this effect is largely driven by marketing incentives to use non-timber forest products. However, we found that the program's benefit is biased toward the upper end of the income distribution, a result that points to the inequality reinforcing effects of the program.

The key task of the PES is matching of labour supply and demand in order to stabilize the labour market and provide sustainable employment. To achieve these goals, the PES implement employment programmes. According to the job search theory, the outcome of job search depends on (i) jobseeker's human capital (education level, experience, professional and other (soft) skills, health, etc.) personality traits (ambition, motivation etc.) and social capital (networks); (ii) job search strategy (including the reservation wage) and intensity/effort of job seeking, but (iii) the number of available vacancies and their distribution with respect to offered salary, required qualification and skills, terms and conditions of work.

These countries have formalized their cooperation, and later, with the joining of South Africa, became the BRICS. They are often perceived as proponents of multipolar world, choosing multipolarity over unipolarity, and supporting political institutions and organizations, at the same time creating alternative financial institutions to the hegemonic ones (the IMF and the World Bank), still dominated by the developed economies of the Western countries. So, what about a different group of countries, called the MINT countries or simply the MINTs that are emerging, growing economies, are heterogeneous as BRICS, but not nearly as large and powerful, and are located on four different continents, with no formal cooperation between themselves such as the BRICS? This article analyses the basic economic trends in the MINT countries by analyzing the linear relationship between GDP as the dependent variable and household consumption, foreign direct investment and government consumption as the independent variables. The general model is as follows: Delta log GDP(t) = alpha(0) + alpha(1)Delta log FDIt + alpha 2 Delta log PCt + alpha 3 Delta log GC(t) + epsilon(t). The analysis was conducted using ordinary least squared (OLS) regression. By conducting this analysis, it is possible to conclude that the MINT countries have significant differences in regards to the statistical relevance of the chosen independent variables. One of the rare common traits of these four economies is that FDI does not seem to have a statistically significant impact on their development. This article concludes that the MINT countries may have a significant role in international relations as regional powers, but they do not have the economic or political traits necessary to challenge the BRICS countries significantly.","[Kokotovic, Filip] Univ Coll Int Relat & Diplomacy Dag Hammarskjold, Ilica 242, Zagreb, Croatia; [Kurecic, Petar] Univ North, Dept Business Econ, 104 Brigade 3, Varazhdin, Croatia",University North - Croatia,"Kokotovic, F (通讯作者)，Univ Coll Int Relat & Diplomacy Dag Hammarskjold, Ilica 242, Zagreb, Croatia.",filip.kokotovic@hotmail.com; petar.kurecic@unin.hr,"Kurecic, Petar/M-2524-2017",,,,,,8,0,0,0,1,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,265,278,,,,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700029,0

The research has found that there is a strong link between skills of entrepreneurs and their involvement in innovations. Research has found that entrepreneur focus on product innovations rather than process, raw material and market innovations due to their low level of general education and the main mode of acquiring skills remains on-the-job-training. Usage of technology has been found to be lower level which has a negative effect on innovations. However, the entrepreneurs have a positive attitude towards innovations the relevant agencies can capitalize-on for expansion of the industry and increase competitiveness.

Sovereign bailouts prevent disruptive insolvencies, but distort bank incentives. Contingent convertible capital instruments (CoCos) - securities which possess a loss-absorbing mechanism in situations where the capital of the issuing bank reaches a level lower than a predefined level - offer a potential solution. Although gaining in popularity in developed economies, CoCo issuance in Africa is still in its infancy, possibly due to pricing complexity and ambiguity about conversion triggers. In this paper, the pricing of these instruments is investigated and the influence of local conditions (using data from three major African markets and an all-African index) on CoCo prices is explored. We find that the African milieu (high interest rates and equity volatility compared with the situation in developed markets) makes CoCos particularly attractive instruments for the simultaneous reduction of debt and the enhancement of capital. If CoCo issuance becomes a viable bank recapitalisation tool in Africa, these details will be valuable to future investors and issuers.","[Liebenberg, Francois; van Vuuren, Gary; Heymans, Andre] North West Univ, Dept Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Liebenberg, F (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Dept Econ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",,"van Vuuren, Gary/B-5453-2019; Heymans, André/W-7520-2019","van Vuuren, Gary/0000-0001-6811-0538; Heymans, André/0000-0003-3879-6887",,,,,44,3,3,0,9,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

All these variables are intertwined with the companies' cultural framework. This paper tries to investigate the determinants and quality of goodwill impairment decisions within two separate accounting cultures under Hall's classification of low-context/high-context considering high-context emerging European markets such as Poland and Romania as well as low-context emerging African markets such as South Africa and Zimbabwe in two models, one investigating goodwill impairment decisions with the other focusing on the relevance of goodwill numbers. The findings suggest that cultural context is connected through various proxy variables to goodwill impairment decisions, thus shedding light on a set of novel variables for consideration.","[Loghin, Radu-Daniel] Univ Econ Studies, Acad Studii Econ, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Loghin, RD (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Studies, Acad Studii Econ, Bucharest, Romania.",Radu.loghin@lognet.ro,,,,,,,15,0,0,3,9,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,,978-3-319-21139-8; 978-3-319-21138-1,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,195,208,,10.1007/978-3-319-21139-8_11,0.0,,,14,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE5QC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373209100011,0

In the process of branding, cities promote themselves as places good for living and as a desirable tourist destination, at the same time seeking to attract significant investments. Brands are the basis of long-term survival for every company in the market, including the cities. Creating and building strong brands requires a clear definition of brand identity and its positioning in the minds of consumers (Paliaga, 2007, 45). Marketing activities result in increased brand equity, and in the case of cities, we talk about the growth of their market recognition, and thus their image. Conducting marketing activities to build a city brand, we highlight its perceived strengths on which we want to build growth. The Creative City Index, developed by Charles Landry and Jonathan Hyams, evaluates the ` creative pulse of places' by exploring their urban dynamics, processes and achieved projects. It looks at the city as an integrated whole, including economic, cultural, technological and social factors, where the dynamics interweave either reinforcing or counteracting each other (Landry, 2014). Competition among cities is expressed most strongly in the field of attracting new investments and jobs. It manifests through two levels, in the global market cities are competing to attract the headquarters of new international companies, while in the national market they compete for resources and incentives from various funds, in order to invest into infrastructure, as well as cultural, economic and other development projects. The main goal of this Paper is to investigate the image of European city brands and their emotional impact on Croatian students from all university regions in Croatia as authors target research group. In order to find out their preferences, authors will conduct a quantitative research. Authors will also focus on whether or not some of Croatian cities would be included in their list of brands.","[Lulic, Luksa; Rocco, Sanja] Zagreb Sch Business, Ulica Grada Vukovara 68, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Bartulovic, Kresimir] Zagreb Sch Business, Zaharova 11, Zagreb 10000, Croatia",,"Lulic, L (通讯作者)，Zagreb Sch Business, Ulica Grada Vukovara 68, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",luksa.lulic@vpsz.hr; sanja.rocco@vpsz.hr; kresimirbartulovic00@gmail.com,,,,,,,35,0,0,1,8,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,224,234,,,,,,11,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7GD,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391254700025,0

A much debated topic is in this sense is the idea of seeing students as customers. There are many authors who agree with this idea. But, there are also many authors who disagree stating that seeing students as customers decreases the value of the degree offered. As long as a big part of the incomes of a university depend on the students, they should be regarded as,a special type of customers or as partners according to some authors. In this article there are presented the results of a research in which the satisfaction of the students is analyzed and used in order,,to define better the relation between a university and its students.

Regulating by means of standard agency contracting becomes irrelevant in the resulting multiple relationships. Looking through the agency lens, using analytic auto-ethnography and compiling narratives, this paper explains the perceptions of what appear to be quasi-agency relationships and obtains a better understanding of these. The findings suggest that the apparent principal-agent relationships suffer from asymmetries of goals, information access, informal power and diverging perceptions of moral hazard, transaction costs and adverse selection. As a solution, contracting has been shown to have limited value owing to outcome uncertainty and measurability. This is because the tasks of the BRP are non-programmable and term-dependent. The findings provide filing directors, shareholders, creditors, regulatory authorities and BRPs in this newly instituted regime, with enhanced understanding of how the relationships manifest in practice and overcome the non-contractibility of the newly formed relationships.","[Pretorius, Marius] Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",University of Pretoria,"Pretorius, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Business Management, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",,"Pretorius, Marius/AAP-3344-2021",,,,,,37,6,11,0,7,AOSIS,CAPE TOWN,"POSTNET SUITE 55, PRIVATE BAG X22, TYGERVALLEY, CAPE TOWN, 00000, SOUTH AFRICA",2222-3436,,,S AFR J ECON MANAG S,S.

It is based upon a piece of 3 year-research on financial literacy among Latvian adolescents and their families. It combines both quantitative and qualitative methods: a regionally-representative household survey (561 households, including 203 double interviews), 29 qualitative interviews with 38 persons and participant observation in 8 families conducted by anthropology students at the University of Latvia. Starting as a project on financial education at schools it soon moved to the families as centre for forming financial literacy knowledge and skills. The logic and development of household economics permits the answering of questions on the high resilience of the Latvian population during years of austerity, comparatively low trust towards formal financial instruments in investing, saving or borrowing money. Social solidarity, investment in durable goods and in morally highly valued products and possessions such as education or a house in countryside, comprises a system of economics with its own rules. So, it is not the lack of knowledge but rather a different kind of knowledge which expresses itself when families face formal economics. The paper shows that a person's financial literacy is deeply rooted in his or her household economics and any change and innovation in the larger economic system is possible only at the cost of transforming socially-embedded economic behaviour in family.","[Putnina, Aivita] Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia",University of Latvia,"Putnina, A (通讯作者)，Univ Latvia, Riga, Latvia.",aivita.putnina@lu.lv,"Putnina, Aivita/AAH-4704-2021","Putnina, Aivita/0000-0001-6500-6743",,,,,17,0,0,0,3,UNIV LATVIA,RIGA,"19 RAINA BLVD, RIGA, LV 1586, LATVIA",,,978-9934-18-140-5,,,,2016,,,,,,,564,573,,,,,,10,Business; Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE8FX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000376433200048,0

Work-family conflict occurs when workplace responsibilities interfere with family life, such as inflexible working hours, work overload, interpersonal conflict at work and unsupportive supervisors in the organization. This study hopes to identify the scenario of work family conflict among nurses in public sector and outline some strategies for the enhancement of their well-being. Ten respondents were chosen based on purposive sampling. The study was conducted among various levels of nurses at Sarawak General Hospital. Findings from the interviews show that three factors contribute to work family conflict among nurses, namely workload, work shift and position. Recommendations have been proposed based on respondent feedback as well as researchers' view such as reducing work family conflict through work family segmentation, support from family (husband, children and other family members) and self-commitment which comprises the elements of work priority, positive attitude, open communication and intention to work.

In recent years, many MCDM methods have been developed; the existing approaches have been improved and extended. Multi criteria decision analysis has been regarded as a suitable set of methods to perform sustainability evaluations. Among numerous MCDM methods developed to solve real-life decision problems, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) continues to work satisfactorily in diverse application areas. In this paper, a novel sorting method (TOPSIS-Sort) based on the classic TOPSIS method is presented. In the TOPSIS-Sort approach an outranking relation is used for sorting purposes. The proposed approach uses characteristic profiles for defining the classes and outranking relation as the preference model. Application of the proposed approach is demonstrated by classifying 22 districts of Tehran into five classes (but none of the districts fits into Classes 4 and 5), representing areas with different levels of environmental quality. An analysis and assessment of the environmental conditions in Tehran helps to identify the districts with the poor environmental quality. Priority should be given to these areas to maintain and improve the quality of environment. The results obtained by the TOPSIS-Sort give credence to its success, because the results of sorting confirm our and specialists' evaluation of the districts. This research provides appropriate results with respect to the development of sorting models in the form of outranking relations.

The aim was to determine the plus and minus of personnel management, to control individual governments and their development from the perspectives of selected factors. When comparing individual selected parameters within our case studies, it is clear that in terms of the management of the organization chart, each message very similar regardless of whether they belong to newer or older national parks. Similarly, on a comparison parameter percent of graduates employed population, which is also very similar. When comparing the total number of employed persons in the administrations of the national parks and the average monthly salary it is evident that the highest salary paid to employees, which is the lowest number Of employees, but for visitors the most attractive national park (according to the annual number of visitors). In conclusion, the creation of national parks in Germany is slightly more modern process or trend.

The unsustainable use of resources have led to climate change, environmental pollution and exhaustion of raw materials, which is why decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation as well as an efficient use of resources is one of the main objectives nowadays. The effectiveness with which the economy uses materials extracted from natural resources to generate economic value is described by resource productivity. Resource productivity is a problematic issue for the Baltic States as it is 1.5-3.0 times lower than the average resource productivity of all the EU. The paper analyses the tendencies of resource productivity in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, as well as the main factors that impact on it. The analysis includes 34 indicators related to national income and outlays for research and development, seeking to discover the factors that have the greatest influence on resource productivity. The research showed significant differences among countries, and, in turn, different means for increasing of the resource productivity should be applied. Latvia is the only country among three that has made progress in this area. Lithuania and, especially, Estonia should pay more attention to the effective use of outlays for R&D, make strict action plans, provide the list of means, and regularly check the implementation as a means of seeking to improve the resource productivity.

However, because of the lack of information, the usage of single indicators is not always efficient. In order to avoid misinterpretation of the indicators and by taking into account the principle of controlling complexity, various indicator systems are formed. They allow not only to quantify the current situation and perform retrospective, operational and perspective diagnostics of financial position, but also to reveal the causes of the origin of the problems. However, not every indicator system is equally able to highlight the weak points and identify the problems. It is also noteworthy that not every indicator system is characterized by the same level of compatibility of indicators, interconnections and strategic orientation. By considering this, it is possible to identify a problematical field of controlling system, which is the choice of appropriate indicators and their systems in order to provide relevant and structured information that is suitable to make management decisions. The aim of the research is to examine and classify the main financial and non-financial indicator systems and to evaluate the suitability of their application in the controlling department activity. A review of the main indicator systems, such as DuPont, EVA, BSC, ZVEI, RL, EFQM and others and the peculiarities of these indicator systems are revealed in the article. The result of the study is a dissection of the indicator systems to eight separate fields according to three dimensions: indicators compatibility level, indicators interconnection level and strategic orientation level. Considering the fact that controlling as an instrument of company management - is oriented towards achieving operational and strategic objectives, strategic orientation level is considered the most important when choosing an indicators system. After performing the main indicator systems analysis, it was determined that the most significant, providing the most relevant amount of information in the controlling system is the BSC system assigned to the eighth field. Its features are: extensive orientation towards strategy, high indicators compatibility and strong relation among indicators.

The CEM is used to evaluate the performance. The results show significant differences in the efficiency scores between CEM and SE-DEA. The CEM can reduce the risks of SE-DEA affected by the dimensions of indicators, and improve its discrimination capability. The evaluation outcomes of the CEM seem to be more objective, therefore, provide a more suitable basis for decision-making related to public transit service performance, as well as for the study of operation and management.

The findings reveal that the discord surrounding the BYU Center had to do primarily with process and the values, and not around the issues themselves. The methodology provides a typology for understanding and analysing the different stories told by stakeholders involved in spatial-religious conflicts where the decision adopted might be perceived as endangering identity and 'sense of place'.

One stream of development is apps that enable collaborative travel, either in the form of lift sharing or collaborative shopping, but despite growing interest from governmental agencies, there is little evidence of the efficacy of such apps. Based on trials of purpose built travel collaboration apps, deployed in tourism, urban and rural residential communities, and logistics, this paper analyses the fundamental challenges facing users adopting such travel apps. The findings suggest that transport practitioners, policy makers and app developers need to better understand the challenges associated with attracting users, the use of incentives and the types of communities most appropriate to implement collaborative travel concepts using such approaches.

A CBA can be very helpful to ex ante evaluate the impacts of candidate cycling policies although the outcomes need to be carefully examined and could be misleading. This is firstly due to current practice and modelling tools which do not address cycling well, key issues being the poor inclusion of cycling in transport models even in countries with high bicycle levels, and the use of aggregate average risk data which do not reflect marginal risk changes in specific cases. In addition it is doubtful whether the value of travel time gains can be captured by the cyclist's willingness to pay. Secondly, some important effects are generally ignored, typically difficulties in quantifying and monetizing the potential impacts on the urban environment, social exclusion and the option value. We point out some research and modelling challenges essential for improving CBA for the evaluation of cycling policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyze data from a Southern California subsample of the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS), which has a quasi-experimental nature thanks to large exogenous variations in gasoline prices during the administration of the NHTS (March 2008 April 2009). Our joint models of residential urban form, vehicle efficiency choice, and vehicle use account for residential self-selection and endogeneity of vehicle preferences in order to explain vehicle miles traveled (VMT) for both work and non-work trips. Residential urban form is treated as a latent construct that reflects observed variables such as population density, land use diversity and distance to employment centers. We find that in the short run, households drive 0.171% less for non-work trips when gas prices increase by 1%, while work trips are not responsive to gasoline price changes. Moreover, owners of more fuel efficient vehicles tend to be more educated and Asian. In addition, households in lower density neighborhoods are more likely to have a higher income, to be older than 65 and White; these households tend to own more vehicles per driver. Overall, our results underscore the importance of accounting for the nature of trips when estimating the short-term price elasticity of travel. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Marvel Entertainment that stare decisis required adherence to the half-century-old, much criticized rule in Brulotte v. Thys. Justice Douglas's Brulotte opinion concluded that license agreements requiring royalties measured by use of a patent after its expiration are unenforceable per se. The court need not inquire into market power, anticompetitive effects, or effects on innovation, and it may not accept any defense. In declining to overrule Brulotte, the Kimble Court observed two things: First, reliance interests had developed around the Brulotte decision and most people had learned to live with it. Second, Congress had had many opportunities to overrule the decision but had resisted every invitation to do so. This article explores some of the reasons why Brulotte was a poor decision as either patent or competition policy, and considers whether stare decisis was a sufficiently weighty reason for adhering to it.","Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA",University of Iowa,"Hovenkamp, H (通讯作者)，Univ Iowa, Coll Law, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA.",herbert-hovenkamp@uiowa.edu,,,,,,,21,1,1,0,2,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",1744-6414,1744-6422,,J COMPET LAW ECON,J.

The lead market approach tries to explain why certain countries are better positioned than others for developing and launching new products. While much research stresses the role of excellence in technology and interaction among users and producers, the lead market approach focuses on the role of demand characteristics. Based on the concept of innovation design, a lead market is defined as a country where customers prefer that design which subsequently becomes the globally dominant design. We use an indicator-based approach which has been successfully employed for individual products as well as for various industries in order to identify lead markets in the European automotive industry. Employing five lead market factors, our results show that the EU is by far no homogeneous market for automobiles and national markets differ considerably in their lead market potential. The German market is found to be most promising to serve as a lead market, while other European countries with a strong automotive tradition like France, Italy, the UK, and Sweden score lower. Our findings suggest that firms from the automotive industry should exploit this diversity of market characteristics within Europe when developing and launching new products.","[Cleff, Thomas] Pforzheim Univ, Pforzheim, Germany; [Grimpe, Christoph] Copenhagen Business Sch, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark; [Rammer, Christian] ZEW Ctr European Econ Res, Mannheim, Germany",Copenhagen Business School; Zentrum fur Europaische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW),"Grimpe, C (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Kilevej 14A, DK-2000 Frederiksberg, Denmark.",cg.ino@cbs.dk,"Rammer, Christian/ABA-8789-2021","Rammer, Christian/0000-0002-1173-9471; Cleff, Thomas/0000-0003-0154-0415",,,,,49,4,5,1,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1366-2716,1469-8390,,IND INNOV,Ind.

Yet only England used the longbow as a mainstay in its military arsenal; France and Scotland clung to the technologically inferior crossbow. This longbow puzzle has perplexed historians for decades. We resolve it by developing a theory of institutionally constrained technology adoption. Unlike the crossbow, the longbow was cheap and easy to make and required rulers who adopted the weapon to train large numbers of citizens in its use. These features enabled usurping nobles whose rulers adopted the longbow to potentially organize effective rebellions against them. Rulers choosing between missile technologies thus confronted a trade-off with respect to internal and external security. England alone in late medieval Europe was sufficiently politically stable to allow its rulers the first-best technology option. In France and Scotland political instability prevailed, constraining rulers in these nations to the crossbow.","[Allen, Douglas W.] Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada; [Leeson, Peter T.] George Mason Univ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",Simon Fraser University; George Mason University,"Allen, DW (通讯作者)，Simon Fraser Univ, Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6, Canada.",,,,,,,,58,10,10,0,10,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0022-2186,1537-5285,,J LAW ECON,J.

We propose that municipalities vary in ability to discipline franchisees, and that this heterogeneous ability affects franchise renewal patterns and the quasi-rents that franchisees extract. We study provision of municipal water services in France, a setting characterized by both direct public provision and franchised private providers. We find that small municipalities pay a significant price premium for franchisee-provided water when compared with publicly provided water; in contrast, large municipalities do not pay a premium on average. Further, large municipalities are less likely to renew an incumbent franchisee that charges an excessive price, while small municipalities' renewal patterns are not influenced by franchisees' excessive pricing. We interpret the results as evidence that although large municipalities can discipline franchisees and thus prevent extraction of quasi-rents, small municipalities are less able to do so due to weaker outside options.","[Chong, Eshien; Saussier, Stephane] Sorbonne Business Sch, Paris, France; [Silverman, Brian S.] Univ Toronto, Toronto, ON M5S 1A1, Canada",University of Toronto,"Chong, E (通讯作者)，Sorbonne Business Sch, Paris, France.",,"Silverman, Brian/AAP-7819-2021",,,,,,20,41,42,0,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

An extensive analysis is performed over a broad cross-country database of the main macroeconomic indicators. The results suggest that, on average, non-linear models cannot outperform standard linear specifications, even during the Great Recession episode. However, non-linear models do lead to an improvement in predictive accuracy in almost 40%-45% of cases, and interesting specific patterns arise across models and variables, though in general the gains are limited. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that describes this recent recession episode as a sequence of unusually large shocks, rather than as an increase in the degree of non-linearity in the stochastic processes underlying the main macroeconomic time series.

We conduct a detailed analysis regarding the airport choice of passengers living in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Northern France and Western Germany. We compare the results with Spain, where a high speed train between Madrid and Barcelona has recently been inaugurated. We estimate a multinomial logit model of airport choice and predict future market shares, based on access time, frequency, average fare and airport specific constants. Direct and cross-elasticities are calculated and finally future market shares are predicted, incorporating changes in access time due to the introduction of the high speed train. We find that the introduction of a high speed train connection benefits the airport with the higher level of service most.

The term was coined before the turn of the century and the tabulation of the 2000 census. However, this term may be antiquatednot because African Americans no longer have disparate consumer experiences, but because these experiences impact all American minorities. This study examines the prevalence of racially motivated discriminatory experiences across consumer contexts. Specifically, it offers an empirical look at ways that racial minorities believe they are treated in a variety of consumption environments. Results show that minority groups experience similar levels of perceived discrimination: Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans are as frequently victims of marketplace discrimination as are African Americans. Interestingly, these shared experiences do not necessarily translate into similar beliefs in the continued existence of discrimination as a derogatory force for American minority consumers.","[Bennett, Aronte Marie] Villanova Univ, Mkt, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Hill, Ronald Paul] Villanova Univ, Mkt & Business Law, Villanova, PA 19085 USA; [Daddario, Kara] Villanova Univ, Villanova, PA 19085 USA",Villanova University; Villanova University; Villanova University,"Bennett, AM (通讯作者)，Villanova Univ, Mkt, Villanova, PA 19085 USA.",aronte.bennett@villanova.edu; ronald.hill@villanova.edu; kdaddari@villanova.edu,"Hill, Ronald/GOK-1216-2022",,Naclerio family; Center for Church Management and Business Ethics; Villanova School of Business,Naclerio family; Center for Church Management and Business Ethics; Villanova School of Business,"Financial support of the Naclerio family, the Center for Church Management and Business Ethics, and the Villanova School of Business are greatly appreciated as well as the collegial review by Stacey Baker.

Payday loan interest rates are as high as 25% per 2- to 4-week loans and individuals use a post-dated check to secure the loan. Pawnshop usage is available for anyone with collateral. This article examines whether individuals using payday loans in states where rollovers are allowed are more likely to also use pawnshops together with payday loans. I find that this is true for individuals who make less than $30,000, but it does not hold for those with higher levels of income. There may be some complementary relationships between payday loan rollovers and pawnshops for these lower-income individuals. These results are important when considering whether to allow payday loan rollovers.","US Mil Acad, Dept Social Sci, Off Econ & Manpower Anal, West Point, NY 10996 USA",United States Military Academy; United States Department of Defense; United States Army,"Carter, SP (通讯作者)，US Mil Acad, Dept Social Sci, Off Econ & Manpower Anal, West Point, NY 10996 USA.",susan.carter@usma.edu,,,Vanderbilt Dissertation Fellowship,Vanderbilt Dissertation Fellowship,"I would first of all like to thank the Vanderbilt Dissertation Fellowship for funding my final year of research at Vanderbilt.

Both scholarly and policymaking communities are interested in this topic of enforcement approach within the realms of finance, tax compliance, occupational safety, food and drug safety, consumer product safety, and environmental protection. To inform this debate, our study explores enforcement of environmental protection laws where the debate has been especially spirited yet lacking in much empirical evidence. Specifically our study empirically analyzes the effects of these two approaches on environmental management practices linked to compliance with wastewater discharge limits imposed on chemical manufacturing facilities. For this analysis, we view the enforcement approach as representing a relationship between a regulator and a regulated entity that is measured in multiple dimensions so that we are able to explore the extent of cooperation or coercion. The empirical results reveal that a more cooperative relationship induces better environmental management. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This is especially true in the specific context of small firms (SFs), despite the fact, that their knowledge-based resources are more important than their property-based resources. This study aims to investigate, through a quali-quantitative analysis carried out on a sample of SFs in northeast Italy, the alignment between knowledge strategies and competitive strategies. We have identified two types of competitive strategies pursued by SFs, i.e. human resource-based (HR-based) and product and customer service quality-based (PCSQ-based). We have also identified two types of internal knowledge strategy, i.e. exploitation strategy of internal knowledge, and exploration strategy of internal knowledge, as well as two types of external knowledge strategy, i.e. exploitation strategy of external knowledge, and exploration strategy of external knowledge. Our findings reveal that SFs pursuing HR-based competitive strategies tend to adopt exploitation strategies of both internal and external knowledge, while firms pursuing PCSQ-based competitive strategies tend to adopt exploration strategies of both internal and external knowledge.","[Bagnoli, Carlo; Giachetti, Claudio] Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, I-30121 Venice, VE, Italy",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia,"Giachetti, C (通讯作者)，Ca Foscari Univ Venice, Dept Management, 873 Cannaregio, I-30121 Venice, VE, Italy.",bagnoli@unive.it; claudio.giachetti@unive.it,,"Giachetti, Claudio/0000-0002-4609-9750",,,,,84,13,23,5,164,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

With non-verifiable output, rewarding agents based on team performance can relax the principal's credibility constraint by smoothing bonus payments over time. Team incentives also induce free-riding, but the principal prefers them to individual incentives if effort costs are relatively high and problems difficult to solve. We show that a simple mixture of an individual and team bonus constitutes the optimal relational contract under joint performance evaluation. The optimal contract may be inefficient when team size is endogenous, as rewarding team performance forces the principal to share surplus with agents, but may allow him to motivate a larger group.","[Kim, Jin-Hyuk] Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; [Vikander, Nick] Univ Copenhagen, Dept Econ, DK-1353 Copenhagen K, Denmark",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Copenhagen,"Kim, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Colorado, Dept Econ, 256 UCB, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",jinhyuk.kim@colorado.edu; nick.vikander@econ.ku.dk,,"Vikander, Nick/0000-0002-8874-6856",,,,,39,4,4,0,24,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",8756-6222,1465-7341,,J LAW ECON ORGAN,J.

In this article, we develop an overlapping generations model in which endogenous growth is based on an accumulation of knowledge driven by the proportion of skilled workers and by the time they have spent in training. In such a framework, we show that conventional pension systems, contrary to notional systems, can enhance economic growth by linking benefits only to the partial earnings history. Thus, to ensure economic growth, the optimal adjustment to increased longevity could consist in increasing the size of existing retirement systems rather than switching to notional systems.","OFCE Sci Po, F-75340 Paris 07, France",,"Le Garrec, G (通讯作者)，OFCE Sci Po, 69 Quai Orsay, F-75340 Paris 07, France.",gilles.legarrec@ofce.sciences-po.fr,,,,,,,72,6,6,3,38,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.

The first group EU-15 is presented by old EU countries and the second group EU-12 is presented by new member countries that joined the EU in 2004-2007. The threefactor Cobb-Douglas production function is estimated through the panel general least squares method. The input factors that might influence the economic growth are labour, ICT capital services and non-ICT capital services. Since ICT capital growth data are not available for all selected economies, the groups of countries were reduced to EU-14 and EU-7. The estimated panel production functions confirmed that the average growth of GDP in the EU-7 countries was supported by the stable growth of labour quantity and ICT-capital and increasing total factor productivity. A short-term drop in non-ICT capital growth with follow-up stagnation was caused rather by lower labour productivity. The research discovered that the drop in GDP growth in the EU-14 countries was a result of the slower growth of non-ICT capital and total factor productivity and the stagnated growth of ICT capital with low elasticity, and showed that even the compensation of growth in labour quality did not prevent a decrease in total factor productivity and economic growth.","[Hanclova, Jana] Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Syst Engn, Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Doucek, Petr] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Syst Anal, Prague, Czech Republic; [Fischer, Jakub; Vltavska, Kristyna] Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Econ Stat, Prague, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Doucek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Prague, Fac Informat & Stat, Dept Syst Anal, W Churchill Sq 4, Prague, Czech Republic.",jana.hanclova@vsb.cz; doucek@vse.cz; fischerj@vse.cz; kristyna.vltavska@vse.cz,"Hanclova, Jana/AAJ-8363-2020; Fischer, Jakub/J-7874-2012; Hanclova, Jana/D-7723-2013; Vltavská, Kristýna/J-1497-2017; Doucek, Petr/A-7703-2015","Hanclova, Jana/0000-0002-0939-6852; Fischer, Jakub/0000-0003-4658-1974; Doucek, Petr/0000-0002-5647-661X",,,,,27,54,58,0,68,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",1611-1699,2029-4433,,J BUS ECON MANAG,J.

Our results suggest there are costs preventing South African firms from adjusting faster to their long-run optimal debt level.

Decompositions show that most of the unexplained disparity appears to emerge during charging, plea-bargaining, and sentencing fact-finding. The approach provides an important complement to prior disparity studies, which have focused on sentencing and have not incorporated disparities arising from those earlier stages.

On the one hand, the social sciences literature makes it clear that most decisions related to transportation are wicked, i.e. they cannot be tackled with traditional engineering approaches since they are poorly defined. On the other, transportation systems have a strong technical component affecting most of such decisions, as they have to (or should) comply with compelling technical and economic requirements. The literature on transport engineering and economics deals with transportation planning mostly as a rational process based on the formulation and comparison of alternative options. In this paper, we propose an approach to planning and designing transportation systems, at least in the more complex cases, meant to bridge the gap between social and technical points of view. The proposed approach is cross-disciplinary, as it integrates notions from cognitive sciences, organization and management sciences with transportation systems analysis. Transportation planning, both under public and private market-oriented viewpoints, is seen as a complex decision-making process where different actors (decision-makers, stakeholders, professionals) interact in different contexts and according to different models or approaches. After a brief discussion of the main elements of most planning processes and of the different decision making models, the paper proposes a decision-making model based on three parallel and intertwined processes: a cognitive rational approach to organizing the decision-making process, a five-level stakeholder engagement process, and a revised role of quantitative analyses and methods drawing on tools from engineering and economics, amongst other disciplines. We also present a real application of the proposed decision-making model to the case study of the Regional Metro System (RMS) project in Campania (southern Italy), where a complex decisional context with different stakeholders and multiple (often contrasting) interests was managed in the integrated framework for over a decade, resulting in the largest and most effective of such projects in Italy. Finally, the paper proposes new roles and new challenges for quantitative analyses and mathematical tools to support participated decision-making processes, extending their well-established functions for designing and assessing transportation solutions.

Yet, the human rights movement increasingly finds itself in a contested relationship with religious ideas and communities. Even as it draws on the inherited moral resources of religion, the human rights movement, at least in its dominant institutional and intellectual expressions, presents itself as a totalizing moral theory that challenges countervailing theological accounts of human rights. This article considers the distinctive account of human rights that has emerged within Catholic social teaching. Particular attention is given to the process by which Catholic thinking about human rights has embraced political liberalism while also bounding liberalism within a particularistic theologically-informed account of the human person.","Valparaiso Univ, Sch Law, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA",Valparaiso University,"Calo, ZR (通讯作者)，Valparaiso Univ, Sch Law, Valparaiso, IN 46383 USA.",zachary.calo@valpo.edu,,,,,,,41,6,6,0,9,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0002-9246,1536-7150,,AM J ECON SOCIOL,Am.

Building information modeling (BIM) is one of the effective techniques that help building in a virtual and collaborative working environment prior to physical construction. This paper aims to initiative a review on the feasible use of BIM for construction conflict management. A conceptual model is developed to analyze and incorporate the philosophy of conflict management into relation to BIM.

Both primary and secondary data have been used for analyzing the determinants of forest conservation outcome in 35 sample villages located in and around STR. The result shows that forest growth is positively associated with function of local management institutions, caste homogeneity, and distance to forest department and nearest market. Moreover, it is concluded that efforts at improving forest conservation outcomes should not be confined to the poorest communities, as rich communities are largely responsible for adopting degrading resource use practices. Our result recommends the revival of existing local institutions and promotion of more participatory community management approaches in the STR. Further, in order to reduce trust deficit that exist between fringe villages and the forest department, more usufruct and ownership rights over resource should be transferred to local people, which in turn may enhance better forest conservation outcome.

The reasons for the difference were not established. This study follows up the one by Brummer and Wolmarans to determine whether the passing of 19 years could have brought about any difference in the results. This process was initiated by testing a set of variables from a sample size of 107 JSE-listed companies from 2002 to 2012 for linearity. As there was no such linear relationship between any of the variables, no assumptions can be made about any relationship between share return and the risk measures tested here.

The aforementioned development together with digitalization determines many aspects of craft enterprises' functioning; also the ones connected with financing tools and conceptions. Referring to the things stated, it is clear that ICT technologies should be taken into account in enterprise's current activities and in other aspects of its functioning e.g. communication, as well as eservices it provides and receives.","[Foltys, Joachim] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Org & Business Management, Opole, Poland; [Debicka-Ozorkiewicz, Grazyna; Krolczyk, Jolanta B.] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Prod Engn & Logist, Dept Biosyst Engn, Opole, Czech Republic; [Hiadlovsky, Vladimir] Matej Bel Univ Banska Bystr, Fac Econ, Dept Corp Econ & Management, Banska Bystrica, Slovakia",Opole University of Technology; Matej Bel University,"Foltys, J (通讯作者)，Opole Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Org & Business Management, Opole, Poland.",j.foltys@po.opole.pl; grazyna.debicka@izbarzem.opole.pl; j.krolczyk@po.opole.pl; vladimir.hiadlovsky@umb.sk,"N'Dri, Amoin Bernadine/IWD-7811-2023; Krolczyk, Jolanta/J-8956-2015","Krolczyk, Jolanta/0000-0002-7404-0377",,,,,28,45,45,3,38,TECHNICKA UNIV & LIBERCI,LIBEREC 1,"HOSPODARSKA FAKULTA, STUDENTSKA 2, HALKOVA 6, IC 46747885, LIBEREC 1, 461 17, CZECH REPUBLIC",1212-3609,,,E M EKON MANAG,E M Ekon.

Pleasant scent enhances product and retailer evaluations, causes changes in shopping behavior (longer stay in premises, better mood and memories, purchase). Also, it has effect on body states and decision making. However, very little research is performed in the area of ambient scent effect on decision making heuristics, especially when risky decisions and risk perceptions are involved. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to identify the relationship of ambient scent type and intensiveness with decision making heuristics when risks are involved. Results of factorial 2x2 experiment with control group are presented. Ambient scent type (vanilla vs. peppermint) and intensiveness (8 (1mg) vs. 16 sprays (2mg) of scent concentrate in the same room) were manipulated as between subject variables. Risk aversion, effect of anchoring heuristic on bidding, and affect (risk and benefit) heuristic were tracked as dependent variables. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Green building, in the long run, minimizes operational costs and building maintenance. With the reduction of maintenance cost, it gives a better return to the property owners. This paper provides a theoretical perspective of investment in green buildings from the cost-benefit viewpoint. It sets the premise that investment in green office buildings promotes a better quality of life in terms of healthy living, energy conservation, healthy environment, and increased rate of return from the buildings.","[Isa, Mona Binti; Abd Rahman, Megat Mohd Ghazali Megat; Sipan, Ibrahim; Murshid, Abdul Hamid Mar Iman] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Shah Alam, Malaysia",Universiti Teknologi Malaysia,"Isa, MB (通讯作者)，Univ Teknol Malaysia, Fac Geoinformat & Real Estate, Shah Alam, Malaysia.",monanuwanda@gmail.com,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,6,INT BUSINESS INFORMATION MANAGEMENT ASSOC-IBIMA,NORRISTOWN,"34 E GERMANTOWN PIKE, NO. 327, NORRISTOWN, PA 19401 USA",,,978-0-9860419-5-2,,,,2015,,,,,,,3446,3458,,,,,,13,Economics; Management,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BE0SX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366872700362,0

A mutually happy marriage often ends a long series of emotionally disappointing matches. This paper analyses the role of speed daters, that is, individuals who are matched more frequently with new possible marriage partners. Speed daters change the equilibrium in a marriage matching model. Speed daters reject quite good matches, leading to a high rate of rejections and failed matches. Speed daters appear to be heart-breakers. This imposes a welfare loss on other individuals who meet new candidates less frequently. Hence, finding out that the next matched partner is a speed dater is actually bad news for an unmarried person.","Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, D-80539 Munich, Germany",Max Planck Society,"Konrad, KA (通讯作者)，Max Planck Inst Tax Law & Publ Finance, Marstallpl 1, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",kai.konrad@tax.mpg.de,,,,,,,20,1,1,0,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0933-1433,1432-1475,,J POPUL ECON,J.
