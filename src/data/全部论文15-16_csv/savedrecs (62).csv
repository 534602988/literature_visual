The local-momentum autoregression (LM-AR) model carries one extra parameter, and depending on the sign of this extra parameter, it can be either local momentum-preserving or momentum-building. The LM-AR model is motivated by observing US interest rate movement over many decades, which over a long time span seems to mean revert but over a period of several months or years can actually exhibit a momentum-like behavior. We use the LM-AR model with a stochastic central tendency factor as the dominant global risk factor in interest rates and add a local variation component of the standard mean-reverting type to create a 3-factor risk environment. We then derive its corresponding term structure model and empirically implement the model on US interest rates of seven maturities from January 1954 to December 2013 on a weekly frequency to establish the presence of local momentum building.

Several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are now available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). This study sought to identify the inputs and assumptions used in existing BIAs for DMTs in the UK, and the uncertainty and variation in these, to allow critique within the context of UK policy. Methods MEDLINE and the Economic Evaluations Database from the Cochrane Library were searched systematically on 15 December 2014 to identify BIAs of DMTs licensed for MS in the UK. In addition, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and National Health Service (NHS) England websites were searched for relevant publications and grey literature searching was undertaken. Sources and assumptions from the included analyses were extracted, compared and critiqued. Results The database searches produced 115 de-duplicated results. An additional 12 results were identified from the NICE and NHS England websites. No BIAs of DMTs for MS in the UK were identified in the literature. All ten included studies were from the NICE website, comprising manufacturer submissions for each DMT and corresponding NICE costing templates. There are considerable uncertainties in the inputs and assumptions used in the BIAs, but limited sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Conclusions Data limitations were not highlighted in the results, failing to present the uncertainty in the results to users clearly. It is to be welcomed that NICE has recently consulted on a process change to allow additional critique of the costing templates.","[Montgomery, Stephen; Kusel, Jeanette] Costello Med Consulting Ltd, Cambridge, England; [Allen, Felicity; Adlard, Nicholas] Novartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, 200 Frimley Business Pk, Camberley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England",Costello Medical Consulting; Novartis,"Adlard, N (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNovartis Pharmaceut UK Ltd, 200 Frimley Business Pk, Camberley GU16 7SR, Surrey, England.",nicholas.adlard@novartis.com,"; Montgomery, Stephen/B-5683-2011","Adlard, Nicholas/0000-0001-6912-1685; Montgomery, Stephen/0000-0002-8481-5850","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK","NA and FA are paid employees of Novartis Pharmaceuticals UK Ltd, Camberley, UK.

Methods: Patients who participated in Hemato-Oncologie voor Volwassenen Nederland (HOVON- the Haemato Oncology Foundation for Adults in the Netherlands) clinical trials between 1999 and 2011 at a single hospital were invited to complete the questionnaires. Interpretability was evaluated by the frequency of incomplete data and highest and lowest possible scores. Content validity was evaluated by exploring the health-related quality-of-life domains included in the questionnaires. Construct validity was assessed using correlations with other quality of-life scales (EQ-visual analogue scale score and global quality-of-life scale of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire) and ability to distinguish between patients with different health statuses. Results: Questionnaires were returned by 89% (111 of 125) of the patients. Six to seven respondents did not return full questionnaires. Perfect health on the EQ-5D-5L was reported by 32 respondents and many of them (N = 17) did report health problems on other questionnaires. All questionnaires were strongly correlated (range 0.61-0.78) with other quality-of-life scales and yielded substantially different utility values for patients with different health statuses. Nevertheless, the disease specific preference-based questionnaires showed greater discriminatory power. Conclusions: Although the Quality of Life Questionnaire Preference-Based Measure and the EORTC-8D appear to have better validity, this study does not provide any strong evidence against the use of the EQ-5D-5L for measuring quality-of-life utilities in acute leukemia. However, our findings need to be confirmed in larger longitudinal studies.","[van Dongen-Leunis, Annemieke; Redekop, W.

In assessing the causal relationship, I estimate fixed-effects instrumental variable models by using exogenous variation in adopting a reduced workweek in South Korea as an instrument for work hours. The estimation results reveal that shortening work hours induces individuals to exercise regularly and decreases the likelihood of smoking, with more pronounced effects for heavy smokers. While a work-hour reduction substantially increases the probability of drinking participation, it does not significantly affect the likelihood of frequent or daily drinking habits. In addition, the effect of a work-hour reduction on regular exercise is salient among women and older groups, and the effect on smoking behaviors is more pronounced among men and middle-aged groups.

This calls for evaluating social risk (what kind of societies will future people be born into) rather than individual risk (what will happen to people during their own lifetimes). We respond to this call by proposing and axiomatizing probability adjusted rank-discounted critical-level generalized utilitarianism (PARDCLU) through a key axiom ensuring that the social welfare order both is ethical and satisfies first-order stochastic dominance. PARDCLU yields a new useful perspective on intergenerational risks, is ethical in contrast to discounted utilitarianism, and avoids objections that have been raised against other ethical criteria. We show that PARDCLU handles situations with positive probability of human extinction and is linked to decision theory by yielding rank-dependent expected utilitarianism but with additional structure in a special case.

Although MDx are used to screen patients and inform disease management and treatment decisions, there is no uniform approach to their evaluation by HTA organizations. Objectives: The International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group reviewed diagnostic-specific HTA programs and identified elements representing common and best practices. Methods: MDx-specific HTA programs in Europe, Australia, and North America were characterized by methodology, evaluation framework, and impact. Published MDx HTAs were reviewed, and five representative case studies of test evaluations were developed: United Kingdom (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's Diagnostics Assessment Programme, epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase mutation), United States (Palmetto's Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, OncotypeDx prostate cancer test), Germany (Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare, human papillomavirus testing), Australia (Medical Services Advisory Committee, anaplastic lymphoma kinase testing for non-small cell lung cancer), and Canada (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Rapid Response: Non-invasive Prenatal Testing). Results: Overall, the few HTA programs that have MDx-specific methods do not provide clear parameters of acceptability related to clinical and analytic performance, clinical utility, and economic impact. The case studies highlight similarities and differences in evaluation approaches across HTAs in the performance metrics used (analytic and clinical validity, clinical utility), evidence requirements, and how value is measured. Not all HTAs are directly linked to reimbursement outcomes. Conclusions: To improve MDx HTAs, organizations should provide greater transparency, better communication and collaboration between industry and HTA stakeholders, clearer links between HTA and funding decisions, explicit recognition of and rationale for differential approaches to laboratory-developed versus regulatory-approved test, and clear evidence requirements.","[Garfield, Susan] EY Boston, Boston, MA USA; [Polisena, Julie] Canadian Agcy Drugs & Technol Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Spinner, Daryl S.] Courtagen Life Sci Inc, Woburn, MA USA; [Postulka, Anne] Cepheid Europe, Med & Econ Value, Maurens Scopont, France; [Lu, Christine Y.] Harvard Med Sch, Dept Populat Med, Boston, MA USA; [Lu, Christine Y.] Harvard Pilgrim Hlth Care Inst, Boston, MA USA; [Tiwana, Simrandeep K.] Alberta Hlth Serv, Alberta Canc Prevent Legacy Fund, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Tiwana, Simrandeep K.; Faulkner, Eric] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [Faulkner, Eric] Univ N Carolina, Ctr Pharmacogen & Individualized Therapy, Chapel Hill, NC USA; [Faulkner, Eric] NAMCP, Genom Biotech & Emerging Technol Inst, Glen Allen, VA USA; [Poulios, Nick] Roche Mol Syst Inc, Pleasanton, CA USA; [Zah, Vladimir] ISPOR Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia; [Longacre, Michael] Danaher Corp, Diagnost Platform, Washington, DC USA",Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Harvard Pilgrim Health Care; Alberta Health Services (AHS); Evidera; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Roche Holding; Danaher Corporation,"Garfield, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)Ôºå24 Sherman Bridge Rd, Wayland, MA 01778 USA.",susansgarfield@gmail.com,"Zah, Vlad/AAI-9140-2020","Zah, Vlad/0000-0003-1368-4491; Lu, Christine Y./0000-0002-7550-6837",International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR); ISPOR Medical Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group,International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR); ISPOR Medical Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group,This research was supported by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) and the ISPOR Medical Devices and Diagnostics Special Interest Group.

This paper proposes a data-driven way of averaging the estimators over candidate specifications to resolve the specification uncertainty in the propensity score weighting estimation of the ATT. The proposed procedures minimize the estimated MSE of the ATT estimator in a local asymptotic framework. We formulate model averaging as a statistical decision problem in a limit experiment, and derive an averaging scheme that is Bayes optimal with respect to a given prior. The averaging estimator outperforms selection estimators and the estimators in any of the candidate models in terms of Bayes asymptotic MSE. Our Monte Carlo studies illustrate the size of the MSE gains. We apply the averaging procedure to evaluate the effect of a labor market program. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of IGlar versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in type 2 diabetes from the perspective of Thai Health Care System. Methods A validated computer simulation model (the IMS CORE Diabetes Model) was used to estimate the long-term projection of costs and clinical outcomes. The model was populated with published characteristics of Thai patients with type 2 diabetes. Baseline risk factors were obtained from Thai cohort studies, while relative risk reduction was derived from a meta-analysis study conducted by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health. Only direct costs were taken into account. Costs of diabetes management and complications were obtained from hospital databases in Thailand. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 % per annum and presented in US dollars in terms of 2014 dollar value. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results IGlar is associated with a slight gain in quality-adjusted life years (0.488 QALYs), an additional life expectancy (0.677 life years), and an incremental cost of THB119,543 (US$3522.19) compared with NPH insulin. The ICERs were THB244,915/QALY (US$7216.12/QALY) and THB176,525/life-year gained (LYG) (US$5201.09/LYG). The ICER was sensitive to discount rates and IGlar cost. At the acceptable willingness to pay of THB160,000/QALY (US$4714.20/QALY), the probability that IGlar was cost effective was less than 20 %. Conclusions Compared to treatment with NPH insulin, treatment with IGlar in type 2 diabetes patients who had uncontrolled blood glucose with oral anti-diabetic drugs did not represent good value for money at the acceptable threshold in Thailand.","[Permsuwan, Unchalee] Chiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Suthep Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Monash Univ Malaysia, Sch Pharm, Selangor, Malaysia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth; Saokaew, Surasak] Naresuan Univ, Fac Pharmaceut Sci, CPOR, Phitsanulok, Thailand; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Queensland, Sch Populat Hlth, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Chaiyakunapruk, Nathorn] Univ Wisconsin, Sch Pharm, 425 N Charter St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Thavorn, Kednapa] Inst Clin & Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Saokaew, Surasak] Univ Phayao, Sch Pharmaceut Sci, Ctr Hlth Outcomes Res & Therapeut Safety COHORTS, Phayao, Thailand",Chiang Mai University; Monash University; Monash University Sunway; Naresuan University; University of Queensland; University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; University of Toronto; University of Phayao,"Permsuwan, U (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåChiang Mai Univ, Fac Pharm, Suthep Rd, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand.",unchalee.permsuwan@gmail.com,"Saokaew, Surasak/AAI-9804-2021; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/AFR-0151-2022","Saokaew, Surasak/0000-0002-1382-0660; Dilokthornsakul, Piyameth/0000-0002-6981-1771; Thavorn, Kednapa/0000-0003-4738-8447",,,,,56,9,9,0,10,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The analysis proceeds by examining the echelon form and presents a fully automatic, strongly consistent, data driven approach to model specification. A novel feature of the inferential procedures developed here is that they work in terms of a canonical representation based on the Kronecker invariants in which the variables are expressed in the form of scalar dynamic structural equations derived from the VARMA system. This feature facilitates the construction of procedures which, from the perspective of macroeconomic modeling, can be efficacious in that they do not rely on VAR approximations. Techniques that are applicable to both asymptotically stationary and unit-root, partially nonstationary (cointegrated) time series models are presented. The inferential potential of the techniques is illustrated via simulation experiments that use data generating mechanisms based on real world examples drawn from the time series literature. Aspects of the Kronecker invariants that impinge on practical application and that have not hitherto been discussed in the literature are explored. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We show that an optimal allocation of experts is extremely asymmetric. To reach the optimal allocation, therefore, one needs only to rank the experts in terms of their abilities and then allocate adjacent experts such that an expert's ability tends to vary inversely with the size of his committee. In the special case of three-member committees, we show that the optimal allocation maximizes the sum of the products of the experts' skills in each committee. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

For example, in contrast to the traditional understanding, tournaments may be dominated by piece rates even if workers are risk-neutral. The paper also offers a strikingly simple characterization of the optimal tournament for quadratic costs and CARA utility, as well as an extension to large tournaments. (C) 2015 The Author.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the effects of ill health on consumptive activities are spontaneously considered in a health state valuation exercise and how much this matters. The survey enrolled patients with inflammatory bowel disease in Germany (n=104). Patients were randomized to explicit and no explicit instruction for the consideration of consumption and leisure effects in a time trade-off (TTO) exercise. Explicit instruction to consider non-health-related utility in TTO exercises did not influence TTO scores. However, spontaneous consideration of non-health-related utility in patients without explicit instruction (60% of respondents) led to significantly lower TTO scores. Results suggest an inclusion of consumption costs in the numerator of the cost-effectiveness ratio, at least for those respondents who spontaneously consider non-health-related utility from treatment. Results also suggest that exercises eliciting health valuations from the general public may include a description of the impact of disease on consumptive activities.

We demonstrate a best practice pragmatic approach to estimate the incremental costs of new technologies in low-income and middle-income countries, using the example of costing the scale-up of Xpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)/resistance to riframpicin (RIF) in South Africa. Materials and methodsWe estimate costs, by applying two distinct approaches of bottom-up and top-down costing, together with an assessment of processes and capacity. ResultsThe unit costs measured using the different methods of bottom-up and top-down costing, respectively, are $US16.9 and $US33.5 for Xpert MTB/RIF, and $US6.3 and $US8.5 for microscopy. The incremental cost of Xpert MTB/RIF is estimated to be between $US14.7 and $US17.7. While the average cost of Xpert MTB/RIF was higher than previous studies using standard methods, the incremental cost of Xpert MTB/RIF was found to be lower. ConclusionCosts estimates are highly dependent on the method used, so an approach, which clearly identifies resource-use data collected from a bottom-up or top-down perspective, together with capacity measurement, is recommended as a pragmatic approach to capture true incremental cost where routine cost data are scarce.","[Cunnama, Lucy; Sinanovic, Edina; Ramma, Lebogang; Foster, Nicola] Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Hlth Econ Unit, ZA-7925 Cape Town, South Africa; [Berrie, Leigh; Stevens, Wendy; Molapo, Sebaka; Marokane, Puleng] Natl Hlth Lab Serv, Natl Prior Programmes, Johannesburg, South Africa; [McCarthy, Kerrigan; Churchyard, Gavin; Vassall, Anna] Aurum Inst Hlth Res, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Churchyard, Gavin] Univ Witwatersrand, Sch Publ Hlth, Johannesburg, South Africa; [Churchyard, Gavin] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England",University of Cape Town; National Health Laboratory Service; University of Witwatersrand; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Cunnama, L (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Cape Town, Fac Hlth Sci, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Hlth Econ Unit, Anzio Rd, ZA-7925 Observatory, South Africa.",lucy.cunnama@uct.ac.za,"Sinanovic, Edina/AAR-2590-2020; Cunnama, Lucy/AAK-3159-2021; Ramma, Lebogang/AAT-1732-2021; Foster, Nicola/AAA-9040-2020; Cunnama, Lucy/AAQ-6468-2021","Cunnama, Lucy/0000-0003-2134-4905; Ramma, Lebogang/0000-0001-9109-9103; Foster, Nicola/0000-0003-4630-6243; Churchyard, Gavin/0000-0002-4269-3699; McCarthy, Kerrigan/0000-0001-8958-9795; Vassall, Anna/0000-0002-2911-1375; Stevens, Wendy Susan/0000-0002-1684-908X",Medical Research Council [MC_PC_16021] Funding Source: researchfish,Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),,,32,65,66,1,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1057-9230,1099-1050,,HEALTH ECON,Health Econ.,FEB,2016,25.0,,,1.0,,,53,66,,10.1002/hec.3295,0.0,,,14,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DB9TF,26763594.0,"Green Published, hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000368859100006,0

CRC screening is the most effective way to prevent CRC death, but compliance with recommended screenings is very low. In this study, we investigate whether CRC screening behavior changed under state mandated private insurance coverage of CRC screening in a sample of insured adults from the 1997 to 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS). We present difference-in-difference-in-differences (DDD) estimates that compare insured individuals age 51 to 64 to Medicare age-eligible individuals (ages 66 to 75) in mandate and non-mandate states over time. Our DDD estimates suggest endoscopic screening among men increased by 2 to 3 percentage points under mandated coverage among 51 to 64year olds relative to their Medicare age-eligible counterparts. We find no clear evidence of changes in screening behavior among women. DD estimates suggest no evidence of a mandate effect on either type of CRC screening for men or women.

Within this group of compounds the antioxidants are included. The importance of antioxidants contained in food is associated with their ability to exert in vivo, in the human body, beneficial effects against chronical-degenerative diseases induced by oxidative stress and age. It has been attributed a positive role to grape polyphenols in terms of increase in endogenous antioxidant defenses, thanks to regulation of genes coding for key enzymes of antioxidant system. For the polyphenols it has also been recognized a specific action of tumor growth inhibition, linked to the modulation of enzymes involved in carcinogenesis or to the inhibition of growth factors and cell proliferation activation. After carbohydrates and acids, the phenolic compounds represent the largest group among grape constituents. The synthesis of these secondary metabolites takes place in two distinct phases of vine growth cycle: fruit set and maturation. The polyphenolic composition contributes to grapes and wine sensory properties, such as color, flavor, astringency, and determines the antioxidant capacity of the extract. These metabolites are mainly related to the variety and their content is influenced by climatic and environmental factors. Among the polyphenols, anthocyanins, hydroxicinnamiltartaric acids, flavonols, flavans, stilbene and resveratrol are of particular interest. Despite numerous studies in the vine-wine industry on polyphenols quantification and qualification, we don't know much about the environmental conditions that affect their synthesis in grapes and how they are extracted from it in wine production. Therefore, the aim of this work has been the study of antioxidant property and phenolic profile of ten autochthonous vines grown in two different areas of South Italy. By spectrophotometric analysis it has been possible to analyze qualiquantitive characteristics of such substances, while by ORAC method (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) we have measured, in vitro, the antioxidant action. The oenological potential has been evaluated, in relation to polyphenols content, of ten Vitis Vinifera varieties belonging to autochthonous vines of Basilicata, grown in espalier and tent in two areas: in the vineyard of Val d'Agri (PZ), in Basilicata, and in South-East Bari area, in Rutigliano (Ba), in Puglia. The ten varieties belonging to Southern Italy autochthonous vines include four black grapes and six white grapes. Data obtained on total polyphenols content, view of the considerable variability encountered, allow us to affirm that the polyphenolic ripening of wine grapes, thus the reaching of the maximum level, is very influenced by the terroir, defined as the cultivation area or environment, by season trend, by cultivation techniques and by the different vines nutritional conditions. The same holds true for the antioxidant activity of the 10 wine grapes varieties of this study, since it is closely related to the polyphenol content.","[Milella, Rosa Anna; Mastrofranceseo, Lisa; Alba, Vittorio; Giannandrea, Maria Angela; Gasparro, Marica; Caputo, Angelo Raffaele] CREA UTV Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Unita Ric Uva Tavola & Vitivinicoltura Ambiente M, Via Casa Massitna 148, I-70010 Turi, Ba, Italy; [Pisani, Rosa] Univ Ferrara, Fac Farm, I-44121 Ferrara, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); University of Ferrara,"Milella, RA (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåCREA UTV Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr, Unita Ric Uva Tavola & Vitivinicoltura Ambiente M, Via Casa Massitna 148, I-70010 Turi, Ba, Italy.",,"Gasparro, Marica/AAP-9506-2021; Alba, Vittorio/AAC-5455-2021","Alba, Vittorio/0000-0001-5317-0589",,,,,13,1,1,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1019.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701019,0.0,,,5,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"gold, Green Submitted, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700019,0
J,"Cseh, A; Koford, BC; Phelps, RT",,,,"Cseh, Attila; Koford, Brandon C.; Phelps, Ryan T.",,,Hospital Utilization and Universal Health Insurance Coverage: Evidence from the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act,APPLIED HEALTH ECONOMICS AND HEALTH POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Objective The Affordable Care Act is currently in the roll-out phase. To gauge the likely implications of the national policy we analyze how the Massachusetts Health Care Reform Act impacted various hospitalization outcomes in each of the 25 major diagnostic categories (MDC). Methods We utilize a difference-in-difference approach to identify the impact of the Massachusetts reform on insurance coverage and patient outcomes. This identification is achieved using six years of data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We report MDC-specific estimates of the impact of the reform on insurance coverage and type as well as length of stay, number of diagnoses, and number of procedures. Results The requirement of universal insurance coverage increased the probability of being covered by insurance. This increase was in part a result of an increase in the probability of being covered by Medicaid. The percentage of admissions covered by private insurance fell. The number of diagnoses rose as a result of the law in the vast majority of diagnostic categories. Our results related to length of stay suggest that looking at aggregate results hides a wealth of information. The most disparate outcomes were pregnancy related. The length of stay for newborn babies and neonates rose dramatically. In aggregate, this increase serves to mute decreases across other diagnoses. Also, the number of procedures fell within the MDCs for pregnancy and child birth and that for new-born babies and neonates. Conclusions The Massachusetts Health Care Reform appears to have been effective at increasing insurance take-up rates. These increases may have come at the cost of lower private insurance coverage. The number of diagnoses per admission was increased by the policy across nearly all MDCs. Understanding the changes in length of stay as a result of the Massachusetts reform, and perhaps the Affordable Care Act, requires MDC-specific analysis. It appears that the most important distinction to make is to differentiate care related to new-born babies and neonates from that related to other diagnostic categories.","[Cseh, Attila] Valdosta State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Valdosta, GA 31698 USA; [Koford, Brandon C.] Weber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA; [Phelps, Ryan T.] Stephen F Austin State Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, Nacogdoches, TX 75962 USA",University System of Georgia; Valdosta State University; Utah System of Higher Education; Weber State University,"Koford, BC (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåWeber State Univ, Dept Econ, Ogden, UT 84408 USA.",brandonkoford@weber.edu,,,,,,,12,5,7,0,8,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

The Italian recommendations for HPV vaccines consider only females. The BEST II study (Bayesian modelling to assess the Effectiveness of a vaccination Strategy to prevent HPV-related diseases) evaluates 1) the cost-effectiveness of immunization strategies targeting universal vaccination compared with cervical cancer screening and female-only vaccination and 2) the economic impact of immunization on various HPV-induced diseases. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate whether female-only vaccination or universal vaccination is the most cost-effective intervention against HPV. Methods: We present a dynamic Bayesian Markov model to investigate transmission dynamics in cohorts of females and males in a follow-up period of 55 years. We assumed that quadrivalent vaccination (against HPV 16, 18, 6, and 11) is available for 12-year-old individuals. The model accounts for the progression of subjects across HPV-induced health states (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and head/neck cancer as well as anogenital warts). The sexual mixing is modeled on the basis of age-, sex-, and sexual behavioral-specific matrices to obtain the dynamic force of infection. Results: In comparison to cervical cancer screening, universal vaccination results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1,500. When universal immunization is compared with female-only vaccination, it is cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of (sic)11,600. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows a relatively large amount of parameter uncertainty, which interestingly has, however, no substantial impact on the decision-making process. The intervention being assessed seems to be associated with an attractive cost-effectiveness profile. Conclusions: Universal HPV vaccination is found to be a cost-effective choice when compared with either cervical cancer screening or female-only vaccination within the Italian context.","[Haeussler, Katrin; Baio, Gianluca] UCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Marcellusi, Andrea; Mennini, Francesco Saverio] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Fac Econ, Econ Evaluat & HTA, Rome, Italy; [Marcellusi, Andrea] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Demog, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Mennini, Francesco Saverio; Favato, Giampiero; Capone, Alessandro] Kingston Univ London, Inst Leadership & Management Hlth, London, England; [Picardo, Mauro] San Gallicano Dermatol Inst IRCCS, Lab Cutaneous Pathophysiol, Rome, Italy; [Garganese, Giorgia; Scambia, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Bononi, Marco] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dept Surg Pietro Valdoni, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Costa, Silvano] Univ Bologna, S Orsola Malpighi Hosp, Dept Gynecol & Obstet, Bologna, Italy; [Zweifel, Peter] Univ Zurich, Socioecon Inst, Zurich, Switzerland",University of London; University College London; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Sapienza University Rome; Kingston University; IRCCS Istituti Fisioterapici Ospitalieri (IFO); IRCCS San Gallicano Dermatological Institute (ISG); Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Sapienza University Rome; IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna; University of Bologna; University of Zurich,"Haeussler, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUCL, Dept Stat Sci, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England.",k.haeussler@ucl.ac.uk,"Marcellusi, Andrea/AAL-6573-2020; Garganese, Giorgia/AAC-3397-2020; FAVATO, Giampiero/HKF-1477-2023; Baio, Gianluca/A-2947-2012; Picardo, Mauro/JOK-5462-2023; Scambia, Giovanni/K-7539-2016","FAVATO, Giampiero/0000-0003-3499-2979; Picardo, Mauro/0000-0003-4899-6639; Scambia, Giovanni/0000-0002-9503-9041; Marcellusi, Andrea/0000-0002-3974-3798; Baio, Gianluca/0000-0003-4314-2570",,,,,127,26,28,0,12,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,956,968,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.010,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686779.0,"Green Published, Green Submitted, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500003,0

It recently published a CEA of screening strategies for women at elevated risk of breast cancer. Although the strategies recommended by HIQA exceed Ireland's cost-effectiveness threshold, they can reasonably be welcomed as a pragmatic response to constraints on disinvestment and are expected to improve screening cost-effectiveness. What is not welcome, however, is HIQA's reporting of average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs) as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The distinction between ACERs and ICERs is well understood in CEA, as is the fact that ICERs not ACERs are the appropriate metric to determine cost-effectiveness. This article critiques HIQA's reporting, considering the implications for the particular case of breast cancer screening and the broader context of consistency of and confidence in CEA as a guide to resource allocation in Ireland. The reporting of ACERs as ICERs is unlikely to be of any great significance in the particular case of screening women at elevated risk of breast cancer, given likely constraints on disinvestment. Despite this, ICERs still need to be reported correctly. If thresholds are exceeded in certain cases, then it is important that decision makers appreciate by how much. More generally, using ACERs in some cases and ICERs in others raises concerns that methods are being applied inconsistently, which risks compromising confidence in CEA in Ireland. As Ireland's statutory CEA authority, HIQA has a special onus of responsibility to ensure established methods are applied correctly.

The results were tabulated and summarised as part of a narrative synthesis. Results A total of 27 economic evaluations [screening-related technologies (n = 11) and NBSPs (n = 16)] were identified. The majority of economic evaluations did not quantify the impact of information provision in terms of healthcare costs or outcomes. Five studies did include an estimate of the time cost associated with information provision. Four studies included a value to reflect the disutility associated with parental anxiety caused by false-positive results, which was used as a proxy for the impact of imperfect information. Conclusion A limited evidence base currently quantifies the impact of information provision on the healthcare costs and impact on the users of NBSPs; the parents of newborns. We suggest that economic evaluations of expanded NBSPs need to take account of information provision otherwise the impact on healthcare costs and the outcomes for newborns and their parents may be underestimated.","[Wright, Stuart J.; Jones, Cheryl; Payne, Katherine] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Dharni, Nimarta; Ulph, Fiona] Univ Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Psychol, Sch Psychol Sci, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England",University of Manchester; University of Manchester,"Payne, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Manchester, Manchester Ctr Hlth Econ, Inst Populat Hlth, Jean McFarlane Bldg,Oxford Rd, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.",katherine.payne@manchester.ac.uk,"Ulph, Fiona/AAD-5905-2022; Payne, Katherine/AAJ-3728-2020","Payne, Katherine/0000-0002-3938-4350; Ulph, Fiona/0000-0003-3590-6542; Jones, Cheryl/0000-0002-3024-225X; Wright, Stuart/0000-0002-4064-7998",National Institute for Health Research [11/62/02] Funding Source: researchfish; Department of Health [11/62/02] Funding Source: Medline,National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); Department of Health,,,78,8,8,1,15,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

For rational eaters, this information gap could be corrected by more labeling. As an alternative, this paper proposes a set of positive and negative taxes on the fattening and slimming nutrients in food rather than on the food itself. There are conditions under which this tax plus subsidy system could increase welfare by stopping unwanted weight gain while leaving the final retail price of food unchanged. A nutrient tax system could improve welfare if fattening nutrients, net of their effect on weight, are inferior goods and the fiscal cost of administering the tax is sufficiently low. More data on the price elasticity of demand for nutrients as well as data on how specific nutrients affect satiety and how total calorie intake would be necessary before one could be sure a nutrient tax would work in practice.

We show that although the asymptotic variance of the second-step GMM estimator may not have a closed form expression, it can be well approximated by sieve variances that have simple closed form expressions. We present consistent or robust variance estimation, Wald tests and Hansen's (1982) over-identification tests for the second step GMM that properly reflect the first-step estimated functions and the weak dependence of the data. Our sieve semiparametric two-step GMM inference procedures are shown to be numerically equivalent to the ones computed as if the first step were parametric. A new consistent random-perturbation estimator of the derivative of the expectation of the non-smooth moment function is also provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Growiec, J; Groth, C",,,,"Growiec, Jakub; Groth, Christian",,,On aggregating human capital across heterogeneous cohorts,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,GROWTH,"This paper studies the question: Can the microeconomic Mincerian (log-linear) functional relationship between human capital, years of schooling and work experience be recovered in some similar form at the macroeconomic level? A large macroeconomic literature assumes so, warranting that the question is of interest. We first examine the question at a theoretical level and find that except under very special assumptions, the answer is in the negative. On the other hand, we also show numerically that a macro-Mincer relationship can nevertheless be perceived as a quantitatively reasonable approximation of the theoretically derived true relationship, at least if the observed heterogeneity comes only from differences in the number of years of schooling, retirement age, or demographic survival laws.

Such settings are common in finance and other areas of economics. Our model allows for heterogeneous nonparametric covariate effects as well as unobserved time and individual specific effects that may depend on the covariates in an arbitrary way. To model the covariate effects parsimoniously, we impose a dimensionality reducing common component structure on them. In the theoretical part of the paper, we derive the asymptotic theory for the proposed procedure. In particular, we provide the convergence rates and the asymptotic distribution of our estimators. In the empirical part, we apply our methodology to a specific application that has been the subject of recent policy interest, that is, the effect of trading venue fragmentation on market quality. We use a unique dataset that reports the location and volume of trading on the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 companies from 2008 to 2011 at the weekly frequency. We find that the effect of fragmentation on market quality is nonlinear and non-monotonic. The implied quality of the market under perfect competition is superior to that under monopoly provision, but the transition between the two is complicated. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the redistribution-of-mass idea, we obtain bounds on the conditional distribution of differences of the model across periods, under conditional quantile restrictions together with a weak conditional independence assumption along the lines of Rosen (2012). The inversion of the distribution bounds characterizes the sharp identified set via a set of inequalities based on conditional quantile functions. Due to the presence of censoring, some of the inequalities defining the identified set hold trivially and have no identification power. Moreover, those trivial inequalities cause a difficulty in estimating the identified set. To deal with the issue, we propose a two-step estimation method, where the first step consists of excluding trivial inequalities and the second step performs minimization of a convex criterion function using the remaining inequalities. We establish asymptotic properties of the set estimator and also consider sufficient conditions under which point identification can be attained. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Despite publication of technical guides for the conduct of mapping research, guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a new checklist, which aims to promote complete and transparent reporting of mapping studies. Methods In the absence of previously published reporting checklists or reporting guidance documents, a de novo list of reporting items was created by a working group comprising six health economists and one Delphi methodologist. A two-round, modified Delphi survey, with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies and the biomedical journal editorial community, was used to identify a list of essential reporting items from this larger list. Results From the initial de novo list of 29 candidate items, a set of 23 essential reporting items was developed. The items are presented numerically and categorized within six sections: (1) title and abstract; (2) introduction; (3) methods; (4) results; (5) discussion; and (6) other. The MAPS statement is best applied in conjunction with the accompanying MAPS Explanation and Elaboration paper. Conclusion It is anticipated that the MAPS statement will improve the clarity, transparency and completeness of the reporting of mapping studies. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the MAPS statement is being co-published by seven health economics and quality-of-life journals, and broader endorsement is encouraged. The MAPS working group plans to assess the need for an update of the reporting checklist in 5 years' time.","[Petrou, Stavros; Froud, Robert] Univ Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Rivero-Arias, Oliver] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Natl Perinatal Epidemiol Unit, Oxford, England; [Dakin, Helen; Gray, Alastair] Univ Oxford, Hlth Econ Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England; [Longworth, Louise] Brunel Univ, Hlth Econ Res Grp, London, Uxbridge, England; [Oppe, Mark] EuroQol Res Fdn, Rotterdam, Netherlands; [Froud, Robert] Norges Helsehoyskole, Oslo, Norway",University of Warwick; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Brunel University,"Petrou, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Warwick, Warwick Med Sch, Warwick Clin Trials Unit, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England.",S.Petrou@warwick.ac.uk,"Froud, Robert/AAQ-2429-2021; Dakin, Helen A/X-2860-2018; Petrou, Stavros/ABD-8323-2021","Froud, Robert/0000-0002-9193-2297; Dakin, Helen A/0000-0003-3255-748X; Petrou, Stavros/0000-0003-3121-6050; Longworth, Louise/0000-0003-2512-4862; Gray, Alastair/0000-0003-0239-7278; Rivero-Arias, Oliver/0000-0003-2233-6544","MRC [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [1499410] Funding Source: researchfish; Medical Research Council [G0700452, G0501681] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [NF-SI-0509-10206] Funding Source: researchfish",MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),,,27,3,3,0,1,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objective To design a budget impact model as a planning tool for UK Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) looking to budget for greater use of anticoagulants in the AF population. Methods An Excel (R) model was developed to estimate the five-year impact of gradually treating all eligible patients with AF who are currently not being prescribed anticoagulants, both in terms of the effect on key clinical outcomes (strokes, major bleeds and mortality) and the associated financial impact. Results For a population of 251,693 (average CCG size) with an estimated 2626 prevalent patients and an additional 546 incident cases annually, the model estimated that increasing the proportion of the eligible AF patient population receiving anticoagulation by a fraction would require an additional budget of GBP139,961 in Year 1 to treat an additional 314 patients. This would rise to GBP1,004,900 in Year 5 to treat an additional 2242 patients, with all eligible patients treated by this year. The price year was 2014. Over the 5-year timeframe, this could lead to the prevention of 24 strokes and 29 deaths, with an increase of 31 major bleeds. Conclusions The clinical benefits of appropriate anticoagulation are widely recognised; however, full implementation can be difficult and costly. Therefore, the development of models can support the planning process by facilitating discussion among stakeholders on how best they can reach full implementation. The model is flexible and can be adapted to suit different payers.","[Shields, Gemma E.; Chapman, Ann-Marie] BresMed, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England; [Bates, Alexander E.] Yorkshire & Humber Commissioning Support, Bradford, W Yorkshire, England",,"Shields, GE (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåBresMed, North Church House,84 Queen St, Sheffield S1 2DW, S Yorkshire, England.",gshields@bresmed.co.uk,"Shields, Gemma/F-2042-2018","Shields, Gemma/0000-0003-4869-7524",,,,,43,4,5,0,6,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Specifically, we merge information on individual characteristics from the German Socio-Economic Panel (1984-2009) with detailed local labour market characteristics, and we then exploit the longitudinal component of the data to determine how immigration affects the health of both immigrants and natives over time. We find that immigrants to Germany are healthier than natives upon their arrival (the healthy immigrant effect) but that immigrants' health deteriorates over time. We show that the convergence in health is heterogeneous across immigrants and occurs more rapidly among those working in more physically demanding jobs. Because immigrants are significantly more likely to work in strenuous occupations, we investigate whether changes in the spatial concentration of immigrants affect the health of the native population. Our results suggest that immigration reduces the likelihood that residents will report negative health outcomes. We show that these effects are concentrated in blue-collar occupations and are stronger among low-educated natives. Improvements in natives' average working conditions and workloads help explain the positive effects of immigration on the health of the native population. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we focus attention on implied volatilities covering a wide range of moneyness (strike/underlying stock price), which load differentially on the different latent state variables. We conduct a similar analysis for high-frequency observations on the VIX volatility index as well as on futures written on it. We find that the innovations over small time scales in the risk-neutral intensity of the negative jumps in the S&P 500 index, which is the dominant component of the short-maturity out-of-the-money put implied volatility dynamics, are best described via non-Gaussian shocks, i.e., jumps. On the other hand, the innovations over small time scales of the diffusive volatility, which is the dominant component in the short-maturity at-the-money option implied volatility dynamics, are best modeled as Gaussian with occasional jumps.

Using Add Health data on secondary schools in the U.S., we investigate whether these effects partly flow through the eating habits channel. Adolescents are assumed to interact through a friendship social network. We propose a two-equation model. The first equation provides a social interaction model of fast food consumption. To estimate this equation we use a quasi maximum likelihood approach that allows us to control for common environment at the network level and to solve the simultaneity (reflection) problem. Our second equation is a panel dynamic weight production function relating an individual's Body Mass Index z-score (zBMI) to his fast food consumption and his lagged zBMI, and allowing for irregular intervals in the data. Results show that there are positive but small peer effects in fast food consumption among adolescents belonging to a same friendship school network. Based on our preferred specification, the estimated social multiplier is 1.15. Our results also suggest that, in the long run, an extra day of weekly fast food restaurant visits increases zBMI by 4.45% when ignoring peer effects and by 5.11%, when they are taken into account.

Methods: A literature search was performed on the PubMed search engine to identify trial based, nonexperimental prospective studies or model-based full economic evaluations carried out in Italy from 1995 to 2013. The studies were randomly assigned to four reviewers who applied a detailed checklist to assess the generalizability and quality of reporting. The review process followed a three-step blinded procedure. The reviewers who carried out the data extraction were blind as to the name of the author(s) of each study. Second, after the first review, articles were reassigned through a second blind randomization to a second reviewer. Finally, any disagreement between the first two reviewers was solved by a senior researcher. Results: One hundred fifty-one economic evaluations eventually met the inclusion criteria. Over time, we observed an increasing transparency in methods and a greater generalizability of results, along with a wider and more representative sample in trials and a larger adoption of transition-Markov models. However, often context specific economic evaluations are carried out and not enough effort is made to ensure the transferability of their results to other contexts. In recent studies, cost-effectiveness analyses and the use of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were preferred. Conclusions: Despite a quite positive temporal trend, generalizability of results still appears as an unsolved question, even if some indication of improvement within Italian studies has been observed.

Methods: A Technical Expert Panel was assembled by the American Medical Association-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement.

Recommended methods for addressing each identified consideration were developed on the basis of published patient-reported outcome (PRO) standards and refined through public comment. Literature review focused on programs using PROs to assess performance and on PRO guidance documents. Results: Thirteen PRO programs and 10 guidance documents were identified. Nine best practices were developed, including the following: provide a rationale for measuring the outcome and for using a PRO PM; describe the context of use; select a measure that is meaningful to patients with adequate psychometric properties; provide evidence of the measure's sensitivity to differences in care; address missing data and risk adjustment; and provide a framework for implementation, interpretation, dissemination, and continuous refinement.

Objectives: To analyze determinants of utility in CHF and drivers of change over 1 year in a large sample from clinical practice. Methods: We included 5334 patients from the Swedish Heart Failure Registry with EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire information available following inpatient or outpatient care during 2008 to 2010; 3495 had 1-year follow-up data Utilities based on Swedish and UK value sets were derived. We applied ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-part models for utility at inclusion and OLS regression for change over 1 year, all with robust standard errors. We assessed the predictive accuracy of both models using cross-validation. Results: Patients' mean age was 73 years, 65% were men, 19% had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or more, 23% had 40% to 49%, 27% had 30% to 39%, and 31% had less than 30%. For both models and value sets, utility at inclusion was affected by sex, age, New York Heart Association class, ejection fraction, hemoglobin, blood pressure, lung disease, diabetes, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, nitrates, antiplatelets, and diuretics. The OLS model performed slightly better than did the two-part model on a population level and for capturing utility ranges. Change in utility over 1 year was influenced by age, sex, and (measured at inclusion) disease duration, New York Heart Association class, blood pressure, ischemic heart disease, lung disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and antiplatelets. Conclusions: Utilities in CHF and their change over time are influenced by diverse demographic and clinical factors. Our findings can be used to target clinical interventions and for economic evaluations of new therapies.","[Berg, Jenny] Karolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Div Cardiovasc Epidemiol, Solna, Sweden; [Berg, Jenny] OptumInsight, Stockholm, Sweden; [Lindgren, Peter] Karolinska Inst, Dept Learning Informat Management & Eth, Med Management Ctr, Solna, Sweden; [Lindgren, Peter] IVBAR, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mejhert, Marit] Ersta Hosp, Dept Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Mejhert, Marit] Karolinska Inst, Danderyd Hosp, Dept Clin Sci, Div Cardiovasc Med, Stockholm, Sweden; [Edner, Magnus] Karolinska Univ Hosp, Karolinska Inst, Heart Res Unit, Solna, Sweden; [Dahlstrom, Ulf] Linkoping Univ, Dept Cardiol, Linkoping, Sweden; [Dahlstrom, Ulf] Linkoping Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden",Karolinska Institutet; Optum; Karolinska Institutet; Ersta Sjukhus; Karolinska Institutet; Danderyds Hospital; Karolinska Institutet; Karolinska University Hospital; Linkoping University; Linkoping University,"Berg, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåKarolinska Inst, Inst Environm Med, Box 210, SE-17177 Stockholm, Sweden.",jenny.berg@ki.se,"Francolini, Iolanda/I-3025-2019; Kahan, Thomas/CAE-8515-2022; Lindgren, Peter/AID-5379-2022","Francolini, Iolanda/0000-0002-0180-2334; Lindgren, Peter/0000-0002-8238-8189",,,,,39,24,25,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,439,448,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.003,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091598.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600011,0

Our primary concern is solidarity: When the environment changes, agents should gain or lose together. Welfare dominance under preference replacement requires this conclusion when the preferences of one agent change. Instead of requiring solidarity for all possible changes in preferences, we introduce a parameterized solidarity property, epsilon-welfare dominance, which requires the conclusion of welfare dominance only for arbitrarily small changes in preferences. In this model, welfare dominance and efficiency characterize a class of target rules, each of which selects the efficient point nearest to its target (Thomson, 1993). Although our property is weaker than and distinct from welfare dominance, it also characterizes the target rules when combined with efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We consider both the sharp and fuzzy regression discontinuity designs and treat the regression functions as nonparametric. The proposed inference procedures do not require asymptotic variance estimation and the confidence sets have natural shapes, unlike the conventional Wald-type method. These features are illustrated by simulations and an empirical example which evaluates the effect of class size on pupils' scholastic achievements. Furthermore, for the sharp regression discontinuity design, we show that the empirical likelihood statistic admits a higher-order refinement, so-called the Bartlett correction. Bandwidth selection methods are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J,"Hall, PG; Racine, JS",,,,"Hall, Peter G.; Racine, Jeffrey S.",,,Infinite order cross-validated local polynomial regression,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Model selection; Efficiency; Rates of convergence,EIGENVALUES,"Many practical problems require nonparametric estimates of regression functions, and local polynomial regression has emerged as a leading approach. In applied settings practitioners often adopt either the local constant or local linear variants, or choose the order of the local polynomial to be slightly greater than the order of the maximum derivative estimate required. But such ad hoc determination of the polynomial order may not be optimal in general, while the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth presents some interesting theoretical and practical challenges. In this paper we propose a data-driven approach towards the joint determination of the polynomial order and bandwidth, provide theoretical underpinnings, and demonstrate that improvements in both finite-sample efficiency and rates of convergence can thereby be obtained. In the case where the true data generating process (DGP) is in fact a polynomial whose order does not depend on the sample size, our method is capable of attaining the rate often associated with correctly specified parametric models, while the estimator is shown to be uniformly consistent for a much larger class of DGPs. Theoretical underpinnings are provided and finite-sample properties are examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Concomitantly, a regional institution that develops pharmacotherapeutic guidelines implemented two educational interventions also aiming at promoting rational statin and PPI prescribing. Utilizing a prescription database, we estimated the effect of the interventions on drug utilization and cost of statins and PPIs over time. We measured the effect of the interventions within an implementation and a control region. The implementation region included prescriptions from the province of Groningen where the educational intervention was implemented and where the health insurer is most active. The control region comprised all other provinces covered by the database. We modelled the effect of the intervention using a state-space approach. Significant differences in prescribing and cost patterns between regions were observed for statins and PPIs. These differences however were mostly related to the concurrent interventions of Proeftuin Farmacie Groningen. We found no evidence indicating a significant effect of the rational prescribing intervention on the prescription patterns of statins and PPIs. Our estimates on the economic impact of the Proeftuin Farmacie Groningen interventions indicate that educational activities as such can achieve significant cost savings.

The consistency with rates and the asymptotic normality of the GEL estimator are obtained by properly restricting the growth rates of the dimensions of the parameters and the moment restrictions, as well as the degree of data dependence. It is shown that even in the high dimensional time series setting, the GEL ratio can still behave like a chi-square random variable asymptotically. A consistent test for the over-identification is proposed. A penalized GEL method is also provided for estimation under sparsity setting. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To evaluate and compare the economic impact of MR and RI!' consolidation versus observation, respectively, following the firstline induction therapy for patients with advanced-stage FL. Methods: We developed Markov models to estimate patients' lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years (LYs) after MR, RI'!', and observation following frontline FL treatment from the US payer's perspective. Progression risks, adverse event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical data of Primary Rltuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First line Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between MR/RI!' and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared with observation, MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391 LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively, and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained was $40,335 (PRIMA) or $37,412 (ECOG) for MR and $40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before first progression, whereas RI'!' had higher incremental costs of adverse events due to higher incidences of cytopenias. Conclusions: MR and RIT following frontline FL therapy demonstrated favorable and similar cost-effectiveness profiles. The model results should be interpreted within the specific clinical settings of each trial. Selection of MR, RIT, or observation should be based on patient characteristics and expected trade-offs for these alternatives.","[Chen, Qiushi; Ayer, Turgay] Georgia Inst Technol, H Milton Stewart Sch Ind & Syst Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA; [Nastoupil, Loretta J.; Rose, Adam C.; Flowers, Christopher R.] Emory Univ, Dept Hematol & Med Oncol, Sch Med, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Nastoupil, Loretta J.; Flowers, Christopher R.] Emory Univ, Winship Canc Inst, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology; Emory University; Emory University,"Flowers, CR (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEmory Univ, 1365 Clifton Rd,NE Bldg B,Suite 4302, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",crflowe@emory.edu,"Flowers, Christopher R/F-1953-2010; Chen, Qiushi/AAE-5002-2020","Rose, Adam/0000-0002-3054-7088",Spectrum,Spectrum,Partial support for this study was provided by Spectrum.,,49,29,32,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,189,197,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.12.017,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773554.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300009,0

Methods: The search strategy, developed by an information specialist, included four groups of terms related to measure, health, children and young people, and psychometric performance. The search was limited to publications from 1992. Five electronic databases and two online specific PROM databases were searched. Two groups of reviewers independently screened all abstracts for eligible PROMs. Descriptive characteristics of the eligible PROMs were collected, and items and domains of each questionnaire were mapped onto the ICS-CY chapters. Results: We identified 35 PROMs, of which 29 were generic PROMs and 6 were preference-based measures. Many PROMs cover a range of aspects of health; however, social functioning is represented most often. Content covered differs both in which aspects of health are assessed and whether individual questions focus on functioning (what the subject can or does do) and/or wellbeing (how the subject feels about a certain aspect of his or her health). Conclusions: A broad variety of PROMs is available to assess children's health. Nevertheless, only a few PROMs can be used across all age ranges to 18 years. When mapping their content on the ICF-CY, it seems that most PROMs exclude at least one major domain, and all conflate aspects of functioning and well-being in the scales.","[Janssens, Astrid; Coon, Jo Thompson; Rogers, Morwenna; Allen, Karen; Green, Colin; Logan, Stuart; Morris, Christopher] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Peninsula Cerebra Res Unit, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Janssens, Astrid; Coon, Jo Thompson; Rogers, Morwenna; Allen, Karen; Green, Colin; Logan, Stuart; Morris, Christopher] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, NIHR PenCLAHRC, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England; [Jenkinson, Crispin] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Populat Hlth, Oxford, England; [Tennant, Alan] Univ Leeds, Dept Rehabil Med, Leeds, W Yorkshire, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter; University of Oxford; University of Leeds,"Janssens, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Exeter, PenCRU, Salmon Pool Lane, Exeter EX2 4SG, Devon, England.",a.janssens@exeter.ac.uk,"Janssens, Astrid/I-1227-2019; Coon, Jo Thompson/C-7923-2017","Janssens, Astrid/0000-0001-8419-0937; Thompson Coon, Jo/0000-0002-5161-0234; Morris, Christopher/0000-0002-9916-507X; Rogers, Morwenna/0000-0002-6039-238X; Logan, Stuart/0000-0002-9279-261X; Tennant, Alan/0000-0002-0728-2130",National Institute for Health Research Library [10/2002/16]; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services [10/2002/16]; NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC); charity Cerebra; National Institute for Health Research [10/2002/16] Funding Source: researchfish,National Institute for Health Research Library; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Services(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); NIHR Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care of the South West Peninsula (PenCLAHRC); charity Cerebra; National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"This article is part of a report published by the National Institute for Health Research Library (Project 10/2002/16).

We investigated the growth and characteristics of CUAs in the peerreviewed English-language literature through 2012. Methods: We analyzed data from the 'tufts Medical Center Cost Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) Registry, a database containing more than 3700 English-language CUAs published through 2012. We summarized various study characteristics (e g, intervention type, funding source, and journal of publication) and methodological practices (e g, use of probabilistic sensitivity analysis) over three time periods: 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, and 2010 to 2012. We also examined CUAs by country, region, and the degree to which diseases studied correlate with disease burden. Results: The number of published CUAs rose from 34 per year from 1990 to 1999 to 431 per year from 2010 to 2012. The proportion of studies focused on the United States declined from 61% during 1990 to 1999 to 35% during 2010 to 2012 (P < 0.0001). Although still small compared with CUAs in higher income countries, the number of CUAs focused on lower and middle-income countries has risen sharply. A large fraction of studies pertain to pharmaceuticals (46% during 2010-2012). In recent years, most studies included probabilistic sensitivity analysis (67% during 2010-2012). Journals publishing CUAs vary widely in the percentage of their studies funded by drug companies. Some conditions, such as injuries, have high burden but few CUAs. Conclusions: Our review reveals considerable growth and some change in the cost-utility literature in recent years.

We focus on whether a patient receives a major intervention in the form of either a coronary artery by-pass or angioplasty. We find strong evidence that treatment intensity declines after a cap on non-economic damages. The probability of receiving a major intervention in the form of either an angioplasty or bypass declines by 1.25-2 percentage points after non-economic damage caps are enacted, and this effect is larger a year or two after reform. However, we also find clear evidence of substitution between major interventions. When doctors have discretion to perform a by-pass and patients have insurance coverage, caps on non-economic damages increase the probability that a by-pass is performed. The effect of non-economic damage caps on costs is not always statistically significant, but in models with state-specific trends, total costs decline by as much as four percent. We conclude that tort reform reduces treatment intensity overall, even though it changes the mix of treatments.

We use exogenous variation in the probability of CS in a fuzzy regression discontinuity design. Using administrative Danish data, we exploit an information shock for obstetricians that sharply altered CS rates for breech babies. We find that CS decreases the child's probability of having a low APGAR score and the number of family doctor visits in the first year of life. We find no significant effects for severe neonatal morbidity or hospitalizations. While mothers are hospitalized longer after birth, we find no effects of CS for maternal post-birth complications or infections. Although the change in mode of delivery for the marginal breech babies increases direct costs, the health benefits show that CS is the safest option for these children. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The main contribution is to consider the negative correlation between the recovery rate and default probability by using an exponential function. Based on this function and reduced-form model, a pricing formula is obtained and solved by a characteristic equation. At last, this paper selects seven Chinese corporate bonds to do empirical research. The estimated parameters showed that a fixed RR will lead to great errors and thus stochastic RR is necessary. The results also indicate that the hazard rate has positive correlation with the interest rate, which means that the level of interest rate is still the main reason influencing a firm's credit risk.

This paper aims to examine the relationship between consistent historical high performance and firm overinvestment. Based on analysis of China's listed firms during 2001-2013, we calculate overinvestment level based on the methods of Biddle et al. and Chen et al. Based on pooled-sample, firm fixed effect and quantile regression models, this study finds that the overinvestment level are higher in the firms with consistent high historical performances. This phenomenon may be due to the problem of managerial self-attribution bias. Moreover, higher quality of corporate government can reduce this relationship though elevated supervision on top executives. It indicates that corporate governance mechanism may restrain managerial bias.","[Zhong Ma] Nanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Ge Tao] China Nucl Ind Huaxing Construct Co Ltd, Nanjing 210019, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Science & Technology,"Zhong, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNanjing Univ Sci & Technol, Sch Econ & Management, Nanjing 210094, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71172104, 71472088, 71173108]; Graduate Innovation Foundation of Jiangsu Province [CXZZI3_0227]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Graduate Innovation Foundation of Jiangsu Province,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71172104, 71472088, 71173108), the Graduate Innovation Foundation of Jiangsu Province (CXZZI3_0227)",,29,0,0,2,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1364,1369,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600184,0

We use a Salop model with a high-, middle-, and low-income region. In each region, a policy maker chooses health care quality to maximise the utility of its residents when health care costs are financed by general income taxation. In equilibrium, regions with higher income offer better quality, which creates an incentive for patient mobility from lower- to higher-income regions. Assuming a prospective payment scheme based on DRG-pricing, we find that lower non-monetary (administrative) mobility costs have (i) no effect on quality or welfare in the high-income region; (ii) a negative effect on quality but a positive effect on welfare for the middle-income region; and (iii) ambiguous effects on quality and welfare for the low-income region. Lower monetary mobility costs (copayments) might reduce welfare in both the middle- and low-income region. Thus, health policies that stimulate cross border patient mobility can be counterproductive when regions differ in income. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objectives: To present a systematic overview of the economic effects of DMPs with Markov models. The quality of the models is assessed, the method by which the DMP intervention is incorporated into the model is examined, and the differences in the structure and data used in the models are considered. Methods: A literature search was conducted; the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses statement was followed to ensure systematic selection of the articles. Study characteristics e.g. results, the intensity of the DMP and usual care, model design, time horizon, discount rates, utility measures, and cost-of-illness were extracted from the reviewed studies. Model quality was assessed by two researchers with two different appraisals: one proposed by Philips et al. (Good practice guidelines for decision-analytic modelling in health technology assessment: a review and consolidation of quality asessment. Pharmacoeconomics 2006;24:355-71) and the other proposed by Caro et al. (Questionnaire to assess relevance and credibility of modeling studies for informing health care decision making: an ISPOR-AMCP-NPC Good Practice Task Force report. Value Health 2014;17:174-82). Results: A total of 16 studies (9 on chronic heart disease, 2 on asthma, and 5 on diabetes) met the inclusion criteria. Five studies reported cost savings and 11 studies reported additional costs. In the quality, the overall score of the models ranged from 39% to 65%, it ranged from 34% to 52%. Eleven models integrated effectiveness derived from a clinical trial or a meta-analysis of complete DMPs and only five models combined intervention effects from different sources into a DMP. The main limitations of the models are bad reporting practice and the variation in the selection of input parameters. Conclusions: Eleven of the 14 studies reported cost-effectiveness results of less than $30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and the remaining two studies less than $30,000 per life-year gained. Nevertheless, if the reporting and selection of data problems are addressed, then Markov models should provide more reliable information for decision makers, because understanding under what circumstances a DMP is cost-effective is an important determinant of efficient resource allocation.","[Kirsch, Florian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Sch Management, Munich, Germany; [Kirsch, Florian] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Hlth Sci, Munich, Germany; [Kirsch, Florian] Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, Inst Hlth Econ & Hlth Care Management, Neuherberg, Germany; [Kirsch, Florian] German Ctr Diabet Res DZD, Neuherberg, Germany",University of Munich; University of Munich; Helmholtz Association; Helmholtz-Center Munich - German Research Center for Environmental Health,"Kirsch, F (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåLudwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Hlth Econ & Management, Ludwigstr 28 RG, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",UUf.kirsch@bwl.lmu.deUU,,,,,,,51,9,9,0,15,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,1039,1054,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.07.004,0.0,,,16,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987631.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300018,0

The model extends the standard one-period value-per-statistical-life model to three health prospects: healthy, ill, and dead. We derive willingness-to-pay values for prevention efforts that reduce a disease's incidence rate as well as for treatments that lower the corresponding health deterioration and mortality rates. We find that the demand value of prevention always exceeds that of treatment. People often overweight small risks and underweight large ones. We use the rank dependent utility framework to explore how the demand for prevention and treatment alters when people evaluate probabilities in a non-linear manner. For incidence and mortality rates associated with common types of cancers, the inverse-S shaped probability weighting found in experimental studies leads to a significant increase in the demand values of both treatment and prevention.

Jump-diffusions play an important role in modeling a variety of economic and financial variables. As a significant generalization of Li (2013), we propose a new closed-form expansion for transition density of Poisson driven jump-diffusion models and its application in maximum-likelihood estimation based on discretely sampled data. Technically speaking, our expansion is obtained by perturbing paths of the underlying model; correction terms can be calculated explicitly using any symbolic software. Numerical examples and Monte Carlo evidence for illustrating the performance of density expansion and the resulting approximate MLE are provided in order to demonstrate the practical applicability of the method. Using the theoretical results in Hayashi and Ishikawa (2012), some convergence properties related to the density expansion and the approximate MLE method can be justified under some standard sufficient (but not necessary) conditions.

Our methodology improves on previous contributions by (i) controlling for the endogeneity of victimisation and (ii) analysing the heterogeneous effect of victimisation along the whole distribution of well-being. Using fixed effects panel estimation, we find that both types of crimes reduce reported well-being to a large extent, with physical violence exerting a larger average effect than property crimes. Furthermore, using recently developed panel data quantile regression model with fixed effects, we show that the negative effects of both crimes are highly heterogeneous, with a monotonic decrease over the distribution of subjective well-being.

In 2007, the government-led Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) program was piloted in China, followed by a nationwide implementation in 2009. Different premium subsidies by government across cities and groups provide a unique opportunity to employ the instrumental variables estimation approach to identify the causal effects of health insurance on health. Using a national panel survey of the URBMI, we find that URBMI beneficiaries experience statistically better health than the uninsured. Furthermore, the insurance health benefit appears to be stronger for groups with disadvantaged education and income than for their counterparts. In addition, the insured receive more and better inpatient care, without paying more for services.

The tentative conclusion is that economic crises affect mortality rates (and presumably other measures of health) in the same way as less severe downturns - leading to improvements in physical health. The effects of severe national recessions in the USA appear to have a beneficial effect on mortality that is roughly twice as strong as that predicted by the elevated unemployment rates alone, while the higher predicted rate of suicides during typical periods of economic weakness is approximately offset during severe recessions. No consistent pattern is obtained for more localized economic crises occurring at the state level - some estimates suggest larger protective mortality effects while others indicate offsetting deleterious consequences.

The latter perspective accepts that people might face self-control problems when exposed to the immediate gratification from food. We exploit unique survey data for Switzerland in multinomial logit and ordered probit regressions to study (i) the covariates of obesity including indicators of self-control and (ii) the consequences of obesity on the subjective well-being of people with limited willpower.

However, we find little evidence to suggest a change between the relative contributions of the Brownian and jump components, as both comove.

It derives an explicit solution to the optimal marginal income tax rates in terms of the parameters of the model, and then rigorously shows the optimal marginal tax rate can be U-shaped, inverse U-shaped, strictly increasing, or strictly decreasing in the interior of skill levels, depending crucially on skill distribution. The numerical examples indicate that the optimal marginal tax rates can be W-shaped and inverse W-shaped in the interior of skill levels. The explicit solution to the optimal marginal income tax rate derived in this discrete model can be used to find optimal marginal income tax rates for an economy with any empirical skill distribution, without the need to estimate the density function of skill.

Objective: The aim of these analyses was to assess the ability of the RESQ-7 to reproduce findings based on RESQ-eD reports of the same symptoms. Methods: These analyses are based on data from patients with GERD with a partial response to PPI (ClinicalTrials.govidentifier: NCT00703534). Participants completed the RESQ-eD twice daily for 7 days and the RESQ-7 on day 7. Results: Data from 446 patients were available for these analyses. Symptom-level analyses showed that, for intensity, mean domain scores were higher for the RESQ-7 (range 1.49-2.72) than for the RESQ-eD (range 1.45-2.57); for frequency, scores were lower for the RESQ-7 (range 2.58-4.82) than for the RESQ-eD (range 4.22-6.24). Correspondence analyses of RESQ-7 and RESQ-eD mean domain scores indicated excellent agreement for intensity (correlation-concordance coefficient 0.77-0.83) and fair agreement for frequency (correlation-concordance coefficient 0.40-0.58). Mean RESQ-eD subscale intensity scores for GERD symptoms were higher for symptoms experienced during the daytime than for those occurring at nighttime. Symptom recall was not associated with peak or recency effects. Conclusions: Patients with GERD slightly overestimated the intensity of their reflux symptoms and markedly underestimated the frequency on weekly recall compared with twice daily reporting.","[Ryden, Anna; Halling, Katarina] AstraZeneca Gothenburg, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden; [Leavy, Olivia C.] Oxford Brookes Univ, Oxford, England; [Stone, Arthur A.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Psychol, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Stone, Arthur A.] Univ Southern Calif, USC Dornsife Ctr Self Report Sci, Los Angeles, CA USA",AstraZeneca; Oxford Brookes University; University of Southern California; University of Southern California,"Ryd√©n, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåAstraZeneca Gothenburg, S-43183 Molndal, Sweden.",anna.ryden@astrazeneca.com,"Stone, Arthur A./AAC-3610-2019","Leavy, Olivia/0000-0002-1503-5535","AstraZeneca Gothenburg, Sweden","AstraZeneca Gothenburg, Sweden(AstraZeneca)","This study was funded by AstraZeneca Gothenburg, Sweden.

This axiom can be interpreted as continuity or insensitivity of aggregated preferences with respect to the reported preferences. We show that bounded response together with a weak axiom imply dictatorship whenever there are four or more alternatives. This result shows that the continuity or the insensitivity of aggregated preferences, formulated as bounded response, with respect to the reported preferences is achieved only by dictatorship. Our result also offers a new perspective on Arrow's theorem: neither independence property nor informational efficiency in independence of irrelevant alternatives is necessary for the impossibility.

It shows that lattice-based monotone comparative statics can be used to weaken the existing sufficient conditions in a two-period model with Kreps-Porteus preferences for prudence and for a definitive relationship between risk aversion and the strength of the saving motive.

Peaks of pain intensity reported in patients with cancer had been invariably examined in the past years, providing relevant information for a better knowledge of this phenomenon and its treatment. The aim of this critical review was to provide the golden rules, namely, the 10 commandments, for a correct diagnostic pathway of BTcP and a consequent personalized pharmacological treatment. These are as follows: 1) assessment of background analgesia, 2) drugs used for background analgesia, 3) BTcP is a frequent phenomenon, 4) characteristics of BTcP, 5) diagnosis of BTcP, 6) continuous assessment, 7) tailored pharmacological treatment of BTcP, 8) selection of BTcP medication, 9) dosing BTcP medications, and 10) education. These steps may help clinicians to recognize and treat BTcP adequately.","[Mercadante, Sebastiano] La Maddalena Canc Ctr, Anesthesia & Intens Care & Pain Relief & Palliat, Via San Lorenzo 312, I-901456 Palermo, Italy; [Cuomo, Arturo] Natl Canc Inst, Anesthesia Intens Care & Pain Therapy, Naples, Italy",IRCCS Fondazione Pascale,"Mercadante, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåLa Maddalena Canc Ctr, Anesthesia & Intens Care & Pain Relief & Palliat, Via San Lorenzo 312, I-901456 Palermo, Italy.",terapiadeldolore@lamaddalenanet.it,"cuomo, arturo/AAL-4416-2020","mercadante, sebastiano/0000-0001-9859-6487",,,,,63,12,14,0,2,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,531,536,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.002,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565269.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600006,0

This health valuation study is the first to summarize the EQ-5D-Y on a QALY scale. Drawn from a nationally representative panel, 5207 adult respondents were asked to choose between two losses in child health-related quality of life. Based on their choices, a 1-year increase in child pain/discomfort from 'some' to 'a lot' equals a loss of 4 QALYs (95% CI, 3.8-4.4). Likewise, a 1-year increase in child anxiety/depression from 'a bit' to 'very worried, sad, or unhappy' equals a loss of 2 QALYs (95% CI, 1.9-2.2). These findings enable the integration of child-reported outcomes with adult preferences to inform economic analysis. Results inform both clinical practice and resource allocation decisions by enhancing understanding of difficult tradeoffs in child-reported outcomes.

Convincing evidence on the ability of such schemes to meet their objectives is scarce. This paper uses randomized control trials conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (India) to evaluate the effects of three CBHI schemes on healthcare utilization and expenditure. We find that the schemes have no effect on these outcomes. The results suggest that CBHI schemes of the type examined in this paper are unlikely to have a substantial impact on access and financial protection in developing countries.

These data were used to estimate the average pre-tax cost of new drug and biologics development. The costs of compounds abandoned during testing were linked to the costs of compounds that obtained marketing approval. The estimated average out-of-pocket cost per approved new compound is $1395 million (2013 dollars). Capitalizing out-of-pocket costs to the point of marketing approval at a real discount rate of 10.5% yields a total pre-approval cost estimate of $2558 million (2013 dollars). When compared to the results of the previous study in this series, total capitalized costs were shown to have increased at an annual rate of 8.5% above general price inflation. Adding an estimate of post-approval R&D costs increases the cost estimate to $2870 million (2013 dollars). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The rising life expectancy and increased availability of treatment options has likely increased the lifetime costs of people living with CF. In addition, a recent drug approval for a therapy that targets the cause of the disease is one of the most expensive drugs worldwide. In light of these circumstances, it is important to have an updated understanding of the costs of CF therapy and management. This study aims to determine the extent of available literature that quantifies CF costs. Methods We used a scoping review framework to identify the sources and types of evidence available to determine the costs of CF therapy and management compared to the general population or a comparable population of people with other complex chronic conditions. We searched 14 databases for peer-reviewed studies and grey literature published in English since 1998. The search was conducted in August 2013 and updated in October 2014. Results We identified 28 studies that estimated overall, general CF costs. Of these, three studies compare CF costs to healthcare costs of a general population and only one of those provides a direct comparison of CF costs to the general population in order to calculate the incremental cost associated with CF. We estimate there are 98 systematic reviews that quantify the costs of comparable conditions and potentially provide a comparison group for people with CF. Conclusions There is evidence available that attempts to quantify overall, general healthcare costs of people with CF, although much of it is outdated. However, there is much less evidence available that provides a comparison of these costs with either the general population or people with comparable conditions.","[Hollin, Ilene L.; Robinson, Karen A.] Johns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 N Broadway,Room 691, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA; [Robinson, Karen A.] Johns Hopkins Sch Med, Dept Med, 1830 E Monument St,Room 8068, Baltimore, MD 21287 USA",Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine,"Hollin, IL (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJohns Hopkins Bloomberg Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 624 N Broadway,Room 691, Baltimore, MD 21205 USA.",ilene.hollin@jhu.edu,"Hollin, Ilene/KDA-6056-2024","Hollin, Ilene/0000-0003-1405-8687",Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,Cystic Fibrosis Foundation(Italian Cystic Fibrosis Research Foundation),"The research and one author were funded by a grant from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills, which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a standard Mincer earnings function, by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right-hand side, overestimates the rate of return to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within generation earnings distribution, intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility. The paper finds that a tax-financed free preschool program for the children of poor socioeconomic status generates positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings, higher intergenerational earnings mobility, and schooling mobility.

Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the quality and summarize the available evidence from published economic evaluations reporting on the cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) compared with interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the screening of LTBI. Methods: An extensive systematic review of the published literature was conducted. A two-step process was adopted to identify relevant articles: information was extracted into evidence tables and then analyzed. The quality of the publications was assessed using a 10-item checklist specific for economic evaluations. Results: Twenty-eight studies were identified for inclusion in this review. Most of the studies found IGRAs to be more cost-effective than TSTs; however, the conclusions from the studies varied significantly. Most studies scored highly on the checklist although only one fulfilled all the stipulated criteria. A wide variety of methodological approaches were documented; identified differences included the type of economic evaluation and model, time horizon, perspective, and outcomes measures. Conclusions: The lack of consistent methods across studies makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about the most cost-effective option between TSTs and IGRAs. This problem can be solved by improving the quality of economic evaluation studies in the field of LTBI screening, through adherence to quality checklists.","[Koufopoulou, Maria; Sutton, Andrew John; Breheny, Katie; Diwakar, Lavanya] Univ Birmingham, Hlth Econ Unit, Birmingham, W Midlands, England",University of Birmingham,"Sutton, AJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Leeds, Leeds Inst Hlth Sci, Charles Thackrah Bldg,101 Clarendon Rd, Leeds LS2 9LJ, W Yorkshire, England.",a.j.sutton@leeds.ac.uk,"Diwakar, Lavanya/G-7425-2016","Diwakar, Lavanya/0000-0003-4369-6637; Breheny, Katie/0000-0001-6886-4049",,,,,49,6,11,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,267,276,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.006,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021762.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800019,0

This paper explores some of the methodological issues in eliciting societal preferences for BOI. Aims This study explores the impact of mode of administration and framing in a survey for eliciting societal preferences for BOI. Methods A pairwise comparison survey with six arms was conducted online and via face-to-face interviews, involving two different wordings of questions and the inclusion/exclusion of pictures. Respondents were asked which of two patient groups they thought a publically funded health service should treat, where the groups varied by life expectancy without treatment, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) without treatment, survival gain from treatment, and HRQOL gain from treatment. Responses across different modes of administration, wording and use of pictures were compared using chi-squared tests and probit regression analysis controlling for respondent socio-demographic characteristics. Results The sample contained 371 respondents: 69 were interviewed and 302 completed the questionnaire online. There were some differences in socio-demographic characteristics across the online and interview samples. Online respondents were less likely to choose the group with higher BOI and more likely to treat those with a higher QALY gain, but there were no statistically significant differences by wording or the inclusion of pictures for the majority of questions. Regression analysis confirmed these results. Respondents chose to treat the group with larger treatment gain, but there was little support for treating the group with higher BOI. Respondents also preferred to treat the group with treatment gains in life expectancy rather than HRQOL. Conclusions Mode of administration did impact on responses, whereas question wording and pictures did not impact on responses, even after controlling for the socio-demographic characteristics of respondents in the regression analysis.","[Rowen, Donna; Brazier, John; Keetharuth, Anju; Tsuchiya, Aki; Mukuria, Clara] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England; [Tsuchiya, Aki] Univ Sheffield, Dept Econ, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield; University of Sheffield,"Brazier, J (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",j.e.brazier@sheffield.ac.uk,"brazier, john e/B-1936-2008; Keetharuth, Anju/AAF-6799-2020; Tsuchiya, Aki/A-2167-2010","Tsuchiya, Aki/0000-0003-4245-5399; Rowen, Donna/0000-0003-3018-5109; Keetharuth, Anju/0000-0001-8889-6806; Brazier, John/0000-0001-8645-4780",Department of Health Funding Source: Medline,Department of Health,,,17,24,25,0,3,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This paper synthesises and appraises the literature on methodological frameworks - which incorporate economic evaluation evidence - for the purpose of setting healthcare priorities in LMICs. A systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Econlit and PubMed identified 3968 articles with a further 21 articles identified through manual searching. A total of 36 papers were eligible for inclusion. These covered a wide range of health interventions with only two studies including health systems strengthening interventions related to financing, governance and human resources. A little under half of the studies (39%) included multiple criteria for priority setting, most commonly equity, feasibility and disease severity. Most studies (91%) specified a measure of efficiency' defined as cost per disability-adjusted life year averted. Ranking of health interventions using multi-criteria decision analysis and generalised cost-effectiveness were the most common frameworks for identifying priority health interventions. Approximately a third of studies discussed the affordability of priority interventions. Only one study identified priority areas for the release or redeployment of resources. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for local capacity to conduct evaluations (including economic analysis) and empowerment of local decision-makers to act on this evidence.","[Wiseman, Virginia; Newall, Anthony T.] Univ New S Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia; [Wiseman, Virginia] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Mitton, Craig; Doyle-Waters, Mary M.] Univ British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V5Z 1M9, Canada; [Drake, Tom] Univ Oxford, Oxford, England; [Drake, Tom] Mahidol Univ, Bangkok 10700, Thailand; [Conteh, Lesong] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, London, England; [Onwujekwe, Obinna] Univ Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria; [Jan, Stephen] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Jan, Stephen] George Inst Global Hlth, Sydney, NSW, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of British Columbia; University of Oxford; Mahidol University; Imperial College London; University of Nigeria; University of Sydney; University of Sydney; George Institute for Global Health,"Wiseman, V (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv New S Wales, Sch Publ Hlth & Community Med, Samuels Bldg,Kensington Campus, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",Virginia.wiseman@lshtm.ac.uk,"Conteh, Lesong/ABE-9550-2020; Jan, Stephen/AAG-3333-2021; Wiseman, Virginia/AAH-5011-2021; Onwujekwe, Obinna/O-6232-2014","Conteh, Lesong/0000-0002-0719-3672; Jan, Stephen/0000-0003-2839-1405; Onwujekwe, Obinna/0000-0002-1214-4285; Drake, Tom/0000-0002-6781-6632; Wiseman, Virginia/0000-0002-7911-0741; Newall, Anthony/0000-0003-0836-1065","NHMRC; MRC [MR/K010174/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [MR/K010174/1, MR/K010174/1B] Funding Source: researchfish",NHMRC(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),"We would like to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

The proposed rank-based tests depend on the choice of scores, associated with a reference density that can freely be chosen. Under appropriate choices they are achieving the semiparametric efficiency bounds; when based on Gaussian scores, they moreover uniformly dominate their pseudo-Gaussian counterparts.

We study the case of Switzerland, where dispensing physicians face financial incentives to overprescribe and sell more expensive pharmaceuticals. Using comprehensive physician-level data, we exploit the regional variation in the dispensing regime to estimate causal effects. The empirical strategy consists of a doubly-robust estimation that combines inverse probability weighting with regression. Our main finding suggests that dispensing leads to higher drug costs on the order of 34% per patient.

We present a variant of Mas-Colell's theorem; but more than for its own sake, we use it to expose and illustrate recent techniques due to Keisler-Sun [31], as developed in Khan-Rath-Yu-Zhang [38], to translate a result on a large distributionalized economy (LDE) to a large individualized economy (LIE), when the former can be represented by a saturated or super-atomless measure space of consumers, as formalized in Keisler-Sun [31], Carmona-Podczeck [12] and Podczeck [63] respectively. This also leads us to identify, hitherto unnoticed, open problems concerning symmetrization of distributionalized equilibria of economies in their distributionalized formulations. In relating our result to the antecedent literature, we bring into salience the notions of (i)overriding desirability of the indivisible commodity, as in Hicks [25], Mas-Colell [51] and Yamazaki [83, 84], and of (ii) bounded marginal rates of substitution, as in Jones [29, 30] and Ostroy-Zame [60].

It is further shown that the number and the location of the thresholds can be consistently estimated. A near optimal convergence rate of the threshold parameters is also established.

Methods A previously published COPD Markov model accounting for disease progression and treatment discontinuation was used. Disease progression included the annual decline in forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and occurrence of any exacerbations. Efficacy in the model consisted of FEV1 improvement between baseline and 12 weeks and the annual risk ratio of having an exacerbation compared to placebo. These clinical efficacy inputs were derived from a 1-year head-to-head trial comparing glycopyrronium 50 mu g to tiotropium 18 mu g. Utility values and cost estimates were obtained from the literature. The base-case analysis was performed for a 3-year time horizon. Cost and effects were discounted with 3 % in accordance to Swedish guidelines. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Glycopyrronium was found to be less costly and more effective than tiotropium in moderate to severe COPD patients with cost savings of 5197 Swedish kronor ((sic)570, US$725) per patient over a 3-year time horizon. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that over 99 % of the iterations produced dominant results for glycopyrronium. Conclusion Glycopyrronium bromide 50 mu g once daily can be considered a cost effective alternative to tiotropium bromide 18 mu g once daily in the maintenance treatment of COPD patients in Sweden.","[Costa-Scharplatz, Madlaina] Novartis Pharma AB, Box 1150, S-18379 Stockholm, Sweden; [Stallberg, Bjorn] Uppsala Univ, Dept Publ Hlth & Caring Sci, Family Med & Prevent Med, Uppsala, Sweden; [Goyal, Pankaj; Gruenberger, Jean-Bernard] Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; [Asukai, Yumi] IMS Hlth, London, England; [Price, David] Univ Aberdeen, Ctr Acad Primary Care, Aberdeen, Scotland",Novartis; Uppsala University; Novartis; University of Aberdeen,"Costa-Scharplatz, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNovartis Pharma AB, Box 1150, S-18379 Stockholm, Sweden.",madlaina.costa-scharplatz@novartis.com,"Price, David/H-2837-2019","Price, David/0000-0002-9728-9992",,,,,30,7,7,0,5,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

HIV-infected individuals survive longer with treatment, but are less likely to transmit the disease. The standard coverage measure improves with the deaths of untreated individuals and does not consider the fact that some individuals may acquire the disease and die before receiving treatment, making it susceptible to overestimating the long-run performance of antiretroviral treatment programs. Objective: The objective was to propose an alternative coverage definition to better measure the long-run performance of HIV treatment programs. Methods: We introduced cumulative incidence-based coverage as an alternative to measure an HIV treatment program's success. To numerically compare the definitions, we extended a simulation model of HIV disease and treatment to represent a dynamic population that includes uninfected and HIV-infected individuals. Also, we estimated the additional resources required to implement various treatment policies in a resource-limited setting. Results: In a synthetic population of 600,000 people of which 44,000 (7.6%) are infected, and eligible for treatment with a CD4 count of less than 500 cells/mm(3), assuming a World Health Organization (WHO)-defined coverage rate of 50% of eligible people, and treating these individuals with a single treatment regimen, the gap between the current WHO coverage definition and our proposed one is as much as 16% over a 10-year planning horizon. Conclusions: Cumulative incidence-based definition of coverage yields a more accurate representation of the long-run treatment success and along with the WHO and other definitions of coverage provides a better understanding of the HIV treatment progress.","[Khademi, Amin] Clemson Univ, Dept Ind Engn, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Roberts, Mark S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Schaefer, Andrew; Roberts, Mark S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Ind Engn, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Roberts, Mark S.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Saure, Denis] Univ Chile, Dept Ind Engn, Santiago, Chile; [Nucifora, Kimberly; Braithwaite, Scott] NYU, Sch Med, Sect Value & Comparat Effectiueness, New York, NY USA",Clemson University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Universidad de Chile; New York University,"Khademi, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåClemson Univ, 130-D Freeman Hall, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.",Khadesni@clemson.edu,"; Saure, Denis/F-5598-2016","Schaefer, Andrew/0000-0002-0379-741X; Braithwaite, Ronald Scott/0000-0001-7067-3655; Saure, Denis/0000-0002-8123-5009","NIAAA NIH HHS [U24AA022007-01, R01 AA017385, U24 AA022007, R01AA017385-01] Funding Source: Medline",NIAAA NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute on Alcohol Abuse & Alcoholism (NIAAA)),,,30,0,0,0,17,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1113,1119,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.10.003,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686798.0,"hybrid, Green Accepted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500022,0

We argue that when choice is the outcome of some underlying internal conflict, the resulting choices may not be perfectly consistent across choice problems: an agent's ability to resist temptation may well depend on what alternatives are available to him. We generalize Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) so that self-control weakens in the presence of temptation. To model choices from menus explicitly, we consider a choice correspondence as well as a preference over menus and relax both the Independence axiom for the preference and the WARP condition for the choice correspondence. The model is shown to unify a range of well-known findings in the experimental literature on choice under risk and over time within a single specification. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In our data, very poor women are three times more likely to be obese and five times more likely to be severely obese than rich women. Despite this strong correlation, it remains unclear whether higher wealth causes lower obesity. In this paper, we use nationally representative panel data and exogenous wealth shocks (primarily inheritances and lottery wins) to shed light on this issue. Our estimates show that wealth improvements increase weight for women, but not men. This effect differs by initial wealth and weightan average-sized wealth shock received by initially poor and obese women is estimated to increase weight by almost 10 lb. Importantly, for some females, the effects appear permanent. We also find that a change in diet is the most likely explanation for the weight gain. Overall, the results suggest that additional wealth may exacerbate rather than alleviate weight problems.

J,"Zheng, BH; Zheng, C",,,,"Zheng, Buhong; Zheng, Charles",,,Fuzzy ranking of human development: A proposal,MATHEMATICAL SOCIAL SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,,ROBUSTNESS,In this paper we propose to measure human development as a fuzzy concept. We stress that there exists a great deal of vagueness in quantifying a country's level of human development; one such source of vagueness is the weighting scheme embedded in the well-publicized UNDP's Human Development Index (HDI). We propose to evaluate the resulting fuzziness in human development ranking with a truth value function. A truth value is simply a function of the probability that a randomly drawn bundle of weights will rank one country to have a higher HDI than another country. We derive simple and easily computable formulae for calculating the truth value. The method derived is equally applicable to fuzzy rankings with other composite indices. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Based on panel data from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old, we estimate a structural life-cycle model with bequests. Each individual's subjective survival rates in the future are estimated with data on his belief of survival probabilities to a target age. This estimation is build upon a Bayesian updating method developed in Gan et al. (2005). We find that life-cycle model using subjective survival rates performs better than using life-table survival rates in predicting wealth holdings. This result suggests that subjective survival expectations play an important role in deciding consumption and savings. In addition, the estimation results show that most bequests are involuntary or accidental. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We derive its asymptotic properties under a sequence of models sending the number of agents to infinity, which enables inference with only a single network observation.

Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron 50 mg compared with oral antimuscarinic agents in adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective. Methods: A Markov model including health states for symptom severity, treatment status, and adverse events was developed. Cycle length was 1 month, and the time horizon was 5 years. Antimuscarinic comparators were tolterodine extended release, solifenacin, fesoterodine, oxybutynin extended release and immediate release (IR), darifenacin, and trospium chloride modified release. Transition probabilities for symptom severity levels and adverse events were estimated from a mirabegron trial and a mixed treatment comparison. Estimates for other inputs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and total health care costs, including costs of drug acquisition, physician visits, incontinence pad use, and botox injections, were modeled. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from 367 (vs. solifenacin 10 mg) to 15,593 (vs. oxybutynin IR 10 mg) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of E20,000/QALY gained, the probability of mirabegron 50 mg being cost-effective ranged from 70.2% versus oxybutynin IR 10 mg to 97.8% versus darifenacin 15 mg. A limitation of our analysis is the uncertainty due to the lack of direct comparisons of mirabegron with other agents; a mixed treatment comparison using rigorous methodology provided the data for the analysis, but the studies involved showed heterogeneity. Conclusions: Mirabegron 50 mg appears to be cost-effective compared with standard oral antimuscarinic agents for the treatment of adults with OAB from a UK National Health Service perspective.","[Nazir, Jameel; Odeyemi, Isaac A.

We used a mixed effects logistic regression model to estimate physicians' choice of three alternative payment models: fee for service, enhanced fee for service, and blended capitation. We found that primary care physicians self-selected into payment models based on existing practice characteristics. Physicians with more complex patient populations were less likely to switch into capitation-based payment models where higher levels of effort were not financially rewarded. These findings suggested that investigations aimed at assessing the impact of different primary care reimbursement models on outcomes, including costs and access, should first account for potential selection effects.

The National Health Service bowel cancer screening programme introduced in 2006 is expected to improve population health on average and to worsen population health inequalities associated with deprivation and ethnicity - a classic case of intervention-generated inequality'. We demonstrate the distributional cost-effectiveness analysis framework by examining two redesign options for the bowel cancer screening programme: (i) the introduction of an enhanced targeted reminder aimed at increasing screening uptake in deprived and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods and (ii) the introduction of a basic universal reminder aimed at increasing screening uptake across the whole population. Our analysis indicates that the universal reminder is the strategy that maximises population health, while the targeted reminder is the screening strategy that minimises unfair variation in health. The framework is used to demonstrate how these two objectives can be traded off against each other, and how alternative social value judgements influence the assessment of which strategy is best, including judgements about which dimensions of health variation are considered unfair and judgements about societal levels of inequality aversion.

Whereas the focus of the existing literature has been on bias correcting the standard fixed effects OLS estimator (due to the well known incidental parameter bias), our focus here is on improving the quality of inference by relying on the bootstrap instead of the standard normal distribution when computing critical values for test statistics. In particular, we show by simulation that confidence intervals based on the normal distribution can be very distorted in finite samples. Instead, a bootstrap that resamples the residuals and generates the bootstrap observations recursively using the estimated autoregressive panel data model greatly reduces these distortions. We show that this recursive-design residual-based bootstrap fixed effects OLS estimator contains a built-in bias correction term that mimics the incidental parameter bias. Thus, this method can be used to approximate the bias (as well as the entire distribution) of the (biased) fixed effects OLS estimator. This is in contrast with two other methods we consider (a fixed-design residual-based bootstrap and a pairs bootstrap) whose distributions are incorrectly centered at zero. As it turns out, both the recursive-design and the pairs bootstrap are asymptotically valid when applied to the bias-corrected estimator, but the fixed-design bootstrap is not. In the simulations, the recursive-design bootstrap is the method that does best overall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This includes settings in which agents repeatedly interact and choose from an uncountable set of strategies. Dynamics exist for which the stochastically stable states differ from those of any reasonable finite discretization. When there are a finite number of rest points of the unperturbed dynamic, sufficient conditions for analogues of results from the finite state space literature are derived and studied.

One (administrative) measurement has location-/scale-normalized errors, but the other (survey) measurement has endogenous errors with arbitrary location and scale. For this setting of data combination, we derive closed-form identification of nonparametric regressions, and practical closed-form estimators that perform well with small samples. Applying this method to NHANES III, we study how obesity explains health care usage. Clinical measurements and self reports of BMI are used as two measurements with normalized errors and endogenous errors, respectively. We robustly find that health care usage increases with obesity.

Methods: We compared TCZ Mono (8 mg/kg monthly) with ADA Mono (40 mg every other week), using efficacy results from a head-to-head study, ADalimumab ACTemrA (ADACTA). We calculated the incremental cost per responder (achievement of American College of Rheumatology [ACR] 20% improvement criteria, ACR 50% improvement criteria, ACR 70% improvement criteria, or low disease activity score) for 'I'CZ versus ADA at 6 months. A patient level simulation was used to estimate the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of initiating treatment with TCZ Mono versus ADA Mono. Both drugs are followed by an etanerceptcertolizumab-palliative care sequence. Nonresponders discontinue at 6 months; responders experience a constant probability of discontinuation. Discontinuers move to the next treatment. ACR responses produce changes in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. We mapped the HAQ score to utility to estimate QALYs. Costs include those related to hospitalization and those related to treatment (drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, along with several scenario analyses. Results: Compared with ADA, TCZ was more effective, with an estimated 6-month incremental cost ranging from $6,570 per additional low disease activity score achiever to $14,265 per additional ACR 70% improvement criteria responder. The lifetime incremental costeffectiveness ratio was $36,944/QALY. Conclusions: TCZ Mono is projected to be cost-effective compared with ADA Mono in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis for whom methotrexate is not appropriate, from a US payer perspective.","[Carlson, Josh J.; Sullivan, Sean D.] Univ Washington, Sch Pharm, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Ogale, Sarika] Genentech Inc, San Francisco, CA 94080 USA; [Dejonckheere, Fred] F Hoffmann La Roche, Basel, Switzerland",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; Roche Holding; Genentech; Roche Holding,"Carlson, JJ (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Washington, Sch Pharm, 1959 NE Pacific Ave,H-375Q,Box 357630, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",carlsojj@u.washington.edu,,,"Genentech, Inc.","Genentech, Inc.(Roche HoldingGenentech)","Source of financial support: This research was supported by a contract from Genentech, Inc.",,37,25,29,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR,2015,18.0,2.0,,,,,173,179,,10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.013,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CD5GF,25773552.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000351115300007,0

Methods: A systematic literature review was performed to identify the relevant NMAs using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, and Health 'technology Assessment. The synthesis studies were evaluated using the Questionnaire to assess the relevance and credibility of the NMA. Results: Eleven NMAs evaluating NOACs among adults with nonvalvular AF were identified. Most NMAs included three large phase Ill randomized controlled trials, comparing NOACs to adjusted-dose warfarin (Randomized Evaluation of LongTerm Anticoagulation Therapy [RE-LY], Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation [ROCKETAF], and Apixaban for Reduction of Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atial Fibrillation [ARISTOTLE]). The main differences identified related to potential treatment effect modifiers regarding the mean time spent in therapeutic range (TTR) in the warfarin arm, the risk of stroke or systemic embolism across the trials (mean CHADS2 score: C = congestive heart failure, H = hypertension, A = older than age 75 years, D = diabetes mellitus, S2 = pfior stroke or history of transient ischemic attack) or primary versus secondary prevention, and type of populations used in the analysis.

In particular, methods are needed that can estimate models efficiently using very large datasets containing healthcare utilization data, clinical data, data from personal devices, and many other sources. Although very large, such datasets can also be quite sparse (ag., device data may only be available for a small subset of individuals), which creates problems for traditional regression models. Many machine learning methods address such limitations effectively but are still subject to the usual sources of bias that commonly arise in observational studies.

The success of pharmaceutical innovation over the last few decades has led to the availability of many off-patent drugs to treat disease areas with the greatest public health need. Therefore, the success of public health programs in improving the health status of the total population is highly dependent on the efficiency of generic drug policies. The objective of this article was to explore factors influencing the true efficiency of generic prescription drug policies in supporting public health initiatives in the developed world. Health care decision makers often assess the efficiency of generic drug policies by the level of price erosion and market share of generics. Drug quality, bioequivalence, in some cases drug formulations, supply reliability, medical adherence and persistence, health outcomes, and nondrug costs, however, are also attributes of success for generic drug policies. Further methodological research is needed to measure and improve the efficiency of generic drug policies. This also requires extension of the evidence base of the impact of generic drugs, partly based on real world evidence. Multicriteria decision analysis may assist policymakers and researchers to evaluate the true value of generic drugs.","[Kalo, Zoltan] Eatvos Lorand Univ ELTE, Fac Social Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary; [Kalo, Zoltan; Agh, Tamas; Inotai, Andras] Syreon Res Inst, Budapest, Hungary; [Holtorf, Anke-Peggy] Hlth Outcomes Strategies, Basel, Switzerland; [Holtorf, Anke-Peggy; Brixner, Diana] Univ Utah, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacotherapy, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Alfonso-Cristancho, Rafael] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Surg, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Shen, Jie] Abbott Prod Operat AG, Allschwil, Switzerland",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; ABB,"Kal√≥, Z (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåEotvos Lorand Univ, Fac Social Sci, Dept Hlth Policy & Hlth Econ, Pazmany P 1a, H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.",kalo@tatk.elte.hu,"Kalo, Zoltan/G-7582-2011","Kalo, Zoltan/0000-0001-7762-2607; Agh, Tamas/0000-0002-9609-0236; Holtorf, Anke-Peggy/0000-0002-4638-5351",Abbott,Abbott(Abbott Laboratories),"The writing of this article was supported in part by Abbott.

In the model introduced and studied here a link can be created unilaterally. When it is only supported by one of the two players the flow through the link suffers some degree of decay, but when it is supported by both the flow runs without friction. When the decay in links supported by only one player is maximal (i.e. there is no flow) we have a simple variation of Jackson and Wolinsky's connections model assuming no decay, while when flow in those links is perfect we have Bala and Goyal's two-way flow model without decay.

Therefore, Switzerland intends to promote MC by forcing health insurers to write MC contracts and introducing budgetary co-responsibility for ambulatory care physicians. A discrete choice experiment conducted in 2011 including 872 physicians reveals a strong preference heterogeneity with respect to network participation and alternative remuneration schemes. The number of physicians working in networks is unlikely to rise on a voluntary basis, while general practitioners are more likely to join networks than specialists with surgical activities. For physicians considering joining networks, cost savings are predicted to be higher than the estimated willingness-to-accept payments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We find positive migration effects on body mass index (BMI), mobility and self-reported health. No effects are found on depression and cognitive capacity. We find evidence that these positive outcomes are linked to an income effect which leads to improvements in diet and identify a reallocation of time use from subsistence farming to leisure and sleep which may have further beneficial effects.

Today, the time has changed and now the customers wish to experience an overall service delivery including the physical environment, employee behavior and food quality. Quality dining experience is an important factor for both the customers as well as the restaurants. Studies in the past have discussed that how food quality, physical environment, employee behavior and service carry out important effect on customers' dining experience. Thus the concept of customers' experiential value will be the key in restaurant service-quality studies. This paper throws light on how food and service quality, physical environment and employee behavior impacts on customers' dining experience. The objective of this study is to investigate the combined effects of mechanic, functional, and humanic clues on customer's dining experience in fine dining restaurants in Malaysian hospitality industry. Consequently, this leads to a quantitative research which examines the combined effects of the physical environment (Mechanic clues), behavior of employees (Humanic clues) and the quality of the food (Functional clues).","[Garg, Anshul] Taylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Taylor's University,"Garg, A (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåTaylors Univ, Subang Jaya, Malaysia.",Anshul.garg@taylors.edu.my,"Garg, Anshul/I-8862-2019","Garg, Anshul/0000-0001-8297-9256",,,,,68,0,0,1,9,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,695,712,,,,,,18,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900050,0

Data from 399 public-trading companies of China are collected as samples to validate the model. Our regression analysis on such data leads to the following findings: in the context of high supervision intensity, because of the weak influence of managerial discretion towards R&D investment, the impact of firm size towards R&D investment, which is mediated through managerial discretion, is also weakened. This leads to the negative correlation between firm size and R&D investment; on the other hand, in the context of low supervision intensity, the influence of managerial discretion towards R&D investment is significantly negative, and the correlation between firm size and R&D investment is strongly positive. Our results suggest that firm size could influence R&D investment through managerial discretion or some other intermediate variables.","[Huang Yue; Yang Nai-ding] Northwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Peoples R China",Northwestern Polytechnical University,"Huang, Y (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåNorthwestern Polytech Univ, Sch Management, Xian 710072, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,34,0,0,0,6,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,706,715,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600094,0

The basic idea is that by introducing additional assumptions about the nature of segregation, one obtains a more complete ranking of distributions. The paper demonstrates that the assumption of symmetry in types an assumption that appears frequently in the literature on segregation measurement has implications for both segregation curves and Blackwell's criterion.

This law aims to encourage productive' forms of competition by increasing the proportion of premium dollars spent on clinical benefits. To date, very little is known about the performance of firms in the individual health insurance market, including how MLRs are related to insurer and market characteristics. The MLR comprises one component of the price-cost margin, a traditional gauge of market power; the other component is percent of premiums spent on administrative expenses. We use data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (2001-2009) to evaluate whether the MLR is a good target measure for regulation by comparing the two components of the price-cost margin between markets that are more competitive versus those that are not, accounting for firm and market characteristics. We find that insurers with monopoly power have lower MLRs. Moreover, we find no evidence suggesting that insurers' administrative expenses are lower in more concentrated insurance markets. Thus, our results are largely consistent with the interpretation that the MLR could serve as a target measure of market power in regulating the individual market for health insurance but with notable limited ability to capture product and firm heterogeneity.

Biochemical indicators of blood (alanineaminotransferase, aspartateaminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, total cholesterol, HDL-fraction and LDL-fraction) and feed conversion rate were analyzed to determine the overall health status of the experimental animal. Diet enriched with 2.5% fish oil significantly decreased (P<0.05) aspartateaminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase, but there was no change (P>0.05) in alanineaminotransferase. Diet enriched with 2.5% palm oil significantly decreased (P<0.05) aspartateaminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and also alanineaminotransferase. Both diets decreased (P<0.05) level of total cholesterol, although we expected a reduction only in the diet enriched with fish oil and increasing in the diet enriched with palm oil. The level of HDL-fraction was increased (P<0.05) in the diet enriched with palm oil, but not in the diet enriched with fish oil (P>0.05). The level of LDL-fraction was decreased (P<0.05) in both diets, which was expected in the diet enriched with fish oil, but not with palm oil. The level of urea was decreased (P<0.05) in both diets. The effect of diet enriched with 2.5% fish resp. palm oil to the feed consumption, body weight gains and feed conversion rate was tested - there were not significant differences (P>0.05) between two experimental diets.

The authors examine the impact of gifts on purchase of customer in a longitudinal field experiment In the first study, we set two groups, one of which receive free experience and the other group does not, and observe the change in their purchasing. The result shows that the participants who received free products for experience purchased significantly more than those who did not. In the second study, we manipulated several factors within the gift treatment: the sequence of gift value, which improved, or worsened. A highly detrimental effect of decreasing value occurred on total purchase volume.

Second, we use the nonparametric test and the regression analysis to test the experimental results. Third, through the analysis of the degree of punishment and the method of group decision-making, we get the optimal mechanism to control free-riding behavior.

Methods: We used the cross-sectional visit 5 data from the ARIC Study to assess the measurement properties of the MGLS. We measured the internal consistency using Cronbach a (where a > 0.70 is considered reliable for group-level measurement), the response frequency, and the inter item correlation. Factor analysis of the MGLS and five other adherence items in the survey was conducted using a polychoric correlation matrix to examine the dimensionality that underlies the MGLS. A vanishing tetrad test was conducted to assess conformity with an effect indicator model. Results: Among the ARIC visit 5 participants, 6,261 (96%) responded to the MGLS and other questions related to medication adherence in the survey (mean age 76 5 years, 59% women). The Cronbach a for the MGLS was 0.47. The inter-item correlations ranged from 0.11 to 0.26. In the factor analysis of the medication adherence survey questions, a three-factor solution was used. One factor captured the extent of nonadherence, whereas other factors focused on the reasons for nonadherence. The MGLS items spread out across the factors that reflect the extent of as well as the reasons for nonadherence. The results of the vanishing tetrad test indicated that the MGLS consists of items other than effect indicators (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The low reliability together with the factor analysis findings imply that the MGLS may reflect causes as well as the extent of medication adherence. The findings suggest that the MGLS, as presently used, lacks consistency in an elderly population.","[Beyhaghi, Hadi; Reeve, Bryce B.; Stearns, Sally C.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 1101 McGavran Greenberg Hall,CB 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Reeve, Bryce B.; Stearns, Sally C.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Cecil G Sheps Ctr Hlth Serv Res, 1101 McGavran Greenberg Hall,CB 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Rodgers, Jo E.] Univ North Carolina Chapel Hill, Eshelman Sch Pharm, Div Pharmacotherapy & Expt Therapeut, 1101 McGavran Greenberg Hall,CB 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina School of Medicine; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Beyhaghi, H (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv North Carolina Chapel Hill, Gillings Sch Global Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, 1101 McGavran Greenberg Hall,CB 7411, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",beyhaghi@live.unc.edu,"Reeve, Bryce/AAE-7657-2019","Rodgers, Jo/0000-0001-6016-0469; Beyhaghi, Hadi/0000-0003-2862-9663","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute [HHSN268201100005C, HHSN268201100006C, HHSN268201100007C, HHSN268201100008C, HHSN268201100009C, HHSN268201100010C, HHSN268201100011C, HHSN26820-1100012C]","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Heart Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI))","The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study is carried out as a collaborative study supported by contracts of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (grant nos.

In this paper, we study the effect of business cycle conditions on infant underweight, overweight, and obesity. We exploit eight waves of repeated cross-sectional data (19872012) of the Spanish National Health Survey for children aged 2-15 and use the regional unemployment rate of the trimester of the interview as a proxy for the business cycle phase at the local level. We find that an increase in the unemployment rate is associated with lower obesity incidence, especially for children under 6 years old and over 12 years old. However, economic shocks also proof to have potentially negative consequences as they increase the prevalence of infant underweight for the same age groups. Moreover, we show that the possible mechanisms through which the cycle is impacting infant obesity is the nutritional composition of the children's diet, as well as, increases in the frequency of exercise. We provide some evidence that suggests that the impact of business cycle conditions on infant weight disorders have little objective health consequences in the short run. However, the potential long-term effects may become important as underweight during childhood is associated with worse outcomes later in life.

Methods A patient-level simulation was developed to compare the costs and outcomes of IND/GLY versus SFC based on data from the LANTERN trial (NCT01709903). Monte-Carlo simulation methods were employed to follow individual patients over various time horizons. Population and efficacy inputs were derived from the LANTERN trial. Considering the payers' perspective, only direct costs were included. Costs and health outcomes were discounted annually at 3.0 % for all countries. Unit costs were taken from publically available sources with all costs converted to euros (sic). The cost base year was 2015. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the robustness of the model results. Results IND/GLY was found to be the dominant (more effective and less costly) treatment option compared with SFC in all four countries. The use of IND/GLY was associated with mean total cost savings per patient over a lifetime of (sic) 6202, (sic) 1974, (sic) 1611, and (sic) 220 in Canada, France, Italy, and Portugal, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that exacerbation rates had the largest impact on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The probability of IND/GLY being cost effective was estimated to be >95 % for thresholds above (sic) 5000/QALY. Conclusion In patients with moderate to severe COPD, IND/GLY is likely to be a cost-effective treatment alternative compared with SFC.","[Maleki-Yazdi, M.

Results indicate that the establishment of a state organ donor registry leads to an increase in donation rates of approximately 8%, while the adoption of FPC legislation has no effect on the supply of organ donors.

Such a property provides interesting analyses by allowing one to separate the within-group contribution to total inequality from the between-group contribution. A limitation of the current method of decomposition is that, depending on the structure absolute, relative, compromise of the inequality index, specific weights have to be used. To avoid such a problem, we propose a unique decomposition property where the weighting functions depend on the size of the population and the mean income. This allows us to characterize a large family of weakly decomposable inequality indices without any recourse to implicit invariance value judgments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the spirit of Hart (1974), consumers purchase financial assets in period 0 and consume in period 1. We differ from Hart by considering that each agent is a country. We provide conditions for the existence of an equilibrium in both international financial assets and goods markets. First, we introduce a weaker notion of Uncovered Interest (rate) Parity (UIP) called Weak Uncovered Interest (rate) Parity (WUIP), and we show its equivalence to the no-arbitrage condition in the international financial markets. Second, we introduce the concept of common no arbitrage and we show its equivalence to the UIP. These results bridge concepts of no arbitrage in general equilibrium theory and financial microeconomics, and of interest parity in international financial macroeconomics. In a multi-country model with many currencies and only one good, we introduce a country-specific conversion rate which transforms the returns on assets valued in local currency into units of physical good. We define also the exchange rates between currencies of different countries. The UIP is required for the existence of an equilibrium in both international financial assets and goods markets and for the existence of the Law of One Price. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

It is known that unmodelled trend breaks can result in tests which are incorrectly sized under the null hypothesis and inconsistent under the alternative hypothesis. Extant procedures in this literature have attempted to solve this inference problem but require the practitioner to either assume that the trend break date is known or to assume that any trend break cannot occur under the co-integration rank null hypothesis being tested. These procedures also assume the autoregressive lag length is known to the practitioner. All of these assumptions would seem unreasonable in practice. Moreover in each of these strands of the literature there is also a presumption in calculating the tests that a trend break is known to have happened. This can lead to a substantial loss in finite sample power in the case where a trend break does not in fact occur. Using information criteria based methods to select both the autoregressive lag order and to choose between the trend break and no trend break models, using a consistent estimate of the break fraction in the context of the former, we develop a number of procedures which deliver asymptotically correctly sized and consistent tests of the co-integration rank regardless of whether a trend break is present in the data or not. By selecting the no break model when no trend break is present, these procedures also avoid the potentially large power losses associated with the extant procedures in such cases.

I consider an inducement model of the role of financial relationships in health care markets, where consulting payments induce physicians to use more devices of the firms that sponsor them. To test the model, I exploit a policy shock, whereby government monitoring of payments to joint replacement surgeons resulted in declines of over 60% in both total payments and in the number of physicians receiving payments from 2007 to 2008. Using hospital discharge data from three states, I find that the loss of payments leads physicians to switch 7 percentage points of their device utilization from their sponsoring firms' devices to other firms' devices, an effect which is concentrated among surgeons with low switching costs. These results offer support for the inducement model. I also find evidence of an increase in medical productivity following the policy intervention, which suggests conditions under which regulation of financial relationships would be socially beneficial.

They cover logit, probit, ordered probit, Poisson and Tobit models that are important for many empirical applications in micro and macroeconomics. Our estimators use analytical and jackknife bias corrections to deal with the incidental parameter problem, and are asymptotically unbiased under asymptotic sequences where N/T converges to a constant.

J,"Maasoumi, E; Racine, JS",,,,"Maasoumi, Esfandiar; Racine, Jeffrey S.",,,A solution to aggregation and an application to multidimensional 'well-being' frontiers,JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,INDEXES,"We propose a new technique for identification and estimation of aggregation functions in multidimensional evaluations and multiple indicator settings. These functions may represent latent objects. They occur in many different contexts, for instance in propensity scores, multivariate measures of well-being and the related analysis of inequality and poverty, and in equivalence scales. Technical advances allow nonparametric inference on the joint distribution of continuous and discrete indicators of well-being, such as income and health, conditional on joint values of other continuous and discrete attributes, such as education and geographical groupings. In a multi-attribute setting, quantiles are frontiers that define equivalent sets of covariate values. We identify these frontiers nonparametrically at first. Then we suggest parametrically equivalent characterizations of these frontiers that reveal likely weights for, and substitutions between different attributes for different groups, and at different quantiles. These estimated parametric functionals are ideal aggregators in a certain sense which we make clear. They correspond directly to measures of aggregate well-being popularized in the earliest multidimensional inequality measures in Maasoumi (1986). This new approach resolves a classic problem of assigning weights to multiple indicators such as dimensions of well-being, as well as empirically incorporating the key component in multidimensional analysis, the relationship between the indicators. It introduces a new way for robust estimation of quantile frontiers, allowing complete assessments, such as multidimensional poverty measurements. In our substantive application, we discover extensive heterogeneity in individual evaluation functions. This leads us to perform robust, weak uniform rankings as afforded by tests for multivariate stochastic dominance. A demonstration is provided based on the Indonesian data analyzed for multidimensional poverty in Maasoumi and Lugo (2008). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The TANF policies have been credited with increased employment for single mothers and a dramatic drop in welfare caseload. Our results show that these policies also had a significant effect on various measures of children's medical utilization among low-income families. These health measures include a rating of the child's health status reported by the parents, the number of times that parents consulted a doctor, and the number of nights that the child stayed in a hospital. We compare the overall changes of health status and medical utilization for children with working and nonworking mothers. We find that the child's health status as reported by the parents is affected by the maternal employment status.

In addition, virtually no evidence exists from the African region. This study explores the impact of Zambia's Child Grant Program on a range of maternal health utilization outcomes using a randomized design and difference-in-differences multivariate regression from data collected over 24months from 2010 to 2012. Results indicate that while there are no measurable program impacts among the main sample, there are heterogeneous impacts on skilled attendance at birth among a sample of women residing in households having better access to maternal health services. The latter result is particularly interesting because of the overall low level of health care availability in program areas suggesting that dedicated program design or matching supply-side interventions may be necessary to leverage unconditional cash transfers in similar settings to impact maternal health.

We propose a two-stage estimator. Given consistent parameter estimates from the selection equation obtained in the first stage, we estimate the semiparametric outcome equation using data for the observed individuals whose likelihood of being selected into the sample stays approximately the same over time. The selection bias term is then asymptotically removed from the equation along with fixed effects using kernel-based weights. The proposed estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal.

Emerging universal healthcare policies prioritize reduction of poverty impact such as catastrophic and impoverishing healthcare expenditure. Poverty impact is therefore increasingly evaluated alongside and within economic evaluations to estimate the impact of specific health interventions on poverty. However, data collection for these metrics can be challenging in intervention-based contexts in LMICs because of study design and practical limitations. Using a set of case studies, this letter identifies methodological challenges in collecting patient cost data in LMIC contexts. These components are presented in a framework to encourage researchers to consider the implications of differing approaches in data collection and to report their approach in a standardized and transparent way.

Their interactions are governed by complex mechanisms, where both competition for resources and toxin production play important roles. Our goal is to understand key mechanisms that lead to coexistence. In this chapter we study many possible scenarios of microbial interactions and we analyze whether or not they can lead to coexistence of species. To achieve this we implemented agent- based models that mimic local dynamics of microbes; initially well mixed microbes from different species interact in a grid with a regular structure. Among others, we show that the coexistence rate is negatively correlated with the number of neighbors of each cell in the grid. Another observation is that the order of selection of focal cells in the grid influences the coexistence rate.","[Abrudan, Monica] Univ Manchester, Fac Life Sci, Michael Smith Bldg,Dover St, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Abrudan, Monica] Leiden Univ, Inst Biol, Sylvius Bldg,Sylviusweg 72, NL-2333 BE Leiden, Netherlands; [Stankova, Katerina] Maastricht Univ, Dept Data Sci & Knowledge Engn, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Stankova, Katerina] Delft Univ Technol, Delft Inst Appl Math, Mekelweg 4, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands",University of Manchester; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University; Maastricht University; Delft University of Technology,"Stankov√°, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåMaastricht Univ, Dept Data Sci & Knowledge Engn, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.;Stankov√°, K (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåDelft Univ Technol, Delft Inst Appl Math, Mekelweg 4, NL-2628 CD Delft, Netherlands.",ma14@sanger.ac.uk; li.you@maastrichtuniversity.nl; k.stankova@maastrichtuniversity.nl; f.thuijsman@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"Stankova, Katerina/0000-0002-4519-0325; Abrudan, Monica/0000-0003-0228-4353",,,,,30,3,3,0,4,BIRKHAUSER BOSTON,CAMBRIDGE,"675 MASSACHUSETTS AVE, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139-2333 USA",,,978-3-319-28014-1; 978-3-319-28012-7,ANN INT SOC DYN GAME,,,2016,14.0,,,,,,267,282,,10.1007/978-3-319-28014-1_13,0.0,,,16,"Economics; Mathematics, Interdisciplinary Applications; Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Mathematics; Mathematical Methods In Social Sciences,BG6CK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389946800013,0

As we can imagine, it was not a very successful venture. Later, other efforts were made by Jesuits in the seventeenth century. In 1739 Portugal prohibited the production of grapes and wine in the colony and this prohibition lasted until the Independence of Brazil in 1822. Although it is interesting to mention those fledgling efforts to produce wine in Brazil, the decisive impetus for the Brazilian wine industry only began with the Italian immigration of the late nineteenth century. These immigrants from Veneto and Trentino Alto Adige settled in the Serra Gaucha and received land from the government, for which they had to pay later. Some of today famous Brazilian wineries, like Miolo and Casa Valduga, began as small canteens initiated by Italian immigrants. These immigrants had not the intention to build a wine industry when they arrived in Brazil. The primary intention was to make wine for their own consumption provided that wine was considered as a food, a part of Italian culture and tradition, not simply an alcoholic beverage. Therefore, wine industry in Rio Grande do Sul emerged to supply a cultural demand of the Italian immigrants. A different motive can be identified in the reasons of the implementation of a wine industry in Sao Francisco Valley, backcountry of Northeast Brazil. We could say that the region became economically interesting since the development induced by investments in irrigation, conducted mainly by CODEVASF. Therefore, the drive for wine production in Serra Gaucha was culture, while the drive for Sao Francisco Valley wine industry was the business opportunities engendered by institutional policies conducted on the region. In this article, I will consider the history of wine industry in Serra Gaucha and in Sao Francisco Valley through the lens of Institutional Economics, initiated by Thorstein Veblen in the late nineteenth century, reworked by new institutionalists like Douglass North, and continued today by authors like Geoffrey Hodgson and others. I suggest three institutional dimensions that are usually considered by the seminal authors of Institutional Economics: (i) rules of the game, they are the formal and informal rules that structure human interaction; (ii) mental models, consistent of ideologies, habits of thought and all the internalized rules of the game; (iii) organizations, that are groups of individuals acting together with an at least temporary common purpose. The objective of this article is to tell the history of wine in Brazil and to compare the different motives for wine production in those two Brazilian regions. The question proposed in this article is: which institutional dimension was more important for the emergence of a wine industry in Serra Gaucha and Sao Francisco Valley? The hypothesis is that not only government policies in the Sao Francisco Valley were important for the emergence of a wine industry in Brazilian backcountry, but also the know-how acquired in winegrowing in Serra Gaucha. This article is divided in five parts. The first section introduces the topics proposed in the article. In the second section, the institutionalist theory will be presented, based on the idea of the three institutional dimensions. In the third section, the history of wine in the Serra Gaucha will be told. In the fourth section, the motives for a wine industry in Sao Francisco Valley will be presented. Finally, the fifth section concludes the article.","[Cavalcante, Carolina Miranda] Univ Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil",Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro,"Cavalcante, CM (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUniv Fed Rio de Janeiro, BR-21941 Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.",cmcavalcante@gmail.com,,,,,,,26,3,3,0,6,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,3025.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160703025,0.0,,,10,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700103,0

In the model, smoking causes weight loss in addition to having direct utility benefits and direct health consequences. It predicts that some individuals smoke for weight loss and that the practice is more common among those who consider themselves overweight and those who experience greater disutility from excess weight. We test these hypotheses using nationally representative data in which adolescents are directly asked whether they smoke to control their weight. We find that, among teenagers who smoke frequently, 46% of girls and 30% of boys are smoking in part to control their weight. As predicted by the model, this practice is significantly more common among those who describe themselves as too fat and among groups that tend to experience greater disutility from obesity. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for tax policy; specifically, the demand for cigarettes is less price elastic among those who smoke for weight loss, all else being equal. Public health efforts to reduce smoking initiation and encourage cessation may wish to design campaigns to alter the derived nature of cigarette demand, especially among adolescent girls.

To build the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI), a methodology deriving from both product and organizational LCA was developed and applied. The LCI was built using a bottom-up approach. Inventories were first built for a sample of 17 representative companies. Then, these inventories were scaled-up to complete the global LCI at the agrifood sector level. Potential environmental impacts were assessed for 8 indicators. The LCA results show potential environmental impacts for each life cycle step: grape production, wine making and aging, packaging, distribution and activity of stakeholders belonging to the close environment. It provided two main outcomes: (i) a methodology for the construction of an LCI adapted to the perimeter of an agrifood sector and composed by high quality data; and (ii) the identification of potential environmental impacts of the studied agrifood sector, providing assistance for the definition of their strategic orientations for the future.","[Penavayre, Sophie; Lempereur, Valerie; Huet, Andre-Paul] Inst Francais Vigne & Vin IFV, F-69661 Villefranche, France; [Gillet, Sarah; Pernet, Claire] BIVB, F-21200 Beaune, France; [Besnier, Antoine] Inst Corps Gras ITERG, F-33600 Pessac, France; [Farrant, Laura] CTCPA, F-32000 Auch, France; [Jolibert, Franck] UNGDA, F-92247 Malakoff, France",,"Penavayre, S (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåInst Francais Vigne & Vin IFV, F-69661 Villefranche, France.",,,,,,,,14,5,5,2,14,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1009.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701009,0.0,,,7,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700009,0

The text should be set to 1.15 line spacing. The abstract should be centred across the page, indented 15mm from the left and right page margins and justified. It should not normally exceed 200 words. Under this problematic context, several growers in our area proposed alternatives to conduction systems. An innovation was the system of divided canopy Rame, developed by the local viticulture Luis Alberto Ramero. This system was attempted to combine high yield with high quality grape, machanize harvest and good cinditions of canopy microclimate. It's a system of vertical shoot position, with its canopy divided into two planes. These systems are characterized, in our region, by a low foliar surface exposed per hectare, a relatively low productivity (in the case of the VSP) or difficulty to mechanize the harvest (in the case of the Parral). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ecophysiology of Rame system, determining if it behaves differently when it is planted with one or two plants by post (Rame single and double). Also the two modalities of Rame were compared with the trellis in VSP. Since this latter system is not included in the statistical, but planted design on the side of the test, the comparison kept a descriptive character. For the Rame we established an experimental trial with statistical design, with two treatments in trellis-training system. A treatment consisted in planting one vine per post, called simple Rame (RS) and two vines per post, called double Rame (RD), leaving in this way different number of plants per unit area (1600 plantas / has and 3200 plantas / has respectively). Nevertheless, regardless of the number of plants per hectare, Rame system maintain high values of anthocyanins (1, 2 mg/Kg of grapes) and IPT (43) with high production (152 qq / has). This fact, added to that the system has potential for mechanization, converts Rame in a trellis system with high potential for vine growth in the viticulture regions. The trellis VSP behaved less productive (86 qq / has), and at the same time obtained lower values of qualitative components such as anthocyanins (1.04 mg/Kg of grapes) and IPT (35).","[Valeria, Bergas; Jose, Rodriguez; Ignacio, Galarraga; Natalia, Carrillo; Andrea, Corvalan; Francisco, Gomez] UNCuyo, Fac Ciencias Agr, Catedra Viticultura, Ahnirante Brown 500, RA-5507 Mendoza, Argentina; [Hernan, Vila] INTA, Mendoza, Argentina",Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA),"Valeria, B (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåUNCuyo, Fac Ciencias Agr, Catedra Viticultura, Ahnirante Brown 500, RA-5507 Mendoza, Argentina.",vbergas@fca.uncu.edu.ar,,,,,,,5,0,0,0,8,E D P SCIENCES,CEDEX A,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE",2117-4458,,,BIO WEB CONF,,,2016,7.0,,,,,,,,1031.0,10.1051/bioconf/20160701031,0.0,,,3,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Food Science & Technology",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture; Food Science & Technology,BG6QG,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000390791700031,0

Although IV is commonly used in economics, the appropriate conditions for the use of genetic variants as instruments have not been well defined. The increasing availability of biomedical data, however, makes understanding of these conditions crucial to the successful use of genotypes as instruments.

Objective: This study aimed to collect health-related quality of life (HRQOL) data in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stratified by disease states. Methods: Men with metastatic CRPC were recruited via UK patient associations, patient panels, and specialist recruiters and classified into four subgroups reflecting disease state: asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic before chemotherapy, symptomatic before chemotherapy, receiving chemotherapy, and postchemotherapy. HRQOL data (including five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire [EQ-5D-5L] European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC QLQ-C30], and 25-item prostate cancer-specific questionnaire module designed to supplement the EORTC QLQ-C30) along with background and medical history data were collected via an online survey. The EQ-5D-5L and the EORTC-8D (EORTC-8D is an 8 dimensional utility index scored from QLQ-C30 data) were both used to estimate utilities. Results: Data were collected from a total sample of 163 men with metastatic CRPC. Utility values elicited by the EQ-5D-5L ranged from 0.830 for the asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic before chemotherapy disease state (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.795-0.865) to 0.625 for the symptomatic before chemotherapy disease state (95% CI 0.577-0.673). EORTC-8D utilities ranged from 0.856 (95% CI 0.831-0.882) to 0.697 (95% CI 0.664-0.731) for the same disease/treatment states. Conclusions: This online survey was designed to capture real-world HRQOL data describing men with CRPC. The study estimated utilities using two alternative methods, and the results show good agreement, suggesting that they are robust. This methodology offers a potentially higher quality alternative to vignette-based methods that are commonly used in oncology submissions.","[Lloyd, Andrew J.; Kerr, Cicely] ICON Patient Reported Outcomes, Oxford, England; [Kerr, Cicely; Penton, James; Knerer, Gerhart] Janssen Cilag Ltd, 50-100 Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe HP12 4EG, Bucks, England",ICON plc; Johnson & Johnson,"Kerr, C (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåJanssen Cilag Ltd, 50-100 Holmers Farm Way, High Wycombe HP12 4EG, Bucks, England.",ckerr8@its.jnj.com,"Penton, James/JZE-3681-2024","Penton, James/0000-0002-1747-0450; Kerr, Cicely/0000-0003-3921-0841",Janssen-Cilag Ltd,Janssen-Cilag Ltd,This study was funded by Janssen-Cilag Ltd and conducted by ICON plc.,,31,31,32,0,14,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2015,18.0,8.0,,,,,1152,1157,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.08.012,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DF3GG,26686802.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371231500026,0

Assuming that constituencies are of equal size within each of the administrative regions, the problem is equivalent to the apportionment problem, that is, the proportional allocation of voting districts among the administrative regions. We show that the principle of maximum admissible departure is incompatible with common apportionment properties, such as monotonicity and Hare-quota. When multiple apportionments satisfy the smallest maximum admissible departure property we find a unique apportionment by the repeated application of the property. The allotment such that the differences from the average district size are lexicographically minimized can be found using an efficient algorithm. This apportionment rule is a well-defined allocation mechanism compatible with and derived from the recommendation of the Venice Commission. Finally, we compare this apportionment rule with mainstream mechanisms using data from Hungary, Germany and the United States. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, we allow fixed effects to be correlated with the regressors to capture unobservable heterogeneity. Under a general spatial error dependence structure, we then establish some consistent closed-form estimates for both the unknown parameters and the link function for the case where both cross-sectional dimension (N) and temporal dimension (T) go to infinity. Rates of convergence and asymptotic normality are established for the proposed estimates. Our experience suggests that the proposed estimation method is simple and thus attractive for finite-sample studies and empirical implementations. Moreover, both the finite-sample performance and the empirical applications show that the proposed estimation method works well when the cross-sectional dependence exists in the data set.

For the definition of social networks, we used information on the doctors' place and time of study and their hospital work history. We found that GPs referred more patients to specialists within their personal networks and that patients referred within a social network had fewer follow-up consultations and less inpatient days thereafter. The effects on patient outcomes (e.g. waiting periods, days in hospital) of referrals within personal networks and affinity-based networks differed. Specifically, whereas empirical evidence showed a concentration on high-quality specialists for referrals within the personal network, suggesting that referrals within personal networks overcome information asymmetry with respect to specialists' abilities, the empirical evidence for affinity-based networks was different and less clear. Same-gender networks tended to refer patients to low-quality specialists. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The recent interest for wealth concerns, a kind of externality associated with herding behavior and other-regarding preferences, motivates a study of the general equilibrium exchange model with those externalities. The diffeomorphism of the equilibrium manifold with a Euclidean space, the smoothness and properness of the natural projection and its non-zero degrees are shown to hold true for endowment spaces with variable total resources. Other properties of the classical exchange model without externalities are fragile in the sense that they do not resist the introduction of wealth concerns even in models where consumers preferences are represented by the simplest forms of utility functions like the log-linear (or Cobb-Douglas) functions. The most notable fragile properties are the uniqueness and regularity of equilibrium at equilibrium allocations and the stability of no-trade equilibria. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In light of this, a number of recent papers have addressed volatility predictability, some from the perspective of the usefulness of jumps in forecasting volatility. Key papers in this area include Andersen et al. (2003), Corsi (2004), Andersen et al. (2007), Corsi et al. (2008), Barndorff et al. (2010), Patton and Shephard (2011), and the references cited therein. In this paper, we review the extant literature and then present new empirical evidence on the predictive content of realized measures of jump power variations (including upside and downside risk, jump asymmetry, and truncated jump variables), constructed using instantaneous returns, i.e.,vertical bar r(t)vertical bar(q), 0 <= q <= 6 in the spirit of Ding et al. (1993) and Ding and Granger (1996). We also present new empirical evidence on the predictive content of realized measures of truncated large jump variations, constructed using truncated squared instantaneous return, i.e., r(t)(2) x I-vertical bar rt vertical bar>gamma, where gamma is the threshold jump size. Our prediction experiments use high frequency price returns constructed using S&P500 futures data as well as stocks in the Dow 30, and our empirical implementation involves estimating linear and nonlinear heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) type models. We find that past large jump power variations help less in the prediction of future realized volatility, than past small jump power variations. Additionally, we find evidence that past realized signed jump power variations, which have not previously been examined in this literature, are strongly correlated with future volatility, and that past downside jump variations matter in prediction. Finally, incorporation of downside and upside jump power variations does improve predictability, albeit to a limited extent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis suggests that this is not necessarily the case under uncertainty. In the presence of uncertainty, the incumbent can set a limit price that affects the entry decision. Limit pricing involves a pre-entry price different from the static monopoly price, which leads to a signaling cost. We show that part of this cost can be distributed over several periods by means of consumer refunds from the MFC clause. If the discount factor is not very high, the incumbent adopts this pricing and prevents entry to a larger extent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using the only representative dataset that includes a module on childhood maltreatment for a metropolitan city in South Africa, we explore the association between different measures of childhood maltreatment and two educational outcomes (numeracy test scores and dropout). Our study provides an estimate of the association between childhood maltreatment and educational outcomes in a developing country where maltreatment is high. We control for potential confounders using a range of statistical techniques and add several robustness checks to evaluate the strength of our findings. Our results indicate that children who are maltreated suffer large adverse consequences in terms of their numeracy test scores and probability of dropout and that the estimated effects of maltreatment are larger and more consistent for the most severe type of maltreatment.

It is calculated in closed form and conveniently represented as a set of ordinary least squares regressions. 3PRF forecasts are consistent for the infeasible best forecast when both the time dimension and cross section dimension become large. This requires specifying only the number of relevant factors driving the forecast target, regardless of the total number of common factors driving the cross section of predictors. The 3PRF is a constrained least squares estimator and reduces to partial least squares as a special case. Simulation evidence confirms the 3PRF's forecasting performance relative to alternatives. We explore two empirical applications: Forecasting macroeconomic aggregates with a large panel of economic indices, and forecasting stock market returns with price-dividend ratios of stock portfolios.

Methods: Following the Core Model as guidance (European network for Health Technology Assessment. HTA core model for medical and surgical interventions. Available from: http://www.ennethta.eu/outputs/hta-core-model-medical-and-surical-interventions-10r. [Accessed May 27, 2014]), it is possible to apply the analytic hierarchy process to break down a problem into its constituent parts and identify priorities (i.e., assigning a weight to each part) in a hierarchical structure. Thus, it quantitatively compares the importance of multiple criteria in assessing health technologies and how the alternative technologies perform in satisfying these criteria. The verbal ratings are translated into a quantitative form by using the Saaty scale (Saaty TL. Decision making with the analytic hierarchy process. Int J Serv Sci 2008;1:83-98). An eigenvectors analysis is used for deriving the weights' systems (i.e., local and global weights' system) that reflect the importance assigned to the criteria and the priorities related to the performance of the alternative technologies. Results: Compared with the Core Model, this methodological approach supplies a more timely as well as contextualized evidence for a specific technology, making it possible to obtain data that are more relevant and easier to interpret, and therefore more useful for decision makers to make investment choices with greater awareness. Conclusions: We reached the conclusion that although there may be scope for improvement, this implementation is a step forward toward the goal of building a solid bridge between the scientific evidence and the final decision maker's choice.","[Ritrouato, Matteo; Faggiano, Francesco C.; Tedesco, Giorgia] Bambino Gesu Pediat Hosp, Hlth Technol Assessment & Safety Res Unit, Rome, Italy; [Derrico, Pietro] Bambino Gesu Pediat Hosp, Clin Technol lnnovat Res Area, Rome, Italy",IRCCS Bambino Gesu; IRCCS Bambino Gesu,"Ritrouato, M (ÈÄöËÆØ‰ΩúËÄÖ)ÔºåViale Ferdinando Baldelli n 41, I-00146 Rome, Italy.",matteo.ritrovato@opbg.net,"Faggiano, Francesco Cosimo/AAT-6104-2020; DERRICO, Pietro/AAA-6382-2020","Faggiano, Francesco Cosimo/0000-0001-5218-0515; Ritrovato, Matteo/0000-0003-3686-6108; DERRICO, PIETRO/0000-0002-8733-1042",,,,,18,23,30,2,30,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,505,511,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.002,0.0,,,7,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091605.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600018,0

Little is known about how limited monitoring must be if money is to be essential, though. Understanding sufficient conditions for the essentiality of money is important since monitoring is a natural way in which credit is introduced in monetary models. In this paper, we show that money can fail to be essential even if monitoring is quite limited. This indicates that one must be careful when introducing monitoring in monetary models to allow for the coexistence of money and credit. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the effects of Medicaid pass-through on nursing home staffing and quality of care by adapting a two-step FGLS method that addresses clustering and state-level temporal autocorrelation. We find that pass-through subsidies increases staffing by about 1% on average and 2.7% in nursing homes with a low share of Medicaid patients. Furthermore, pass-through subsidies reduce the incidences of pressure ulcer worsening by about 0.9%. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This latter methodology is essentially semiparametric, focusing on estimating long run parameters by means of cointegrating regressions. However, it is less used in practice than Johansen's approach, since its implementation requires prior knowledge of features such as the cointegrating rank and an appropriate set of non-cointegrated regressors. In this paper we develop a simple and automatic procedure (based on unit root and regression-based cointegration testing) which, without imposing a parametric specification for the short run components of the model, provides an estimator of the cointegrating rank and data-based just-identifying conditions for the cointegrating parameters which lead to a Phillips' triangular form. A Monte Carlo analysis of the properties of the estimator and an empirical application are also provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
