The complex and imprecise patterns of FP changes are explored by dominance-based rough set approach (DRSA) to find decision rules associated with FP changes. Companies may identify its underperformed criterion (gap) to conduct formal concept analysis (FCA) - by implication rules - to explore the source criteria regarding the underperformed gap. The source criteria are analysed by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) technique to explore the cause-effect relationship among the source criteria for guiding improvements; in the next, DEMATEL-based analytical network process (DANP) can provide the influential weights to form an evaluation model, to select or rank improvement plans. To illustrate the proposed method, the financial data of a real semiconductor company is used as an example to show the involved processes: from performance gaps identification to the selection of five assumed improvement plans. Moreover, the obtained implication rules can integrate with DEMATEL analysis to explore directional influences among the critical criteria, which may provide rich insights and managerial implications in practice.","[Shen, Kao-Yi] Chinese Culture Univ SCE, Dept Banking & Finance, Taipei 11114, Taiwan; [Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung] Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Urban Planning, Coll Publ Affairs, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan",National Taipei University,"Tzeng, GH (通讯作者)，Natl Taipei Univ, Grad Inst Urban Planning, Coll Publ Affairs, 151 Univ Rd, New Taipei 23741, Taiwan.",ghtzeng@gm.ntpu.edu.tw,"Shen, Kao-Yi/L-8926-2019; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/B-2775-2009; Shen, Simon/JJG-1572-2023","Shen, Kao-Yi/0000-0001-6659-2684; Tzeng, Gwo-Hshiung/0000-0003-1856-7497;",,,,,61,22,22,0,24,VILNIUS GEDIMINAS TECH UNIV,VILNIUS,"SAULETEKIO AL 11, VILNIUS, LT-10223, LITHUANIA",2029-4913,2029-4921,,TECHNOL ECON DEV ECO,Technol.

Although several recent improvements have enhanced the realism of standard models, we argue that major drawbacks still undermine their reliability. In particular, DSGE models still fail to recognize the complex adaptive nature of economic systems, and the implications of money endogeneity. The paper argues that a coherent and exhaustive representation of the inter-linkages between the real and financial sides of the economy should be a pivotal feature of every macroeconomic model and proposes a macroeconomic framework based on the combination of the Agent Based and Stock Flow Consistent approaches. The papers aims at contributing to the nascent AB-SFC literature under two fundamental respects: first, we develop a fully decentralized AB-SFC model with several innovative features, and we thoroughly validate it in order to check whether the model is a good candidate for policy analysis applications. Results suggest that the properties of the model match many empirical regularities, ranking among the best performers in the related literature, and that these properties are robust across different parameterizations. Second, the paper has also a methodological purpose in that we try to provide a set or rules and tools to build, calibrate, validate, and display AB-SFC models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Governments have raised taxes and cut spending in bad times and have expanded the size of the government in good times. Procyclical access to external borrowing and political economy distortions (e.g., common pool problems and asymmetric information) have been mentioned as culprit. The main goal of this article is to document the cyclical properties of fiscal policy in SSA and to test whether the cyclical stance can be influenced by structural and policy features of the economy, namely, institutional quality, policy space, resource abundance and state fragility among others. This article complements the existing literature on SSA by: (i) using an indicator of institutional quality that better captures economic institutions supporting policy frameworks and (ii) testing jointly the influence of structural and policy factors affecting the cyclicality of fiscal policy. Using annual information for 128 countries from 1970 to 2013, this article finds that stronger institutions and ample policy space do help to reduce the degree of procyclicality of fiscal policy for the majority of countries in the region. These findings call for African policymakers to: (i) deepen institutional reforms that will help them deliver sustainable and countercyclical responses and (ii) replenish liquidity and policy buffers in good times so as to be prepared for bad ones.","[Calderon, Cesar] World Bank, Africa Reg AFRCE, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Nguyen, Ha] World Bank, Dev Econ Res Grp DECRG, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; The World Bank,"Calderón, C (通讯作者)，World Bank, Africa Reg AFRCE, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",ccalderon@worldbank.org,,"Nguyen, Ha/0000-0003-4549-035X",,,,,51,15,18,1,1,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

However, domestic regulations, which apply to all firms alike and do not intend to exclude foreign sellers, are often seen as serious obstacles to cross-border trade in services. This paper proposes an assessment of the impact of these regulations on international trade of professional services. Our empirical analysis combines OECD measures of domestic regulation and detailed French data on firm-level bilateral export of professional services. Results show a robust and a sizeable negative impact of domestic regulations on both the decision to export and the values exported by each firm. This impact does not vary with firms' productivity, and remains significant when we focus on the European Union market, where French exporters do not face discriminatory barriers. We conduct a quantification exercise based on our estimates and find an average ad-valorem tariff equivalent of domestic regulations of 60% in 2007. The ad-valorem tariff equivalent ranges from 26% to 88%, depending on the country. (C) 2015 Association for Comparative Economic Studies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The gaps are driven mostly by a lower female labor force participation (LFP) in developing countries. Females began to participate more in the labor markets of these countries when more households acquired access to basic infrastructure and when distortive policies affecting the prices of household appliances were partially removed. I use a model of home production with endogenous labor force participation to account for these facts. I find that the prices of household appliances and access to infrastructure are quantitatively important in explaining cross-country labor supply differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

To assess the size of these intended effects of experience rating, this study provides an empirical analysis of the effects of DI experience rating in The Netherlands. We use a difference-in-difference approach with administrative matched firm- and worker data that exploits the removal of experience rating for small firms in 2003 and 2004. According to our results, removing experience rating caused an increase of DI inflow of about 7% for small firms, while DI outflow decreased by 12% as a result of the reform. We argue that these effects were largely confined to the first year of DI benefit receipt. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that drug advertising inspections are used by provincial governments to discriminate against firms from outside the province. We further reveal systematic patterns in the degree of discrimination across firms: those from neighboring areas, those from regions with more economic links to the destination province, those from provinces with a stronger presence in the market, and those with political ties to allied provincial governments are less likely to be targeted. Our findings highlight the unique politico-economic structure in China and confirm that giving local governments strong incentives to compete with each other may exacerbate the market distortions inherent in a partially reformed economy.

Lessons from a laboratory experiment,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL,,,English,Article,,,,,,Expansionary fiscal consolidation; Expectations; Intertemporal choice; Experimental macroeconomics,RICARDIAN EQUIVALENCE; POLICY; AUSTERITY; ADJUSTMENTS; MULTIPLIERS; UNCERTAINTY,"According to the expectations channel, a fiscal consolidation may give rise to less contractionary, or even expansionary effects on consumption, despite a decline in current disposable income. Intuitively, people may accumulate a stock of savings in anticipation of the consolidation and may start to reduce their savings to support consumption once it occurs. We design a laboratory experiment to study the conditions under which the expectations channel operates. Our results indicate that fiscal contractions that occur in an unsustainable fiscal environment exert less contractionary effects on consumption, which supports the expectations channel. We also find that the expectations channel is more pronounced if the fiscal authority can convincingly commit to abstain from tax increases in the future, whereas increasing subjects' level of awareness by running a transparent policy has only little influence on the outcomes.

A unique feature of our model is that the agent who provides the loan might have a low valuation for the collateral asset. Nevertheless, the lender rationally chooses to accept the collateral because she can access a secondary asset market where she can sell the asset. Following a recent strand of the finance literature, based on the influential work of Duffie et al. (Econometrica 73(6):1815-1847, 2005), we model this secondary asset market as an over-the-counter market characterized by search and bargaining frictions. We study how the asset's property to serve as collateral affects its equilibrium price, and how the asset price and the economy's welfare are affected by the degree of liquidity in the secondary asset market.","[Geromichalos, Athanasios; Lee, Jiwon; Lee, Seungduck; Oikawa, Keita] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Geromichalos, A; Lee, S (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, 1 Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",ageromich@ucdavis.edu; jiwlee@ucdavis.edu; sddlee@ucdavis.edu; koikawa@ucdavis.edu,,"Oikawa, Keita/0000-0002-2190-3941",,,,,36,9,10,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

Two communication treatments are considered: non-binding price announcements and unrestricted written communication. We find that price announcements are conducive to coordinating on a high price but only under duopoly and when firms are symmetric. The standard experimental finding that collusion without communication is rare when there are more than two firms is shown to be robust to allowing firms to make price announcements. When firms are asymmetric, price announcements do result in higher prices but there is little evidence that firms are coordinating their behavior. When firms are allowed to engage in unrestricted written communication, coordination on high prices occurs for all market structures. We find that the incremental value to express communication (compared to price announcements) is greater when firms are asymmetric and there are more firms. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

To address this question, we use detailed monthly US import data to investigate changes in import composition during a 24-month window immediately preceding the filing of a petition for import protection. A decomposition methodology allows a comparison of imports from two groups of countries supplying the same product: those that are named in the petition and those that are not. The same decomposition can be applied to products quite similar to the imports in question, but not subject to a petition. The results suggest that industries typically seek protection when faced with a specific pattern of shocks. First, a persistent positive relative supply shock favours imports from named countries. Second, a negative demand shock hits imports from all sources just prior to domestic industries' petition for protection. The relative supply shock is a broad one; it applies both to named commodities and to the comparison product group. The import demand shock, by contrast, is narrow, hitting only named products. This negative import demand shock appears to be a key event in the run-up to the filing of a petition. This latter shock has been missed by previous studies using more aggregated data.","[Hillberry, Russell] Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA; [McCalman, Phillip] Univ Melbourne, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3010, Australia",Purdue University System; Purdue University; Purdue University West Lafayette Campus; University of Melbourne,"Hillberry, R (通讯作者)，Purdue Univ, Dept Agr Econ, W Lafayette, IN 47907 USA.",rhillber@purdue.edu,"McCalman, Phillip/O-2636-2015",,,,,,44,2,2,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

When bidders decide whether to participate or not, they know their own valuations as well as earlier bidders' participation decisions. To analyze bidders' participation and bidding decisions, we study equilibria in cutoff strategies with which a bidder participates and bids his valuation if his valuation exceeds a cutoff given his observation on earlier bidders' participation. Focusing on the case of two bidders, we present two main results on comparative statics and revenue comparison. In the comparative statics analysis, we study the effects of a change in bidders' characteristics on equilibrium cutoffs. In revenue comparison, we show that the considered sequential entry format yields lower revenue than the simultaneous entry counterpart. Finally, we discuss the difficulties in generalizing these two results for the case of more than two bidders.","[Lee, Jinhyuk] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, 145 Anam Ro, Seoul 02841, South Korea; [Lee, Jinhyuk] Ulsan Natl Inst Sci & Technol, Sch Business Adm, 50 UNIST Gil, Ulsan 44919, South Korea; [Park, Jaeok] Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Korea University; Ulsan National Institute of Science & Technology (UNIST); Yonsei University,"Park, J (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Sch Econ, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",jinhyuklee@korea.ac.kr; jaeok.park@yonsei.ac.kr,"Park, Jaeok/HJP-8771-2023",,UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology); Yonsei University Research Grant,UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology); Yonsei University Research Grant,"We are grateful to Daniel Ackerberg, Yeon-Koo Che, Myeonghwan Cho, Kyungmin (Teddy) Kim, an associate editor, an anonymous referee, and participants at the 15th Korean Economic Association International Conference, the 8th Biennial Conference on Economic Design, and the 2015 Winter Meeting of the Korean Econometric Society for helpful comments.

Our model combines features of patent racing with dynamic market structure, capturing the interplay between the immediate competition in terms of production rates and the long-term competition in R&D. The resulting Markov Nash equilibrium is found from a sequence of one-step static games arising between R&D successes, and several numerical examples and extensive analysis of the emerging comparative statics are presented. Analyzing the relationship between current market dominance and the level of R&D investments, we find that market leaders tend to invest more, which in some sense makes oligopoly dynamically unstable. We show that anticipated market transitions have long-term impact; for example the potential of future monopoly can spur R&D investment now, even if the firm is presently uncompetitive and not actively producing. We also show that, surprisingly, random innovations have an ambiguous effect on R&D. This feature, which is driven by the Cournot framework, contrasts with the common situation whereby uncertainty lowers innovation and delays R&D investments.

(2005), which states that movements in labour force do not significantly affect unemployment rates, holds true for Romania. Using quarterly labour force data for the 1996-2012 period, we explore the time-series properties of the two variables. We find that unemployment rates and participation rates have unit roots, and that they are not cointegrated, meaning that no significant long-term relationship exists between them. The analysis carried out on the first differences of unemployment rates and participation rates shows discouraged and added worker effects for Romania's female labour force. This conclusion diverges from findings that point out to a stable, long-term relationship between unemployment and participation in several developed countries (Japan, Sweden, USA) and shows that Romanian labour market is highly adaptive, where changes in labour force participation do not lead to increases in unemployment. This finding can help model the influence of adverse developments such as ageing and emigration, and show their true impact beyond demographic doom scenarios. It also points out the role played by labour demand in shaping the evolution of the Romanian labour market.","[Otoiu, Adrian] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet & Stat, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania; [Titan, Emilia] Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet & Stat, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies; Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Otoiu, A (通讯作者)，Bucharest Acad Econ Studies, Fac Cybernet & Stat, Dept Stat & Econometr, Bucharest, Romania.",adrian.otoiu@csie.ase.ro,"Titan, Emilia/AAR-7437-2020; OTOIU, Adrian/GWM-9957-2022; OTOIU, Adrian/HPE-8279-2023; Otoiu, Adrian/J-6348-2013","Titan, Emilia/0000-0003-0614-1958; Otoiu, Adrian/0000-0001-5830-5462",,,,,11,8,8,1,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Why, then, is US FDI so profitable whilst FDI in the USA is conspicuous in its unprofitability? Using sectoral-based data from 1999 to 2005 to investigate this puzzle, I find that US-owned FDI (USDIA) demonstrates far higher returns particularly relative to foreign-owned direct investment in the USA (FDIUS) but also compared to all US-based industries (NIPA). FDIUS is the worst performing of all three portfolios, exhibiting the poorest and most volatile returns for the period examined. These results hold for both the aggregate non-financial data as well as for the 'narrow measured value added'. For the period tested, US inwards FDI isn't employment generating whereas US direct investment abroad produces the fastest gains in labour productivity, output, employment, investment expenditures and tax revenues. Whilst it is debatable that 'dark matter' or intangible proprietary assets drive superior relative returns to USDIA, labour exploitation appears to play a role. Increases in labour productivity coupled with declining wage shares for all three portfolios (especially pronounced for USDIA) suggest 'race to bottom' outcomes. A burgeoning aspect of this race is cross-border profit-shifting to minimise firms' global tax burdens. I suspect but am unable to confirm that profits are being shifted overseas-vanishing into the 'black holes' of tax havens, transfer pricing and other modes of tax avoidance.","[Ali, Mona] SUNY Coll New Paltz, New Paltz, NY 12561 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; SUNY New Paltz,"Ali, M (通讯作者)，SUNY Coll New Paltz, Dept Econ, JFT 814,600 Hawk Dr, New Paltz, NY 12651 USA.",alim@newpaltz.edu,,,,,,,77,8,8,0,19,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We conduct seven different treatments of such markets, varying the number of firms, demand rationing, subject matching, and subjects' knowledge about the market mechanism. We find that only the number of firms has a persistent effect on capacity choices, whereas price choices are affected by both the number of firms and the rationing scheme. From the outset, subjects in the high-knowledge condition behave in the same way as subjects with low knowledge do in later periods after gaining experience. In all treatments, conduct is more competitive than the Cournot outcome, irrespective of the Nash equilibrium prediction. Nevertheless, the Cournot model does pack some predictive power. Under efficient demand rationing where the Cournot outcome is predicted, exact Cournot choices are more likely for both capacities and prices.","[Jacobs, Martin] Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany",University of Kiel,"Jacobs, M (通讯作者)，Univ Kiel, Dept Econ, Olshaussenstr 40, D-24118 Kiel, Germany.",jacobs@economics.uni-kiel.de,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,1,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

It uses 19 years of monthly food prices from 20 markets and 3 waves of nationally representative household panel surveys from Tanzania. Trigonometric specifications are introduced to measure the seasonal gap. When samples are short and seasonality is poorly defined, they produce less upward bias than the common dummy variable approach. On average, the seasonal gap for maize prices is estimated to be 27%; it is 15% for rice. In both cases, it is two and a half to three times higher than in the international reference market. Food price seasonality is not a major contributor to food price volatility, but it does translate into seasonal variation in caloric intake of about 10% among poor urban households and rural net food sellers. Rural net food-buying households appear able to smooth their consumption. It is premature to ignore seasonality in the African development debate.","[Kaminski, Jonathan] COFCO Agri Res Dept, Geneva, Switzerland; [Christiaensen, Luc] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Gilbert, Christopher L.] Johns Hopkins Univ, SAIS Bologna Ctr, Baltimore, MD 21218 USA",The World Bank; Johns Hopkins University,"Kaminski, J (通讯作者)，COFCO Agri Res Dept, Geneva, Switzerland.",christopher.gilbert@jhu.edu; lchristiaensen@worldbank.org; christopher.gilbert@jhu.edu,"Gilbert, Christopher/JXL-5629-2024",,,,,,32,29,35,1,10,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We present the only treatment up to date of how switching costs (and only switching costs) affect competition based on the assumption that switching costs differ across consumers, which allows us to illustrate the undesired byproduct of assuming that products exhibit substantial horizontal differentiation. Not only do we draw implications for the classical literature on competition with switching costs, but also for the more recent one that rests upon such an assumption too. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Taxes also attract a high degree of loathing. Tax noncompliance is a major problem for governments worldwide with hundreds of billions of potential tax revenue uncollected each year. It is therefore critical for research to examine factors that encourage tax satisfaction. In this research, we hypothesized that people would be more inclined to view taxation in a favorable light if they believed that wealth incurs a responsibility to give back to society (wealth-as-responsibility). Consistent with this prediction, in Study 1, people who reported stronger wealth-as-responsibility beliefs felt better about paying taxes. In Study 2, individuals assigned to read text encouraging the idea that wealth incurs a responsibility to give back to society felt better about paying taxes compared to a neutral control group. In Study 3, individuals assigned to read text encouraging wealth-as-responsibility felt better about paying taxes on earned income in the lab. Together, these studies show that reframing the meaning of wealth can shape people's attitudes about paying their taxes, thus providing evidence for a novel lever to encourage more positive attitudes about taxation.

Higher interest rates may strengthen the currency by inducing owners of local currency assets not to sell local currency offshore. There is also an effect that goes in the opposite direction: higher interest rates may increase the flow of interest income to foreigners through the current account, making the exchange rate fall. The historical financial crisis in Iceland provides excellent testing grounds for the analysis. Overall, the Icelandic experience does not suggest that cutting interest rates in small steps from a very high level is likely to make a currency depreciate significantly in a capital control regime, but it highlights the importance of effective enforcement of the controls.","[Gudmundsson, Gudmundur S.] Univ Pompeu Fabra, Dept Econ & Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Zoega, Gylfi] Univ Iceland, Dept Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland; [Zoega, Gylfi] Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ, London WC1E 7HX, England",Pompeu Fabra University; University of Iceland; University of London; Birkbeck University London,"Zoega, G (通讯作者)，Univ Iceland, Dept Dept Econ, Reykjavik, Iceland.;Zoega, G (通讯作者)，Univ London Birkbeck Coll, Dept Econ, London WC1E 7HX, England.",gz@hi.is,,,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF) [130551-052]; University of Iceland Research Fund,Icelandic Research Fund (IRF); University of Iceland Research Fund,"We thank Thorvaldur Gylfason, Ron Smith and two anonymous referees for useful comments.

This paper extends the discussion to German direct democracy reforms of the mid-1990s, which granted voters rights to launch initiatives on local issues, but neither the right nor the responsibility of voting on the implied costs of these initiatives. An analysis of around 2300 voter initiatives in the population of around 13,000 German municipalities from 2002 to 2009 demonstrates that in this sample-and in contrast to most of the Swiss and US evidence-direct democracy causes an expansion of local government size on average by around 8 % in annual per capita expenditure and revenue per initiative (on economic projects).

Corn is the primary input, and the outputs are ethanol, corn oil, distillers' dried grains (DDGs), and renewable identification numbers (RINs). A theoretical model is developed including margins and risk is measured using value at risk (VaR). An empirical model is developed and extended to VaR using copulas to analyze the marginal distribution and dependence structure for input and output prices on margins. Efficient frontier curves analyzing VaR with and without copula are discussed. The results compare varying risk-strategy measures for long corn, short corn, and combining short and long corn.

This perspective emphasizes that beliefs often fulfill important psychological and functional needs of the individual. Economically relevant examples include confidence in ones' abilities, moral self-esteem, hope and anxiety reduction, social identity, political ideology, and religious faith. People thus hold certain beliefs in part because they attach value to them, as a result of some (usually implicit) tradeoff between accuracy and desirability. In a sense, we propose to treat beliefs as regular economic goods and assets--which people consume, invest in, reap returns from, and produce, using the informational inputs they receive or have access to. Such beliefs will be resistant to many forms of evidence, with individuals displaying non-Bayesian behaviors such as not wanting to know, wishful thinking, and reality denial.","[Benabou, Roland] Princeton Univ, Econ & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Benabou, Roland] Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tirole, Jean] Toulouse Sch Econ, Toulouse, France; [Tirole, Jean] Inst Adv Study, Execut Comm, Toulouse, France",Princeton University; Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR); Universite de Toulouse; Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole; Toulouse School of Economics,"Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Econ & Publ Affairs, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Bénabou, R (通讯作者)，Canadian Inst Adv Res, Toronto, ON, Canada.",,,,"Canadian Institute for Advanced Research; European Research Council [FP7/2007-2013-249429, 669217]; European Research Council (ERC) [669217] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)",Canadian Institute for Advanced Research(Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)); European Research Council(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"We are grateful to S.

While the change itself was indeed a remarkable moment in time, a branching point from which a multitude of new paths originated in most of the countries in Central and Eastern Europe, this was only partially true in the case of Hungary. If a critical juncture is sought for Hungary, it is more likely to be 1968, the year the New Economic Mechanism was launched. By applying the conceptual framework of historical institutionalism, the article argues that what made Hungary unique during the communist era and what rendered its position as a (one-time) frontrunner proved to be a serious constraint after the systemic change. The legacy of a pre-born welfare state, the constant need for compensating potential losers of any economic reform, along with short-sighted decision-making, have together generated specific path dependencies in the Hungarian trajectory of economic development.","[Benczes, Istvan] Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst World Econ, Budapest, Hungary",Corvinus University Budapest; Hungarian Research Network; Hungarian Academy of Sciences; HUN-REN Centre for Economic & Regional Studies,"Benczes, I (通讯作者)，Corvinus Univ Budapest, Inst World Econ, Budapest, Hungary.",istvan.benczes@uni-corvinus.hu,,,,,,,85,21,22,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUN,2016,28,2,,,,,146,166,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1124557,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DL3WC,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375563200002,0

We find that our treatment effects are present with both stated effort and a real-effort task, which suggests that both approaches may yield similar results in labor experiments.","[Charness, Gary] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA; [Maria Perez, Jose] Univ Granada, Granada, Spain; [Cobo-Reyes, Ramon] Univ Exeter, Sch Business, Exeter, Devon, England; [Lacomba, Juan A.; Lagos, Francisco] Univ Granada & Globe, Dept Teoria & Hist Econ, Campus Cartuja S-N, Granada 18071, Spain",University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara; University of Granada; University of Exeter; University of Granada,"Charness, G (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Dept Econ, 2127 North Hall, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.",charness@econ.ucsb.edu; ramonc@ugr.es; jlacomba@ugr.es; fmlagos@ugr.es,"Lagos, Francis/AAT-6192-2020; Charness, Gary/JVP-0357-2024; reyes, ramon cobo/AAH-8853-2021","Cobo-Reyes, Ramon/0000-0002-1979-4061; Lagos Garcia, Francisco Miguel/0000-0003-1945-3272","Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [SEJ2010-17049/ECON, SEJ2009-11117/ECON, ECO2012-36695]; Division of Social Sciences; Department of Economics at UCSB; Junta de Andalucia [P07-SEJ-02547, P07-SEJ-3261]",Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); Division of Social Sciences; Department of Economics at UCSB; Junta de Andalucia(Junta de Andalucia),"Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science (SEJ2010-17049/ECON; SEJ2009-11117/ECON, ECO2012-36695), the Division of Social Sciences and the Department of Economics at UCSB, and Junta de Andalucia (P07-SEJ-02547; P07-SEJ-3261) is gratefully acknowledged.",,41,15,17,5,18,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1386-4157,1573-6938,,EXP ECON,Exp.

Evidence from Korea,ASIAN ECONOMIC PAPERS,,,English,Article,,,,,,,UNITED-STATES; MANUFACTURING PLANTS; JAPANESE; AGGLOMERATION; CHOICE; DETERMINANTS; TRUST; CHINA; FDI,"Social capital refers to the stock of social relationships such as network, norms, and trust that facilitate both coordination and cooperation. Utilizing an extensive firm-level data set for 2006-10, this paper investigates the importance of social capital in conjunction with the conventional location factors that are known to influence the location decisions of multinational firms within Korea. Our nested logit estimates show that the Trust and Norms component of social capital has a stronger influence on locational decisions than does the Social Network component. That is, regions in Korea characterized by a high level of Trust and Norms attract more knowledge-based foreign direct investment (FDI) firms than those with lower levels of trust and norms. In addition, positive agglomeration externalities are more powerful in regions with a higher level of trust and norms. Another important result of our analysis is the discovery that the regions with high unemployment levels and union activities are less attractive to foreign investors. On the basis of the results we conclude that measures that strengthen the trust and norms component of social capital should be fostered along with traditional cost-saving policies, which are used to attract FDI in Korea.","[Choe, Jong-Il] Chosun Univ, Dept Econ, 309 Pilmun Daero, Gwangju 61452, South Korea; [Lee, Ki-Dong] Keimgung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea",Chosun University,"Lee, KD (通讯作者)，Keimgung Univ, Dept Int Commerce, 1095 Dalgubeol Daero, Daegu 42601, South Korea.",jichoe@chosun.ac.kr; kdlee@kmu.ac.kr,"Lee, Ki-Dong/L-4195-2017","Lee, Ki-Dong/0000-0002-2660-2806",National Research Foundation of Korea grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A3A2044643],National Research Foundation of Korea grant - Korean Government,"The work reported here was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea grant funded by the Korean Government (NRF-2014S1A3A2044643).

This article argues that constraints to intergenerational transfers are crucial for understanding this relationship. If parents could legally impose debt obligations on their children to recover the costs incurred in raising them, then fertility would be independent of parental income. A relationship between fertility and income arises when parents are unable to leave debts because of legal, enforcement or moral constraints. This relationship is negative when the intergenerational elasticity of substitution is larger than one, a case in which parental consumption is a good substitute for children's consumption.","Iowa State Univ, Ames, IA USA; Univ Pittsburgh, 4532 WW Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Iowa State University; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Ripoll, M (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Econ, 4532 WW Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",ripoll@pitt.edu,,,IAE; CREI; Barcelona GSE,IAE; CREI; Barcelona GSE,"An earlier version of this article circulated under the title: 'Barro-Becker with Credit Frictions'.

We find that institutional reforms are unequivocally environmental improving. Meanwhile, the impacts of trade on the environment tend to depend on the institutional setting of a country. More specifically, trade openness is harmful to the environment in countries with low institutional quality and beneficial to the environment in countries with high institutional quality. This means that institutional reforms are a perquisite for the countries with low institutional quality to actualise the beneficial environment effect of trade. As for the countries with adequate institutional quality, trade and institutions are reinforcing each other in bringing down pollution. From these results, we conclude that trade openness implemented in a sound institutional setting potentially brings better trade, more growth and better environment.","[Ibrahim, Mansor H.] Lorong Univ A, Int Ctr Educ Islam Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia; [Law, Siong Hook] Univ Putra Malaysia, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ, Upm Serdang 43400, Selangor, Malaysia",Lorong Universiti A; INCEIF; Universiti Putra Malaysia,"Ibrahim, MH (通讯作者)，Lorong Univ A, Int Ctr Educ Islam Finance INCEIF, Kuala Lumpur 59100, Malaysia.",mansorhi@inceif.org,"Ibrahim, Mansor/AAU-6887-2020; Law, Siong Hook/AAF-6672-2020","Law, Siong Hook/0000-0002-6058-4883; Ibrahim, Mansor/0000-0003-0413-0075",,,,,65,167,171,0,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0038-2280,1813-6982,,S AFR J ECON,South Afr.

Both perspectives are investigated as case studies for a broader discussion about significant trends in economics and social sciences. Duflo and the J-PAL's approach illustrates - in its own way - new trends and some blind alleys in contemporary forms of mainstream economics, whereas Ostrom and the Bloomington school point towards the marked theoretical and methodological reflexivity of institutionalism, its sensitivity to historical diversity and openness towards social sciences. Distinct social philosophies and episteme are at stake displaying a great divide between two brands of realism and pragmatism, two relationships to development, expertise and knowledge. The paper also contrasts Duflo's methodological monism and mechanistic piecemeal analysis with Ostrom's methodological pluralism and adaptive complex systems analysis.","[Labrousse, Agnes] Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, Amiens, France",Universite de Picardie Jules Verne (UPJV),"Labrousse, A (通讯作者)，Univ Picardie Jules Verne, CRIISEA, Amiens, France.",agnes.labrousse@u-picardie.fr,,,,,,,92,8,8,1,10,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In the absence of direct group-level interactions, groups with the most cooperative members will outcompete less cooperative groups, while within any group the least cooperative members will be the most successful. Introducing group-level interactions, however, such as raiding or warfare, changes the selective landscape for groups. Our model suggests that as the global population becomes more integrated and the rate of intergroup conflict increases, selection increasingly favors unequally distributed power structures, where individual influence is weighted by acquired resources. The advantage to less democratic groups rests in their ability to facilitate selection for cooperative strategies-involving cooperation both among themselves and with outsiders-in order to produce the resources necessary to fuel their success in inter-group conflicts, while simultaneously selecting for leaders (and corresponding collective behavior) who are unburdened with those same prosocial norms. The coevolution of cooperative social norms and institutions of power facilitates the emergence of a leadership class of the selfish and has implications for theories of inequality, structures of governance, non-cooperative personality traits, and hierarchy. Our findings suggest an amendment to the well-known doctrine of multilevel selection that Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups. In an interconnected world, altruistic groups led by selfish individuals can beat them both.

First, it aims to estimate the effect of the tightening of regulatory capital requirements on the real economy in periods of credit upswing. Second, it intends to show whether applying a counter-cyclical capital buffer measure as set down in the Basel III rules could have helped to reduce the pace of FX lending growth in Hungary, mitigating the buildup of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the global financial crisis. In order to answer these questions, we use a Vector Autoregression-based approach with the aim of understanding the impact of shocks to capital adequacy in the pre-crisis period. Our results suggest that although regulatory authorities could have slowed down the increase in lending temporarily, they would not have been able to avoid the upswing of FX lending by requiring counter-cyclical capital buffers even if such a tool had been available and even if they had reacted quickly to accelerating credit growth. Our results also suggest that a more pronounced tightening might have reduced FX lending substantially, but at the expense of real GDP growth. The reason is that unsustainable fiscal policy led to a trade-off between economic growth and the build-up of new vulnerabilities in the form of FX lending.","[Siklos, Dora] European Stabil Mech, Luxembourg, Luxembourg",,"Siklós, D (通讯作者)，European Stabil Mech, Luxembourg, Luxembourg.",d.siklos@esm.europa.eu,,,,,,,31,0,0,0,2,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",0001-6373,1588-2659,,ACTA OECON,Acta.

These threats pose real risks of putting oil and gas producers out of business. They lead to the problem of stranded assets and a significant downward valuation of oil and gas producers. This calls for divesting from and shorting coal, oil, and gas. The economies of oil- and gas-rich countries are typically in a deplorable state, since they did not use their past windfalls to build up buffers and invest in a diversified economy. More rapacious depletion of their oil and gas reserves will not help.

Standard rate effects are found to differ considerably from those calculated using the fixed taxable income approach in terms of both level and longitudinal trend.,"[Miyazaki, Takeshi] Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan",Kyushu University,"Miyazaki, T (通讯作者)，Kyushu Univ, Dept Econ, Fukuoka 812, Japan.",tmiyazak@econ.kyushu-u.ac.jp,,,"Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University","Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University","This work was supported by the Joint Usage and Research Center, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University.",,10,0,0,0,8,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

At each team's turn to pick, the team has the option of exercising the pick itself or trading it to another team. If gains from trade are exhausted, draft picks should be exercised by the team with the highest expected value. That is, the expected player contribution garnered from a given pick should not be dependent on whether the pick was traded or retained. Regression results, however, indicate that controlling for a player's draft position, when a team trades up to acquire a player, that player is more likely to have greater on-field success. This suggests that there are too few draft day trades. Plausible reasons are high transaction costs or the fear of media scrutiny that draft trades can engender.","[Hersch, Philip L.; Pelkowski, Jodi E.] Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS USA",Wichita State University,"Hersch, PL (通讯作者)，Wichita State Univ, Dept Econ, Wichita, KS USA.",philip.hersch@wichita.edu,,,,,,,4,2,2,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

The supply-management programs use target prices, production quotas and import tariff-rate quotas to raise domestic prices. Canadian supply-managed producers cannot export their output to world markets as exports would be considered subsidized under World Trade Organization rules. In this paper, we show that once foregone export opportunities are accounted for, supply management may no longer be beneficial to domestic producers of the supply-managed commodities. The extent to which foregone profits from exports dominate domestic rents depends on Canada's comparative advantage, domestic market elasticities and the extent of supply management distortion in the domestic market.","[Carter, Colin A.; Merel, Pierre] Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Carter, Colin A.; Merel, Pierre] Univ Calif Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis,"Carter, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Carter, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Giannini Fdn Agr Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",colin@primal.ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,65,9,10,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Rather than focus on asymptotic performance, we show how gradient strategies developed to minimize asymptotic regret imply financial trading strategies that yield arbitrage-based bounds for option prices. These bounds are new and robust in that they do not depend on the continuity of the stock price process, complete markets, or an assumed pricing kernel. They depend only on the realized quadratic variation of the price process, which can be measured and, importantly, hedged in financial markets using existing securities. Our results also apply directly to a new class of options called timer options. Finally, we argue that the Hannan Blackwell strategy is path dependent and therefore suboptimal with a finite horizon. We improve it by solving for the optimal path-independent strategy, and compare the resulting bounds with Black Scholes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We test our predictions using a database of Italian parliamentarians for the period 1996-2006. We find evidence of advantageous selection of both market-fit and public-fit parliamentarians.

I use the difference between the change in public debt and the deficit (stock-flow adjustment) to measure creative accounting. The results suggest that governments strategically engaged in creative accounting before regular elections so as to sugarcoat the budget balance.

In a world Nash equilibrium, foreign monetary policy depends on the degree of home exchange rate pass-through. Asymmetry in exchange rate pass-through leads to asymmetric welfare effects. The welfare level of the home country is higher than that of the foreign country in the Nash equilibrium.

The article provides an almost complete characterization of the domain of economies in which free trade equilibria with incomplete specialization exist. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient conditions for free trade equilibrium to involve UE is identified. It suggests that the emergence of free trade equilibria with UE cannot be entailed by the competitive mechanism of markets and unequal distribution of wealth alone, but might be understood as an outcome of equilibrium selection on the basis of Nash bargaining between rich and poor nations.","[Yoshihara, Naoki] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan; [Yoshihara, Naoki] Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Management, Kami City, Kochi 7828502, Japan; [Kaneko, Soh] Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Mita 2-15-45, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst; Hitotsubashi University; Kochi University Technology; Keio University,"Yoshihara, N (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Thompson Hall,200 Hicks Way, Amherst, MA 01003 USA.;Yoshihara, N (通讯作者)，Hitotsubashi Univ, Inst Econ Res, 2-1 Naka, Kunitachi, Tokyo 1868603, Japan.;Yoshihara, N (通讯作者)，Kochi Univ Technol, Sch Management, Kami City, Kochi 7828502, Japan.;Kaneko, S (通讯作者)，Keio Univ, Fac Econ, Minato Ku, Mita 2-15-45, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",nyoshihara@econs.umass.edu; skaneko@keio.jp,,"Yoshihara, Naoki/0000-0002-0804-787X",,,,,23,1,1,0,6,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,MAY,2016,67,2,,,SI,,210,241,,10.1111/meca.12125,0.0,,,32,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DK7ZK,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000375145700002,0

Several econometric techniques, including the Gamma Pseudo Maximum Likelihood estimator, are used to rectify possible problems of heteroskedasticity and zero trade flows inherent in the estimation of gravity models of trade. The major finding is that outward FDI is trade enhancing for the Japanese manufacturing industry. However, we find that whether outward FDI creates or replaces trade depends on the industry under scrutiny. Our results indicate that the complementary relationship between FDI and trade is dominant in Japanese manufacturing, especially in the food and beverages, electric machinery, primary metals, and precision machinery sectors. We find also that Japanese overseas investments substitute for imports of chemical products, and for both exports and imports of general machinery.","[Chiappini, Raphael] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, UMR 7321, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Chiappini, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, GREDEG CNRS, UMR 7321, 250 Rue Albert Einstein, F-06560 Valbonne, France.",raphael.chiappini@gredeg.cnrs.fr,"Chiappini, Raphaël/JNR-8433-2023","Chiappini, Raphaël/0000-0003-4819-8792",,,,,55,5,5,1,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

It argues that contradicting results in the existing empirical research may have arisen due to a neglect of sub-demographic differences and failure to recognize endogeneity. It hypothesizes that male and female unemployment will have different impacts on fertility across subgroups of the population. Drawing on the UK Labor Force Survey and the Birth Statistics data from the Office for National Statistics, the results of this study suggest that female unemployment tends to increase births, whereas male unemployment has the opposite effect. More importantly, the reported results indicate the unemployment and fertility relation exhibits strong variation across demographic subgroups. Lastly, a persistent countercyclical fertility pattern is also documented at the county level.","[Aksoy, Cevat Giray] Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, London TW20 0EX, England",University of London; Royal Holloway University London,"Aksoy, CG (通讯作者)，Royal Holloway Univ London, Dept Econ, London TW20 0EX, England.",cevat.aksoy.2012@live.rhul.ac.uk,,"Aksoy, Cevat Giray/0000-0002-8318-6618",,,,,27,8,8,1,20,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Second I allow for the transmission of shocks between the two regions. Whilst both of these changes considerably improve the model's performance along the international dimension, common shocks appear to be the main drivers of cross-regional correlation.

The candidates, we assume, do not know the true distribution of voters. Following the robust control literature, candidates respond to this uncertainty by applying a max-min operator to their optimization problem. This approach, consistent with findings within the behavioral economics literature, protects the candidate by ensuring that her expected utility never falls too far, regardless of the true voter distribution. We show that this framework produces a continuum of equilibria upon which the candidates can converge and that the size of this continuum is weakly increasing in each candidate's uncertainty. We argue that our model can explain movements in political platforms over time. That is, the mere presence of candidate uncertainty, in addition to shifts in attitudes or demographics, can cause political candidates to change their policy positions across elections.","[Baumann, Robert; Svec, Justin] Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, POB 87A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA",College of the Holy Cross,"Baumann, R (通讯作者)，Coll Holy Cross, Dept Econ, POB 87A, Worcester, MA 01610 USA.",rbau-mann@holycross.edu; jsvec@holycross.edu,,,,,,,46,1,1,0,4,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

I show that conformism has positive social value and that social welfare can be bounded by network polarization and connectivity measures. I apply the model to empirical data on high school students' participation in extracurricular activities. I find that the local effect of conformism (i.e. the endogenous peer effect for a fixed network structure) ranges from 7.5% to 45%, depending on the number of peers that an individual has.

They can: (1) sell reserves, (2) raise interest rates, (3) impose capital controls, (4) apply trade restrictions, or (5) depreciate the currency. While researchers typically analyze these policies in isolation from one another, we treat them as a menu of options available to election-minded politicians. We analyze the use of these five policy responses to payments difficulties for a large sample of countries since the early 1970s. We argue that governments try to minimize political costs by adopting less transparent policies first and only moving to more visible policies as necessary, delaying the most visible and politically costly policies until after elections. The evidence is consistent with these claims: governments are more likely to draw down reserves and impose capital controls before other options. If these policies do not succeed, they tend to raise interest rates. If further action is needed, they delay devaluations and trade protection until after elections.","[Broz, J.

With altruistic preferences of the warm-glow type, the contributions converge to a level strictly higher than those given by voluntary contributions, but in general they do not yield first-best levels. Our results are important to clarify why in general governments do not rely on lotteries for a large part of the revenue creation for public good provision.

Investors with S-shaped utility functions prefer spot (futures) to futures (spot) when markets move upward (downward). Investors with reverse S-shaped utility functions prefer futures (spot) to spot (futures) when markets move upward (downward).

Studies of the impacts of these crises have identified three broad sets of consequences. First, the burden of crises falls disproportionately on labor in general and low-income segments of society in particular. In the years following financial crises, wages and labor share of income fall, the rate of unemployment increases, the power of labor and labor unions is eroded, and income inequality and rates of poverty increase. Capital as a whole, on the other hand, usually recovers quickly and most of the time gains more ground. Second, the consequences of crises are visible not only through asset and income distribution, but also in government policies. Government policies in most cases favor capital, especially financial capital, at the expense of large masses. In addition, many crises have presented opportunities for further deregulation and liberalization, not only in financial markets but in the rest of the economy as well. Third, in the aftermath of financial crises in low-and middle-income economies, capital inflows may increase as international capital seeks to take advantage of the crisis and acquire domestic financial and non-financial assets. The 2007-2008 financial crisis in the US provides an opportunity to extend this analysis to a leading high-income country and see if the patterns visible in other crises are also visible in this case. Using the questions and issues typically raised in examinations of low-and middle-income countries, we study the consequences of the 2007-2008 US financial crisis and complement the budding literature on the 'Great Recession.' In particular, we examine the impacts of the crisis on labor and capital, with a focus on distributional effects of the crisis such as changes in income shares of labor and capital, and the evolution of inequality and poverty. We also analyse the role of government policies through a study of government taxation and spending policies, and examine capital flow patterns.","[Dufour, Mathieu] Univ Quebec Outaouais, Dept Sci Sociales, Gatineau, PQ, Canada; [Orhangazi, Ozgur] Kadir Has Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey",University of Quebec; University Quebec Outaouais; Kadir Has University,"Orhangazi, Ö (通讯作者)，Kadir Has Univ, Dept Econ, Istanbul, Turkey.",mathieu.perron-dufour@uqo.ca; ozgur.orhangazi@khas.edu.tr,"Orhangazi, Özgür/D-7311-2019","orhangazi, ozgur/0000-0002-3122-8206",Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme [FP7-PEOPLE-2011-CIG: 303981]; Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK) [2221],Marie Curie European Reintegration Grant within the 7th European Community Framework Programme(European Union (EU)); Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)(Turkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma Kurumu (TUBITAK)),The authors thank Onur Ozdemir for research assistance and the two anonymous referees for their comments on an earlier version of this paper.

Besides this novel model, our approach embodies several important features: we perform Lee and Mykland's (2012) non-parametric test procedure to filter out microstructure noise from observed exchange rates and extract jumps as the significant equilibrium returns; various categories of information news from different geographical regions are exploited; the hypothesis of a leverage effect on foreign exchange jumps due to asymmetric volatility shocks is examined. We found that the most influential scheduled macroeconomic news are globally related to the US job markets, output growth indicators and public debt, whereas significant event news include announcements of bank failures and government rescue plans. Surprises impact Forex jumps for about one third as a result of rather pessimistic forecasts due to the crisis period analyzed. For most of the currencies the hypothesis that negative volatility shocks have a-greater impact on volatility than positive shocks of the same magnitude is validated, reflecting markets' concern about the costs implied by central bank's stabilization policies. Our findings provide evidence that the major foreign exchange markets are not efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using 2003-2007 data from Sweden we investigated whether EU enlargement in 2004, when new countries with low pharmaceutical prices joined the EU, increased competition from parallel imports. Drugs facing competition from parallel imports are found to have on average 19-22% lower prices than they would have had if they had never faced such competition. The EU enlargement is, however, not found to have increased this effect, which might be explained by derogations and changes in consumer perceptions of parallel imports.","[Granlund, David] Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden; [Koksal-Ayhan, Miyase Yesim] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",Umea University; University of Gothenburg,"Granlund, D (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Econ, SE-90187 Umea, Sweden.",David.Granlund@umu.se,,,Swedish Competition Authority,Swedish Competition Authority,"The authors would like to thank Mats Bergman, Gautam Gowrisankaran, Douglas Lundin, Johan Stennek, Mans Soderbom, Joakim Westerlund, and two anonymous reviewers for constructive comments.

Second, we extend the model and review earlier findings how a preexisting network affects existence of Nash equilibria and efficiency of Nash equilibrium outcomes of the strategic network formation game.

Building on a critique of Keen's original paper by the present author, it is argued that in using an alternative way to derive his statement, Keen modifies his hypothesis to the point of turning it into an outright tautology which, importantly, was not the case previously. While he thus indeed arrives at a relationship which necessarily holds, this contains no novel insight and does not justify his strong claims regarding any necessary relationship between changes in debt and effective demand. This paper also comments on Keen's peculiar views on the loanable funds model which appear to lie at the root of his hypothesis.","[Reissl, Severin] Univ Kingston, MSc Polit Econ Macroecon & Finance, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Reissl, S (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, MSc Polit Econ Macroecon & Finance, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",,,"Reissl, Severin/0000-0002-5614-5669",,,,,22,1,1,0,1,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

I show that a competitive regime is inherently unstable due to the properties of endogenously determined limits on private money creation. Precisely, there is a continuum of equilibria characterized by a self-fulfilling collapse of the value of private money and a persistent decline in the demand for money. I associate these equilibrium allocations with self-fulfilling banking crises. It is possible to formulate a fiscal intervention that results in the global determinacy of equilibrium, with the property that the value of private money remains stable. Thus, the goal of monetary stability necessarily requires some form of government intervention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

What is then the mix of general education and technology-specific training that maximises the growth rate of an economy? We try to answer these questions by developing an endogenous growth model which focuses on privately financed general education and firm financed technology specific training in a setting where creative destruction renders technologies gradually obsolete. We reproduce some stylized facts regarding the technology-education-training relationship and we show how the optimum amount of time devoted to education and training is affected by the rate of technical change itself. In particular, we find that a faster arrival of new technologies shifts the private knowledge portfolio towards general human capital, less prone to creative destruction. We also find that households tend to under-invest in education, thus leading to lower growth rates than technically feasible, and higher training costs than absolutely necessary. This suggests that there is room for education policy reducing private education fees.","[Van Zon, Adriaan] Maastricht Univ, UNU MERIT SBE, Kaizer Karelpl 19, NL-6211 TC Maastricht, Netherlands; [Antonietti, Roberto] Univ Padua, Marco Fanno Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy",Maastricht University; University of Padua,"Antonietti, R (通讯作者)，Univ Padua, Marco Fanno Dept Econ & Management, Via Santo 33, I-35123 Padua, Italy.",roberto.antonietti@unipd.it,,"Antonietti, Roberto/0000-0002-2172-4062",,,,,40,1,1,0,14,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

The reserve life index measures how long reserves would last at the current production rate if there were no additions to reserves. In this study, we examine the time series behavior of the reserve life index for each of the twelve onshore oil producing districts in Texas. Specifically, we model the relationship between reserve life and the real price of oil within a nonlinear ARDL framework. Among the results, we find evidence of both long run and short-run asymmetries in the response of reserve life to increases/decreases in real oil prices. Further, the magnitude of the effect is greater for positive changes in real oil prices than for negative changes in real oil prices. The findings are important to operators, investors and policymakers interested in sustainability. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We also seek to understand whether online prices have distinct dynamics, their advantages and disadvantages, and whether they can serve as reliable source of information for economic research. The word billion in Billion Prices Project was simply meant to express our desire to collect a massive amount of prices, though we in fact reached that number of observations in less than two years. By 2010, we were collecting 5 million prices every day from over 300 retailers in 50 countries. We describe the methodology used to compute online price indexes and show how they co-move with consumer price indexes in most countries. We also use our price data to study price stickiness, and to investigate the law of one price in international economics. Finally we describe how the Billion Prices Project data are publicly shared and discuss why data collection is an important endeavor that macro- and international economists should pursue more often.","[Cavallo, Alberto] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Informat Technol & Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cavallo, Alberto] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Appl Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rigobon, Roberto] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Rigobon, Roberto] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Appl Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Cavallo, Alberto; Rigobon, Roberto] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); National Bureau of Economic Research,"Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Informat Technol & Management, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Appl Econ, 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.;Cavallo, A (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",acavallo@mit.edu,,,MIT Sloan,MIT Sloan,"We thank Manuel Bertolotto, Maria Fazzolari, Diego Aparicio, Belen Bazano, and Augusto Ospital for outstanding research assistance at various stages of our Billion Prices Project research.

Drawing a parallel between the main changes in banking regulations since the 1960s and the evolutions in the economic analyses of regulation over the same period, it shows that the shift from the public interest theory of regulation that prevailed until the late 1960s towards the private interest theory of regulation accounts for the substitution of micro-prudential regulations for macro-prudential ones and explains a paradigmatic change in the conception of the regulatory instruments of the banking authorities. It also shows that although the outcome of several factors, the 2007-2008 crisis was also a consequence of the fact that the economic analysis of banking regulations supported micro-prudential regulations that fail to take the global features and impact of banking activities into account and have proved unable to recommend effective solutions in a context of crisis.","[Harnay, Sophie] Univ Lorraine, Nancy, France; [Harnay, Sophie; Scialom, Laurence] Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Defense, EconomiX, F-54035 Nancy, France",Universite de Lorraine,"Harnay, S (通讯作者)，BETA CNRS UMR 7522, 13 Pl Carnot,CO 26, F-54035 Nancy, France.;Harnay, S (通讯作者)，Univ Paris Ouest Nanterre La Defense, EconomiX CNRS UMR 7235, 13 Pl Carnot,CO 26, F-54035 Nancy, France.;Harnay, S (通讯作者)，Fac Droit Sci Econ & Gest, 13 Pl Carnot,CO 26, F-54035 Nancy, France.",sophie.harnay@univ-lorraine.fr,"Harnay, Sophie/ABB-8027-2021","Harnay, Sophie/0000-0001-7546-1846",,,,,95,21,23,3,28,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

We then examine trends over time in foreign holdings of debt securities and find that capital has been flowing from the USA and the eurozone economies to both advanced Asia (especially Japan) and developing Asia, and that foreign holdings of debt securities have been increasing in advanced as well as developing Asia but for different reasons. The main reason in the case of advanced Asia (especially Japan) appears to be higher risk-adjusted returns, whereas the main reason in the case of developing Asia appears to be the growth of debt securities markets combined with relatively weak home bias and (in the case of short-term securities) lower exchange rate volatility. Finally, we find that since the global financial crisis, foreign holdings of debt securities have declined (i.e. that home bias has strengthened) in all economies and regions except developing Asia, where they have increased (except for a temporary decline in 2008) but where their share is still much lower than the optimal share warranted by the capital asset pricing market model.","[Horioka, Charles Yuji] Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Horioka, Charles Yuji] Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan; [Terada-Hagiwara, Akiko] Asian Dev Bank, Econ Res & Reg Cooperat Dept, 6 ADB Ave, Madaluyong 1550, Metro Manila, Philippines; [Nomoto, Takaaki] Cabinet Secretariat, Chiyoda Ku, 1-6-1 Nagatacho, Tokyo 1008968, Japan",National Bureau of Economic Research; Osaka University; Asian Development Bank,"Horioka, CY (通讯作者)，Asian Growth Res Inst, Kokurakita Ku, 11-4 Ohtemachi, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka 8030814, Japan.;Horioka, CY (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, 1050 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.;Horioka, CY (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Inst Social & Econ Res, 6-1 Mihogaoka, Osaka, Ibaraki 5670047, Japan.",horioka@iser.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Horioka, Charles Yuji/AFE-9181-2022",,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI [15H01950]; Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center for Behavioral Economics, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [15H01950] Funding Source: KAKEN","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI)); Asian Growth Research Institute; MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center for Behavioral Economics, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","This work was supported by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI Grant Number 15H01950, an Asian Growth Research Institute project grant and a grant from the MEXT Joint Usage/Research Center for Behavioral Economics, Institute of Social and Economic Research, Osaka University.",,28,4,4,0,6,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1351-3958,1467-8381,,ASIAN ECON J,Asian Econ.

The adoption of inflation targeting (IT) by many EMEs has raised questions about its relative suitability in dealing with these shocks compared with other monetary policy regimes. This paper tests the robustness of IT compared with monetary targeting and exchange rate targeting regimes in coping with commodity terms of trade shocks using the panel vector autoregressive technique. The results show that in general, IT countries respond better to commodity terms of trade shocks especially with respect to inflation and output gap. However, exchange rates are more volatile in IT countries than in exchange rate targeting countries. The results suggest that EME countries can reduce the adverse effects of commodity terms of trade fluctuations when they adopt IT, but they also need to pay attention to exchange rate movements.","[Hove, Seedwell] World Bank, Zimbabwe Country Off, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Mama, Albert Touna] Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7700 Rondebosch, South Africa; [Tchana, Fulbert Tchana] World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA",The World Bank; University of Cape Town; The World Bank,"Hove, S (通讯作者)，World Bank, Zimbabwe Country Off, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",shove@worldbank.org,,,Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),Economic Research Southern Africa (ERSA),"World Bank, Macroeconomic and Fiscal Management Global Practice, Washington DC, USA.

This trend began in the early 1980s, if not somewhat earlier. Next, we present evidence for a variety of hypotheses that might explain this downward trend, which is only partly related to population demographics and is not due to the secular shift in industrial composition. Moreover, this decline in labor market fluidity seems unlikely to have been caused by an improvement in worker firm matching or by mounting regulatory strictness in the labor or housing markets. Plausible avenues for further exploration include changes in the worker firm relationship, particularly with regard to compensation adjustment; changes in firm characteristics, such as firm size and age; and a decline in social trust, which may have increased the cost of job searches or made both parties in the hiring process more risk averse.","[Molloy, Raven; Smith, Christopher L.; Trezzi, Riccardo] Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA; [Wozniak, Abigail] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve System Board of Governors; University of Notre Dame,"Molloy, R (通讯作者)，Fed Reserve Board, Richmond, VA 23261 USA.",,,"Smith, Christopher/0000-0002-9648-5641; Molloy, Raven/0000-0002-5041-803X",,,,,70,40,57,1,9,BROOKINGS INST PRESS,WASHINGTON,"1775 MASSACHUSETTS AVE NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA",0007-2303,1533-4465,,BROOKINGS PAP ECO AC,Brook.

We contribute to this debate by measuring consumers' willingness to pay for fuel economy using a novel identification strategy and high quality microdata from wholesale used car auctions. We leverage differences in future fuel costs across otherwise identical vehicles that have different current mileage, and therefore different remaining lifetimes. By seeing how price differences across high and low mileage vehicles of different fuel economies change in response to shocks to the price of gasoline, we estimate the relationship between vehicle prices and future fuel costs. Our data suggest that used automobile prices move one for one with changes in present discounted future fuel costs, which implies that consumers fully value fuel economy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We uncover a number of behavioral patterns: On the one hand, senders follow exaggeration strategies, qualitatively similar to those predicted by a special case for the fully revealing equilibrium. Receivers, on the other hand, follow differing heuristics depending on the senders' biases, which are not always sequentially rational.

The growth is related to the levels of employment and value added in enterprises, as well as, ten institutional variables. We test the data for consistency of behavioural patterns in various countries and gradually remove outlying observations that can lead to erroneous conclusions when using the classic estimators; this is a quite unique approach in panel data analysis. In the first part of this paper we outline a highly robust method of estimation based on fixed effects and least trimmed squares (LTS). In its second part we apply this method on the panel data of 28 countries in 2002-2008 testing for the hypothesis that micro and small businesses in Europe use different strategies for their growth. We run a series of econometric tests where we regress employment and total net production in micro and small businesses on three economic factors: gross capital returns, labour cost gaps in small relative to large enterprises and GDP per capita. In addition, we test the role of 10 institutional factors in the growth of family businesses.","[Benacek, Vladimir] Charles Univ Prague, FSV Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic; [Michalikova, Eva] Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague; Brno University of Technology,"Benácek, V (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, FSV Inst Econ Studies, Prague, Czech Republic.;Michalíková, E (通讯作者)，Brno Univ Technol, Fac Business & Management, CS-61090 Brno, Czech Republic.",benacekv@fsv.cuni.cz; michalikova@volny.cz,"Benacek, Vladimir/E-9717-2018",,Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [P402/12/0982]; Research Project of VUT in Brno [FP-S-15-2787]; Research Project of Institutional Developing Project of FP VUT in Brno [IS 2014-04],Grant Agency of the Czech Republic(Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicNorwegian Agency for Development Cooperation - NORAD); Research Project of VUT in Brno; Research Project of Institutional Developing Project of FP VUT in Brno,"The authors are grateful for the financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic No. P402/12/0982 and Research Project of VUT in Brno No. FP-S-15-2787 and Research Project of Institutional Developing Project of FP VUT in Brno, No. IS 2014-04.",,26,2,3,0,17,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

To conduct the empirical analysis we use a dataset collected with the support of the Italian energy regulatory authority, comprising micro data on monetary incentives and physical assets for the largest electricity distribution operator in Italy (86 % of the market). Our results show that physical assets and operational expenditures do affect service quality. Moreover, when we investigate causality in the relationship between incentives to quality and the use of capital and non-capital resources, we find that incentives Granger-cause capital expenditures ( and not vice-versa). Finally, our results reveal an asymmetric effect of rewards and penalties on capital expenditures' decisions across areas with different quality levels. From these findings, we derive several policy implications.","[Cambini, Carlo; Rondi, Laura] Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy; [Cambini, Carlo] EUI, Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy; [Cambini, Carlo; Fumagalli, Elena] Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Milan, Italy; [Fumagalli, Elena] Politecn Milan, DIG, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Rondi, Laura] CERIS CNR, Moncalieri Torino, Italy",Polytechnic University of Turin; European University Institute; Bocconi University; Polytechnic University of Milan; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR),"Cambini, C (通讯作者)，Politecn Torino, DIGEP, Turin, Italy.;Cambini, C (通讯作者)，EUI, Florence Sch Regulat, Florence, Italy.;Cambini, C (通讯作者)，Bocconi Univ, IEFE, Milan, Italy.",carlo.cambini@polito.it; elena.fumagalli@polimi.it; laura.rondi@polito.it,"Rondi, Laura/ADS-4154-2022","CAMBINI, CARLO/0000-0002-7471-8133; RONDI, Laura/0000-0002-7683-1164; FUMAGALLI, ELENA MARIA/0000-0002-5387-2860","Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water","Italian Regulatory Authority for Electricity, Gas and Water","For comments on earlier versions of this paper we thank the Editor, Michael Crew, two anonymous referees, Alberto Iozzi, Tooraj Jamasb and David E.M.

A seller privately knows the quality of an indivisible good and decides when to trade. In each period, he may draw a dropout shock that forces him to trade immediately. To avoid costly delay, the seller with a low-quality good voluntarily pools with early dropouts, implying that the expected quality of the good increases over time. We characterize the time-varying equilibrium trading dynamics. It is demonstrated that the maximum equilibrium delay of trade is decreasing in the initial belief that the good is of high quality.","[Dilme, Francesc] Univ Bonn, Inst Mikrookon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Li, Fei] Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, 107 Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA",University of Bonn; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,"Dilmé, F (通讯作者)，Univ Bonn, Inst Mikrookon, Adenauerallee 24-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.;Li, F (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Econ, 107 Gardner Hall,CB 3305, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",fdilme@uni-bonn.de; lifei@email.unc.edu,"Li, Fei/E-9113-2017","Dilme, Francesc/0000-0001-6317-8664",,,,,23,6,7,1,4,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7669,1945-7685,,AM ECON J-MICROECON,Am.

We estimate meta-regressions for samples of Morishima substitution elasticities for labor, land, and capital vs. the polluting input. Much of the heterogeneity of Morishima elasticities can be explained by type of primal or dual function, functional form, type and observational level of data, input categories, number of outputs, type of output, time period, and country categories. Each estimated long-run elasticity for the reference case, which is most relevant for assessing GHG emissions through life-cycle analysis, is greater than 1.0 and significantly different from zero. Most predicted long-run elasticities remain significantly different from zero at the data means. These findings imply that life-cycle analysis based on fixed proportion production functions could provide grossly inaccurate measures of GHG of biofuel. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so, bounds-test cointegration techniques in conjunction with Granger causality tests provide the econometric framework upon which the respective models are tested. Annual time series were used spanning from 1971 to 2012, for the UK. The empirical evidence is in line with the theoretical exposition insofar as investment decisions by industry are significantly conditioned by industrial profit. Moreover, the distribution of profits between industry and finance, in conjunction with policy objectives, appears to be playing an instrumental role in affecting capital accumulation.","[Alexiou, Constantinos; Nellis, Joseph G.] Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England",Cranfield University,"Alexiou, C; Nellis, JG (通讯作者)，Cranfield Univ, Sch Management, Cranfield MK43 0AL, Beds, England.",,"Alexiou, Constantinos/GVT-4165-2022","Alexiou, Professor Constantinos/0000-0002-9481-3066",,,,,74,3,3,1,8,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2016,63,1,,,,,113,133,,10.2298/PAN1601113A,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DJ3DL,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000374084900006,0

The data cover the monthly period 2005: 1-2013: 10 for the time series of total industrial production, 36 sub-industrial sectors' production and FDI. Following nonlinear threshold cointegration and VECMs, the article yields that (i) total industrial production and nine sub-industrial productions have positive long-run impact on FDI with significant error corrections, (ii) six sub-industrial productions have short-term influence on FDI, (iii) FDI has long-run positive impulse on total industrial production and nine sub-industrial productions with some significant error corrections and (iv) FDI affects four sub-industrial productions in the short run as well as in the long run. The results of VECMs from (i) also reveal that the all short-term adjustment parameters are found significant and powerful in 10 typical regimes (Regime-1s) and in 5 extreme regimes (Regime-2s). Finally, the outcome of VECMs from (iii) yields that short-term adjustment parameters are found significant and powerful in two typical regimes and in four extreme regimes. Eventually, considering FDI's positive impact in the short and long run, this article suggests that policymakers promote specifically the FDI inflows to the sectors of intermediate goods, manufacture of beverages, manufacture of rubber and plastic and manufacture of other nonmetallic mineral products.","[Bilgili, Faik; Baglitas, H.

The increase of interest in higher education has led to public concerns on how efficiently funds for higher education institutions (HEIs) are being used. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the relative efficiency of 31 higher education institutions of economic orientation in Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia and Herzegovina for the year 2012. The analysis was carried out using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The underlying premise of the research is that HEIs are not necessarily equally efficient in all areas of activity. To confirm this, four different models are tested. Three models evaluate the relative efficiency of the observed institutions within three fundamental areas of their activity: teaching, research and international activity, while the fourth model evaluates the relative efficiency of overall activity. The empirical findings suggest that higher education institutions are not equally efficient in all areas of activity, which is why evaluation by individual areas is needed. If the evaluations were made aggregately, it would be possible for HEIs to compensate the less efficient results in one area with the more efficient results in other areas of activity. These actions could affect the results in the way that they are unfoundedly better than that obtained by individual approach. The results of this paper can be used to improve the efficiency of higher education institutions. The institution position, relative to their peers, gives valuable information about its relative efficiency performance and leads to suggestions for improvement.","[Blecich, Andrea Arbula; Zikovic, Ivana Tomas] Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Blecich, AA (通讯作者)，Fac Econ, Ivana Filipovica 4, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",aarbula@efri.hr; itomas@efri.hr,"Žiković, Ivana Tomas/R-5169-2018; Blecich, Andrea Arbula/R-6647-2018; Tomas Žiković, Ivana/AAJ-8542-2020; Arbula Blecich, Andrea/JMQ-7081-2023","Blecich, Andrea Arbula/0000-0002-1379-6410; Tomas Žiković, Ivana/0000-0002-9156-3479; Arbula Blecich, Andrea/0000-0002-1379-6410",,,,,18,0,0,1,7,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,91,100,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600008,0

Development of philosophy of social responsibility and selection of proper communication inside and outside of business entity can be diversely inspiring for different companies and organizations. Spreading of social responsibility awareness by using process approach model has potential in implementation process as well as in process of further management. By using process approach, it is possible to help with creation and strengthening of social values and with solving of various socio-ecological problems. Properly chosen strategy is the key to public awareness. Authors see potential in usage of principles and rules of process approach to create marketing communication strategy.

We use cross-country panel data to set up an instrumental variable model of high-income export destinations and wages. We find robust evidence that, worldwide, industries that ship products to high-income destinations do pay higher average wages. Our IV results indicate this is a causal relationship. We also explore the operating mechanisms, and find robust evidence in support of a dual link. First, industries that ship products to high-income destination export higher quality goods (as measured by the average unit value of exports within industries). This is because high-income countries demand high-quality products. Second, the provision of quality is costly and requires more intensive use of higher-wage skilled labor. As a result, the production of higher quality products at the industry level creates a wage premium and conduces to higher average industry wages. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Because standard choice data conflate utilities and perception, they point out that it is inadequate for research in which attention is endogenous. The review focuses on their thesis that advances in our understanding of attention require modeling of novel choice-based data sets, and corresponding methods of measurement.

Our results suggest that the public share of total healthcare financing in nine OECD countries has exhibited signs of co-movement over the period of 1960-2012 in the short, medium, and long-runs. The public-private mix of healthcare financing in National Health Service (NHS) systems led those in the Social Health Insurance (SHI) and Private Health Insurance (PHI) systems in the short and medium-runs, while the public-private mix of healthcare financing in the PHI health care system lagged behind that of the SHI and NHS systems over the period of 1960-2012.

The group was equally divided also by gender (male, female) and age (young, old). Comparisons of cerebral and emotional indices previously defined have been performed to highlight gender differences between TV commercial and scenes of interest of specific commercials. Findings show how EEG methodologies, along with the measurements of autonomic variables, could be used to obtain information not obtainable otherwise with verbal interviews.

J,"Choi, N",,,,"Choi, Namsuk",,,Do trade reforms affect changes in patterns of comparative advantage?,JOURNAL OF KOREA TRADE,,,English,Article,,,,,,Exports; Trade liberalization; Reforms; Structural upgrading,LIBERALIZATION; GROWTH,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of foreign trade liberalization and trade reforms on the process of structural upgrading, and explore the extent to which they provide impetus for exports. Design/methodology/approach - This paper accounts for trade liberalization dates, cumulative years in open regime, and the density of 1,006 products in the patterns of comparative advantage for 132 countries from 1975 to 2000. The effects of trade liberalizations and trade reforms in open regime on future export performance are estimated by using various empirical strategies. Findings - This paper finds that the speed of moving from simple poor-country goods to rich-country goods in export depends not only on having a route to nearby goods of increasingly higher value, but also on the increase in the cumulative years in open regime. In particular, a 1 percent change in the relatedness across products with trade reform in open regime increases the probability of exporting a new product by 2.0 percent more. Originality/value - A contribution of this paper is that it measures the extent to which trade reform in open regime affects the evolution of comparative advantage, even after taking account of the role of relatedness of exported products as in the Hausmann and Klinger (2006, 2007). In this paper, empirical findings of a comprehensive product level cross-country time-series data analysis may contribute to generalize the role of trade reform on structural upgrading not only for a pro-competitive export country like Korea but also for a typical developing country.","[Choi, Namsuk] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University,"Choi, N (通讯作者)，Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea.",namsuk.choi@jbnu.ac.kr,"Choi, Namsuk/AAC-2830-2019; Choi, Namsuk/HLW-8040-2023","Choi, Namsuk/0000-0002-2113-2833;",,,,,21,1,1,1,10,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

Unlike the numerous previous studies, we considered the unit root tests with a structural break and suggested that all price variables were stationary series. We also showed that the adjustments of retail gasoline price follow a politico-economic asymmetry. Moreover, gasoline price responses to exchange-rate shocks were slow and complex and exhibited reverse adjustments during periods of initial exchange-rate depreciation. This is potentially because domestic petroleum companies must purchase foreign currency before purchasing chide oil. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

It can come from local, regional, national or transnational level. In Europe, there are examples of systematic support at different levels. Scientific studies result in models of spin-off companies and support models. The result of content analysis of official EU and OECD documents and scientific studies is a review of support of academic spin-off processes in Europe.

We consider a model in which R&D efforts of an incumbent firm generate partly tacit technological know-how embodied in a key R&D employee, who might use it to form a start-up. The availability of complementary assets influences whether new firms are created and determine expected profits for start-up's founders. A large availability of complementary assets has the direct effect that the generation of start-ups is fostered. However, as a strategic effect, the incentives of incumbents to invest in R&D may be reduced because of the increased danger of knowledge loss occurring through start-up formation. We characterize the effects of an increase in the availability of complementary assets, showing that counter-intuitively there are cases in which it induces an increase in incumbents' R&D investment.

Postulating the automaticity of market forces, the Chicago school's ascendency in the early 1970s effectively marginalized growthmanship, while eliding stagnation and refocusing economics on vacuous, equilibrium-driven models. As a result, growthmanship was superseded by the institutionalization of wage stagnation as a macroeconomic policy objective. An institutionalist analysis of stagnation posits conditional and contingent conjunctures and denies the determinism underlying the conceptualization of permanent tendencies. I hypothesize the emergence of a social structure of redistribution based on the institutionalization of wage stagnation. Wage stagnation is a condition arising from the pursuit of neoliberal macroeconomic policies that are antithetical to full employment and wage growth.","[Cypher, James M.] Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Doctoral Program Dev Studies UAED, Econ, Zacatecas, Zac, Mexico; [Cypher, James M.] Denison Univ, Binzagr Inst, Granville, OH 43023 USA",Universidad Autonoma de Zacatecas; University System of Ohio; Denison University,"Cypher, JM (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Zacatecas, Doctoral Program Dev Studies UAED, Econ, Zacatecas, Zac, Mexico.;Cypher, JM (通讯作者)，Denison Univ, Binzagr Inst, Granville, OH 43023 USA.",,,,,,,,28,1,1,0,1,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

We use data from binary-choice dictator games run with school children in rural Sierra Leone to measure aversion to inequality, altruism and spite towards peers within and outside one's social group. We exploit shocks in the level of rainfall in the place and year of children's birth as sources of variation in the environment at the time children are born. We find that being born into an environment with higher rainfall, which is associated with worse health outcomes, lowers the probability that a child will demonstrate a propensity to maximise her own material pay-off. We show that rainfall shocks are linked to children's height-for-age and suggest that they influence preferences through their effect on children's health. Whether the relationship is a direct one from health to physical and cognitive development, or an indirect one through parents' socialisation, our results suggest that preferences are shaped by features of the physical environment in which individuals are born.","[d'Adda, Giovanna] Politecn Milan, Dipartimento Ingn Gestionale, I-20133 Milan, Italy; [Levely, Ian] Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands",Polytechnic University of Milan; Wageningen University & Research,"Levely, I (通讯作者)，Wageningen Univ, Dev Econ Grp, NL-6700 AP Wageningen, Netherlands.",ian.levely@wur.nl,,"d'ADDA, GIOVANNA/0000-0002-2327-8481",Czech Science Foundation [13-20217S],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic),"We thank Michal Bauer, Alesandra Cassar and Julie Chytilova for their help and for access to data from this project, as well Abigail Barr, Bjorn Bartlin, Pamela Jakiela, Owen Ozier and Bertil Tungodden for their comments.

The Argentine macroeconomic regime established in 1991 and based on the hard peg of the peso to the dollar at a 1 to 1 parity ended in a multiple crisis in 2001-2. Beyond the default on the public debt, the crisis also involved the breakdown of the domestic financial system, and an almost complete isolation of the country from the international financial markets as a consequence of the default. Under such a deep crisis and the consequent uncertainty, the recovery of the solvency of the financial institutions was an almost insurmountable enterprise. However, with a gradualist approach (contrary to the advice of the International Monetary Fund) and a degree of regulatory forbearance, the financial and monetary authorities were able to recover the health of the financial system, which became much more resilient to shocks, even if its development has been very slow and, as a consequence, the contribution of domestic credit to the economic expansion of the 2000s can be considered almost negligible.","[Damill, Mario; Frenkel, Roberto; Simpson, Lucio] Ctr Study State & Soc EDES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Damill, Mario] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Damill, M (通讯作者)，Ctr Study State & Soc EDES, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.;Damill, M (通讯作者)，Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn, RA-1033 Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina.",,,,Ford Foundation,Ford Foundation,Lucio Simpson is a nonresident fellow at the Center for the Study of State and Society-CEDES.

Short Run Relations,COINTEGRATION TESTS,"The paper addresses the problem of aging from a topical perspective, namely its impact on labour productivity, one of the main sources of an economy's competitiveness. Labour resources tend to become a limited 'asset' in many European Union countries, even the most developed ones, like Germany or Italy, where the age structure of the population is changing towards an increase in the share of older persons. In this context, aging and its effects on the productivity of older workers can become a challenge for the countries that are trying to maintain their sustainable economic growth. Our article is founded on the success stories of some of the countries the most affected by aging, namely Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Finland, and has the main aim to investigate how productivity and the number of older workers influence sectoral competitiveness in the studied countries. The originality of the paper lies in the comparative perspective from which this phenomenon is investigated: the comparison between four developed economies that seem to have managed preserving a positive correlation between productivity and the aging workforce in recent years, with the main purpose to identify the driving factors of their long- term competitiveness and the comparison between economic sectors, in order to identify those who can be the sources of sustainable economic growth. Modern econometric analysis using Dynamic OLS (DOLS) and ARDL models based on panel data on five economic sectors and 19 years scientifically substantiates some solutions possibly to be adopted by other countries facing the same demographic challenges. More precisely, less labour intensive industries and young people involvement in innovative industries are some of the key competitiveness factors.","[Dimian, Gina Cristina; Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile; Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies ASE, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Dimian, GC (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies ASE, 6 Piata Romana,1st Dist, Bucharest 010374, Romania.",gina.dimian@csie.ase.ro; ileanu@csie.ase.ro; mirela.aceleanu@economie.ase.ro,"Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/GYU-2760-2022; Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile/V-1290-2019; Ileanu, Bogdan/HDM-5675-2022; Gina Cristina, Dimian/HOF-2342-2023","Ileanu, Bogdan Vasile/0000-0002-9229-3431; Aceleanu, Mirela Ionela/0000-0002-7884-8445",,,,,49,5,6,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

To detect the factors of de/coupling of the environmental variable, represented by the DMC, from the economic variable, represented by the GDP, in the EU economy, the changes of DMC were divided into three effects. These factors include the economic activity (scale), the composition or structure of the EU economy with respect to the countries, and material intensity of the countries. The results indicate that the intensity effect showed the highest magnitude in the longer-term periods 2002 2014 and 2004 2014, but overall and in the majority of years, this effect was negative. The scale effect showed the second highest extent, whereas the composition effect was only slight.

Economic convergence in general is understood as a process of decreasing of differences in the economic level and efficiency of individual countries, and therefore it serves as a starting point of the international comparison and important part of macroeconomic analyses as well. When the Czech Republic joined the EU in 2004, agreed to take steps to become a member of a higher degree of integration as soon as possible. For this purpose, to determine whether the EU member states are ready to join the Eurozone, nominal convergence criteria were defined, but they are not primarily used to determine the real convergence. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the hypothesis that the economic level of the Czech Republic and the Eurozone states converged in the pre-crisis period 1995-2009 to the average economic level of the Eurozone. The theoretical part of the paper is devoted to the methodological bases of the economic convergence. The empirical part is aimed at econometric modelling of real convergence of economic level in selected economies. The final part of the paper summarizes main findings of the paper that confirmed the real convergence process within the Czech Republic and Eurozone countries before economic crisis in period 1995-2009.","[Dvorokova, Katerina; Hodula, Martin] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolskatrida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Dvoroková, K (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolskatrida 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.",katerina.dvorokova@vsb.cz; martin.hodula@vsb.cz,"Dvoroková, Kateřina/C-6917-2018","Dvoroková, Kateřina/0000-0002-1092-8078",Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness [CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.02],Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness,This paper was supported within Operational Programme Education for Competitiveness - Project No. CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.02.,,36,0,0,0,0,"SILESIAN UNIV OPAVA, SCHOOL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION KARVINA",KARVINA,"UNIVERZITNI NAM 1934-3, KARVINA, 73340, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7510-210-2,,,,2016,,,,,,,120,131,,,,,,12,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BH8SH,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000403638200013,0

Our findings show that, after controlling for both firms and founders' characteristics, firms whose founders had prior experience in a related upstream industry such as semiconductors enjoy a relatively lower hazard of exit with respect to intra-industry spinoffs and other types of start-ups.

Literature recognises the fragmentation of production processes on a global scale and the emergence of global value chains (GVCs). As the result of these processes, the final value of the goods and services produced by particular countries contains both domestic and foreign value added content. In this situation, it becomes necessary to revise the approach to determining the position of countries in world export. The article aims to analyse the position of the EU-15 countries in global export in comparison with other countries based on the concept of measuring foreign trade by value added. The calculations use the OECD-WTO data from the TiVA database. Due to the availability of data, the analysis comprised the years 1995-2011. The study showed that the real position of the EU-15 countries was lower than the one given in official statistics. Their share in global export measured based on the new concept was smaller than according to the conventional approach, only to further decrease significantly in the years 1995-2011. This is also confirmed by changes in the position of the EU-15 countries on the list of top global exporters. At the start of the researched period, nine old EU member states featured in the top twenty, while in 2011 only six and most of them ranked lower than in 1995.","[Fronczek, Malgorzata] Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Fronczek, M (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",malgorzata.fronczek@ue.katowice.pl,"Fronczek, Małgorzata/W-1554-2018","Fronczek, Małgorzata/0000-0002-1502-1168",,,,,24,2,2,0,1,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,458,467,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800057,0

We adopt a new forecasting approach by using squared overnight return, pre-open volatility of the same asset and realized volatilities of related assets from other markets, where intraday data is still available while the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) is closed, to predict stock volatility. We use a number of different specifications of the Heterogeneous Autoregressive (BAR) model to identify an optimal way to incorporate this additional information. We evaluate the forecasting performance of 45 ASX 200 stocks, categorized in three groups based on their annual total trading volumes, three Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) indices and the S&P/ASX 200 index using a rolling estimation method. Our empirical analysis of the ASX constituents confirms the usefulness of using pre-open volatility of the same asset and realized volatilities of related assets from other markets when the ASX is closed for forecasting future volatility. Furthermore, we find that the predictive power of overnight information for all stocks and indices is higher during the market opening period and declines gradually over the trading day. However, the decrement is steeper for active stocks, suggesting that the predictive power is higher for inactively traded stocks. Finally, we evaluate the economic significance of the augmented BAR model that includes realized volatilities of related assets from other markets, and we find that it provides significant utility gains to a typical mean-variance investor.

This is particularly important for the development of transport systems, which play an important role in the livelihood of the population through the provision of spatial relations: interregional, interstate, between the production and consumers and other. The development of information society has necessitated the acceleration of all processes, including reducing the delivery time. In this regard, an important condition for ensuring the competitiveness of the national transport system in the world market of transportation and logistics services is the scientific and technological transport development and activation of innovation activities of transportation and logistics companies in accordance with the main vector of its development to improve the time of delivery. The authors propose to use the instrument of strategic controlling for the purposes of assessing the national transport system competitiveness. The article presents the key-point indicators for estimation of transport systems innovativeness. Using the proposed evaluation system will allow to perform benchmarking of national transport systems and to improve them to the level of advanced countries in order to harmonize the global transport system.

The system of measurement and assessment of labor productivity should be applicable for comparison of this indicator in different countries and for decision-making to provide the economic growth and prosperity of the country in the context of global challenges. In comparison with the developed countries, in Russia the level of labor productivity is unacceptably low. Russia with a large number of working hours a year has rather poor performance indexes in terms of hourly wages.

In the aftermath of the global financial crisis the policymakers worldwide expressed deep concern about the lack of financial knowledge and, as the recent research has suggested, lack of financial literacy amongst different population groups. Faced with a wide variety of available financial products and services today both individuals and company management need to be able to make informed financial decisions. The quality of these decisions will greatly depend on the level of knowledge of the decision makers, including their financial literacy. It has been argued that financial literacy could be one of the key factors of economic growth, as decisions made by management directly affect the business, financial performance and, ultimately, overall economy. The main purpose of this paper is to evaluate perceptions of the decision makers of the companies of Tuzla Canton, Bosnia and Herzegovina, with regards to financial literacy construct and the overall importance of financial literacy in their decision making process. As part of this study, the level of financial literacy of decision makers and employees in Tuzla Canton companies was also explored and evaluated. The research, conducted on a random sample of managers and employees of the companies in Tuzla Canton, showed that company managers are aware of the importance of financial literacy and that they would like to see the financial education becoming a development priority for all employees. While the results indicated that the current financial literacy of the research sample is rather satisfactory, it is clear that the level of financial awareness and literacy can be directly correlated with higher levels of education.","[Kozarevic, Emira; Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic] Tuzla Univ, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg; [Dzafic, Jasmina] Zenica Univ, Fac Econ, Fak Ska 3, Zenica 72000, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Tuzla; University of Zenica,"Kozarevic, E (通讯作者)，Tuzla Univ, Fac Econ, Univ 8, Tuzla 75000, Bosnia & Herceg.",emira.kozarevic@untz.ba; meldina.kokorovic@untz.ba; jasmina.dzafic@ef.unze.ba,"Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/AAS-7598-2021","Jukan, Meldina Kokorovic/0000-0002-4954-5437",,,,,12,0,0,0,3,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,449,458,,,,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600045,0

On the basis of three measures, namely R& D expenditure, R& D employment and patent applications, two regional innovation indicators have been calculated. The first methodological approach involves computation the composite indicator while the second approach corresponds to the concept of technical efficiency calculated by Data Envelopment Analysis. The point is that these two approaches pose V4 regions in a completely different light, both surprising and disappointing. These findings cause a question which ranking shows a truer picture of the innovativeness in examined regions. Both methodological approaches have their cons and pros. Composite indicator is a kind of diagnosis of innovative potential based on sub- measures which are essential preconditions for innovativeness, but at the same time this method is weak in assessing the productivity of resources employed in pro- innovative activity. Such an approach usually favours highly developed regions where economic wealth is strongly influenced by factors rooted in beneficial historical circumstances, geographical advantages, political significance, etc. On the contrary, the approach which focuses on examining the relationship between innovative inputs and outputs disregards these specific regional conditions which make up their competitiveness and ability to development. This approach also is unsatisfying because the innovation potential of any territory is embedded in the conditions of that territory. Thus, the two approaches used in this study to evaluate the regional innovativeness should not be considered as the substitutes but rather as complementary methods.","[Kozun-Cieslak, Grazyna] Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Chrobrego 31, PL-26600 Radom, Poland",Kazimierz Pulaski University of Technology & Humanities in Radom,"Kozun-Cieslak, G (通讯作者)，Univ Technol & Humanities Radom, Fac Econ, Dept Econ, Chrobrego 31, PL-26600 Radom, Poland.",g.kozun@uthrad.pl,"Kozun Cieslak, Grazyna/GLS-1613-2022","Kozun Cieslak, Grazyna/0000-0001-5836-2766",,,,,31,4,4,0,10,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,325,332,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-41,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500042,0

The liberalization of markets and changing conditions of the world economy offers promising perspectives in international activities even for small and medium-sized businesses, which have their irreplaceable roles in the economies of individual countries and function as major employers persistently stimulating competition, thus contributing to a healthier business environment. Although their major advantage compared to big companies is their ability to instantly adapt to changing market requirements, small and medium-sized businesses have limited access to financial resources, information and knowledge due to their size and position in the market. This results in their reduced ability to respond to various business risks, such as an increase in input prices, loss of key markets, potential legislative restrictions, lack of skilled workers due to limited wage costs and lower image. Since one of the possible alternatives for further development of a small business is its entry to a foreign market, this paper aims to clearly define the impact of globalization on the Czech business environment and identify factors that influence the success of small and medium-sized businesses in their expansion to foreign markets.","[Kuchynkova, Ladislava] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Kuchynková, L (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Dept Corp Econ, Lipova 41a, Brno 60200, Czech Republic.",Ladikuchynkova@gmail.com,"Kuchynková, Ladislava/AAF-1771-2020",,,,,,21,1,1,0,5,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1110,1118,,,,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800138,0

Unlike most previous studies, we apply a dynamic framework to account for a regular inflow of contributions and impose specific investment constraints that make the simulation more realistic. Our outcomes challenge the conventional knowledge concerning the need for currency hedging. We discover that in the case of Poland, shortening the currency positions is undesirable, as it amplifies the portfolio variance. Moreover, we provide evidence that pension funds should internationalize their portfolios even further to fully exploit the available diversification gains. Finally, the obtained simulation results are matched with real data.

These two visions of capitalism have important implications for our understanding of political power over workers, and also to our understanding of political power over land and its natural resources. The role of land and natural resources was not discussed in the Cambridge controversies, but is addressed in Piero Sraffa's Production of Commodities, and is implied in Piketty's inclusion of land in his definition of capital, which brings in a geographical dimension to our understanding of capitalism and capitalist crises, as I shall argue.","[Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catlica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal; [Martins, Nuno Ornelas] Univ Catlica Portuguesa, CEGE, Lisbon, Portugal",Universidade Catolica Portuguesa; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Catlica Portuguesa, Catolica Porto Business Sch, Lisbon, Portugal.;Martins, NO (通讯作者)，Univ Catlica Portuguesa, CEGE, Lisbon, Portugal.",,"Martins, Nuno/B-6012-2009","Martins, Nuno/0000-0001-7966-6435",,,,,62,3,4,1,3,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

The rate at which workers move between unemployment, employment and across different firms is endogenous because search is directed and, hence, workers can choose whether to seek low-wage jobs that are easy to find or high-wage jobs that are hard to find. We calibrate our theory using data on labor market transitions aggregated across workers of different ages. We validate our theory by showing that it predicts quite well the pattern of labor market transitions for workers of different ages.

J,"Merlo, P",,,,"Merlo, Pawel",,,Consequences of the Absence of Monotonicity of the NPV Function to the Assessment of the Effectiveness of Investment Projects,INZINERINE EKONOMIKA-ENGINEERING ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Investments; Effectiveness of an Investment; Investment Effectiveness; Assessment Methods; NPV and IRR Criteria,CORPORATE-FINANCE; ANOMALIES,"Discount methods do not pose difficulties in calculating and interpreting their outcome as long as the NPV function is monotonic. However, the loss of monotonicity can create obstacles to efficient applications of the mentioned methods. Thus, the thesis developed herein is that the major cause of problems encountered while calculating and interpreting profitability indices based on the discount technique is the course of the NPV function. The objective has been to identify and evaluate situations which may lead to the loss of monotonicity of the NPV, which in turn creates problems when making an assessment of the profitability of an investment and consequently can lead to an erroneous evaluation of the profitability of a planned investment project, whose assessment has been supported by discount methods. To this aim, the course of the function's variability has been scrutinized, and in particular zero points, the function's extreme values and intervals of monotonicity have been determined. The study has verified the research thesis and demonstrated that an assessment becomes more difficult when the NPV function's monotonicity is lost, which may lead to the appearance of more than one internal return rate. The current state of knowledge on this matter suggests that various modifications of such methods should be used in order to avoid any ambiguity of measures in case the NPV function is non-monotonic. However, it is not infrequent that instead of eliminating disadvantages of discount methods the said modifications lead to a mistaken interpretation of the achieved results. Then, a more radical solution is to use an NPV measure as one unburdened with errors originating from unconventional cash flows and to abandon measures like the IRR. However, this solution may also be incorrect because - despite obtaining a single NPV measure - its interpretation cannot be adequate due to the function's intervals in which the NPV increases together with an increasing discount rate, which can lead to an absurd conclusion that an investment project would become more profitable if the cost of capital was higher. Consequently, the methodology for evaluation of the profitability of investment projects employed until today cannot be considered as a correct approach as it may lead to making an unoptimal decision.","[Merlo, Pawel] Univ Warmia & Mazury, R Prawochenski 19, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland",University of Warmia & Mazury,"Merlo, P (通讯作者)，Univ Warmia & Mazury, R Prawochenski 19, PL-10719 Olsztyn, Poland.",merlo@uwm.edu.pl,"Merło, Paweł/Q-2379-2018","Merlo, Pawel/0000-0002-6881-2852",,,,,33,4,4,2,9,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

One of the goals of this paper is to evaluate the mapping of absorption capacity realized by the individuals secretariats of so called Regional permanent conferences in November and December 2015. Results of survey demonstrate the interest of municipalities on projects related to sustainable transport - terminals and bicycle transportation, which could, if implemented, significantly contribute to sustainable mobility in the affected municipalities. The paper also seeks to identify possible barriers for potential applicants for subsidies in the current (ie. Spring 2016) call no. 18: Promoting traffic safety and bicycle transportation safety. The mapping of absorption capacity found some interesting facts, for example that in the regions are in the specific objective 1.2: Increase in share of sustainable forms of transport planned projects worth about 17 billion CZK, and that there are significant differences between individual regions, from which we can deduce the readiness of municipalities and regions in the new subsidy period.","[Merta, Tomas] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic",University of Ostrava,"Merta, T (通讯作者)，Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Human Geog & Reg Dev, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",merta@cirihk.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,0,2,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,682,690,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-87,0.0,,,9,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500088,0

The categorization of the NUTS 2 regions is also one of the aspects determining the level of support from European Structural and Investment Funds. However, evaluation of the level of regional development according to only one indicator GDP per capita does not always have to reflect the real level of regional development. The aim of the paper is to propose an alternative classification of the NUTS 2 regions in the context of the EU Cohesion policy with using the multicriteria approach. The alternative classification is carried out on case study of the NUTS 2 regions in the Visegrad Four countries (V4). Based on TOPSIS method and cluster analysis, three categories of regions according their level of development are determined. The membership of regions in these categories differs in comparison with classification of the European Commission (EC). One of the results shows that region with capital city Mazowieckie achieves the lower level of development and is classified as transition region compared to the EC categorization as more developed region. Applied alternative multicriteria approach to the regional classification can indicate that the explanatory ability of the GDP per capita as only indicator of the level of regional development is limited.","[Minarcikova, Eva] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Minarcíková, E (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept European Integrat, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70121, Czech Republic.",eva.minarcikova@vsb.cz,"Polednikova, Eva/J-5333-2018","Polednikova, Eva/0000-0001-8645-5716",,,,,17,2,2,0,1,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,116,123,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-13,0.0,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500014,0

This is the market with a short history of trading, characterized by a high degree of volatility, with frequent and high jumps in prices. In addition, it is a very narrow and depth lacking market dominated by share trading in that period; the market where the trading in neither treasury, nor corporate bonds was well-developed. All stipulated above indicates a high degree of correlation between the stock price and the current local political events, with the exception of the financial crisis as a global factor. Serbian political shocks are frequent, unpredictable and well defined, which allows us to clearly identify political risk. We have identified the dates/periods when certain jumps in the volatility of the market index return happened, which were then brought into connection with the occurrence of appropriate political news. In that way we were able to quantify the effects of political events on the volatility of return. This is the first paper that deals with the impact of political risk on stock returns in Serbia. Additionally, it is shown that Serbia's score of political risk in December 2009 was the highest in the Eastern Europe region. In 2015 it is around regional Balkan's average, and it lies between Albanian and Macedonian score of political risk index.","[Minovic, Jelena] Inst Econ Sci, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia; [Eric, Dejan] Union Univ, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia",Institute of Economic Sciences,"Minovic, J (通讯作者)，Inst Econ Sci, Zmaj Jovina 12, Belgrade, Serbia.",jelena.minovic@ien.bg.ac.rs; dejan.eric@bba.edu.rs,"Minovic, Jelena/HDN-9968-2022","Minovic, Jelena/0000-0001-6254-4888","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [47009, 179015]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia(Ministry of Education, Science & Technological Development, Serbia)","The authors wish to thank Dr. Milos Bozovic for helpful suggestions and valuable comments.

The Monte Carlo simulation method is the starting point, from which one can generate values of the total claim amount and their statistical treatment for the needs of measuring the value of the capital required to ensure solvency. As a final result the paper presents simulations as an effective problem solving tool, by enabling the development of interactive studies in the risk management process. The methodology presented makes use of Visual Basic for Applications under Microsoft Excel. This opens up the potential of developing actuarial software for solving risk reduction problems by applying various forms of insurance.

Advocating that indirect learning plays a crucial role in explaining this phenomenon, the purpose of this paper is attempted to investigate whether and how learning indirectly from competitors and interfirm relationships enables exporters to successful expand their business into foreign markets. Design/methodology/approach - Drawing on the knowledge-based theory of the firm and the late-mover advantage theory, the authors developed an empirically testable model that explains and predicts the effects of indirect learning on the success of export market expansion. The model was tested using a complied archival data set in regard to exporters' market expansion events and international accounting. The sampling frame was the events of Korean exporters' market expansion. Findings - Empirical evidence shows that exporters' indirect learning from domestic, local, global competitors and from interfirm relationships influence their success of market expansion. In addition, indirect learning from domestic rivals and from interfirm relationships has a more positive effect on the success of expansion into emerging markets than into developed markets. Research limitations/implications - Because the authors employed an event-study method, the limitations of this method can be applied to the present research. In addition, because of the empirical context, the results of the research may lack generalizability. The authors, however, provided an understanding how an exporter can succeed in a foreign market specifically when it has lack of direct experience in the market. Practical implications - The results of the current research suggested that an exporter should try to learn from local, domestic, and global rivals experienced in a foreign market in order to succeed in the market. In addition, exporters should be affiliated with business groups or partnerships because these affiliations can strengthen the information-sharing mechanisms. Moreover, an exporter should focus first on learning from local rivals and then domestic rivals in order to develop proper expansion strategies. Finally, an exporter should attempt to more actively learn from rivals and interfirm relationships when it targets an emerging market than a developed market. Originality/value - Prior studies have emphasized the effects of a firm's direct learning on market development success. The authors, however, filled a knowledge gap of the impacts of learning in two aspects. First, the authors provided an understanding of the effects of indirect learning on market expansion success. Second, the authors demonstrated these effects in the context of export.","[Oh, Han-Mo] Chonbuk Natl Univ, Dept Int Trade, Jeollabuk Do, South Korea; [Arnett, Dennis B.] Texas Tech Univ, Rawls Coll Business, Lubbock, TX 79409 USA; [An, Sang Bong] Shingyeong Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea",Jeonbuk National University; Texas Tech University System; Texas Tech University,"An, SB (通讯作者)，Shingyeong Univ, Dept Business Adm, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea.",asb3030@sgu.ac.kr,"Oh, Han-Mo/ACZ-2253-2022",,research funds of Chonbuk National University,research funds of Chonbuk National University,"The authors thank the participants of the 2015 ANZMAC Conference held at Sidney, Australia for their helpful comments on previous drafts.

Specifically, it focuses on eleven comparably meaningful cities on the border of Bohemia and Moravia in the eastern part of the Pardubice Region. These are the cities Svitavy, Ceska Trebova, Usti nad Orlici, Vysoke Myto, Moravska Trebova, Lanskroun, Litomysl, Chocen, Letohrad, Zamberk and Jablonne nad Orlici with a total population of over 115 000 inhabitants. All of the above cities except Svitavy and Moravska Trebova belong historically to Bohemia and all except Svitavy, Moravska Trebova and Lanskroun lies outside the Sudetenland. The main aim of the paper is to map the level and themes of inter-municipal cooperation between these cities and to verify whether and how this cooperation is taking place or not taking place through current or historical borders. The research question is defined in the form 'In what meanings the theme of 'border' is appeared in the statements of municipal representatives about inter-municipal cooperation?' The article is based on a series of semi-structured interviews were realized with representatives of selected cities in January 2011, from which concluded that the borders play in any case declared cooperation different meaning. Somewhere municipal borders were more central themes, regional or land elsewhere. Itconfirms the assumption that cooperation is declared between municipalities that were and are separated a smaller number of these borders.","[Osman, Robert; Sery, Ondrej; Cernak, Tomas] Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno,"Osman, R (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Geog, Kotlarska 2, Brno 61137, Czech Republic.",osman@mail.muni.cz; ondrej.sery@mail.muni.cz; tomas.cernak@mail.muni.cz,"Osman, Robert/H-2952-2014","Osman, Robert/0000-0002-1066-7664",,,,,20,2,2,0,5,MASARYKOVA UNIV,BRNO,"ZEROTINOVO NAM 617-9, BRNO 601 77, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-210-8273-1,,,,2016,,,,,,,595,604,,10.5817/CZ.MUNI.P210-8273-2016-76,0.0,,,10,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG7FQ,,Bronze,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391253500077,0

Using firm-level data for 48 developing and emerging countries, I analyze whether corruption's impacts are stronger on firms operating in industries that use quality certificates and patents more intensively. My results show that corruption reduces the likelihood that firms in these industries obtain quality certificates. Corruption affects particularly smaller firms but has no impacts on exporters or foreign- and publicly-owned firms. While corruption does not reduce patenting, it lowers machinery investments for innovation. By contrast, more reliable business environments foster firms' adoption of quality certificates.

Although CEEs are characterised by high indicators of trade openness, they show rather different trends of economic development and competitiveness. In most CEEs, trade policies are oriented towards regional trade cooperation with an explicit aim of integration in global economics. The empirical research was conducted on the basis of the panel data for 11 CEEs over the period 2000 to 2014 by applying correlation analysis. Granger-causality test and vector autoregression (VAR) model. This methodological framework allows to test the direct causality relations among trade openness, economic growth and competitiveness, and enables to distinguish between short-run and long-term effect. The research results have confirmed the empirical interdependence among the triad components - trade openness, economic growth and competitiveness, i.e. it has been established that economic growth leads to the improvement of trade openness, while competitiveness of the CEE region leads to the improvement of economic growth, which has obviously disclosed the validity of the theoretical insights. Granger-causality test as well as the developed VAR model have revealed that economic growth has a long-lasting effect on trade openness, while the indicators of competitiveness have a long-lasting effect on GDP per capita in CEEs.","[Pilinkiene, Vaida] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Pilinkiene, V (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",vaida.pilinkiene@ktu.lt,,,,,,,47,25,29,0,13,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

It was fulfilled then in the draft amendment to the Constitution of the Czech Republic and in the draft amendment to Act no. 166/1993 Coll., On the Supreme Audit Office, as amended. The proposal has become the subject of intense criticism from municipalities and regions especially considering that it is not based on any thorough analysis of the system of control activities at all levels of government and public administration. The amount and frequency of the various checks carried towards municipalities and regions have been criticized for a long time. Therefore, the proposal to extend the monitoring authority of the Supreme Audit Office has been perceived as an unjustified additional burden and in May 2016 was rejected in the Senate.

For purposes of this study we conducted a survey on a representative sample of employees in the Czech Republic, in which we asked 64 questions covering various aspects of work and family life, preferences, personality and other characteristics of employees and their jobs. In addition to already established questions, we introduce a number of novel controls, such as grit among psychological factors based on research in psychology by e.g. Duckworth and Quinn (2009), and novel gender identity and family situation variables. This unique survey helps us to shed some light on factors explaining gender wage gap as a whole. In our analyses we first run wage equations starting with very parsimonious specification with the female dummy as a sole explanatory variable, and then we add various subsets of variables one by one in order to examine the effect of their inclusion on the female dummy coefficient. We find that female dummy shows 25.3% wage difference with respect to men and it explains approximately 11.6% of the variance in monthly wages (adj. R-sq) in this most parsimonious model specification. Adding our rich subsets of variables decreases the coefficient to female dummy substantially to 3.2%, and our full model specification explains 53.5% of variance of monthly wages.","[Pytlikova, Mariola; Filipova, Lenka; Balcar, Jiri; Gottvald, Jaromir] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic; [Pytlikova, Mariola] CERGE EI Prague, Prague, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava; Charles University Prague; Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences,"Pytliková, M (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Sokolska Tr 33, Ostrava 70200, Czech Republic.;Pytliková, M (通讯作者)，CERGE EI Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.",mariola.pytlikova@vsb.cz; lenka.filipova@vsb.cz; jiri.balcar@vsb.cz; jaromir.gottvald@vsb.cz,"Pytlikova, Mariola/I-5193-2018; Gottvald, Jaromir/I-5312-2018; Balcar, Jiří/I-4985-2018; Filipova, Lenka/I-5323-2018","Pytlikova, Mariola/0000-0002-0639-152X; Gottvald, Jaromir/0000-0003-3375-6173; Balcar, Jiří/0000-0001-6997-1065; Filipova, Lenka/0000-0002-1047-3632",Czech Science Foundation [GAP402/11/2464]; Student Grant Competition [SP2016/138],Czech Science Foundation(Grant Agency of the Czech Republic); Student Grant Competition,"We are grateful to Alicia Adsera, Tor Eriksson, Armin Falk, Nabanita Datta Gupta, James Heckman and Leslie Stratton (alphabetical order) for helpful discussions on questionnaire during the survey preparation.

We re-examine the question posited by Arrow and Dasgupta (2009) building upon their general framework but recognizing that relative concerns can only apply to visible goods (e.g., cars, clothing, jewelry) and that households consume both visible and non-visible goods. Contrary to Arrow and Dasgupta (2009), the answer to this question turns to be always affirmative: the competitive equilibrium will always be different than the socially optimal one, since individuals do not take into account the negative externality they exert on others through the consumption of the visible good, while the social planner does. If one invokes separability assumptions, then the steady state competitive equilibrium consumption of non-visible goods will be strictly lower than the socially optimal one.","[Quintana-Domeque, Climent] Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England; [Turino, Francesco] Univ Alacant, Dept Fonaments Anal Econ, Alacant 03690, Spain",University of Oxford; Universitat d'Alacant,"Quintana-Domeque, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, Dept Econ, Manor Rd Bldg,Manor Rd, Oxford OX1 3UQ, England.",climent.quintana-domeque@economics.ox.ac.uk; fturino@ua.es,"Turino, Francesco/H-6947-2015","Turino, Francesco/0000-0003-4816-2319","Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO2011-29751, ECO2012-36719]",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),Financial support from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ECO2011-29751 and ECO2012-36719) is gratefully acknowledged.,,18,2,2,1,6,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1704,,,BE J THEOR ECON,B E J.

During the last decades, the financialisation of nonfinancial corporations has been characterised by a shift from a retain and reinvest strategy to a downsize and distribute one. We will investigate this phenomenon by varying some of the model parameters, thus simulating agents' behaviours under alternative settings. On the one hand, more distributed dividends increase agents' wealth and thus consumption may rise due to a wealth-effect. On the other hand, this reduces firms' net worth that may result in a strong dependence of firms' production on bank credit; at the same time, if banks also distribute more dividends, then banks' capital decreases and credit rationing may follow. All in all, financialisation through payout policy impacts financial (in)stability and income distribution, with relevant consequences on macroeconomic dynamics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

I find that structural technological and financial parameters of one-sector model are time-varying during 1936-2006. Time-varying parameters correlate with the real exchange rate, suggesting potential misspecification of the one-sector model. Therefore, I propose a two-sector model that endogenously accounts for the real exchange rate. In this model, stationary productivity shocks and the country premium together explain a large share of the variability observed in the data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

An import demand equation based on panel data was used to test whether export promotion has a positive and significant impact on US dairy exports. The effects of various promotion scenarios on the dairy market were then simulated, and benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) for these programmes were estimated. There were three key findings. First, the combined effort of public and private dairy export promotion expenditures had a positive and statistically significant impact on demand for US dairy products in the world market. The findings indicated that export promotion stimulated total dairy exports by 4.14 billion pounds, on average, per year, which represented 55.8% of total exports. Second, US dairy export promotion has been highly profitable for the nation's dairy farmers. The calculated BCRs, based on assumed elasticity of supply, ranged from a low of 8.54 for the most elastic assumption to a high of 30.12. Third, from an optimality standpoint, dairy farmers are underinvesting in export promotion. The marginal BCRs ranged from a low of 3.79 to a high of 15.22, which means that, at the margin, increasing export promotion expenditures would be profitable for dairy farmers.","[Song, Liang; Kaiser, Harry M.] Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA",Cornell University,"Kaiser, HM (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dyson Sch Appl Econ & Management, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",hmk2@cornell.edu,,,,,,,25,3,4,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The purpose of this study is to determine whether controlling the credit channel of monetary policy could be used as a macroprudential tool to suppress the effects of sudden capital inflows on economic performance for small open economies like Turkey. In this paper, using the Vector Autoregression methodology employed by (Bernanke, S. B., M. Gertler, and M. Watson. 1997. Systematic Monetary Policy and the Effects of Oil Price Shocks. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity 1: 91-157), we investigate whether shutting down the credit channel helps reduce the effects of capital inflows. Indeed, empirical evidence from Turkey shows that doing so decreases the effects of capital inflows on imports and industrial production, but further decreases interest rate and prices and further appreciates the domestic currency. Therefore, it may be prudent to support credit control with additional policy tools to prevent a further decrease in interest rate and prices and a further appreciation of the domestic currency.","[Berument, M.

In a nutshell, the main findings indicate that the effects of the TTIP agreement are going to be small, albeit positive, and not equally distributed. More specifically, the most developed countries tend to be those that, potentially, will undergo a higher increase in their trade with the US, so they are more likely to reap benefits from the TTIP than the less developed countries.

The goal of this study was to test the relationship between micro-expression recognition ability and emotional intelligence (EI), which can be perceived as the ability to function well in social life. The study used micro-expressions training videos (METVs), a new tool for detecting micro-expressions on faces filmed on videos, and the SIE-T test, which is a measure of emotional intelligence (Matczak et al. 2005). Social ability skills were measured through self-declaration. Forty students participated in the study. The results indicated a positive correlation between EI (SIE-T) and the ability to recognize facial expressions (METV). Moreover, METV performance was correlated with certain dimensions of social skills (declaration).","[Wezowski, Kasia] Ctr Body Language, Antwerp, Belgium; [Maison, Dominika] Robert B Zajonc Inst Social Studies, Ctr Psychol Res, Stawki 5-7, PL-00183 Warsaw, Poland",University of Warsaw,"Wezowski, K (通讯作者)，Ctr Body Language, Antwerp, Belgium.",kasia.contact@gmail.com; dominika@psych.uw.edu.pl,,,,,,,49,2,2,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",2198-7246,2198-7254,978-3-319-28419-4; 978-3-319-28417-0,SPR PROC BUS ECON,,,2016,,,,,,,135,149,,10.1007/978-3-319-28419-4_10,0.0,,,15,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BF9OA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000385789700010,0

The first, CAS1, refers to a complex system that is adaptive as a system; the second, CAS2, refers to a complex system of agents which follow adaptive strategies. Examples of CAS1 include the brain, the immune system, and social insect colonies. Examples of CAS2 include multispecies ecosystems and the biosphere. This chapter uses multilevel selection theory to clarify the relationships between CAS1 and CAS2. The general rule is that for a complex system to qualify as CAS1, selection must occur at the level of the complex system (e.g., individual-level selection for brains and the immune system, colony-level selection for social insect colonies). Selection below the level of the system tends to undermine system-level functional organization. This general rule applies to human social systems as well as biological systems and has profound consequences for economics and public policy.","[Wilson, David S.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Biol, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA; [Wilson, David S.] Binghamton Univ, Dept Anthropol, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA",State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Binghamton,"Wilson, DS (通讯作者)，Binghamton Univ, Dept Biol, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.;Wilson, DS (通讯作者)，Binghamton Univ, Dept Anthropol, Binghamton, NY 13902 USA.",,,,,,,,0,28,31,0,4,MIT PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"ONE ROGERS ST, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02142 USA",,,978-0-262-03538-5,STRUNGMANN FORUM REP,,,2016,,,,,,,31,46,,,,,,16,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BP3CU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000546243200003,0

We employ Markov-switching vector autoregressive model to capture the dynamic linkages between them. Empirical examination processes use the nominal and real exchange rates of Chinese Yuan; Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar and South Korean Won. The results of Markov-switching Granger causalities differ remarkably from the conventional linear model and provide more accurate measurement. We find the Markov-switching Granger causalities between exchange rates, and they vary with respect to the sample lag period. The mutual relationships between Asia-Pacific exchange rates are profound and lasting. This is suggested that we should use the nonlinear model to recheck the Granger causalities of exchange rates, and capture the fluctuations of Asia-Pacific exchange rates.","[Wu, Jing-Tung] Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan",Ming Chuan University,"Wu, JT (通讯作者)，Ming Chuan Univ, Dept Finance, Taipei, Taiwan.",jtwu@mail.mcu.edu.tw,,,,,,,21,0,0,0,1,INST ECONOMIC FORECASTING,BUCHAREST,"CASA ACADEMIEI, CALEA 13 SEPTEMBRIE NR 13, SECTOR 5, BUCHAREST, 050711, ROMANIA",1582-6163,2537-6071,,ROM J ECON FORECAST,Rom.

For each hierarchy, I consider a dynamic signaling game in which each player observes only the actions of his direct superiors before choosing his action. At the top of the hierarchy are the leaders, who learn the state from nature. The hierarchy controls the flow of information and the timing of the game, and determines the equilibrium output and welfare. I show that the welfare-optimal hierarchy is the chain, because it maximizes the incentive of players to lead by example for their subordinates. The chain remains optimal even in the presence of verifiable or unverifiable costly information acquisition by the leaders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, attention is restricted to heating system replacements, and to the effect of monetary and non-monetary incentives on the propensity to replace the heating equipment with a more efficient one. To get around adverse selection and free riding issues, we ask stated preference questions to those who weren't planning energy efficiency upgrades any time soon. We argue that these persons are not affected by these behaviors. We use their responses to fit an energy-efficiency renovations curve that predicts the share of the population that will undertake these improvements for any given incentive level. This curve is used to estimate the CO2 emissions saved and their cost-effectiveness. Respondents are more likely to agree to a replacement when the savings on the energy bills are larger and experienced over a longer horizon, and when rebates are offered to them. Reminding the respondents about possible CO2 emissions reductions (our non-monetary incentive) had little effect. Even under optimistic assumptions, monetary incentives similar to those in the Italian tax credit program are generally not cost-effective. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Is it desirable? We think that to deal with these questions, which may well not be the right ones just now, what is needed is a preliminary but thorough critique of the views on the European crisis that are most widespread. The heterodox approaches more and more underline a balance-of-payments problem, caused by cumulative differences in relative prices which have led to distinct growth strategies: export-led in the core, and debt-led in the periphery, focused on consumption and real-estate investment. This interpretation overlooks some defining features of current monetary economies, in general, and some specifics of currency areas. In a monetary union it's not possible to have a 'normal' balance-of-payments crisis, and a distinction must be made between financing and saving. Moreover, current accounts, based on net flows, exclude underlying changes in gross flows and their contribution to the existing stocks of debt. We also have to deal with the structural divergences in the European economy. To make sense of Europe today and its crisis, we have to take into account the geographical and technological composition of intra-European trade.","[Bellofiore, Riccardo] Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy; [Garibaido, Francesco] Claudio Sabattini Fdn, Bologna, Italy; [Mortagua, Mariana] SOAS, London, England",University of Bergamo; University of London; University of London School Oriental & African Studies (SOAS),"Bellofiore, R (通讯作者)，Univ Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.",,,"Mortagua, Mariana/0000-0002-5533-7765",,,,,38,11,11,0,7,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

This paper will study the existence and identify the nature of spillovers resulting from local expenditure policies. These spillovers impact the efficiency of decentralization. We develop a two-jurisdiction model of public expenditure, which differs from existing literature by capturing the extreme poverty of some local governments in developing countries through a generalized notion of Nash equilibrium, namely constrained Nash equilibrium. We show how and under what conditions spillovers among jurisdictions induce strategic behaviors from local officials. By estimating a spatial lag model for a panel data analysis of the 77 communes in Benin from 2002 to 2008, our empirical analysis establishes the existence of the strategic complementarity of public spending in various jurisdictions. Thus, any increase in the local public provision in one jurisdiction should induce a similar variation among the neighboring jurisdictions. This result raises the issue of coordination among local governments, and more broadly, it questions the efficiency of decentralization in developing countries in line with Oates' theorem.","[Caldeira, Emilie; Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire] Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, Dept Econ, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Foucault, Martial] CEVIPOF CNRS, Dept Polit Sci, Sci Paris, F-75007 Paris, France; [Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire] Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); International Monetary Fund,"Rota-Graziosi, G (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, 700 19th St NW, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",Emilie.caldeira@udamail.fr; martial.foucault@sciencespo.fr; grotagraziosi@imf.org,,"Rota-Graziosi, Gregoire/0000-0002-9085-6974",National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); NBER Program on African Successes; French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01]; FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International),National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER); NBER Program on African Successes; French government; FERDI (Fondation pour les Etudes et Recherches sur le Developpement International),"We thank the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), which has funded this project since 2009.

In this research, we study a representative market system, the U.S. crude oil, corn and plastics markets affected by policies promoting corn-based energy and corn-based bioplastics production. A vector error correction model (VECM) is estimated to study price transmission among markets in the United States, especially price volatility spillover effects. We find that plastics prices and corn futures prices move together in the long run, but that the crude oil futures prices are weakly exogenous to this system. We identify significant bidirectional volatility transmission between the corn futures and plastics markets, which brings new challenges to stakeholders in both markets. Moreover, we demonstrate that EISA 2007 has strengthened linkages between the corn futures and crude oil futures markets. In addition, changes in the linkages across the three markets are associated with the fuel ethanol-gasoline consumption ratio. The potential application of these findings for policy makers and risk managers is discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We obtain that the optimal shares of government spending in production and consumption are the same as those in a frictionless labor market under the Hosios condition. However, as higher capital accumulation increases the cost of job creation and maintenance, the optimal tax rate of capital income is positive. In addition, when the labor market is frictional, the marginal benefit of labor is larger than the marginal utility of leisure. Thus, consumption and labor should not be taxed uniformly any more. Our calibration suggests that all of the three tax rates should be positive. Moreover, in the situation in which the Hosios condition does not hold, the shares of public productive spending and public consumption both increase when the worker's bargaining power is greater than the elasticity of search in the matching function.

The primary objective is to find out the changes in relative employment opportunities for women workers as industries respond to increased international competition by pursuing the high road of increasing productivity. I use the seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) method to examine the determinants of skill- and female-intensity of employment. I find evidence for capital deepening having gender biased employment effects for the period 1990-2001.

Research to date has so far considered privacy concerns either as an independent variable to explore consumers' actual (or stated) behavioural intentions (e.g. the decision to purchase goods online) or as dependent variable explained through a number of antecedents (e.g. privacy awareness). However, there has not been a formal link across antecedents, latent constructs and (stated) behavioural intentions. This study establishes this link through a stated choice experiment, and an integrated latent variable and choice model. The proposed approach simultaneously explains individuals' perceptions of privacy and general caution through observed individual characteristics and explores how these perceptions, in the form of latent constructs, may be associated with consumers' decisions to engage with an online transaction. The stated choice experiment is designed to collect consumers' choices across online retailers, a conventional store and an opt-out option in which online retailers are presented with varying levels of personal-information requirements. The data was collected come from over 500 respondents representing the online-user population in the UK. Model estimation results show that the higher an individual's privacy concern, general caution and technical protection, the less likely a consumer is to purchase a product online. In a joint model, the privacy concern variable is found to outweigh the effect of general caution and technical protection. Finally, consumers with higher levels of general caution are more sensitive towards an online retailer that shares their personal data with third parties. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this light, we examine the impact of exporting on firms' energy efficiency by resorting to an instrumental variables strategy based on a differencing approach (Pitt and Rosenzweig, 1990).

The model is based on heterogeneous workers who make educational decisions in the presence of complete markets. When such heterogeneous workers invest in schooling, high type agents earn a surplus from their investment. In the presence of cross-country differences in skill-augmenting technology, trade shifts this surplus to rich countries that can use skills more efficiently. Thus, while the static gains from trade may lead to convergence, the dynamic gains from trade occur to initially rich countries, thus leading to cross-country divergence of income and welfare. The second part of the paper endogenizes world prices, documenting that as trade liberalization concentrates skills in countries with a high level of skill-augmenting technology, it thereby increases the effective global supply of skilled labor. Despite the resulting decline in the price of skill-intensive goods, trade is shown to be skill biased. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This discrepancy is hitherto regarded as a major financial puzzle. We propose an alternative model to explain the equity premium. For normally distributed returns and for returns far away from normality (but still light tailed), realistic equity risk premia do not imply puzzlingly high risk aversions. Following our approach, the equity premium puzzle' does not exist.

Thus, adverse shocks to commodity prices in the world market can force them to reduce savings by a larger amount than they would otherwise have. Empirical analysis using a dynamic GMM model and data from 45 developing countries confirm that most of the determinants of savings identified in the literature also apply to the developing countries. The transitory component in the terms of trade have a larger positive impact than the permanent component. This reflects the lack of access to foreign borrowing. Although the impact of terms of trade shocks is found to be asymmetric, the magnitude of the impact appears to be relatively small. Results show some differences in the response of savings in the three regions considered here. The results are, however, robust for alternative estimators and determinants.

Instead, the political process leads to a means tested system. The necessity to draw political support does affect the design of the system, but it only implies that means testing becomes less severe so that benefits are extended also to the middle classes.

This paper explores qualitatively and quantitatively how this distinction matters for the gains from trade. Most obviously, tariffs generate government revenues, while icebergs do not. In models of monopolistic competition, they may also affect entry. Finally, depending on whether they are modeled as cost or demand shifters, tariffs may have different implications on profits, entry, and, in turn, on the elasticity of trade flows and welfare. We show that the welfare formula by Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) requires qualification, even in the simple single-sector case.

The proposed procedure, called Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC), relies on the iterative solution of optimal control problems on finite time horizons and is well established in engineering applications for stabilization and tracking problems. Only quite recently, extensions to more general optimal control problems including those appearing in economic applications have been investigated. Like Dynamic Programming (DP), NMPC does not rely on linearization techniques but uses the full nonlinear model and in this sense provides a global solution to the problem. However, unlike DP, NMPC only computes one optimal trajectory at a time, thus avoids to grid the state space and for this reason the computational demand grows much more moderately with the space dimension than for DP. In this paper we explain the basic idea of NMPC, give a proof concerning the accuracy of NMPC for discounted optimal control problems, present implementational details, and demonstrate the ability of NMPC to solve dynamic decision problems in economics by solving low and high dimensional examples, including models with multiple equilibria, tracking and stochastic problems.

Opportunities for impact vary across issues NGOs with broader missions expect to execute higher-impact projects but provide less precision to donors as to the sorts of projects that will be funded. This matters if donors have preferences amongst issues. The mission-design problem faced by an impact-motivated NGO is analyzed. Interestingly, expected donations are non-monotonic in mission-width. A monopoly NGO engages in donor-stretching, choosing a mission statement that includes issues not preferred by any of its donors, but still narrower than socially desirable. Under free entry, issue-widths are strategic complements amongst NGOs. In equilibrium there are too many NGOs, each with too narrow a mission. The issue-space is exactly donor-covered (all donors will have an NGO they wish to give to) but issue over-covered (mission statements overlap). Expected NGO impact is higher for issues at the periphery of any particular NGO's issue-domain, which is socially inefficient.

The market participants are restricted to financial institutions domiciled in Japan. We analyze the systemic risk implied in the Japanese interbank network based on various network measures such as directed graphs, centrality measures, degree distributions, and modified susceptible-infected-removable (SIR) models. The main findings are as follows: First, betweenness centrality has the highest discriminative power among three centrality measures in selecting systemically important banks in the Japanese financial system. Second, the topology structure of the Japanese interbank network exhibits characteristics similar to the small-world or scale-free networks, depending on the region of the degree distributions. Third, three mega-bank groups currently designated as globally systemically important banks (G-SIBs) overwhelm others in terms of interconnectedness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We present a controlled experiment that analyzes the impact of professional norms on prospective physicians' trade-offs between their own profits, the patients' benefits, and the payers' expenses for medical care.

Some spectators go to the limits and equalize either all or no inequalities, but many follow an interior allocation rule. These interior allocators regard an agent's choices as more important than the cause of her low income and do not always compensate bad uncontrollable luck. Instead, they condition such compensation on the agent's decision regarding controllable luck exposure, even though the two types of luck are independent. This allocation rule is previously unaccounted for by the fairness views in the literature.

Participants played one-shot games in which either, neither, or only one of the players had a dominant strategy. First, we performed a mixture models cluster analysis to group participants into types according to the pattern of visual information acquisition observed in a single class of games. Then, we predicted agents' choices in different classes of games and observed that patterns of visual information acquisition were game invariant. Our method allowed us to predict whether the decision process would lead to equilibrium choices or not, and to attribute out-of-equilibrium responses to limited cognitive capacities or social motives. Our results suggest the existence of individually heterogeneous-but-stable patterns of visual information acquisition based on subjective levels of strategic sophistication and social preferences.

However, few attempts have been made to explore the impact of separate controls on each type of capital flow on currency instability. To date, no study has examined the impact of regulation and control of direct investment on the probability of currency instability. The hypothesis of this study is that direct investment control decreases currency instability, especially when there is no control over the liquidation of direct investment. Regression analysis of probit panel data from eight ASEAN members over 1998-2011 supported this hypothesis. Another interesting outcome, which confirms the results of previous studies, is that overall capital control insufficiently protects countries against currency attacks. This study underlines the importance of considering various types of capital flows separately during external reform policy in emerging economies.","Univ Wollongong, Fac Business, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia",University of Wollongong,"Mohammadzadeh, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wollongong, Fac Business, Sch Accounting Econ & Finance, Wollongong, NSW 2522, Australia.",abbasm@uow.edu.au,,,,,,,12,0,0,0,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Although their use has increased significantly in the last years, insufficient attention has been paid to the methodological soundness of the underlying environmental extension. This should follow the internationally agreed accounting rules of the System of Environmental-Economic Accounting, which addresses the activities undertaken by the residents of a country, independent from where these take place. Nonetheless, some footprint calculations use extensions that account for all the activities within the territory, which leads to methodological inconsistencies. Thus, this article introduces the most relevant conceptual differences between these accounting frameworks and shows the magnitude of the gap between them building on the data generated for the EXIOBASE model. It concludes that the differences are high for many countries and their magnitude is increasing over time.","[Usubiaga, Arkaitz; Acosta-Fernandez, Jose] Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany",,"Usubiaga, A (通讯作者)，Wuppertal Inst Climate Environm & Energy, Wuppertal, Germany.",arkaitz.usubiaga@wupperinst.org,"Usubiaga, Arkaitz/U-6085-2019","Usubiaga, Arkaitz/0000-0002-2352-5489",European Commission [308552],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),DESIRE was funded by the 7th Framework Program of the European Commission (Grant Agreement no: 308552).

Using a small extension of the standard principal-agent model, we argue that pay caps might serve the opposite purpose, because the agent might be better off with a pay cap. Specifically, we show that, given a fixed effort level to be implemented, the agent's expected utility can be decreasing in an upper bound for the agent's reward. The effect of pay caps on the general structure of optimal incentive contracts is also characterized. While an improvement of contracting information always helps the principal, it might increase or decrease the marginal cost of imposing pay caps.","[Chou, Eric S.] Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan; [Chen, Chien-Lung] Acad Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan",National Tsing Hua University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan,"Chou, ES (通讯作者)，Natl Tsing Hua Univ, Hsinchu 30013, Taiwan.",swchou@mx.nthu.edu.tw; lungclchen@gmail.com,,,Ministry of Science and Technology of R.O.C.

We examine this general public sector problem by collecting unique data on budget institutions and conflicts of interest within the Swedish municipalities. Our estimations suggest that institutions pertaining to both the planning stage and the implementation stage of the budget process are important for fiscal performance. The fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities that have centralized their budget process to some degree, and where local committees are allowed to carry over surpluses or forced to carry over deficits between fiscal years. The associations however differ between municipalities with different degrees of conflicts of interests, calling for further research to understand the incentives given by the result carry-over rules. We further find that the fiscal surplus is higher in municipalities where local managers face a relatively high risk of dismissal as a consequence of budget deficits.","[Dietrichson, Jens; Ellegard, Lina Maria] Lund Univ, Dept Econ, S-22007 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Dietrichson, J (通讯作者)，SFI Danish Ctr Social Res, Herluf Trolles Gade 11, DK-1052 Copenhagen K, Denmark.",jsd@sfi.dk; lina_maria.ellegard@nek.lu.se,,"Dietrichson, Jens/0000-0003-4178-7682",,,,,55,4,7,1,10,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0927-5940,1573-6970,,INT TAX PUBLIC FINAN,Int.

High-talented individuals choose to become self-employed entrepreneurs and acquire more managerial (human) capital; whereas low-talented individuals become workers and face the prospect of equilibrium unemployment. In a two-country global economy, trade openness raises firm productivity, increases top income inequality, and may reduce welfare in the country exporting the good with lower relative labor-market frictions. Trade openness reduces firm productivity, lowers top income inequality, and necessarily raises welfare in the other country. The effect of trade on unemployment is ambiguous. Unilateral job-creating policies increase welfare in both countries. However, they reduce unemployment and raise top income inequality in the policy-active country; and reduce top income inequality while increasing unemployment in the policy-passive country.

We provide several measures of the extent in which the tax and benefit system redistributes from the rich to the poor and from the childless households to the households with children. We find a rather weak combined power of the tax and benefit systems in alleviating income inequalities. The system redistributes primarily towards households with children. While households with children earn 55 per cent of total earnings, they pay 39 per cent of total taxes and receive 68 per cent of total benefits. Even the richest households with children contribute a lower share of total net taxes (8 per cent) than their share in total earnings (10 per cent). About a quarter of households with children in the upper income deciles collect some benefits while only half of the poorest households without children do.","[Dusek, Libor; Kaliskova, Klara; Muenich, Daniel] CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic; [Dusek, Libor; Kaliskova, Klara] Univ Econ, Prague, Czech Republic",Czech Academy of Sciences; Economics Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences; Charles University Prague; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Dusek, L (通讯作者)，CERGE EI, Prague, Czech Republic.",libor.dusek@vse.cz; klara.kaliskova@cerge-ei.cz; daniel.munich@cerge-ei.cz,"Kalíšková, Klára/H-2887-2014; Dušek, Libor/AHD-6685-2022; Dušek, Libor/G-3205-2013; Munich, Daniel/B-8891-2008","Kalíšková, Klára/0000-0002-4762-086X; Dušek, Libor/0000-0001-8054-3002;",Technology Agency of the Czech Republic [TD010033],Technology Agency of the Czech Republic,"The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Technology Agency of the Czech Republic, Grant No. TD010033.",,18,2,2,0,9,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The equivalence conditions help to identify factors that render institutional change non-neutral and to construct politico-economic equilibria in new policy regimes.

A new process based on the use of the ordered weighted averaging distance (OWAD) operator and the induced OWAD (IOWAD) operator in the Hungarian algorithm is introduced. We refer to it as the Hungarian algorithm with the OWAD operator (HAOWAD) and the Hungarian algorithm with the IOWAD operator (HAIOWAD). The main advantage of this approach is that we can provide a parameterized family of aggregation operators between the minimum and the maximum. Thus, the information can be represented in a more complete way. Furthermore, we also present a general framework by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means. Therefore, we can consider a wide range of particular cases including the Euclidean and the Minkowski distance.

These treaties are an important institutional reform that clarifies ownership of land and natural resources near Aboriginal communities. Using confidential micro-data, I find evidence of a positive impact of modern treaties on real income. The effect is driven by employment income and spreads across workers in industries not directly affected by the reform. I also find an increase in real wages and housing costs. The effects are similar in neighboring communities outside Indian reserves. These results are consistent with property right reforms creating a positive demand shock that affects the whole local economy. This is a yet understudied mechanism through which better property rights can generate positive local spillovers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The main motivation for investing in a gateway country is the need to overcome the target country's impediments to exportation and business creation.","[Dominguez, Noemie] IAE Lyon 3, Ctr Rech Magellan, ATER, Lyon, France; [Mercier-Suissa, Catherine] IAE Lyon 3, Ctr Rech Magellan, MCF HDR Sci Econ, Lyon, France",,"Dominguez, N (通讯作者)，IAE Lyon 3, Ctr Rech Magellan, ATER, Lyon, France.",noemie.dominguez@univ-lyon3.fr; catherine.mercier-suissa@univ-lyon3.fr,,,,,,,52,1,2,0,5,PRESSES UNIV FRANCE,PARIS CEDEX 14,"6 AVENUE REILLE, 75685 PARIS CEDEX 14, FRANCE",0338-0599,,,REV ETUD COMP EST-O,Rev.

Our starting point is the Goodwin model (1967), rephrased in discrete time and extended by means of a full coupled dynamics structure. The model adds the combined interaction of a demand effect, which resembles a rudimentary first approximation to an accelerator, and of a hysteresis effect in wage formation in turn affecting investments. Our model yields business cycle movements either by means of persistent oscillations, or chaotic motions. These two different dynamical paths accounting for the behaviour of the system are influenced by its (predominantly) profit-led or demand-led structures.","[Dosi, Giovanni; Virgillito, Maria Enrica] Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy; [Sodini, Mauro] Univ Pisa, Pisa, Italy",Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna; University of Pisa,"Dosi, G (通讯作者)，Scuola Super Sant Anna, Pisa, Italy.",gdosi@sssup.it; m.sodini@unipi.it; m.virgillito@sssup.it,"VIRGILLITO, Maria Enrica/ABB-8288-2020; Sodini, Mauro/R-1776-2016; DOSI, GIOVANNI/B-9587-2014","VIRGILLITO, Maria Enrica/0000-0001-5958-9647; Sodini, Mauro/0000-0002-8237-8941; DOSI, GIOVANNI/0000-0002-0126-9349",Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET) [INO12-00039],Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET),"We are grateful for helpful comments to several participants at the 8th International Conference on Nonlinear Economic Dynamics (NED), Siena, July 2013; the Workshop on Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamics in Economics and Finance, Scuola Normale Superiore, Pisa, December 2013; the 5th International Conference of the International Schumpeter Society (ISS), Jena, July 2014; and to two anonymous referees.

In this paper, we disentangle the effect of observing a peer from that of being observed by a peer, by setting up a real effort experiment in which we manipulate the observability of performance. In particular, we randomize subjects into three groups: in the first one subjects are observed by another subject, but do not observe anybody; in the second one subjects observe somebody else's performance, but are not observed by anybody; in the last group subjects work in isolation, neither observing, nor being observed. To assess the importance of payoff externalities in the emergence of peer effects, we consider both a piece rate compensation scheme, where pay depends solely on own performance, and a team compensation scheme, where pay also depends on the performance of other team members. Overall, we find some evidence that subjects who are observed increase productivity at least initially when compensation is team based, while we find that subjects observing react to what they see when compensation is based only on own performance.

Specifically, using four different models, namely a partial adjustment model, a distributed lag model, an autoregressive distributed lag model, and an error correction model, we estimate gasoline and diesel demand functions with quarterly data covering the period 2003:Q1-2014:Q3. We find a stable long-run relationship only for diesel demand, income and price. Our results imply that gasoline demand does not respond to income and price in the long run, reflecting a shift from gasoline towards diesel induced by differential tax policies. Furthermore, we find that transport fuel demand is price inelastic, making tax on fuel a perfect tool for raising budget revenues. In addition, our results suggest that fuel demand responds to negative and positive price changes symmetrically. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

They can be defined for different sets of public institutions, including the nested sets corresponding to central government, general government, and the public sector, and, for any definition of government, there are many measures of the debt and deficit, including those generated by four kinds of accounts (cash, financial, full accrual, and comprehensive), which can be derived from four nested sets of assets and liabilities. Each debt and deficit measure says something about public finances, but none tells the whole story. Each is also vulnerable to manipulation, and is likely to be manipulated if it is subject to a binding fiscal rule or target. Narrow definitions of government encourage the shifting of spending to entities outside the defined perimeter of government. Narrow definitions of debt and deficit encourage operations involving off-balance-sheets assets and liabilities, while broad measures are susceptible to the mismeasurement of on-balance-sheet assets and liabilities. Reviewing the literature on these issues, the paper concludes that governments should publish several measures of the debt and deficit in a form that clearly reveals their interrelationships.","Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA",International Monetary Fund,"Irwin, TC (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Fiscal Affairs Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",tirwin@imf.org,,"Irwin, Timothy/0000-0002-8978-4889",,,,,124,12,17,1,49,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

We argue that ambiguity, and particularly ambiguity aversion, make it more attractive for the principal to choose a tournament. If agents are risk neutral, but ambiguity averse, we show that the set of optimal incentive schemes contains a tournament. Moreover, if ambiguity is rich enough, all optimal incentive schemes must be such that realized output levels affect only the distribution of wages across agents and not the total wages paid out, as it is true for tournaments. When agents are both risk averse and ambiguity averse, tournaments need not be optimal, but ambiguity and ambiguity aversion still favor, in many cases, the use of tournaments or tournament-like schemes over e.g. incentive schemes that only depend on each agent's own output level.

He points to both structural problems (culture and institutions) and incentives. Despairing of cultural change, Schuck focuses on incentives. He relies on Charles Wolf 's theory of nonmarket failures in which internalities replace the heavily-studied market failure from externalities (Wolf 1979). Internalities are evidence of a discord between the public goals by which a program is defended and the private goals of its administrators. What might economists contribute? We suggest that economists have neglected internalities because they take group goals as exogenously determined and we defend an alternative tradition in which group goals are endogenously determined.","[Levy, David M.] George Mason Univ, Publ Choice Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA; [Peart, Sandra J.] Univ Richmond, Jepson Sch Leadership Studies, Richmond, VA 23173 USA",George Mason University; University of Richmond,"Levy, DM (通讯作者)，George Mason Univ, Publ Choice Ctr, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA.",,"Levy, David/GPS-4945-2022",,,,,,19,0,0,0,14,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0022-0515,2328-8175,,J ECON LIT,J.

This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only be reliably obtained in cases where the transitions have already occurred, precluding its use for studying cases of interest where nascent innovations in protective niches await favourable conditions for their diffusion. In principle, scaling parameters of transitions can, however, be derived from knowledge of industrial dynamics, technology turnover rates and technology characteristics. In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for evaluating the parameterisation of S-shaped diffusion curves for use in simulation models of technology transitions without the involvement of historical data fitting, making use of standard demography theory applied to technology at the unit level. The classic Lotka-Volterra competition system emerges from first principles from demography theory, its timescales explained in terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics. The theory is placed in the context of the multi-level perspective on technology transitions, where innovation and the diffusion of new socio-technical regimes take a prominent place, as well as discrete choice theory, the primary theoretical framework for introducing agent diversity.","Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res 4CMR, Cambridge CB3 1EP, England",University of Cambridge,"Mercure, JF (通讯作者)，Univ Cambridge, Dept Land Econ, Cambridge Ctr Climate Change Mitigat Res 4CMR, 19 Silver St, Cambridge CB3 1EP, England.",jm801@cam.ac.uk,"Cabral Meira Chaves, Thiago/HSE-5162-2023; Mercure, Jean-Francois/G-2386-2017","Mercure, Jean-Francois/0000-0003-2620-9200",UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K007254/1]; EPSRC [EP/K007254/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [EP/K007254/1] Funding Source: researchfish,UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); EPSRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)),"I would like to acknowledge the students who have been attending the Energy Systems Modelling seminars held at 4CMR in 2013, in particular A.

We establish weak and strong duality theorems and provide a dynamic programming characterization of the dual problem. The dual problem gives a linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with a known state space subject to free-boundary conditions, making analysis much more tractable than the primal problem. We provide two explicitly solved examples of a consumption insurance problem. We characterize the optimal consumption allocation in terms of the marginal utility ratio. We find that neither autarky nor full risk sharing can be an optimal contract with two-sided limited commitment, unlike in discrete-time models. We also derive an explicit solution for the unique long-run stationary distribution of consumption relative to income. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The use of waiting time can be interpreted as a special type of real effort condition, in which it is particularly straightforward to achieve experimental control over incentives. The three experiments, commonly employed to study social preferences, are the dictator game, the ultimatum game and the trust game. All subjects in a session earn the same participation fee, but their choices affect the time at which they are permitted to leave the laboratory. Decisions that are associated with greater own payoff translate into the right to depart earlier. The modal proposal in both the dictator and ultimatum games is an equal split of the waiting time. In the trust game, there is substantial trust and reciprocity. Overall, social preferences are evident in time allocation decisions. We compare subjects' decisions over time and money and find no significant differences in average decisions. The pattern of results suggests that results obtained in the laboratory with money as the medium of reward generalize to other reward media.","[Noussair, Charles N.] Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Noussair, Charles N.] Tilburg Univ, CentER, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Stoop, Jan] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, Rotterdam, Netherlands",Tilburg University; Tilburg University; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Noussair, CN (通讯作者)，Tilburg Univ, Dept Econ, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands.",c.n.noussair@uvt.nl; stoop@ese.eur.nl,,,ERIM,ERIM,"We would like to thank ERIM for providing funds to conduct this experiment.

We show that the income of the top income groups is more sensitive to growth, defined broadly as current growth and changes in expectations of future growth, compared to the income of the lower income groups. We provide evidence that this increased sensitivity arises for two reasons: (a) the top income groups receive a large portion of their income from wealth, which is more sensitive to growth than labor income and (b) the top income groups receive a large portion of their labor income in the form of pay-for-performance (equity compensation), which is also sensitive to growth. Consequently, we conclude that growth and income inequality are positively associated.

Also, endogenous Ramsey fiscal policy eliminates the possibility of an environmental and economic poverty trap.

To this end, I propose a simple post-Keynesian model, so as to test whether the Turkish economy is wage or profit-led. I find evidence that, while a rising wage has a positive effect on investment, it does not affect consumption in Turkey. Hence the combined effect of a rising wage share on domestic demand (investment plus consumption) is positive.

In this paper, we advance instead a fuzzy procedure based on the non-parametric bootstrap method, allowing us to depict fuzzy unidimensional privation states with boundaries drawn spontaneously from data. Fuzzy non-parametric measures of privation within each state as well as a collective fuzzy non-parametric index of poverty are derived, along with their corresponding confidence intervals.

It is shown that, when the spillover effect is rather strong, the public firm innovates in order to acquire a larger market share, while the private firm prefers that its rival invests in the new technology and reaps the benefits of technological leakages if investment costs are moderate. Thus, when information spillovers are taken into account, the public firm sometimes behaves more innovatively than the private firm, which is contrary to the well-known results. Furthermore, in a mixed duopoly where only the public firm invests, its average cost exceeds that of its competitor, but investment remains an efficient strategy compared with non-investment.","[Zhang, Yanfang] Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhong, Weijun] Southeast Univ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nanjing University of Finance & Economics; Southeast University - China,"Zhang, YF (通讯作者)，Nanjing Univ Finance & Econ, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",,"Shi, Yaolin/JXN-8322-2024",,National Pillar Program of China [2012BAH29F01],National Pillar Program of China,The authors would like to thank the co-editor Shingo Ishiguro and anonymous referees for valuable comments and constructive suggestions that helped improve the quality and the presentation of this paper.

Foreign tourists demand for the non-traded goods provided in the informal sector of the host economy, resulting in a tourism-induced terms-of-trade effect. The presence of inbound tourism lends a support to positive tariffs even for a small open economy. The indirect tax reform of this kind can increase residents' welfare and government revenue when the initial tariffs are relatively larger to the consumption taxes.","[Beladi, Hamid] Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA; [Chao, Chi-Chur] Deakin Univ, Dept Econ, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] Univ Paris 01, Dept Econ, F-75231 Paris 05, France; [Laffargue, Jean-Pierre] CEPREMAP, Paris, France",University of Texas System; University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA); Deakin University; heSam Universite; Universite Pantheon-Sorbonne,"Beladi, H (通讯作者)，Univ Texas San Antonio, Dept Econ, San Antonio, TX 78249 USA.",hamid.beladi@utsa.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

Several recent studies have failed to find the standard patterns of present bias. However, such monetary studies contain often-discussed confounds. In this article, we sidestep these confounds and investigate choices over consumption (real effort) in a longitudinal experiment. We pair this effort study with a companion monetary discounting study. We confirm very limited time inconsistency in monetary choices. However, subjects show considerably more present bias in effort. Furthermore, present bias in the allocation of work has predictive power for demand of a meaningfully binding commitment device.

On the one hand, municipalities are closely monitored and supervised by upper-level governments. Local borrowing is confined to pre-defined cases with respect to extra-ordinary expenditure. Both dimensions come close to constitute an at least soft debt limit (budget constraint) for municipalities. On the other hand, municipal discretion over expenditure and revenue is limited. In the current paper, we test whether municipalities' budgetary policies were sustainable by means of an adapted version of Bohn's (Q J Econ 113:949-963, 1998) sustainability test. We find that municipal debt limits were quite effective and resulted in stationary debt levels, and in significant and sufficient reactions of the municipal primary surplus to increasing public debt. However, in order to achieve such sustainable policies, municipalities have widely cut investments in local infrastructure. From a long-term perspective, such development is problematic with respect to the quality of available infrastructure.","[Broethaler, Johann; Getzner, Michael] Vienna Univ Technol, Ctr Publ Finance & Infrastruct Policy, A-1040 Vienna, Austria; [Haber, Gottfried] Danube Univ Krems, Econ & Fiscal Policy Res Unit, A-3500 Krems, Austria",Technische Universitat Wien; Danube University Krems,"Getzner, M (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Technol, Ctr Publ Finance & Infrastruct Policy, Resselgasse 5, A-1040 Vienna, Austria.",Johann.Broethaler@tuwien.ac.at; Michael.Getzner@tuwien.ac.at; Gottfried.Haber@donau-uni.ac.at,"Getzner, Michael/S-6765-2019","Getzner, Michael/0000-0003-1088-2652",,,,,41,16,16,1,28,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,AUG,2015,42,3,,,,,521,546,,10.1007/s10663-014-9261-3,0.0,,,26,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN2OO,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358261800003,0

In equilibrium, a large majority of legislators vote for the first-period proposal because they thereby maintain the chance of belonging to the minimum winning coalition in the future. Legislators may therefore approve policies by large majorities, or even unanimously, that benefit few, or even none, of them. The results are robust. But institutional arrangements (such as entitlements) can reduce the agenda setter's power by reducing his discretion to reward and punish legislators, and rules (such as sequential voting) can increase a legislator's ability to resist exploitation.

While political considerations shape China's allocation of aid, China does not pay substantially more attention to politics compared to Western donors.

Is there solid evidence that the behavior of the current account is different during deficits and surpluses or that the size of the imbalance matters? Is there a threshold relationship between the US current account and its main drivers? We estimate a threshold model to answer these questions using the instrumental variable estimation proposed by Caner and Hansen (2004). Rather than concluding that the size or the sign of (previous) external imbalances matters, we find that time is the most important threshold variable. One regime exists before and another one exists after the third quarter of 1997, a period that coincides with the onset of the Asian financial crisis and the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Statistically significant determinants in the second regime are the fiscal surplus, productivity, productivity volatility, oil prices, the real exchange rate, and the real interest rate.

We develop a model to show that the intermediary would want to restrict sellers from charging buyers more for transactions it intermediates. With this restriction an intermediary can profitably raise demand for its services by eliminating any extra price buyers face for purchasing through the intermediary. We show that this leads to inflated retail prices, excessive adoption of the intermediaries' services, over-investment in benefits to buyers, and a reduction in consumer surplus and sometimes welfare. Competition among intermediaries intensifies these problems by increasing the magnitude of their effects and broadening the circumstances in which they arise.

For this purpose, we consider competitive markets for multiple commodities with endogenous formation of one-or two-person households. Within each two-person household, individuals obtain utility from his/her own private consumption, from discrete actions such as job choice, from the partner's observable characteristics such as appearance and hobbies, from some of the partner's consumption vectors, and from the partner's action choices. We investigate competitive market outcomes with an endogenous household structure in which no individual and no man/woman pair can deviate profitably.

Our finding reveals that exogenous restriction of displayed depth, up to several best quotes, does not benefit market performance. On the contrary, endogenous restriction of displayed quote depth, by means of iceberg orders, improves market quality in multiple dimensions: it reduces average transaction costs, maintains higher liquidity and moderate volatility, balances the limit order book, and enhances price discovery.

Does the end of an empire invert this effect, and if so, through which channels? This paper uses an original dataset to explore the impact of independence on former colonies' bilateral trade over the 1948-2007 period. We show large differences across empires. Whereas independence reduces the trade (imports and exports) between former French colonies and their coloniser, as well as with other colonies of the same empire, we do not find any comparable effect for former British colonies. We attribute this finding to the particularly protectionist trade policy implemented by France during the colonial era, and we are able to rule out alternative explanations related to transaction costs. We also find that after independence, all former colonies trade more with third countries, and we relate this result to the geographical diversification of trade.

The approaches bear some similarities, but differ in that the CA attaches more importance to autonomy and highlights the indirect effects of social influence. In contrast to TPB, the CA suggests indirect norm effects (on behavior) by shaping attitudes and the perception of freedom of choice. Furthermore, the CA hints at the motivational power of personal autonomy for behavioral choices. We develop a combined model to test our assumptions for two sustainable consumption behaviors (i.e., purchase of organic food and mobility behavior). Testing the combined model based on cross-sectional data of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP-IS) confirms the significance of the CA for sustainable consumption. The policy implications of the findings are enhancing people's opportunities for sustainable consumption in order to strengthen sustainable behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This is an interesting topic because public engagement and social capital play a crucial role in shaping the economy and democracy. We exploit a recent survey on the 1936-1939 Spanish Civil War to shed light on this question. Our findings indicate that being a member of a family that suffered violence during the Civil War is related to a higher interest, knowledge and engagement in politics. These results stand in stark contrast to the common expectation that political violence leads to lower public engagement, while they are consistent with other studies focusing on the short-term consequences of civil conflicts. Therefore, the legacy of political violence, far from creating political apathy, may be the higher involvement of citizens in politics.","Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Seville 41013, Spain",Universidad Pablo de Olavide,"Oto-Peralías, D (通讯作者)，Univ Pablo de Olavide, Dept Econ Metodos Cuantitat & Hist Econ, Carretera Utrera,Km 1, Seville 41013, Spain.",dotoper@upo.es,,"Oto-Peralias, Daniel/0000-0001-8773-6835",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2012-35430]; Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science [SEJ-4546],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Andalusian Council of Innovation and Science,"Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Departamento de Economia, Metodos Cuantitativos e Historia Economica, Carretera de Utrera, Km. 1, Seville, 41013, Spain.

Our results show a significant difference in the performance between state-owned banks and joint-stock banks over the period analyzed. Moreover, the equity-to-asset ratio also significantly explains variations in inefficiency across Chinese commercial banks.

Using a dataset of publically listed PSEs in China, we empirically investigate the effects of partial state ownership of PSEs upon firm performance. We demonstrate channels through which the benefits of partial state ownership are realised in terms of easier access to resources such as credit and industries to which entry is restricted by formal barriers, which ultimately increases the performance of firms. We also find some evidence that political participation of private sector entrepreneurs, another dimension of political connection, becomes less valuable when partial state ownership of PSEs is present.","[Song, Zengji] Chongqing Univ, Chongqing 630044, Peoples R China; [Nahm, Abraham] Univ Wisconsin, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA; [Zhang, Zongyi] South Western Univ Finance & Econ, Chengdu, Peoples R China",Chongqing University; University of Wisconsin System; Southwestern University of Finance & Economics - China,"Nahm, A (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Eau Claire, WI 54701 USA.",nahmay@uwec.edu,,,National Social Sciences Foundation of China [14BGL047],National Social Sciences Foundation of China,We acknowledge financial support from The National Social Sciences Foundation of China (Grant: 14BGL047).,,34,9,9,4,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1463-1377,1465-3958,,POST-COMMUNIST ECON,Post-Communist Econ.,JUL 3,2015,27,3,,,,,336,353,,10.1080/14631377.2015.1055967,0.0,,,18,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CP1BA,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000359609600003,0

However, taxes not only affect incentives; they also provide implicit insurance, and this may critically affect the efficiency-equity relationship. For a standard labour supply problem it is shown that the insurance effect mutes the sensitivity of labour supply to taxes, which tends to reduce tax distortions and lower the marginal costs of public funds. The relation between incentives and insurance and thus efficiency and equity is flattened by the insurance effect and it may even be non-monotone. However, the optimal utilitarian policy implies that there is always a trade-off between efficiency and equity on the margin.","[Andersen, Torben M.] Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Andersen, Torben M.] CESifo, CEPR, Munich, Germany; [Andersen, Torben M.] IZA, Bonn, Germany",Aarhus University; Ifo Institut; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Andersen, TM (通讯作者)，Aarhus Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark.",tandersen@econ.au.dk,,,,,,,25,1,1,0,7,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-3378,1467-8586,,B ECON RES,Bull Econ.

In addition to, and independent from, the standard transmission mechanism associated with nominal rigidities, financial imperfections introduce a wealth redistribution role for monetary policy. Moreover, the two mechanisms reinforce each other and amplify the effects of monetary policy. On the normative side, financial imperfections, via interactions with nominal rigidities, generate two novel policy trade-offs. First, the central bank needs to pay attention to distributional efficiency in addition to macroeconomic (and price level) stability, which implies that a strict inflation targeting policy of setting union-wide inflation to zero is never optimal. Second, the interactions lead to a trade-off in stabilizing relative consumption versus the relative price gap (the deviation of relative prices from their efficient level) across countries, which implies that the central bank allows for less flexibility in relative prices. Finally, we consider how the central bank should respond to a financial shock that causes an increase in the interest rate spread. Under optimal policy, the central bank strongly decreases the deposit rate, which reduces aggregate and distributional inefficiencies by mitigating the drop in output and inflation and the rise in relative consumption and prices. Such a policy response can be well approximated by a spread-adjusted Taylor rule as it helps the real interest rate track the efficient rate of interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Throughout the history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, qualitative evidence of various sources of distortion abounds. No study, however, has quantified the inefficiency in the slave trade due to these distortions. We use a structural approach to identify the dispersion of distortions in the slave trade from wedges in first order conditions. We then calculate the TFP gains had the dispersion of distortions disappeared. Two main results emerge. First, dispersion of distortions had the smallest damage to TFP in Great Britain, followed by Portugal, and then France. Second, dispersion of distortions in the product market had a bigger impact on TFP than that of the capital and labor markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We contribute to this debate by investigating the driving forces behind the magnitudes of the estimated welfare gains using the structurally estimated general equilibrium trade model by Egger and Larch (2011) for 173 countries. In our baseline scenario, the TTIP amounts to a reduction of ad valorem trade costs across the Atlantic between 16 and 26 percentage points. We find that the TTIP could yield substantial gains for the EU (3.9%), the United States (4.9%), and the world (+1.6%). While welfare gains are heterogeneous within the EU, the TTIP does not systematically favour richer or more central member states. The majority of third countries would be negatively affected (0.9% on average). We identify as key drivers for the magnitudes of the welfare effects different assumptions about trade cost specifications, about the assumed trade cost reducing potential of the TTIP, about different levels of aggregation, and about the regulatory spill-overs of the TTIP on third countries. Our insights on the drivers for the welfare effects help to understand differences across current evaluations of the TTIP.","[Felbermayr, Gabriel] Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Munich, CESifo, D-81377 Munich, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, CESifo, GEP, Bayreuth, Germany; Univ Bayreuth, Ifo Inst, Bayreuth, Germany; Ifo Inst, Munich, Germany",University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Bayreuth; University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut; Ifo Institut; University of Bayreuth; Ifo Institut,"Felbermayr, G (通讯作者)，Univ Munich, Ifo Inst, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany.",,"Heid, Benedikt Sebastian/GON-5030-2022; Heid, Benedikt/AAK-5247-2020","Heid, Benedikt Sebastian/0000-0002-2313-8614; Yalcin, Erdal/0000-0001-9459-1718; Felbermayr, Gabriel/0000-0003-4984-9745",,,,,56,34,36,0,61,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-4658,1468-0327,,ECON POLICY,Econ.

Through comparison of market share changes at both macro and micro levels, we find that on the one hand China's total negative impact on Mexican manufactured exports has been greatly reduced since 2007; on the other hand, China is increasingly aligned with Mexico in terms of its competitive position over the US market, consolidating its competitiveness in high and medium-to-high technology products and gaining market share in the US market, mainly at the expense of the most advanced economies. This changing pattern suggests the intensification of competition between Mexico and China, but also a potential for cooperation, with the enhancement of bilateral intra-industry trade as a result of different technology choices and specialization paths.","Autonomous Univ Madrid, Ctr East Asian Studies, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Autonomous University of Madrid,"Lin, Y (通讯作者)，Autonomous Univ Madrid, Ctr East Asian Studies, E-28049 Madrid, Spain.",yue.lin@uam.es,"Lin, Yue/I-4318-2014","Lin, Yue/0000-0001-8118-4267",Spanish National Research Project [FFI2011-25897],Spanish National Research Project(Spanish Government),Financial support from Spanish National Research Project No. FFI2011-25897 is gratefully acknowledged.,,34,4,4,1,26,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1671-2234,1749-124X,,CHINA WORLD ECON,China World Econ.,JUL-AUG,2015,23,4,,,,,104,124,,10.1111/cwe.12123,0.0,,,21,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CN3MG,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000358330100006,0

The paper first applies evolutionary game theory combined with scenario analysis for the quantitative prediction of long term trends in rural labor transfer in China. First, it discusses the evolutionary mechanism of the general replicator dynamic model in rural labor transfer. In particular, we use evolutionary games to build a causality prediction model forecasting the long term trends in rural labor transfer, where the residuals of the forecasting model, after removing the economic payoff differences, are considered as the social factors, i.e., the employment barriers in the urban sectors, affecting the transfer decision-making. Based on the historical time series data of income and population distribution of rural employment in various sectors, the paper builds a time series forecasting model of employment barriers of different urban sectors. Given the future uncertainties in economic factors, i.e., the urban-rural income gaps which affect the rural labor transfer, we introduce scenario analysis into the evolutionary game forecasting model. We consider three scenarios of the urban-rural income differences: (1) the average situation - no change in the current urban-rural income differences, (2) the pessimistic situation - the income differences fall into the middle-income trap, and (3) the optimistic situation - the income gap approaches the level in developed countries, to forecast the long term trends in the rural labor transfer in China.","[Liu, Dehai; Wang, Weiguo; Zhou, Chuang] Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Li, Hongyi] Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Dongbei University of Finance & Economics; Chinese University of Hong Kong,"Liu, DH (通讯作者)，Dongbei Univ Finance & Econ, Dalian, Peoples R China.",ldhai2001@163.com,"Dong, Yucheng/J-1668-2017","Li, Hongyi/0000-0002-4518-5315","Natural Science Foundation of China [70901016, 71171035, 71271045]; Program for Discipline Construction in DUFE [XKT-201411]",Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Program for Discipline Construction in DUFE,"The authors thank three reviewers, the associate editor, the department editor and the English editor for their insightful comments that greatly improved this paper.

Taking into account the sensitivity of each industry to the speed of the tariff reductions under NAFTA, the results show that PCMs immediately decreased once the second round of trade liberalization in Mexico had commenced in 1994. However, in subsequent years, no clear pattern emerges for these Pcms. Additionally, the paper accounts for the sensitivity of each industry to the initial level of its tariff and presents evidence showing that while NAFTA had an effect on the Pcms of the group of industries that liberalized in 10 years, no robust effect was found for the group of industries that liberalized in five years.","Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Bank of Mexico,"Noria, GL (通讯作者)，Banco Mexico, Direcc Gen Invest Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",glopezn@banxico.org.mx,,,,,,,41,0,0,0,5,FONDO CULTURA ECONOMICA,TLALPAN,"AVE PICACHO AJUSCO, NO 227, TLALPAN CP 14200, MEXICO",0041-3011,,,TRIMEST ECON,Trimest.

In contrast, selfishness refers to prioritizing one's own interests with no consideration for others. However, even if an agent is selfish, he might nevertheless act as if he were altruistic out of selfish concerns triggered when his action is observed; that is, he might seek to feel pride in acting altruistically and to avoid the shame of acting selfishly. We call such behavior impurely altruistic. Alternatively, even if an agent is altruistic, he might nevertheless give in to the temptation to act selfishly. We call such behavior impurely selfish. This paper axiomatizes a model that distinguishes altruism from impure altruism and selfishness from impure selfishness. In the model, unique real numbers separately capture altruism and the other forces of pride, shame, and the temptation to act selfishly. We show that the model can describe recent experiments on dictator games with an exit option. In addition, we describe an empirical puzzle that government spending only partially crowds out consumers' donations, contrary to the prediction based on standard consumer theory.

The advents of globalization and factor mobility have given a recipe to reap up gains from labor abundance for most of the labor abundant countries by strategically converting abundant labor into capital. However, remittance inflow may become counterproductive strategy for growth, if it is viewed within the work-leisure framework. Using heterogeneous non-stationary panel data with cross-sectional bias this empirical study explores the best-fitted estimator to explain remittance and labor productivity dynamics for 61 top remittance recipient countries of the world. Our results suggest that though remittance has a positive impact on domestic labor productivity for countries with higher size of remittance inflow and abundant labor force; however, there is new evidence that such impact diminishes after certain level. Moreover, such result does not hold for countries with higher remittance-share of GDP. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our identification strategy exploits a natural experiment in a leading UK university where different departments have historically different rules on the provision of feedback to their students. We find that the provision of feedback has a positive effect on students' subsequent test scores: the mean impact corresponds to 13% of a standard deviation in test scores. The impact of feedback is stronger for more able students and for students who have less information to start with about the academic environment, while no subset of individuals is found to be discouraged by feedback Our findings suggest that students have imperfect information on how their effort translates into test scores and that the provision of feedback might be a cost-effective means to increase students' exam performance.

The Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS III) consisting of 13477 non-Malay respondents is used. The present study applies two logit models to analyse the factors affecting the likelihood of heavy and light alcohol drinking. The results show that the likelihood of heavy alcohol drinking is positively associated with younger individuals, lower income earners, males, the less-educated, non-singles, rural dwellers and the employed, whereas, the likelihood of light alcohol drinking is positively associated with higher income earners, the well-educated, urban dwellers and the unemployed. Based on these findings, several policy implications are discussed.","Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok 06010, Kedah Darul Ama, Malaysia",Universiti Utara Malaysia,"Cheah, YK (通讯作者)，Univ Utara Malaysia, Coll Business, Sch Econ Finance & Banking, Sintok 06010, Kedah Darul Ama, Malaysia.",cheahykang@gmail.com,"Cheah, Yong Kang/M-2677-2014","Cheah, Yong Kang/0000-0002-6793-7055",Geran Penyelidikan Kolej Universiti Utara Malaysia [KOD S/O 12995],Geran Penyelidikan Kolej Universiti Utara Malaysia,The author is grateful to an anonymous reviewer for his/her insightful comments and suggestions to this manuscript.

We find evidence that early marijuana use is related to educational penalties that are compounded by high-intensity use and are larger for young people living in families with a history of income support receipt. The relationships between marijuana use and both high school completion and achieving a university entrance score appear to stem from selectivity into the use of marijuana. In contrast, early marijuana use is associated with significantly lower university entrance scores for those who obtain one, and we provide evidence that this effect is unlikely to be driven by selection. Collectively, these findings point to a more nuanced view of the relationship between adolescent marijuana use and educational outcomes than is suggested by the existing literature.","[Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Inst Appl Econ & Social Res, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.; Kassenboehmer, Sonja C.] Inst Study Lab IZA, Bonn, Germany; [Cobb-Clark, Deborah A.] ARC Ctr Excellence Children & Families Life Cours, Brisbane, Qld, Australia; [Kassenboehmer, Sonja C.] Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Trinh Le] Motu Econ & Publ Policy Res, Wellington, New Zealand; [Mcvicar, Duncan] Queens Univ Belfast, Sch Management, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Zhang, Rong] Monash Univ, Fac Business & Econ, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",University of Melbourne; IZA Institute Labor Economics; Monash University; Queens University Belfast; Monash University,"Kassenboehmer, SC (通讯作者)，Monash Univ, Ctr Hlth Econ, Bldg 75, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia.",sonja.kassenboehmer@monash.edu,"de New (nee Kassenboehmer), Sonja/B-4385-2019; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/H-1153-2013","de New (nee Kassenboehmer), Sonja/0000-0003-4348-2049; Le, Trinh Van Thi/0000-0002-7541-158X; Cobb-Clark, Deborah/0000-0003-2895-7886","DEEWR; Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; Australian Research Council [LP0347164]; Australian Research Council [LP0347164] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","DEEWR(Australian GovernmentDepartment of Industry, Innovation and Science); Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs(Australian Government); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","This paper is based on research commissioned by the Australian Government Department of Employment under the Social Policy Research Services Agreement (2010-2012) with the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research.

The technique allows the creation of a synthetic panel - done by predicting future or past household income or consumption using a set of simple modeling and error structure assumptions - and thus permits the estimation of lower and upper bounds of the joint distribution of poverty and non-poverty transitions. We validate the approach in three different settings where good panel data exist (Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru). In doing so, we also carry out a number of refinements to the validation procedure and expand the set of tests undertaken. The results are broadly encouraging in estimating the joint probabilities of poverty and non-poverty transitions between two periods in all three contexts. The approach is also robust to a broad set of additional stress and sensitivity tests, especially in cases where richer model specifications can be estimated. Finally, we test whether the scope of synthetic panels can be expanded in three new directions, namely comparing between income and consumption welfare measures; the robustness to longer intervals (the approach does especially well in predicting long-term poverty transition patterns); and the robustness to two transition lines instead of one. Overall, the results lend support to the application of this approach to settings where panel data are absent.","[Cruces, Guillermo; Viollaz, Mariana] Univ Nacl La Plata, Fac Ciencias Econ, Dept Econ, CEDLAS, RA-1900 La Plata, Argentina; [Lanjouw, Peter; Lucchetti, Leonardo; Perova, Elizaveta; Vakis, Renos] World Bank, Washington, DC 20433 USA",National University of La Plata; The World Bank,"Vakis, R (通讯作者)，World Bank, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",gcruces@cedlas.org; planjouw@worldbank.org; llucchetti@worldbank.org; eperova@worldbank.org; rvakis@worldbank.org; mviollaz@cedlas.org,,"Lanjouw, Peter/0000-0002-4150-7890; Cruces, Guillermo/0000-0002-1965-5897",,,,,3,21,23,1,13,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",1569-1721,1573-8701,,J ECON INEQUAL,J.

However, despite the importance of this issue, surprisingly little is known about how different asset pricing models behave in emerging capital markets. The purpose of this paper is to determine the suitability of conditional compared to unconditional versions namely, the capital asset pricing model and the Fama-French three-factor model for the Indian stock market. The key distinction between the present empirical tests and previous tests is the application of the Kalman filter method for dynamic beta estimation in the Indian market. The findings indicate that the cross-sectional variation in expected returns is driven by mainly two firm characteristics size and book-to-market ratio.Unlike the unconditional model, the market beta is able to capture the variation of expected return in conditional model. The results imply that information has a role and investors use the prior belief and macroeconomic variables as predictive variables to determine the cost of capital. These results are supported by some recent findings that Fama-French three-factor model is the only multifactor model that consistently sources three different types of risk included in the list of anomalies.

We model such infrastructure projects taking into account their credence goods feature and the costly design effort they require and examine the performance of commonly used contracting methods. We show that when building costs are homogeneous and public information, simultaneous bidding involving shortlisting of two contractors and contingent compensation of both contractors on design efforts outperforms sequential search.

Using a two-stage game with Research and Development (R&D) and output, we investigate the effects of imperfectly appropriable R&D on optimal R&D strategies of a domestic public firm and a foreign private firm across different market interactions: (i) international R&D competition, (ii) only the foreign firm conducts R&D, (iii) only the domestic public firm conducts R&D, (iv) no firm conducts R&D, and (v) research joint venture. The results show that firms' research performances are determined by the degree of spillovers and the optimal R&D strategies involve R&D competition. Spillovers are shown to be socially beneficial and their absence can prove to be a strategic deterrent, with the public firm monopolising the market. Some of these findings contrast with the traditional models of oligopoly (with or without R&D) and mixed oligopoly (without R&D).","[Haruna, Shoji] Okayama Univ, Okayama 7008530, Japan; [Goel, Rajeev K.] Illinois State Univ, Normal, IL 61761 USA",Okayama University; Illinois State University,"Goel, RK (通讯作者)，Illinois State Univ, Dept Econ, Normal, IL 61790 USA.",rkgoel@ilstu.edu,"Goel, Rajeev K/HPD-3780-2023","Goel, Rajeev/0000-0001-9580-3196",Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [23330081]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23330081] Funding Source: KAKEN,"Japan Society for the Promotion of Science(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","S.

Our paper fills this gap by addressing the nexus of production fragmentation and product technology based on a panel dynamic ordinary least square (DOLS) estimator. We documented three findings. First, income elasticity is positive and significant in all export categories and increases with higher technology products. Second, consistent with the literature, we find that the RMB real exchange rate has a significant positive impact on ASEAN total exports to China and that the exports of high-tech and medium-tech finished goods, as well as the parts and components exports, contribute to this effect. Third, the RMB effect on disaggregated exports by technology level is mixed: For finished goods exports, higher technology exports are more sensitive to RMB depreciation, which is consistent with the income effect, while for parts and components exports, the lower technology exports actually have greater exposure to RMB depreciation, which is possibly due to the price effect and the recent production relocations of MNCs in the ASEAN region to China and Vietnam.

A DYNAMIC FACTOR ANALYSIS,MACROECONOMIC DYNAMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Financial Dollarization; Institutions; European Union,MEMBERSHIP,"This paper investigates the impact of institutions on the dollarization of the domestic banking system using a unique policy experiment: the process of accession of countries to the European Union (EU). Using a dynamic factor model, we decompose fluctuations in financial dollarization for 24 transition economies into a common factor, an EU factor, a non-EU factor, and country-specific factors. The EU factor, which proxies for improvements in institutions under the set criteria for eventual membership, reveals the importance of institutions for the extent of financial dollarization over time. The results also indicate the asymmetric impact of improved institutions on the domestic bank's balance sheets by inducing higher loan dollarization and lower deposit dollarization. The relative importance of the EU factor to the financial dollarization of a country is associated to the degree of comovement of its business cycle with that of the EU.","[Kishor, Narayan K.] Univ Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA; [Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Univ Manchester, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Neanidis, Kyriakos C.] Ctr Growth & Business Cycle Res, Quebec City, PQ, Canada",University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Milwaukee; University of Manchester,"Kishor, NK (通讯作者)，Univ Wisconsin, Dept Econ, Milwaukee, WI 53201 USA.",kishor@uwm.edu,,"Kishor, N.

Assessing the effects of debt services on welfare recipients,LABOUR ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Debt services; Program evaluation; Threat effects,LABOR-MARKET PROGRAMS; BENEFIT SANCTIONS; TRANSITION RATE; JOB SEARCH; UNEMPLOYMENT; DURATION,"This paper investigates the effects of an intervention that was targeted at a specific group of Dutch Social Assistance (SA) recipients with debt problems. Since a large share of the income gains of work resumption is earmarked for creditors, these individuals generally experienced a strong a priori disincentive to resume formal work. The intervention had three aims: restructuring personal debts, preventing the occurrence of new debt problems, and increasing the direct incentives to resume work. The paper uses the Timing-of-Events method to identify the effects of debt programs on SA spells. Our main finding is that the debt program substantially increased the exit out of the SA schemes, but this was mainly due to exits out of the labor force. With a large share of assigned individuals who did not participate in the scheme, it appears that individuals perceived or experienced the program as unpleasant and opted to exit without work Our results suggest the presence of threat effects, particularly for individuals who were assigned by their caseworkers but did not participate in the debt program.

The pre-crisis period is characterized by increasing realized and, especially, option-implied returns. This translates into transient unsustainable price growth that may be identified as a bubble. Granger tests detect causality running from option-implied returns to Treasury Bill yields in the pre-crisis regime with a lag of a few days, and the other way round during the post-crisis regime with much longer lags (50-200 days). This suggests a transition from an abnormal regime preceding the crisis to a new normal post-crisis. The difference between realized and option-implied returns remains roughly constant prior to the crisis but diverges in the post-crisis phase, which may be interpreted as an increase of the representative investor's risk aversion.

To this end, I build a housing model by incorporating houses into a standard deleveraging model and allow debt limits to be endogenous. I find that, under an adverse credit shock, only with high leverage can the housing model generate more macroeconomic fluctuations with the nominal interest rate being more likely to hit the ZLB, compared to the standard deleveraging model without housing. In addition, the relative amplification is more pronounced under a shock that causes the ZLB to bind in both the models. Importantly, the ZLB plays a key role in generating a significant decline in the housing price under a particularly adverse credit shock. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Gil-Bazo and Ruiz-Verdu (2009) drew attention to the puzzling fact that funds with worse before-fee performance charge higher fees. We make another contribution to the literature about the market for equity mutual funds: we find strong evidence of predictability for mutual fund fees. Funds with both positive and negative relations with fees show strong evidence of negative return predictability for their fees. Our findings are robust to alternative estimation methods and under the assumption of conditionally heteroskedastic stock returns. Our results also show that conditioning information (e.g. dividend yield, t-bill yield, default spread and term spread) are useful in selecting funds with superior performance and are valuable for asset allocation decisions.

Lower marginal costs have reduced prices by 10-15% in the past four years, and digitization has given creators the ability to circumvent traditional gatekeepers and publish their work directly. The number of self-published works has grown by almost 300% since 2006 and now exceeds the number of traditionally published works. While e-book data are not systematically available, we are able to document that falling prices have increased consumer surplus by $2-3 billion per year. Given the inherent difficulty in predicting the ex post appeal of creative products at the time of investment, a growth in available new products can substantially expand the appeal of available products. Using bestseller lists in conjunction with title-level data on physical sales and our best estimates of e-book sales, we document that many self-published books have substantial ex post appeal to consumers. Works that began their commercial lives through self-publishing began to appear on bestseller lists in 2011 and by 2013 such works accounted for a tenth of both bestseller listings and estimated unit sales. In romantic fiction, self-published works account for almost a third. These changes challenge the role of gatekeepers while benefiting consumers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This article uses the incarceration tendency of randomly assigned judges as an instrumental variable to estimate causal effects of juvenile incarceration on high school completion and adult recidivism. Estimates based on over 35,000 juvenile offenders over a 10-year period from a large urban county in the United States suggest that juvenile incarceration results in substantially lower high school completion rates and higher adult incarceration rates, including for violent crimes. In an attempt to understand the large effects, we found that incarceration for this population could be very disruptive, greatly reducing the likelihood of ever returning to school and, for those who do return, significantly increasing the likelihood of being classified as having an emotional or behavioral disorder.","[Aizer, Anna] Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA",Brown University; National Bureau of Economic Research; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),"Aizer, A (通讯作者)，Brown Univ, Providence, RI 02912 USA.",,,,,,,,69,235,244,7,163,OXFORD UNIV PRESS INC,CARY,"JOURNALS DEPT, 2001 EVANS RD, CARY, NC 27513 USA",0033-5533,1531-4650,,Q J ECON,Q.

Using a novel approach that may detect causalities when the time-constant hypothesis is rejected, we find significant time-varying Granger causalities among the variables under consideration. There is bidirectional causality between GDP and energy consumption for Japan, unidirectional causality running from GDP to energy consumption for Italy, and unidirectional causality running from energy consumption to GDP for the resource country Canada. Moreover, the results also show a bidirectional time-varying causality between energy consumption and CO2 emissions for the United States, and causality from energy consumption to CO2 emissions for France. Finally, while we find significant time-varying causalities running from GDP to CO2 emissions for Italy and Japan, the finding of inverted N-shaped curves (Italy and Japan) lends no support to the traditional Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis for these countries.

Beginning with a brief recap of these interpretations-temporal single system interpretation (TSSI) and the new interpretation (NI) of Dumenil and Foley-the article emphasises the theoretical advantage of the TSS. Subsequently it refers to the second volume of Marx's Capital to highlight the fundamental role of the concept of turnover in Marxian value theory and argues that for the calculation of the MELT, the appropriate level of abstraction should be the turnover of social capital rather than annual statistics. At that point, the article attempts to show theoretically and mathematically that whenever empirical calculations are made on the basis of social turnover data, the MELT of TSSI essentially converges to the MELT of the NI. However, the article also notes that this convergence cannot be interpreted as a substantial equivalence of these different theoretical approaches.","[Akinci, Umit] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fizik Bolumu, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey; [Karahanogullari, Yigit] Ankara Univ, Fac Polit Sci, Dept Publ Finance, TR-06100 Ankara, Turkey",Dokuz Eylul University; Ankara University,"Akinci, U (通讯作者)，Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fizik Bolumu, Tinaztepe Yerleskesi, TR-35160 Izmir, Turkey.",umit.akinci@deu.edu.tr,"Akinci, Umit/F-7944-2013","Akinci, Umit/0000-0002-6349-0495",,,,,22,1,1,1,9,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

I argue that there have been periods in the past when income inequality was reduced and we can learn from these, that the textbook story of the causes of rising wage inequality-globalisation and technological change-has a more optimistic interpretation; and that, whereas wages are a major part of household incomes, but there are other important determinants where it is possible to take action to reduce inequality. The paper ends by outlining four old measures to reduce inequality, based on the lessons from the post-war decades in Europe, and four new measures suggested by the analysis of today's economics of inequality.","[Atkinson, Anthony B.] Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England; [Atkinson, Anthony B.] Oxford Martin Sch, INET, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Atkinson, AB (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford Nuffield Coll, Oxford OX1 1NF, England.",tony.atkinson@nuffield.ox.ac.uk,,,INET at the Oxford Martin School,INET at the Oxford Martin School,"A (considerably) revised version of a plenary lecture given at the Nationalokonomische Gesellschaft/Austrian Economic Association Annual Meeting in Vienna, May 2014.

This is relied on by price questionnaires used with household surveys in developing countries and when constructing temporal and spatial deflators. Methods of estimating demand systems from household survey data also rely on Hicksian separability. Yet this restriction remains untested in cross-sections. We use unique data from Vietnam with multiple specifications from within the same food groups to test if within-group relative prices are constant over space. The data firmly reject these restrictions. Some guidelines for survey design are discussed, in terms of the characteristics of commodity groups that should be disaggregated and those that should have more elementary goods added to their linked price questionnaire.

Our study differs from other studies by employing multivariate normal mixture models to capture the structural properties of the price dependencies in the underlying states. This paper investigates price dependencies from both quantitative and structural perspectives. By analyzing the overall dependencies and structural heterogeneity in the empirical results, we conclude that the global financial crisis is the most influential shock on the price links between energy and agricultural commodities. Because price links are vulnerable to financial shocks, our results also suggest introducing state-based analysis to risk management and portfolio diversification across the energy and agriculture markets during times of turmoil.

Unlike those authors, however, time is treated as a continuous rather than as a discrete variable. Existence of an optimal harvesting policy is established. Then necessary conditions are derived for the extended model which are also sufficient. The Conditions are used to show that under certain boundedness conditions, sequences of optimal harvesting policies contain subsequences which converge pointwise a.e. and in net present value to an optimal harvesting policy. This result is then used to show that any optimal logging policy must converge in harvesting age to a constant rotation period given by modified Faustmann formula.

In this setting, this paper investigates the impact of varying the informativeness of public information, as defined by Blackwell [8,9], pertaining to the games that will be played in future periods. In brief, when a curvature condition on payoffs is satisfied, the finding is that, for any fixed discount factor, the set of strongly symmetric subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs of a Markov game with more informative signals is contained in this set of equilibrium payoffs if the Markov game is played with any less informative signals. The second result shows that larger equilibrium payoffs are possible with less informative signals when the curvature condition fails, but only for some discount factors. The third result strengthens the curvature condition, but generalizes the first result to all subgame perfect equilibrium payoffs. Finally, a collusion application is presented to illustrate the curvature condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We use an endogenous growth model with a ceiling and an abatement option to study the effect of the ceiling on the allocation of limited funds for R&D, abatement and capital accumulation. It is found that the advantagenousness of abatement rises with the cost advantage of fossil fuel versus backstop. If the cost advantage is sufficiently large at some point in time it outweighs the costs of abatement and the gains of R&D and capital accumulation. The reallocation of production towards abatement may cause an increase or decrease in long-run consumption. In the latter case, abatement allows an intertemporal consumption trade-off which may even justify the disregard of everlasting growth. In case of stock dependent fossil fuel costs, an abatement induced speed-up of technology development may cause an increase in fossil fuel stock left in situ. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use a dynamic structural model to evaluate the role of local market entry regulations in the productivity of retail trade. Our model is flexible with respect to how local market regulations influence store productivity and controls for demand in local markets. We combine the structural approach with detailed data on all stores in the Swedish retail industry. The results show that more liberal entry regulations increase future productivity and that the increase in productivity is larger for small stores and small markets than for large stores and large markets.

In doing so, we return to Marx's hypotheses regarding the length of the working day. These include the arguments that class conflict over the length of the working day is inherently distributional in a surplus-value sense and that workers often display a preference for reduced hours even with a proportionate reduction in pay. Our quantitative Marxist methodology provides a way of assessing the pattern of surplus value before and during the period of office of the New Labour governments and the distributional effects of regulation. The impact of such regulations on workers' preferences are examined through an investigation of British Household Panel Survey data. Although many have been sceptical concerning the record of the last Labour governments, policies such as the Working Time Regulations (1998) and the Work-Life Balance Campaign (2000) are found to have been noteworthy innovations in the labour market. This is all the more important given recent moves by the successor government to weaken work-time regulation. Our results suggest the impact of these policy initiatives was broadly favourable, though the effect on men and women was different.","[Philp, Bruce; Wheatley, Daniel] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham, England; [Slater, Gary] Univ Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England",Nottingham Trent University; University of Leeds,"Slater, G (通讯作者)，Univ Leeds, Sch Business, Leeds LS2 9JT, W Yorkshire, England.",g.slater@leeds.ac.uk,"Slater, Gary/Y-4239-2019; Slater, Gary/ACB-1161-2022","Slater, Gary/0000-0003-0895-7117; Slater, Gary/0000-0003-0895-7117; Wheatley, Daniel/0000-0002-6753-2867",,,,,50,2,2,0,31,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

In this sense rising inequality should be regarded as a root cause of the present crisis. I identify four channels by which it has contributed to the crisis. First, rising inequality creates a downwards pressure on aggregate demand since poorer income groups have high marginal propensities to consume. Second, international financial deregulation has allowed countries to run larger current account deficits and for longer time periods. Thus, in reaction to potentially stagnant demand, two growth models have emerged: a debt-led model and an export-led model. Third, (in the debt-led growth models) higher inequality has led to higher household debt as working-class families have tried to keep up with social consumption norms despite stagnating or falling real wages. Fourth, rising inequality has increased the propensity to speculate as richer households tend to hold riskier financial assets than other groups. The rise of hedge funds and of subprime derivatives in particular has been linked to rise of the super-rich.","Univ Kingston, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England",Kingston University,"Stockhammer, E (通讯作者)，Univ Kingston, Penrhyn Rd, Kingston Upon Thames KT1 2EE, Surrey, England.",e.stockhammer@kingston.ac.uk,"Stockhammer, Engelbert/M-1744-2019","Stockhammer, Engelbert/0000-0002-5329-3535",,,,,93,197,213,4,73,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

The negative effects on the global economy are comparable to those found in other studies, but the impacts are unevenly distributed across countries/regions or sectors. The agricultural sectors of high-income countries, which are relatively energy intensive, would suffer more from a rising oil prices than that in lower-income countries, whereas the reverse is true for the impacts across manufacturing sectors. The impacts are especially strong for oil importers with relatively energy-intensive manufacturing and trade, such as India and China. While the availability of biofuels does mitigate some of the negative impacts of rising oil prices, the benefit is small because capacity of biofuels to economically substitute for fossil fuels on a large scale remains limited.

The HFCS is a complex survey accounting for survey design, non-response and coverage problems by providing specific weighting schemes and multiple implicates. This paper investigates the differences between risky asset holders and non-holders in a set of selected countries in the euro area by giving a comprehensive cross-country comparison of their wealth and socio-economic status. The findings show a substantial inequality between these two groups associated with their wealth, real estate ownership and debt level across the euro area countries. However, most of the differences can be reduced to a handful of relevant covariates. In particular, the focus of this paper is on the relationship between background risks and risky assets in the German-speaking countries in the HFCS dataset. So far, Austria and Germany lacked a qualitative dataset of such a scale and detail prior to the HFCS in order to answer questions concerning household risky assets. A logistic model and a GLM with the inverse Gaussian distribution are applied within the complex survey design to explore relevant covariates explaining the probability and the investment level of risky asset holdings. The logistic model for Austrian and German households suggests that housing risk is a negligible and insignificant factor when deciding to invest in risky assets, while credit constraint, occupation-linked income risks and entrepreneurial risks are major negative factors. However, none of these background risk factors are found to be significant when the level of investment is concerned.","Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Zhan, JC (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Vienna, Austria.",zhanjun@gmx.at,,,,,,,52,2,4,0,25,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0340-8744,1573-6911,,EMPIRICA,Empirica,MAY,2015,42,2,,,SI,,323,370,,10.1007/s10663-015-9295-1,0.0,,,48,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,CG5UP,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000353361700007,0

We find that intellectual property rights (IPRs) and offshoring are different ways for the labor endowment of the South to affect the size of the market for innovations in the North. Absent offshoring and lacking IPRs in the South - as in China in the early 1980s - an increase in Southern unskilled labor should lead to skill-biased technical change. If instead offshoring is present and/or IPRs are better enforced (as in China in more recent times), then a decrease in unskilled labor in the South should lead to skill-biased technical change. Furthermore, an increase in Southern per capita stock of capital reduces offshoring and also leads to skill-biased technical change. Calibrating the model to China-US data, we find that under a moderate elasticity of substitution between skill-intensive and labor-intensive goods, the decrease in unskilled labor and the increase in capital in China can explain about one-third of the recent increase in the skill premium in China through skill-biased technical change in the US.

We focus on China because it is experiencing an historic demographic transition and has had a massive increase in household saving. We conduct a quantitative investigation using a structural overlapping generations model that incorporates parental care through support for dependent children and financial transfers to retirees. The saving decisions in the parameterized model mimic many of the features observed in the Chinese household saving rate time series from 1955 to 2009. Demographic change alone accounts for over half of the saving rate increase.,"[Curtis, Chadwick C.] Univ Richmond, Dept Econ, Robins Sch Business 338, Richmond, VA 23173 USA; [Lugauer, Steven; Mark, Nelson C.] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Econ, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Mark, Nelson C.] NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Richmond; University of Notre Dame; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Curtis, CC (通讯作者)，Univ Richmond, Dept Econ, Robins Sch Business 338, Richmond, VA 23173 USA.",ccurtis2@richmond.edu; slugauer@nd.edu; nmark@nd.edu,,"Mark, Nelson/0000-0001-5446-5119",,,,,49,69,79,7,65,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

Another natural type of experimentation cost, the cost of holding on to the option of developing a currently inactive project, has not been studied. In a multi-armed bandit model of experimentation in which inactive projects have explicit maintenance costs and can be irreversibly discarded, I show that the decision-maker's incentive to actively manage its options has important implications for the order of project development. In the model, an experimenter searches for a success among a number of projects by choosing both those to develop now and those to maintain for (potential) future development. In the absence of maintenance costs, optimal experimentation policies have a 'stay-with-the-winner' property: the projects that are more likely to succeed are developed first. Maintenance costs provide incentives to bring the option value of less promising projects forward, and under optimal experimentation policies, 'going with the loser' can be optimal: projects that are less likely to succeed are sometimes developed first.

In particular, it has been found lacking for allegedly assuming that people are selfish, an assumption which is contradicted by both introspection and empirical evidence. The aim of this paper is to show that never in the history of the economic discipline has selfishness constituted the core of the Homo economicus model. In fact, the standard economic model of behaviour which has been used by economists for more than a hundred years is reticent about the motives of behaviour. Critics thus do not criticize Homo economicus but a straw man - Homo stramineus. Three possible reasons for confusing Homo economicus with Homo stramineus are identified: malicious intent, ignorance and an attempt to avoid the tautological model of behaviour.","Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Hudík, M (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Ctr Theoret Study, Prague, Czech Republic.",hudik@cts.cuni.cz,"Hudik, Marek/N-1610-2019","Hudik, Marek/0000-0002-1670-2555",,,,,116,3,4,0,22,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

The framework includes non-unitary income and substitution elasticities, so that both windfall income and productivity growth lead to sectoral reallocation of labor. I use the model to account for the declining share of manufacturing employment in Canada. I find that the relative importance of these factors has varied over time. While productivity growth is responsible for a substantial fraction of the decline in the share of manufacturing employment since 1960, the windfall income from the booming resource sector contributed to this decline significantly during the 2000s, when the Canadian terms of trade improved rather dramatically.","Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Iscan, TB (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, Dept Econ, 6214 Univ Ave,POB 15000, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",tiscan@dal.ca,"Iscan, Talan B/HSG-2878-2023","Iscan, Talan B/0000-0003-0600-2026",,,,,45,2,3,0,11,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0923-7992,1573-708X,,OPEN ECON REV,Open Econ.

The financial crisis has intensified the divergences emerging within the EU-27, leading to the multimodality of bond yield density distribution, and also to the decline of the financial integration process in the long term.

It is worth pointing out that the GBIVIFGC operator can be seen as an extension of some geometric mean operators. Since the fuzzy measure is defined on the power set, it makes the problem exponentially complex. In order to overall reflect the interaction among elements and reduce the complexity of solving a fuzzy measure, we further introduce the GBIVIFGC operator w.r.t. 2-additive measures. Furthermore, if the information about weights of experts and attributes is incompletely known, the models of obtaining the optimal 2-additive measures on criteria set and expert set are given by using the introduced cross entropy measure and the Banzhaf index.

Firm outputs weigh private information about private values by more than common values. Thus, prices contain more information about private-value shocks.","[Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA; [Bernhardt, Dan] Univ Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL, W Midlands, England; [Taub, Bart] Univ Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, Lanark, Scotland",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; University of Warwick; University of Glasgow,"Bernhardt, D (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Chicago, IL 60680 USA.",danber@Illinois.edu; bart.taub@gmail.com,"Taub, Bart/A-9626-2014","Taub, Bart/0000-0003-1223-1386",,,,,29,14,15,0,12,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0741-6261,1756-2171,,RAND J ECON,Rand J.

The provincial marginal abatement cost (MAC) of CO2 emissions is estimated using a parameterized directional output distance function. Four types of model specifications are applied to fit the MAC-carbon intensity pairs. The optimal specification controlling for various covariates is identified econometrically. A scenario simulation of China's 40-45% carbon intensity reduction based on our MACC is illustrated. Our simulation results show that China would incur a 559-623 Yuan/t (roughly 51-57%) increase in marginal abatement cost to achieve a corresponding 40-45% reduction in carbon intensity compared to its 2005 level.

While these deficiencies are multidimensional, a major reason is that the dominant approach fails to take into account seriously and adequately three major aspects of real-world economies: uncertainty, power, and institutions. Incorporating these issues into economic analysis, which is the urgent and important business at hand for critics of mainstream economics, leads to a more appropriate approach to policies that can help to shape more desirable forms of capitalism.","[Dutt, Amitava Krishna] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; [Dutt, Amitava Krishna] FLACSO, Quito, Ecuador",University of Notre Dame,"Dutt, AK (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Polit Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",,,,,,,,36,7,7,0,8,EDWARD ELGAR PUBLISHING LTD,CHELTENHAM,"THE LYPIATTS, 15 LANSDOWN RD, CHELTENHAM, GLOS GL50 2JA, ENGLAND",2049-5323,2049-5331,,REV KEYNES ECON,Rev.

The quantitative implications of income tax progressivity increments are illustrated for the US economy under three main headings: individual effects (reduced labor supply and savings, and increased dispersion of tax rates); aggregate effects (lower GDP growth and lower income inequality); and welfare effects (lower dispersion of consumption across individuals and higher leisure levels, but also lower growth of future consumption). The social discount factor proves to be crucial for this third effect: a higher valuation of future generations' well-being requires a lower level of progressivity. Additionally, if tax revenues are used to provide a public good rather than just being discarded, a higher private valuation of such public goods will also call for a lower level of progressivity.","Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Bilbao 48015, Spain",University of Basque Country,"Echevarría, CA (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Avda Lehendakari Aguirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Spain.",cruz.echevarria@ehu.es,"Echevarria, Cruz/E-6557-2019","Echevarria, Cruz/0000-0003-2795-1917",MEC [ECO2012-35820]; Basque Government (DEUI) [IT-793-13]; UPV/EHU [UFI 11/46 BETS],MEC; Basque Government (DEUI)(Basque Government); UPV/EHU,"This paper has greatly benefited from comments by Mara Cruz Loyo and Amaia Iza.

These two government-sponsored enterprises play a central role in the US housing finance system, and at the start of their conservatorships held or guaranteed about $5.2 trillion of home mortgage debt. The two firms were often cited as shining examples of public-private partnerships-that is, the harnessing of private capital to advance the social goal of expanding homeownership. But in reality, the hybrid structures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were destined to fail at some point, owing to their singular exposure to residential real estate and moral hazard incentives emanating from the implicit guarantee of their liabilities. We describe the financial distress experienced by the two firms, the events that led the federal government to take dramatic action in an effort to stabilize housing and financial markets, and the various resolution options available to US policymakers at the time; and we evaluate the success of the choice of conservatorship in terms of its effects on financial markets and financial stability, on mortgage supply, and on the financial position of the two firms themselves. Conservatorship achieved its key short-run goals of stabilizing mortgage markets and promoting financial stability during a period of extreme stress. However, conservatorship was intended to be a temporary fix, not a long-term solution, and more than six years later, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac still remain in conservatorship.","[Frame, W.

Since 1970, some trade unionists have been making use of European legislation to improve legal norms and build a strong body of case law. They have developed legal expertise and detailed knowledge of the practicalities of the law and have supported numerous claims. However this use of litigation has not developed consistently over time and across unions. Litigation has been quite controversial within the trade union movement. This article seeks to investigate what are the conditions under which some trade unionists have decided to rely upon litigation to further their female members' interests, depending on the time period. The article emphasises the crucial role these local trade unionists have played in the development of equal pay litigation. The paper builds on a 'developmental approach' that differentiates several 'stages' or phases in which union's litigation strategies for equal pay figure differently.","[Guillaume, Cecile] Univ London, London E1 4NS, England",University of London,"Guillaume, C (通讯作者)，Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England.",cecileguillaume94@gmail.com,,"Guillaume, Cecile/0000-0001-5331-8811",,,,,58,28,30,1,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Two large bets on real estate made with funding vulnerable to bank-run-like dynamics pushed AIG to the brink of bankruptcy. AIG used securities lending to transform insurance company assets into residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, ultimately losing at least $21 billion and threatening the solvency of the life insurance companies. AIG also sold insurance on multisector collateralized debt obligations, backed by real estate assets, ultimately losing more than $30 billion. These activities were apparently motivated by a belief that AIG's real estate bets would not suffer defaults and were money-good.

As in Kurozumi (2008), the optimal sustainable policy is a strategy considered in the absence of commitment technologies; however it is implemented following an optimal quasi-sustainable policy derived by assuming that the commitment technologies are present. This study finds that solving for the policy function of the optimal quasi-sustainable policy yields a result basically identical to the Ramsey-optimal commitment policy under a set of parameters commonly used in the literature. The simulation shows two further results: policymakers have incentive to deviate from the Ramsey-optimal commitment policy when the lagged output gap is large and the optimal quasi-sustainable policy endogenously diminishes the steadfastness of policymakers' commitment.

The latter problem has emerged unresolved from the earlier Cambridge capital controversy. In the presence of these two problems, all specifications of microproduction functions have involved nonunique coefficients and error terms. We provide a method of deriving time-varying coefficients that produces unique coefficients and error terms. Specifically, we respecify the microproduction function in such a way that its coefficients are the sums of (i) the appropriate partial derivatives and (ii) exact representations of excluded-variable biases. By decomposing the total coefficients, we obtain the unique coefficients and a unique error term.

In addition we depart from the implicit assumption that all farmers scattered across rural areas face the same prices when interacting with markets. Using maize marketing during the 2007-2008 agricultural season in a sample of smallholders in Tanzania as an illustration, we find that especially poor farmers face greater losses than what a standard analysis would suggest.

By doing so, we stress the limitations that can result when applying an aggregate institutional interpretation of economic history and development.

We first use a simplified theoretical framework which allows us to formalize the testable implications of the relevant literature. Subsequently, our analysis indicates that more unequal economies rely heavier on capital relative to labor income taxation. This relationship remains robust across various alternative measures of income inequality and most importantly through alternative political regimes. In addition, our analysis investigates the role of the tax structure on the relationship between income inequality and economic growth.

Strengthening Pareto indifference to Pareto preference provides a refinement of the representation.","[Danan, Eric] Univ Cergy Pontoise, CNRS, THEMA, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France; [Gajdos, Thibault] Aix Marseille Univ, EHESS Aix Marseille Sch Econ, CNRS, GREQAM, F-13002 Marseille, France; [Tallon, Jean-Marc] Univ Paris 01, CNRS, Paris Sch Econ, F-75647 Paris 13, France",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CY Cergy Paris Universite; Aix-Marseille Universite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Paris School of Economics,"Danan, E (通讯作者)，Univ Cergy Pontoise, CNRS, THEMA, 33 Blvd Port, F-95000 Cergy Pontoise, France.",eric.danan@u-cergy.fr; thibault.gajdos@univ-amu.fr; jean-marc.tallon@univ-paris1.fr,,"Tallon, Jean-Marc/0000-0003-1762-9633; gajdos, thibault/0000-0001-6906-4836; Danan, Eric/0000-0002-0287-1091",Labex MME-DII program [ANR-11-LBX-0023-01]; A-MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir Program [ANR-11-IDEX-0001-02]; ANR grant AmGames [ANR-12-FRAL-0008-01]; Investissements d'Avenir Program [ANR-10-LABX-93]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-12-FRAL-0008] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR),Labex MME-DII program; A-MIDEX project - Investissements d'Avenir Program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); ANR grant AmGames(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Investissements d'Avenir Program(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),We thank two anonymous referees for their comments and suggestions.

We use the recently developed GVAR approach to model financial variables jointly with macroeconomic variables in 33 countries for the period 1983-2009. We experiment with inter-country links based on bilateral trade, portfolio investment, foreign direct investment and banking exposures. Capturing both bilateral trade and financial exposures in a GVAR fits the data better than using trade weights only. We use sign restrictions on the short-run impulse responses in the US model to identify the credit supply shocks. We find that negative credit supply shocks have strong negative effects on US and foreign GDP. Credit and equity markets in several countries respond clearly to the shocks. Exchange rate responses are consistent with a flight to quality to the US dollar. The credit supply shocks explain about a fifth of one-year-ahead output forecast error variance in the US and about a tenth in the euro area and the UK, but considerably less elsewhere.

If the regulator does not have statutory authority to provide regulatory relief, the VA can leave the firm more vulnerable to legal challenges through citizen lawsuits. I use a model of negotiated VAs to examine the impact of citizen enforcement on the likelihood of an agreement and on the outcome of a VA. The findings indicate that both the probabilities of enforcement by the regulatory agency and of private enforcement through a citizen lawsuit affect the likelihood of a VA and the level of abatement when an agreement is reached. A VA can result in higher abatement and net social benefits than regulation if the probability of private enforcement and accompanying costs are high and the probability of agency enforcement is low.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Langpap, C (通讯作者)，Oregon State Univ, Dept Appl Econ, Ballard Hall 240 E, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",christian.langpap@oregonstate.edu,,"Langpap, Christian/0000-0002-6583-6402",,,,,41,2,3,1,36,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0922-680X,1573-0468,,J REGUL ECON,J.

Policy is determined by probabilistic voting under proportional and majoritarian elections. Different electoral competition give rise to different location incentives. Under plausible assumptions, the smaller region has a higher fraction of ideologically independent swing voters than the larger region. Majoritarian voting, by focusing electoral competition into swing districts containing the most policy-responsive voters, therefore allocates more subsidies to firms in the smaller region. Compared to proportional voting, this leads to more firms in the region with fewer consumers. Proportional voting thus welfare-dominates majoritarian election.","Natl Inst Econ Res, Stockholm, Sweden",,"Wiberg, M (通讯作者)，Natl Inst Econ Res, Stockholm, Sweden.",magnus.wiberg@konj.se,,,,,,,28,0,0,0,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

Instead of isolating the systematic component of risk by recasting the risk in terms of a stock's beta coefficient, I decompose the SD directly into its systematic and unsystematic components. From this decomposed SD, an 'adjusted capital market line (CML)' can be derived. It is easily shown that the adjusted CML is equivalent to Sharpe's security market line (SML). I evaluate the effectiveness of these alternative measures of systematic and unsystematic risk using empirical data and find that beta often deviates from my systematic risk measure and, in general, tends to overestimate a portfolio's risk. This alternative way of looking at systematic and unsystematic risk offers easily accessible insights into the very nature of risk. Implications include reducing the computational complexities in calculating the relevant portion of a portfolio's volatility, facilitating sophisticated dispersion trades, estimating risk-adjusted returns and improving risk-adjusted performance measurement. This article offers new ideas that may influence the teaching of economics and finance.","CUNY Queens Coll, Flushing, NY 11367 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Queens College NY (CUNY),"Marshall, CM (通讯作者)，CUNY Queens Coll, Flushing, NY 11367 USA.",Cara.Marshall@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,,,11,7,11,0,54,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

For this purpose, a number of recently developed more powerful panel unit root tests that permit for dependence among the individual countries are employed. In addition to this, we utilize the Lagrange multiplier (LM) cointegration test developed by Westerlund, which is flexible enough to accommodate a large degree of country specific heterogeneity, cross-country dependence as well as multiple structural breaks. The main results derived from this study are: first, our findings from panel unit root tests which do not control for cross-sectional dependence appear to be clearly showing evidence against PPP. Second, the evidence from panel tests controlling for cross-sectional dependence is against PPP over the whole and 1997 pre-financial crisis periods. On the other hand, we find sufficient evidence to support PPP for ASEAN-5 countries over the post-financial crisis period. Third, in stark contrast stand the results obtained from the application of the panel cointegration test provide strong evidence of panel cointegration in whole and sub-periods, providing evidence for PPP; however, these findings have become apparent after allowing for multiple structural breaks as well as for general forms of cross-sectional dependence through bootstrap methods. We provide a detailed description of the breaks identified in the analysis, which appear to be closely associated with some macroeconomic shocks and institutional arrangements. The findings of this study offer important policy implications.","[Munir, Qaiser; Kok, Sook Ching] Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Malaysia",Universiti Malaysia Sabah,"Munir, Q (通讯作者)，Univ Malaysia Sabah, Fac Business Econ & Accountancy, Jalan UMS, Kota Kinabalu 88400, Malaysia.",qaiser@ums.edu.my,"Munir, Qaiser/K-1948-2019; Munir, Qaiser/J-9665-2019","Munir, Qaiser/0000-0002-5009-9788; Munir, Qaiser/0000-0002-5009-9788",,,,,120,3,3,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

There is a sizeable empirical literature on the development of the welfare state and on the typology of the welfare regimes. There appear to be, however, no empirical studies that examine welfare regimes with special attention to military spending. This study aims at providing a comprehensive analysis on the topic by considering several different welfare regime typologies. To do so, we use dynamic panel data analysis for 37 countries for the period of 1988-2003 by considering a wide range of control variables such as inequality measures, number of terrorist events, and size of the armed forces. We also replicate the same analyses for the political regimes. Our findings, in line with the literature, show that there is a positive relationship between income inequality and share of military expenditures in the central government budget, and that the number of terrorist events is a significant factor that affects both the level of military expenditure and inequality. Also, the paper reveals a significant negative relationship between social democratic welfare regimes and military expenditures.","[Tongur, Unal] Middle E Tech Univ, Dept Econ, Ankara, Turkey; [Elveren, Adem Y.] Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Dept Econ, TR-46050 Kahramanmaras, Turkey",Middle East Technical University; Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam University,"Elveren, AY (通讯作者)，Kahramanmaras Sutcu Imam Univ, Dept Econ, TR-46050 Kahramanmaras, Turkey.",ademyavu-zelveren@gmail.com,"Töngür, Ünal/I-9772-2017; Töngür, Ünal/JBR-9138-2023","Töngür, Ünal/0000-0002-6891-6854; Töngür, Ünal/0000-0002-6891-6854",,,,,78,25,26,1,28,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

The results suggest that only a restrictive fiscal policy that simultaneously increases government revenues and reduces government expenditure could permit the country to achieve debt sustainability. The results also suggest that debt sustainability can be achieved faster when tax revenue policies are intensified.

Using unique survey data from the Netherlands, we explore two possible explanations: deposit holders may have limited knowledge of deposit insurance (DI)-schemes or they may not fully trust these schemes to be executed faithfully. We find that knowledge on the eligibility for DI is limited, particularly when it concerns minor banks. Nevertheless, households with more deposits have better knowledge of the DI-scheme and show higher levels of trust. In addition, deposit holders generally expect an associated payback time that well exceeds the time it has taken to pay back depositors in the past. Moreover, consumers believe repayment is more likely and faster for large, systemic banks. These results confirm that both households' awareness of the coverage and trust in the operations of the DI-scheme are suboptimal.","[Bijlsma, Michiel] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2585 JR The Hague, Netherlands; [Bijlsma, Michiel; Van der Wiel, Karen] Tilburg Univ, TILEC, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [Van der Wiel, Karen] IZA, Bonn, Germany",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy; Tilburg University; IZA Institute Labor Economics,"Bijlsma, M (通讯作者)，CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, NL-2585 JR The Hague, Netherlands.",m.j.bijlsma@cpb.nl,,,,,,,17,6,6,0,16,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

I find that deregulated plants substantially reduce the price paid for coal (but not gas) and tend to employ less capital-intensive sulfur abatement techniques relative to matched plants that were not subject to any regulatory change. Deregulation also led to a shift toward more productive coal mines. I show how these results lend support to theories of asymmetric information, capital bias, and regulatory capture as important sources of regulatory distortion.","Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Cicala, S (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, 1155 E 60th St, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",scicala@uchicago.edu,,,,,,,55,73,114,2,54,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0002-8282,1944-7981,,AM ECON REV,Am.

Mainstream climate change economics tackles the correction of the underlying externalities introducing a worldwide price mechanism on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which has proven to be unworkable, basically due to institutional failures. Moreover, the perverse incentives of carbon curbing policies might even counteract their aims under the so-called GP of climate policy. The fundamental (Knightian-type) underlying uncertainty around the climate change issue, the lessons learnt from the GP debate, and the acknowledgement that the fundamentals of a green macroeconomic policy around the notion of growth is still pending, evidence the difficulty to develop a coherent and successful global policy to face rising carbon emissions.

In this study, the conditional variance of the GARCH (1, 1) model is taken as a proxy for exchange-rate stability, and generalized impulse-response functions and variance-decomposition analyses are applied to analyze the dynamic effects of variables on real export volume.

I show that when recipients have private information, policies reflecting their preferences and knowledge might result in such a regime. However, generous transfers can also induce them to conform to the outcome-oriented expectations of donors at the expense of lower aid impact. Such behaviour is consistent with an abundance of case-study evidence. Moderate disagreements over what the optimal policy is could actually produce better results. Certain forms of both donor competition and coordination might also eliminate this distortion, while a donor concern for need only removes incentives for aid-seeking in the least needy countries. In summary, optimal aid policies are highly context-specific, and donors should thus concentrate their efforts to practise more informed selectivity.","Univ Bergen, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway",University of Bergen,"Hagen, RJ (通讯作者)，Univ Bergen, NO-5020 Bergen, Norway.",rune.hagen@econ.uib.no,"Hagen, Rune Jansen/I-8522-2019",,,,,,45,4,4,0,10,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0347-0520,1467-9442,,SCAND J ECON,Scand.

It found a weak relation between the AGR rating and share price data (Close and Volume), using a skew t-distribution. For visualisation we used the Kohonen map, which identified three clusters. Clusters revealed AGR increasing, decreasing trendsetting and cluster-based companies which appear to have no clear trend. A self-organised map (SOM) used the AGR history of alpha-stable distribution parameters, which were calculated from the stock data (Close and Volume). Also, the test sample (companies rating data), following from skew t-distribution, has been simulated by maximum likelihood method, and parameters of the skew t-distribution have been estimated.","[Kabasinskas, Audrius] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Math Modelling, Studentu 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania; [Vaiciulyte, Ingrida] Siauliai State Coll, Business & Technol Fac, Dept Elect Engn, Shiauliai, Lithuania; [Vasiliauskaite, Asta] Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Finance, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology; Siauliai State College; Kaunas University of Technology,"Kabasinskas, A (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Dept Math Modelling, Studentu 50, LT-51368 Kaunas, Lithuania.",audrius.kabasinskas@ktu.lt,"; Kabasinskas, Audrius/I-1028-2018","Vaiciulyte, Ingrida/0009-0008-0895-9343; Kabasinskas, Audrius/0000-0001-6863-5895",,,,,27,0,0,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

We classify firms into three access categories: private, unrated public and rated public. Private firms have the lowest access, and to date, no large sample investigation of their loans has been done in the literature. Rated public firms access the capital markets the most. We find the level of access influences loan structure in ways that are consistent with having greater or fewer financing alternatives, as well as theories on information asymmetry, agency and monitoring. In particular, loans to firms with higher levels of access have shorter maturities, fewer loan facilities per package, and a lower probability of being secured. We also find that a higher level of access results in a higher incidence of single-lender loans, but among multiple-lender loans, it leads to a larger number of lenders. Furthermore, we find evidence that access affects financial covenants in a nonmonotonic manner. Finally, lender type and economic conditions influence loan structure. Our results are robust to endogeneity caused by simultaneity of contract terms and rating.","[Khang, K.] Idaho State Univ, Coll Business, Pocatello, ID 83209 USA; [King, T.

In the model, the decision to migrate and the corresponding decision to return are endogenous and take place within families that are heterogeneous in terms of human capital. After finding a migrant's optimal migration duration and the resulting shrinkage in the wage gap and change in interest rates, the paper derives the restriction on migrants' stay that maximizes natives' utility. It also derives the migrant length of stay that would pass a majority vote. When migration duration is restricted, the fraction of the native population made better off is maximized with a permit length of four years.","[Khraiche, Maroula] Colorado Coll, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA",Colorado College,"Khraiche, M (通讯作者)，Colorado Coll, Dept Econ & Business, 14 East Cache La Poudre St, Colorado Springs, CO 80903 USA.",maroula.khraiche@coloradocollege.edu,,"Khraiche, Maroula/0000-0001-5385-696X",,,,,25,6,6,2,8,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",1365-1005,1469-8056,,MACROECON DYN,Macroecon.

These events call into question the canonical life-cycle theory of consumption, with its benign view of debt as a neutral instrument of optimal intertemporal expenditure smoothing. This paper draws attention to an alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption spending in which current income, household borrowing and household indebtedness all affect current consumption. Central to the analysis is an empirical investigation of US consumption spending since the 1950s. The results of this inquiry cast doubt on the life-cycle hypothesis, but are congruent with the alternative, post-Keynesian account of consumption.","[Kim, Yun K.; Setterfield, Mark; Mei, Yuan] Hartford MS & Univ Chicago YM, Univ Massachusetts Boston YK, New Sch Social Res & Trin Coll, Hartford, CT USA",,"Kim, YK (通讯作者)，Hartford MS & Univ Chicago YM, Univ Massachusetts Boston YK, New Sch Social Res & Trin Coll, Hartford, CT USA.",Mark.Setterfield@trincoll.edu,,"Mei, Yuan/0000-0001-7341-0113",,,,,32,25,26,3,36,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

Energy sector transformation represents a key element in ensuring the energy security and it one of the most troubling questions of energy economics nowadays. It is expected that by 2020 more than half of the energy equipment in Russia would exceed its economic life. Our results show that the main goals of reconstruction might include life extension, increasing production efficiency, and output. We demonstrate that these goals can be achieved through partial replacement of the most worn parts of equipment (e.g. replacement of blades in the turbine), the combination of new and old equipment (such as add-in steam and gas cycle), and full replacement of equipment.","[Lisin, Evgeny] Natl Res Univ, Moscow Power Engn Inst, Dept Econ Power Engn & Ind, Moscow, Russia; [Strielkowski, Wadim] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Prague 11001, Czech Republic; [Garanin, Ivan] Natl Res Univ, Moscow Power Engn Inst, Dept Thermal Power Plants, Moscow, Russia",Moscow Power Engineering Institute; Charles University Prague; Moscow Power Engineering Institute,"Strielkowski, W (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fac Social Sci, Smetanovo 6, Prague 11001, Czech Republic.",strielkowski@fsv.cuni.cz,"Strielkowski, Wadim/I-4374-2019; Strielkowski, Wadim/J-6112-2017; Lisin, Evgeny/O-9046-2014","Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Strielkowski, Wadim/0000-0001-6113-3841; Lisin, Evgeny/0000-0001-9794-913X",Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [26.1795.2014/K]; People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme [609642],"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); People Programme (Marie Curie Actions) of the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme(European Union (EU))",This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [grant number No. 26.1795.2014/K].

It is written as a manifesto urging reintegration of social sciences. A number of reviewers judged it on ideological grounds, labeling it either as a revolution in economic thinking, or dismissing it offhandedly. Piketty's theory of rising inequality is based on the two Fundamental Laws of Capitalism, developed after the Solow growth model. However, this model is inconsistent with Piketty's own characterization of modern capitalism. Moreover, his sole justification for the constant discrepancy between rate of return and rate of income growth (r > g) is based on the high elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. However, that is just one factor that can have an influence on factor income shares. By failing to offer a consistent theory of rising inequality, his piece can hardly be considered as a useful founding stone for a new social science.","[Milovanovic, Milic] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia",University of Belgrade,"Milovanovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade 11001, Serbia.",,,,,,,,23,1,1,2,5,SAVEZ EKONOMISTA VOJVODINE,NOVI SAD,"ZMAJ JOVINA 26-1, NOVI SAD, 21000, SERBIA",1452-595X,2217-2386,,PANOECONOMICUS,Panoeconomicus,,2015,62,5,,,,,663,677,,10.2298/PAN1505663M,0.0,,,15,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CZ9JV,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000367414800007,0

Our recommendation is to organise public tenders for works in manners allowing for the highest possible level of competition, to do as much as possible to motivate potential suppliers for participation.","[Ochrana, Frantisek; Stehlik, Petr] Charles Univ Prague, Fak Socialnich Ved, Inst Sociol Studii, Prague 15800, Czech Republic",Charles University Prague,"Ochrana, F (通讯作者)，Charles Univ Prague, Fak Socialnich Ved, Inst Sociol Studii, U Krize, Prague 15800, Czech Republic.",ochrana@fsv.cuni.cz; petrus.stehlik@gmail.com,"Stehlik, Petr/U-7987-2018; Ochrana, Frantisek/E-9765-2018","Stehlik, Petr/0000-0002-7248-5524",,,,,26,6,6,1,14,INST ECONOMICS RESEARCH SAS & INST FORECASTING CSPS SAS,BRATISLAVA,"SANCOVA 56, BRATISLAVA, SLOVAKIA",0013-3035,,,EKON CAS,Ekon.

For this purpose, three different tasks were carried out: firstly analyzing the psychometric properties of the instrument; secondly, analyzing the knowledge management levels of the R&D teams at a technical university as well as the relationship between organizational culture and knowledge management. This instrument was developed to cover the existing gap in the evaluation of knowledge management. The Knowledge Creation and Dissemination Survey was administered to four different samples from a Spanish technical university. Here we will refer to the sample used for the final validation of the scale, 275 participants from 35 R&D teams. The psychometric properties of the Knowledge Creation and Dissemination Survey are adequate. According to the results of the study, the use of this diagnostic tool with university R&D teams seems justified, the knowledge management on these teams seems to be high considering the levels on the KCD dimensions, and there is a link between organizational culture and knowledge management. The main limitation of the study refers to the sample, future research must continue, extending the sample both in terms of its size and also on its diversity. The paper contributes to management research by presenting a useful, practical tool to evaluate group practices on knowledge management, and by present empirical evidence of the links between organizational culture and knowledge management.","[Prado-Gasco, Vicente J.] Univ Europea Valencia, E-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Pardo, Ismael Quintanilla; Calabuig-Moreno, Ferran] Univ Valencia, E-46010 Valencia, Spain; [Vveinhardt, Jolita] Lithuanian Sports Univ, LT-44221 Kaunas, Lithuania",University of Valencia; Lithuanian Sports University,"Prado-Gasco, VJ (通讯作者)，Univ Europea Valencia, Gen Elio 8, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",vicentejavier.prado@uem.es; ismael.quintanilla@uv.es; ferran.calabuig@uv.es; jolita.vveinhardt@gmail.com,"PRADO-GASCO, VICENTE/K-7276-2014; Vveinhardt, Jolita/AAB-6754-2020; Calabuig, Ferran/A-9738-2009","PRADO-GASCO, VICENTE/0000-0002-2108-2186; Vveinhardt, Jolita/0000-0001-6231-9402; Calabuig, Ferran/0000-0002-4538-2976",,,,,82,8,12,2,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

However, the assessment of these benefits is quite challenging, since it requires combining features from bottom-up and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. This paper assesses the impacts of a DR program in Spain using a CGE model which includes both technological and temporal disaggregation. The model is able to account for the indirect effects characteristic of CGE models while also mimicking the detailed behavior of the electricity operation and investment available before only in bottom-up detailed models. Our results show clearly the advantages of using this approach for this type of policies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Previous researchers have aimed to achieve this objective by determining the correlation between accounting variables and the market beta. However, the magnitude of the resulting error in this correlation has remained unknown. The current study is an attempt to test the performance of the BACC as a proxy measure for the market risk and to examine the extent of the statistical error in the correlation between these two measures. Our findings indicate that BACC overestimates the market beta by between 20% and 50%. Applying some corrective measures, such as operational earnings scaled by equity, may lessen this difference to a range of 22%-25%; however, it does not eliminate the error. Our output also suggests that the BACC might be biased when used to assess the risk of small firms.","[Sarmiento-Sabogal, J.] Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Business Adm Dept, Bogota, Colombia; [Sadeghi, M.] Macquarie Univ, Dept Appl Finance & Actuarial Studies, N Ryde, NSW, Australia",Pontificia Universidad Javeriana; Macquarie University,"Sarmiento-Sabogal, J (通讯作者)，Pontificia Univ Javeriana, Business Adm Dept, Bogota, Colombia.",sarmien@javeriana.edu.co,"Sarmiento-Sabogal, Julio/O-7070-2014","Sarmiento-Sabogal, Julio/0000-0001-5986-4813; Sadeghi, Mehdi/0000-0003-2042-185X",,,,,39,8,8,2,28,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Hence, this paper adds to the existing empirical work by specifying an export performance equation not only as a function of income and price, as is traditionally done, but also industrial production and labour cost. For that purpose, dynamic panel data models are estimated by utilising the system GMM estimator for the period from 2000 to 2011. The obtained results indicate that both industrial production and domestic demand have a positive and statistically significant impact on total and high tech manufacturing exports. On the other hand, it is proven that foreign demand also has an impact on total manufacturing exports. Thus, the paper's contribution is reflected in the acknowledgement that a stable macroeconomic environment (contained in the significance of a dummy variable for the economic crisis in both models), boosting production capacity and domestic demand, is essential for better export performance and the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry in an increasingly competitive global economic climate. Finally, from the perspective of policy-making, the paper concludes that recovery in the manufacturing industry could be the much needed push from crisis to economic development.","[Sertic, Martina Basarac] Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Econ Res Div, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Vuckovic, Valentina] Univ Zagreb, Fac Econ & Business, Zagreb 10000, Croatia; [Peric, Blanka Skrabic] Univ Split, Fac Econ, Split 21000, Croatia",Croatian Academy of Sciences & Arts; University of Zagreb; University of Split,"Sertic, MB (通讯作者)，Croatian Acad Sci & Arts, Econ Res Div, Strossmayerov Trg 2, Zagreb 10000, Croatia.",mbasarac@hazu.hr,"Vučković, Valentina/AAM-7141-2021; Skrabic Peric, Blanka/D-4976-2017; Sertić, Martina Basarac/AAH-4377-2019","Vučković, Valentina/0000-0002-5438-0665; Skrabic Peric, Blanka/0000-0002-7448-3821; Sertić, Martina Basarac/0000-0003-4182-8405",,,,,43,21,23,0,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1331-677X,1848-9664,,ECON RES-EKON ISTRAZ,Ekon.

To that end, we apply three sequential procedures that consider the dynamics of exchange rates to data covering the period from 1999:01 to 2012:12. Our results would suggest that implicit bands have existed in many sub-periods for almost all currencies under study. Once we detect de facto discrepancies between de facto and de iure exchange-rate regimes, we make use of different methods to study the credibility of the detected fluctuation bands. The detected lack of credibility in a high percentage of the sample is robust to the use of several credibility tests, suggesting that economic agents do not behave as if these bands actually were in force at time of making their financial plans. These countries do not improve the confidence on the fluctuation bands as time evolves.","[Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon] Univ Complutense Madrid, Complutense Inst Int Studies, Madrid 28223, Spain; [del Carmen Ramos-Herrera, Maria] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Cuantitat, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Complutense University of Madrid,"Ramos-Herrera, MD (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Ciencias Econ & Empresariales, Dept Econ Cuantitat, Campus Somosaguas, Madrid 28223, Spain.",madelram@ccee.ucm.es,"Ramos-Herrera, Maria del Carmen/JXN-9501-2024; del Carmen Ramos-Herrera, Maria/ABF-2795-2020; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/H-4163-2015","Ramos-Herrera, Maria del Carmen/0000-0002-2903-5405; Sosvilla-Rivero, Simon/0000-0003-2084-0640",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2011-23189]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [FPU AP2008-004015],Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government),This paper is based upon work supported by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (project ECO2011-23189).

Buyers learn from their own experiences about the effectiveness of the product. Individual learning generates ex post heterogeneity, which affects the buyers' purchasing decisions, the monopolist's pricing strategy, and efficiency. When learning occurs through good news signals, buyers receive a rent because of the possible advantageous belief caused by short-lived deviations. If a good news signal arrives, the price can instantaneously increase or decrease depending on the arrival time of this signal. The equilibrium is inefficient because the monopolist's incentive to exploit known buyers leads to inefficient early termination of exploration. When learning occurs through bad news signals, ex post heterogeneity has no such effect, since only homogeneous unknown buyers purchase the experience good. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fish consumption has positive health benefits but also brings higher risks of intake of heavy metals for humans. This increase in the demand for fish products has also been accompanied with fishing practices that threaten biodiversity. This article aims at evaluating from an economic perspective how important are these health and biodiversity components for those in the fish value chain, from fishermen to final consumers, using an experimental approach to estimate, through conjoint valuation techniques, the economic value of these aspects in the decision making of these agents. We find that final consumers place a significant economic value to the reduction of exposure to mercury contamination in fish; we also show that consumers respond positively to an education campaign showing the effects of mercury contained in fish, and that this money value could be used to create campaigns that transmit better price signals throughout the chain value. On the other extreme, the fishermen, we find that they place a positive economic value in a reduction of contamination in their fish as well, which could be aligned with the results for consumers, creating opportunities for Pareto improving measures in the regulations and prices which could translate into lower demand for more contaminated fish.","[Andres Garzon, Camilo; Juliana Sarmiento, Paula] Univ Los Andes, Econ, Bogota, Colombia; [Andres Garzon, Camilo] Univ Los Andes, Escuela Gobierno Alberto Lleras Camargo, Bogota, Colombia; [Catalina Rey, Maria] Univ Los Andes Bogota, Maestria Escuela Gobierno Alberto Lleras Camargo, Bogota, Colombia; [Camilo Cardenas, Juan] Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia",Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia); Universidad de los Andes (Colombia),"Cardenas, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Los Andes, Fac Econ, Bogota, Colombia.",ca.garzon972@uniandes.edu.co; mc.rey11@uniandes.edu.co; pj.sarmiento101@uniandes.edu.co; jccarden@uniandes.edu.co,"cardenas, juan-camilo/B-4658-2009","cardenas, juan-camilo/0000-0003-0005-7595; Rey-Guerra, Catalina/0000-0002-4751-3589",,,,,31,5,5,1,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1120-2890,1973-820X,,ECON POLIT-ITALY,Econ.

However, the Chinese authorities have so far acted with great caution because this transition cannot but accelerate the slowdown of China's growth which will likely occur because of other structural factors. We address these issues by means of a two-country two-stage (before and after the renminbi's full convertibility) model, which reproduces some qualitative features of China's growth pattern and its relationship with the United States. We analyse the extent to which altering the Chinese exchange rate regime, as well as other policies affecting sensitive social and economic issues, may impact on the short-, medium-and long-term evolution of the Chinese economy. The paper shows that by lifting the controls on the capital account and letting the currency float, the Chinese authorities will renounce those policy instruments for controlling the allocation of the national resources and the dynamics of China's economy.","[Fracasso, Andrea] Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy; [Fracasso, Andrea] Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy",University of Trento; University of Trento,"Fracasso, A (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Dept Econ & Management, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.;Fracasso, A (通讯作者)，Univ Trento, Sch Int Studies, Via Inama 5, I-38122 Trento, Italy.",andrea.fracasso@unitn.it,"Fracasso, Andrea/S-9532-2019","Fracasso, Andrea/0000-0003-1581-8481",Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University (Beijing); CAPS at the Seikei University (Tokyo); School of International Studies,Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University (Beijing); CAPS at the Seikei University (Tokyo); School of International Studies,"Luigi Bonatti thanks the Department of International Relations at Tsinghua University (Beijing) for its warm hospitality and financial support when the first draft of this paper was prepared.

We use country-level yearly panel data for more than ninety countries from 2000 through 2009. Our data contain information on Internet penetration, daily local and national print newspaper circulation, and the number of local and national print newspaper titles. Our results show that increases in Internet penetration can explain a large fraction of the recent decline in newspaper circulation and the number of newspaper titles. We also find that Internet adoption appears to affect the survival of local newspapers to a greater extent than for national newspapers. We argue that this might be due to local newspapers' greater reliance on classified advertising. Our results further suggest that Internet adoption decreases country-level circulation rates by driving newspapers out of business without significantly affecting the net circulation rates of surviving newspapers. Because newspaper readership has been linked to the health of the democratic system, the importance of examining the decline of the newspaper industry extends beyond the literature on the media industry.

To mitigate the impact of this trend and secure long-term financial sustainability, several countries have recently adopted notional defined contribution (NDC) schemes. In this paper, we show how to apply an NDC scheme to the public pension system of Korea, arguably the fastest ageing country. In particular, we create a new pension system by combining the current Korean pension scheme and an NDC. Through simulations it is shown that the proposed scheme can reduce the financial instability caused by the changes in demographic and economic factors, while retaining the income redistribution component. We further consider applying a German-type automatic balancing mechanism to the proposed scheme, by using the average income to determine the return rate of the fund, to make it sustainable in the long term.","[Choi, Jang Hoon] Korea Insurance Res Inst, Dept Social Safety & AgingResearch, Seoul, South Korea; [Kim, Joseph H.

In this article we use a dynamic nonlinear cointegrating approach to better understand trade factors relevant for European exporters in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) markets across industries. Results show that all trade determinants in our models, i.e. exchange rates, relative prices and foreign demand, are relevant for European exports to the BRICs, although their impact is heterogeneous across countries and industries. We then apply cluster analysis to group exports that respond similarly to changes, in major trade determinants in order to identify current bottlenecks and reveal opportunities for European exporters in the BRIC markets. We find that trade patterns are stable over time; there is an asymmetric response to exchange rate movements, and that three clusters, with distinct characteristics, comprise over 90% of European exports to the BRIC markets. Results shed some light on the drivers of European-BRICs trade and the way recent geo-political and economic developments in BRICs might affect European exports. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We take into account preference uncertainty, which generates a trade-off between flexibility and commitment provided by sin licenses. We also account for the possibility that consumers may trade the sin good in a secondary market, which partially erodes the commitment power of sin licenses. We show that if sophisticated consumers are allowed to choose any general, individualized pricing scheme for sin goods, they will choose a system of sin licenses. Nevertheless, sin licenses do not implement the social optimum in our general setting.

Second, export starters are more likely to add products and to change product shares in plants than never exporters. Third, added products tend to have higher product quality than dropped products. Therefore, our results imply that the entry to export markets plays an important role in product portfolio upgrading: the process of reallocation from lower-attribute to higher-attribute products.","[Ito, Keiko] Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan; [Hahn, Chin Hee] Gachon Univ, 1342 Seongnam Daero, Seongnam Si, Gyeonggi Do, South Korea; [Narjoko, Dionisius] Econ Res Inst ASEAN & East Asia ERIA, Sentral Senayan 2, 6th Floor,Jalan Asia Afrika 8, Senayan 10270, Jakarta Pusat, Indonesia",Gachon University; Economic Research Institute ASEAN & East Asia,"Ito, K (通讯作者)，Senshu Univ, Tama Ku, 2-1-1 Higashi Mita, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 2148580, Japan.",chhahn@gachon.ac.kr; keiko-i@isc.senshu-u.ac.jp; dion.narjoko@eria.org,"Ito, Keiko/AAA-6255-2019","Ito, Keiko/0000-0002-2162-2517",JSPS [23683003]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [23683003] Funding Source: KAKEN,"JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","Keiko Ito (corresponding author), Senshu University, 2-1-1 Higashi-mita, Tama-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 214-8580, Japan.

Solar geoengineering reduces temperatures without reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Climate tipping points are irreversible and uncertain events that can alter the dynamics of the climate system. We analyze three different rules related to the availability of solar geoengineering, and we model three distinct types of tipping points. Before reaching the tipping point, the introduction of solar geoengineering reduces the amount of mitigation, lowers temperatures and increases carbon concentrations. The capacity of solar geoengineering to deal with climate damages depends on the type of tipping point. Solar geoengineering is most effective at dealing with tipping points that affect the responsiveness of temperature to carbon, and it is least effective at dealing with tipping points that cause direct economic losses.

Based on a gravity-type equation estimated at firm-level, we find that export spillovers positively influence not only the decision of a nearby firm to start exporting, but also the volume of the exporting. Several methods are used to verify the robustness of these results. In addition, we find that the effect of export spillovers is stronger when it is product-destination-specific than that when it is either product or destination-specific alone, and also stronger than that is in general. Geographically, local export spillovers exhibit spatial decay in China: the effect is stronger for firms located in the same city than it is for firms outside the city. Small and multi-product firms are more likely to be influenced by the local export spillovers, and their impact is stronger for firms exporting complex goods and exporting to easy-entry countries. Moreover, the export spillovers from private firms are the strongest, followed by foreign invested firms with the effect generated by state-owned firms ranking last. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Unlike previous related studies that focus on low frequency data and GARCH volatility measures, we use recent intraday data to measure realised volatility and to investigate the instantaneous intraday linkages between different types and proxies of oil price and US$/euro volatilities. We specify the drivers of oil price volatility through a focus on extreme US$ exchange rate movements (intraday jumps). Accordingly, we find a negative relationship between the US dollar/euro and oil returns, indicating that a US$ appreciation decreases oil price. Second, we note the presence of a volatility spillover from the US exchange market to the oil market. Interestingly, this spillover effect seems to occur through intraday jumps that take place simultaneously in both markets. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We review the literature and, using data for English institutions in 2013-14, apply appropriate frontier methods to model the structure of costs in this diverse sector. In doing so, we uncover information about the returns to scale and scope within the higher education sector: in particular, the class of institutions comprising larger research-intensive universities and small specialist institutions could benefit from further concentrating postgraduate and research activity. We find that the universities comprising the English higher education sector are largely efficient (measured relative to observed practices) and that there is little scope for gains in technical efficiency from allocating resources on the basis of efficiency scores.","[Johnes, Geraint] Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England; [Johnes, Jill] Univ Huddersfield, Sch Business, Huddersfield, W Yorkshire, England",Lancaster University; University of Huddersfield,"Johnes, G (通讯作者)，Univ Lancaster, Lancaster LA1 4YW, England.",g.johnes@lancs.ac.uk; j.johnes@hud.ac.uk,"Johnes, Jill/AAB-2233-2020; Johnes, Geraint/G-3671-2013","Johnes, Jill/0000-0002-1607-1810; Johnes, Geraint/0000-0002-8148-0629",ESRC [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G020183/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,43,22,24,1,30,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

An implication is that even in cases where an industry is not particularly export-oriented through its reliance on the export of final goods, the industry may still be subject to potential effects-positive or negative-linked to changes in export demand.","[Kiyota, Kozo] Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan",,"Kiyota, K (通讯作者)，Keio Econ Observ, Minato Ku, 2-15-45 Mita, Tokyo 1088345, Japan.",kiyota@sanken.keio.ac.jp,,"Kiyota, Kozo/0000-0001-7649-9870","JSPS [26220503, 26285058]; MEXT; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [26220503, 26285058] Funding Source: KAKEN","JSPS(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science); MEXT(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","An earlier version of this paper was prepared under a consultancy for the OECD.

Yet relatively little is known about the extent to which education is causally linked to cancer incidence and mortality. This paper exploits a large social experiment where an education reform expanded compulsory schooling during the 1960s in Norway. The reform led to a discontinuous increase in educational attainment, which we exploit to estimate the effect of the reform on various cancer outcomes. We find little evidence that education affects overall cancer risk, as well as the most common cancer sites in isolation with two exceptions: The compulsory school reform lowered the risk of lung and prostate cancers for men. These protective effects are consistent with the idea that education reduced smoking behavior and increased the uptake of prostate cancer screening. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Higher death rates are consistently found to have a positive and statistically significant impact on health expenditures. While mental health and COPD are not generally found to impact expenditures, increases in the percentage of the population diagnosed with cholesterol and obesity tend to increase health expenditures. Increases in health expenditures slowed considerably after the financial crisis. Even though recessions (high unemployment rates) are generally found to have a positive impact on health expenditures, the post-financial crisis time period is estimated to have much lower health expenditures than in other time periods. Our results can be used to give insight into the conditions under which the slower rate of increase in health expenditures can be expected to increase. More research will be needed to be able to more completely explore not only the reasons for these changes in health expenditures but also whether they are likely to continue into the future.","[Olsen, Reed] Missouri State Univ, Econ, Springfield, MO USA; [Tseng, Hui-Kuan] Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA",Missouri State University; University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Charlotte,"Tseng, HK (通讯作者)，Univ North Carolina Charlotte, Econ, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA.",htseng@uncc.edu,,,,,,,21,1,2,1,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

In open economies, the consumption-smoothing current account process is related to the consumption behaviour of households. The effect on consumption choices and the current account is derived from the premise that households adjust their consumption expenditures according to the terms of trade. The process can be treated in an optimizing framework and originally was strictly connected to the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) and no restrictions to capital mobility. Both assumptions were successively relaxed and relationships allowing incorporation of the excess sensitivity hypothesis (ESH) and not perfect capital mobility have been introduced. Transformed into a VAR model with current account and national cash flow increments as endogenous variables, relevant conclusions are drawn on the basis of Granger causality, the equivalence of the current and predicted current account and an analysis of parameters of the model.

This paper investigates how hukou system reforms affect the skilled-unskilled wage inequality through the general equilibrium approach. In the basic model, we find that an increase in the strength of hukou system reforms will narrow down the wage inequality if the urban skilled sector is more capital intensive than the urban unskilled sector. In addition, we separately extend the basic model by introducing the endogenous minimum wage and an informal sector, and find that in these two extended cases the main results of the basic model will conditionally or unconditionally hold. When we consider some empirical evidences in China, our models predict that an increase in the strength of hukou system reforms will reduce the wage inequality. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We use geographical distance between non-resident parents and their children to test how such distance is related to educational and behavioral outcomes within a population sample of children from nonnuclear families in Denmark. As this distance is a choice, non-resident parents may choose where to live in part based on expected child outcomes; results that fail to take endogeneity into account will be biased. We use instrumental variable techniques to control for this potential endogeneity. The results indicate educational outcomes are somewhat better for all and behavioral outcomes are at least no worse for girls who live at a greater distance from their non-resident parent. Failing to control for endogeneity seems to bias the results for behavioral outcomes in favor of more proximate parents. Thus, policy efforts to keep separated parents geographically closer for the sake of their children may in fact not be advantageous.","[Rasmussen, Astrid Wurtz] Aarhus Univ, Fuglesangs Alle 4, DK-8210 Aarhus V, Denmark; [Stratton, Leslie S.] Virginia Commonwealth Univ, IZA, 301 W Main St,POB 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA",Aarhus University; Virginia Commonwealth University,"Stratton, LS (通讯作者)，Virginia Commonwealth Univ, IZA, 301 W Main St,POB 844000, Richmond, VA 23284 USA.",awr@econ.au.dk; lsstratt@vcu.edu,"Rasmussen, Astrid/ABF-4634-2020","Rasmussen, Astrid Wurtz/0000-0003-2540-4178",Danish Social Science Research Council,Danish Social Science Research Council,"Financial support from The Danish Social Science Research Council is gratefully acknowledged.

A frequent challenge in assembling an IO model or linking several such models is the absence of flow data with the same level of detail for all components. Such problems can be addressed using proportional allocation, which is a form of algebraic transformations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach whereby the IO system is viewed as a network, the topology of which is transformed with the addition of virtual nodes so that available empirical flow data can be mapped directly to existing links, with no additional estimation required, and no impact on results. As IO systems become increasingly disaggregated, and coupled to adjacent databases and models, the adaptability of IO frameworks becomes increasingly important. We show that topological transformations also offer large advantages in terms of transparency, modularity and increasingly importantly for global IO models, efficiency. We illustrate the results in the context of trade linking, multi-scale integration and other applications.","[Rodrigues, Joao; Marques, Alexandra; Tukker, Arnold] Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Leiden, Netherlands; [Wood, Richard] NTNU, Energy & Proc Technol Dept, Programme Ind Ecol, Trondheim, Norway",Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Norwegian University of Science & Technology (NTNU),"Rodrigues, J (通讯作者)，Leiden Univ, Inst Environm Sci CML, Leiden, Netherlands.",j.rodrigues@cml.leidenuniv.nl,"Rodrigues, João/GVU-7735-2022; Marques, Alexandra/A-9689-2013; Wood, Richard/E-4111-2015; Rodrigues, João/ISB-6671-2023; RODRIGUES, JOÃO/AAC-6993-2019; Tukker, Arnold/M-4596-2013","Marques, Alexandra/0000-0001-6669-1201; Wood, Richard/0000-0002-7906-3324; Tukker, Arnold/0000-0002-8229-2929",,,,,43,18,21,0,22,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

Abortion rights, in contrast, were mainly shown to affect women in the low ability group, with their plans shifting toward careers associated with lower income and lower prestige scores.

Despite its policy relevance to social security sustainability, the question has not yet been empirically addressed in the European context We combine data from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and cover sixteen European countries, representative of different institutional settings, in the years spanning from 2002 to 2013. The empirical strategy builds on the availability of an extremely rich set of health and labour market information as well as of panel data. To remove the potential confounding bias, a selection on observables strategy is adopted, while the longitudinal dimension of data allows controlling for time invariant unobservables. Implementation is based on a combination of stratification and propensity score matching methods. Results reveal that experiencing an acute health shock on average doubles the risk of an older worker leaving the labour market, and is accompanied by a deterioration in physical functioning and mental health, as well as by a reduction in perceived life expectancy. Men's labour market response appears driven by the onset of impairment acting as a barrier to work. In the case of women, preferences for leisure and financial constraints seem to play a prominent role.

Using a multiple linear regression model with cross-sectional information from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, the Indices of Social Development, the World Values Survey, the Hofstede Centre, the United Nations Development Programme and World Development Indicators, we find that social progress orientation dimensions such as voluntary spirit, survival vs. self-expression values and power distance were related to entrepreneurial activity. More specifically, the main findings demonstrate that high voluntary spirit had a positive and statistically significant impact on innovative early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA). In addition, necessity-driven TEA is highly discouraged in those societies with high voluntary spirit and self-expression values, whereas larger power distance increased the entrepreneurial activity driven by necessity. Based on these results, this study advances the literature by introducing and analyzing the concept of social progress orientation, by examining the factors that influence innovative entrepreneurial activity in light of an institutional approach. Also, this research could be useful for designing policies to foster entrepreneurial activity in different national and regional environments.","[Urbano, David; Aparicio, Sebastian; Querol, Victor] Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Barcelona, Spain; [Aparicio, Sebastian] Fdn ECSIM, Medellin, Colombia",Autonomous University of Barcelona,"Urbano, D (通讯作者)，Univ Autonoma Barcelona, Dept Business, Barcelona, Spain.",david.urbano@uab.cat,"Peter, Serin/ITR-8938-2023; Urbano, David/B-6879-2009; Aparicio, Sebastian/D-4106-2015; Urbano, David/GLQ-6309-2022; PENG, Xiao-bao/J-4466-2012","Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656; Aparicio, Sebastian/0000-0003-1121-5667; Urbano, David/0000-0001-7600-8656;",Spanish Ministry of Economy AMP; Competitiveness [ECO2013-44027-P]; Economy AMP; Knowledge Department -Catalan Government [2014-SGR-1626]; COLCIENCIAS Ph.D. Programme chapter 3 [617/2013]; Enlaza Mundos Municipio de Medellin; Fundacion ECSIM,"Spanish Ministry of Economy AMP; Competitiveness; Economy AMP; Knowledge Department -Catalan Government; COLCIENCIAS Ph.D. Programme chapter 3(Departamento Administrativo de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Innovacion Colciencias); Enlaza Mundos Municipio de Medellin; Fundacion ECSIM","The authors appreciate helpful comments by Professor Uwe Cantner and anonymous reviewers in the previous versions of this manuscript.

Using the capital income tax to implement such a policy leads to welfare gains; the consumption tax, a very small welfare gain; and the labor income tax, a welfare loss.

We augmented the convergence model with contemporaneous spatial dependence in house prices and found that price convergence and positive spatial spillover are both present. We explicitly addressed the endogeneity problem by introducing a Bayesian instrumental variable setup, which was estimated with particle filtering techniques. From a growth poles perspective, the empirical evidence indicates that the spread effect in regional house prices outweighs the backwash effect. The identified positive spatial spillover has two effects on the growth of house prices in Chinese cities. First, the spillover elevates the trajectories of the steady-state growth paths of house prices. Second, the spillover narrows the gaps between the growth paths of house prices in neighbouring cities. Shocks to the socio-economic variables of a city generate their own effects on domestic house prices that dominate the effects arising from cross-city price feedbacks, thus mitigating the prospect of level convergence. Our findings also suggest a collaborating role between time and spatial dependence parameters. The identification of inter-city spillover, which is a conditioning factor for regional house price convergence, offers implications to policies that are most likely to be effective in reducing regional disparity.","[Chow, William W.] Cent Govt Offices, Financial Secretarys Off, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Fung, Michael K.; Cheng, Arnold C.

This orthodox economic prescription aims to reduce incentives to poach endangered wildlife by driving down the market price of their products via auctioned stockpile releases. Biologists are clear, however, that securing a stockpile for some species needs biological success in captive breeding programmes (CBPs), which varies markedly across species and habitats. Rhinoceros herds in a CBP would need spatially extensive terrain and costly permanent security measures; this only appears feasible for the less aggressive 'white' rhino. We argue that the market price would actually need to be sustained at a high level to cover protection costs over the longer reproduction cycles in CBPs and that, without extensive monitoring and the correct institutional structures being in place, legalising trade may encourage, rather than prevent, poaching. Supplementary policy measures that differentiate among consumer groups would also likely prove necessary.","[Collins, Alan; Fraser, Gavin; Snowball, Jen] Rhodes Univ, Grahamstown, South Africa; [Collins, Alan] Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Hants, England",Rhodes University; University of Portsmouth,"Collins, A (通讯作者)，Univ Portsmouth, Portsmouth Business Sch, Econ & Finance, Richmond Bldg,Portland St, Portsmouth PO1 3DE, Hants, England.",alan.collins@port.ac.uk,"Collins, Alan Oscar Michael/AAF-2751-2019; Fraser, Gavin/R-9525-2019; Snowball, Jen/D-8887-2017","Collins, Alan Oscar Michael/0000-0001-9805-9091; Snowball, Jen/0000-0001-7497-6653",,,,,49,14,15,1,80,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0309-166X,1464-3545,,CAMB J ECON,Cambr.

At the same time, debt leverage stands as a key variable in the design of a control contract as it has a strong disciplinary role. A simple option valuation model is used to show that debt is also a governance variable because it can moderate or enhance private benefits. It is argued that an asymmetrical self-regulation mechanism may develop in the case of control by a dominant shareholder. The joint questions of control, private benefits, and debt levels are linked within an inside corporate governance framework. At low levels of leverage, debt is relatively less disciplinary compared with a non-private benefits case. When leverage exceeds a threshold point, it becomes strongly disciplinary. We show that under given conditions, a self-regulation mechanism develops where the controlling shareholder is incentivized to hold less debt when he/she wants to increase his/her private appropriation rate.

Hence daily observations of hourly prices take the form of a periodic panel rather than a time series of hourly observations. We consider novel panel data approaches to analyse the time series and the cross-sectional dependence of hourly Nord Pool electricity spot prices and loads for the period 2000-2013. Hourly electricity prices and load data are characterized by strong serial long-range dependence in the time series dimension in addition to strong seasonal periodicity, and along the cross-sectional dimension, i.e. the hours of the day, there is a strong dependence which necessarily has to be accounted for in order to avoid spurious inference when focusing on the time series dependence alone. The long-range dependence is modelled in terms of a fractionally integrated panel data model and it is shown that both prices and loads consist of common factors with long memory and with loadings that vary considerably during the day. Due to the competitiveness of the Nordic power market the aggregate supply curve approximates well the marginal costs of the underlying production technology and because the demand is more volatile than the supply, equilibrium prices and loads are argued to identify the periodic power supply curve.

Most of them are undergoing reforms in order to adapt to the new demographic reality. The package of reforms implemented includes increasing the retirement age, reducing the replacement rate, or introducing a sustainability factor linking pension to life expectancy. The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential consequences of a different type of reform that is at a very incipient stage in Spain but that could have a significant impact if it were fully implemented. This reform, called 'silent reform' because it is imperceptible to citizens in its early stages, basically consists in increasing maximum pensions in line with inflation instead of wage or productivity growth. This policy is reducing the replacement rate only for high earning workers and increasing the redistributive component of the system. This paper is the first to quantify and evaluate the potential consequences of this type of reform in Spain. We have used an accounting model with heterogeneous agents and overlapping generations in order to project pension expenditure for the next six decades. The results show that this type of reform could potentially contain future expenditure but at the cost of changing the nature of the pension system from a contributory or Bismarckian-type system into a pure redistributive pension system or Beveridgean-type one.","[Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, J.] Univ Complutense Madrid, C Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain; [Ignacio Conde-Ruiz, J.] FEDEA, C Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain; [Gonzalez, Clara I.] Banco Espana, C Alcala 48, Madrid 28014, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; Banco de Espana,"Conde-Ruiz, JI (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, C Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain.;Conde-Ruiz, JI (通讯作者)，FEDEA, C Jorge Juan 46, Madrid 28001, Spain.",nacho.conderuiz@gmail.com; gonzalez.claraisabel@gmail.com,"Conde-Ruiz, Jose Igancio/L-6523-2014; Gonzalez, Clara I./ABA-2323-2021","Gonzalez, Clara I./0000-0003-0091-9765",Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2014-59491-P],Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),"The research on which this article is based won a Second Prize at the 2011 FIPROS Awards (TIN/731/2011).

Warren Buffett Companies that have sustainable competitive advantages should be able to create a barrier (Moat) to prevent or lessen competition from other firms. The wider the Moat the greater the barrier and the more secure the company's profitability. Using the Morningstar classification of Wide Moat' stocks, we construct annually rebalanced equal- and value-weighted portfolios to analyse their performance in order to determine if they deliver superior performance relative to standard benchmark portfolios. The period for our analysis extends from June 2002 through May 2014. We find that the Wide Moat' portfolios outperform both the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indices generating higher average monthly and annualized returns, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Treynor Ratio, Omega Ratio, Upside Potential Ratio, M-2, M-2 Alpha, and cumulative returns. When we compute alpha using Carhart four-factor and Fama-French five-factor models, we find that Wide Moat' portfolios had significantly positive risk-adjusted alphas with both the models. Wide Moat' portfolios also lost less value during the 2007-2009 financial crisis compared to both S&P 500 and Russell 3000. In conclusion, we find that Wide Moat' stocks have created significant value for their investors over the course of our study.","[Kanuri, Srinidhi] Univ Southern Mississippi, Dept Finance Real Estate & Business Law, Coll Business, Hattiesburg, MS USA; [McLeod, Robert W.] Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA",University of Southern Mississippi; University of Alabama System; University of Alabama Tuscaloosa,"McLeod, RW (通讯作者)，Univ Alabama, Dept Econ Finance & Legal Studies, Culverhouse Coll Commerce, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487 USA.",rmcleod@cba.ua.edu,"McLeod, Robert/Y-4011-2019",,,,,,25,9,11,0,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

While incomplete contracts typically rule out direct control of workers' effort, many employers hope to increase productivity through 'soft' control, by restricting the private use of internet at work. In a lab experiment with real effort, we investigate how the temptation of the internet and a manager's decision whether to restrict workers' access to it affect the morale of workers. When tempted by internet access, workers reciprocate fair wages less than without access. Nevertheless, a manager's decision to actively grant inter net access might increase workers' effort: we find that highly reciprocal workers perceive the autonomy such a policy gives as a gift which they reciprocate with high effort despite the temptation of the internet. For less reciprocal workers the temptation aspect dominates and restricting internet access is better for the manager. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Governments rely on rural elites to control rural regions, guaranteeing them a degree of authority and revenue in return. This paper provides a model to analyze the forging of such alliances. Without cooperation between the national government and rural elite, the power of the two competing authorities to compel farmers' obedience determines the revenue of the government extracted from cash crop production. Hence, with a powerful rural elite, the national government has a weak bargaining position and agrees to a large transfer to the rural elite. Furthermore, the government's capacity to compel rural residents' obedience is endogenously determined by the level of cash crop production and the power of rural elites. Because indirect colonial rule is a significant source of the elite control over residents in rural areas, cross-regional variations in colonial policies lead to various forms of postcolonial alliances between African national governments and rural elites.

Communal benefits and costs of each individual depend on her identity and the composition of the community which she belongs to. Since the framework is too general to yield an existence of Nash equilibrium, we introduce the essentiality of membership in one of the communities for all individuals. We highlight the Border Indifference Property (BIP), when all individuals located on a border between two adjacent jurisdictions are indifferent about joining either of them and show that BIP is a necessary condition for yielding a Nash equilibrium. We invoke the celebrated Gale-Nikaido-Debreu Lemma to guarantee the existence of a partition that satisfies BIP. We then proceed to demonstrate that BIP is not sufficient to yield a Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium existence under BIP is rescued when we use the Milgrom Shannon monotone comparative statics conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An inefficient market commonly implies return predictability and the existence of profitable opportunities for traders and speculators. Technical analysis has been a popular tool to identify predictable patterns in asset prices. The usefulness of a large universe of technical trading rules popularized in the existing literature on technical analysis is tested when they are applied to a set of equity markets that are generally considered developed and efficient during the two most recent periods of major financial turmoil: the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 2008 global financial crisis. Three major statistical deficiencies that existing studies on return predictability are commonly criticized for - data snooping bias, nonsynchronicity bias and transaction costs - have been incorporated in the analysis. Technical trading rules are largely unable to yield abnormal excess returns over the passive benchmark after data snooping bias, nonsynchronous pricing and transaction costs are accounted for. Chaotic price movements typical for a volatile market during a financial crisis are likely to have an adverse effect on the performance of active trend chasing trading strategies.","[Shynkevich, Andrei] Kent State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Salem; Kent State University Kent,"Shynkevich, A (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Dept Finance, Coll Business Adm, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",ashynkev@kent.edu,,,,,,,6,4,5,1,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Using a standard multicountry trade model, we measure openness by a country's potential welfare gain from moving to a world with frictionless trade. In this model, a country's trade potential depends on only the trade elasticity and two observable statistics: the country's home trade share and its income level. Quantitatively, poor countries have greater potential gains from trade relative to rich countries, while their welfare costs of autarky are similar. This leads us to infer that rich countries are more open to trade. Our trade potential index correlates strongly with estimates of trade costs, while both the welfare cost of autarky and the volume of trade correlate weakly with trade costs. Thus, our measure of openness is informative about the underlying trade frictions.

Our results show that, while the SARIMA model is superior relative to other linear and nonlinear models, as it tends to produce smaller forecast errors; statistically, these forecasting gains are not significant relative to higher-order AR and nonlinear models, though simple benchmarks like the RW and AR(1) models are statistically outperformed.

First, we do not find a relationship for all the states between the annual average rate of growth and changes in the poverty rate, either using the alimentary or the patrimony poverty line, during the period between 2000 and 2012. This means that the gains from economic growth have not translated into reductions in poverty. Secondly, by comparing annual changes by quarter for the period 2005-2014, it is possible to observe that only for a few states, economic growth has led to reductions in poverty. At the national level, this implies that the elasticity of poverty with respect to growth is close to the unit. Third, we find that economic growth is related with a larger number of formal employments but not with better wages.","[Campos Vazquez, Raymundo M.] Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico",Colegio de Mexico,"Vázquez, RMC (通讯作者)，Colegio Mexico, Ctr Estudios Econ, Mexico City, DF, Mexico.",rmcampos@colmex.mx,"Monroy-Gomez-Franco, Luis/JJD-3871-2023",,,,,,43,1,1,3,31,"UNIV NACIONAL AUTONOMA MEXICO, FAC ECONOMIA",MEXICO,"CIRCUITO INTERIOR S-N EDIFICIO B, PRIMER PISO, CIUDAD UNIV, MEXICO, DISTRITO FEDERAL 04510, MEXICO",0185-1667,,,INVEST ECON-MEX,Investig.

A threshold regression is used to assess potential nonlinear relationships between macroeconomic variables and presidential popularity. A quarterly data analysis for the 1960Q1-2012Q2 time period reveals that domestic factors prevail in shaping presidential approval. Most compelling is evidence of a threshold relationship involving economic conditions: When unemployment is slightly over 7%, its decline impacts significantly and favourably on presidential approval, an effect that virtually disappears below the threshold value. Change in consumer sentiment affects presidential approval in a limited way, while inflation shows no association at all.

It finds that shifts in aid dependency are frequent and have significant fiscal effects in developing countries. In addition to the traditional evidences of tax and investment displacement and aid illusion,' we show that upward shifts and downward shifts in aid dependency have asymmetric effects on fiscal accounts in developing countries. Large aid inflows undermine tax capacity and public investment while large reductions in aid inflows tend to keep recipients' fiscal behaviour intact. Moreover, the tax displacement effect tends to be temporary while the impacts on expenditure items tend to last.

Further, I consider how welfare-maximizing tax rates change as patent protection becomes stronger, as seen in many countries. The results show that as patent protection becomes stronger, the corporate income tax rate should be higher and the consumption tax rate should be lower. This implies that under stronger patent protection, recovering production at the expense of innovation by raising corporate income tax and reducing consumption tax improves welfare.","[Iwaisako, Tatsuro] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Osaka University,"Iwaisako, T (通讯作者)，Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, 1-7 Machikaneyama, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan.",iwaisako@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,"Iwaisako, Tatsuro/AAD-7103-2019","Iwaisako, Tatsuro/0000-0003-2285-4456","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology [25780134, 23000001]; Global Center of Excellence program at Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research [25780134] Funding Source: KAKEN","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)); Global Center of Excellence program at Osaka University; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI))","The author would like to thank Yuichi Furukawa, Tetsugen Haruyama, Kenichi Hashimoto, Makoto Hirazawa, Katsuhiko Hori, Banri Ito, Kimiyoshi Kamata, Taketo Kawagishi, Yuki Saito, Koki Sugawara, Kizuku Takao, Yasuhiro Takarada, Hitoshi Tanaka, Yoshihiro Tomaru, and Ryuhei Wakasugi, and seminar participants at Chukyo University, Kobe University, Tezukayama University, and Yokohama National University for their helpful comments on this article.

Owing to the existence of significant international trade links in the automotive sector, there is also a strong theoretical foundation for cross-border effects of such scrappage programmes. This paper explores spillovers of the German scheme to the Czech economy on the basis of a close mutual trade link between these two countries and the size of the Czech automotive sector. It is demonstrated that the German programme provided for a significant boost for Czech personal car exports, which were also coupled with increased imports due to large import requirements of the Czech automotive segment. Overall, the contribution of first-round effects of the German car scrapping scheme to the Czech real GDP growth in 2009 is estimated to have reached between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points.","[Malecek, Petr] Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Prague, Czech Republic; [Melcher, Ota] Univ Econ, Fac Int Relat, Prague, Czech Republic",Prague University of Economics & Business; Prague University of Economics & Business,"Malecek, P (通讯作者)，Univ Econ, Fac Econ, Prague, Czech Republic.",petrxmalecek@gmail.com; ota.melcher@vse.cz,,,,,,,25,2,2,0,8,UNIV ECONOMICS-PRAGUE,PRAGUE 3,"OECONOMICA PUBL, NAM W CHIRCHILLA 4, PRAGUE 3, CZ-130 67, CZECH REPUBLIC",1210-0455,2336-730X,,PRAGUE ECON PAP,Prague Econ.

It starts with a description of recent initiatives to scale up infrastructure investment in Africa. The article then uses insights from the literature on informed versus arm's-length debt to discuss the structure of infrastructure financing. Considering the differences in investors' preferences that Africa faces, the article argues that continent's success to fill its greenfield and hence risky infrastructure gap hinges upon a delicate balancing act between development banking and institutional long-term investment. In the first phase, development banks, which have both the flexibility and expertise, should help finance the riskier phases of large greenfield infrastructure projects. In the second phase, development banks should disengage and offload their mature brownfield projects to pave the way for a viable engagement of long-term institutional investors such as sovereign wealth funds. In order to promote an Africa-wide infrastructure bond markets where the latter could play a critical role, the enhancement of Africa's legal and regulatory framework should however start now.","[Arezki, Rabah] Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA; [Sy, Amadou] Brookings Inst, Washington, DC 20036 USA",International Monetary Fund; Brookings Institution,"Arezki, R (通讯作者)，Int Monetary Fund, Res Dept, Washington, DC 20431 USA.",RArezki@imf.org,,,"AERC at the AERC Biannual Research Workshop, Arusha, Tanzania","AERC at the AERC Biannual Research Workshop, Arusha, Tanzania","The authors are grateful to the AERC for providing financial support for the preparation and presentation of this article at the AERC Biannual Research Workshop, Arusha, Tanzania, June 2015.",,28,4,4,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

The First World War constitutes an exogenous shock to living standards since the duration and intensity of the war exceeded all expectations. We assess the ability of Protestant and Catholic communities to cope with increasing food prices and wartime black markets. Literature based on Weber (1904, 1905) suggests that Protestants must be more resilient than their Catholic peers. Using individual height data on some 2,800 Germans to assess levels of malnutrition during the war, we find that living standards for both Protestants and Catholics declined; however, the decrease of Catholics' height was disproportionately large. Our empirical analysis finds a large statistically significant difference between Protestants and Catholics for the 1915-19 birth cohort, and we argue that this height gap cannot be attributed to socioeconomic background and fertility alone.","[Blum, Matthias] Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Strebel, Matthias] Tech Univ Munich, Wissensch Zentrum Weihenstephan, Freising Weihenstephan, Germany",Queens University Belfast; Technical University of Munich,"Blum, M (通讯作者)，Queens Univ Belfast, Queens Management Sch, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland.",matthias.blum@qub.ac.uk; matthias.strebel@mytum.de,,"Blum, Matthias/0000-0003-4129-9873",,,,,67,1,2,0,13,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In their place, economists have singled out financial and uncertainty shocks as potentially important drivers of economic fluctuations. Empirically distinguishing between these two types of shocks, however, is difficult because increases in economic uncertainty are strongly associated with a widening of credit spreads, an indication of a tightening in financial conditions. This paper uses the penalty function approach within the SVAR framework to examine the interaction between financial conditions and economic uncertainty and to trace out the impact of these two types of shocks on the economy. The results indicate that (1) financial shocks have a significant adverse effect on economic outcomes and that such shocks were an important source of cyclical fluctuations since the mid-1980s; (2) uncertainty shocks, especially those implied by uncertainty proxies that do not rely on financial asset prices, are also an important source of macroeconomic disturbances; and (3) uncertainty shocks have an especially negative economic impact in situations where they elicit a concomitant tightening of financial conditions. Evidence suggests that the Great Recession was likely an acute manifestation of the toxic interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks.

As a consequence the income of rural populations will change, and with it the incentives for people to remain in rural areas. Using data from 115 countries between 1960 and 2000, we analyze the effect of differential warming trends across countries on the probability of either migrating out of the country or from rural to urban areas. We find that higher temperatures in middle-income economies increased migration rates to urban areas and to other countries. In poor countries, higher temperatures reduced the probability of migration to cities and to other countries, consistently with the presence of severe liquidity constraints. In middle-income countries, migration represents an important margin of adjustment to global warming, potentially contributing to structural change and even increasing income per worker. Such a mechanism, however, does not seem to work in poor economies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we generalize the original airport problem by imposing capacity constraints to consider the situation when one airstrip cannot serve all airplanes and investigate how to share the cost among airplanes. We introduce the sequential equal contributions rule for our problem and show that it coincides with the Shapley value of the corresponding airport game when the worth of a coalition is defined to be the minimum cost of serving all members of the coalition. The sequential equal contributions rule requires each airplane to contribute equally to the cost of a given section of any airstrip as long as the length of the section is less than or equal to its desired length even though the airplane cannot use the airstrip. Each airplane's contribution is the sum of terms, one for each section of the airstrip whose length is less than or equal to its desired length. We also present an axiomatic characterization of the rule by imposing the axioms of efficiency, the equal share lower bound, smaller-cost monotonicity, and population fairness.","[Chun, Youngsub] Seoul Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 08826, South Korea; [Park, Boram] Ajou Univ, Dept Math, Suwon 16499, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU); Ajou University,"Park, B (通讯作者)，Ajou Univ, Dept Math, Suwon 16499, South Korea.",ychun@snu.ac.kr; borampark@ajou.ac.kr,,,"National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2013S1A3A2055391]; Institute of Economic Research of Seoul National University; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning [NRF-2015R1C1A1A01053495]","National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government; Institute of Economic Research of Seoul National University; Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","We are grateful to William Thomson, an associate editor, and three referees for their comments.

I show that optimal cooperative fiscal policies consist in more than just stabilizing output gaps: policy makers can increase welfare by responding to sub-optimal intra-union imbalances. Numerical analysis reveals that if traded goods are little substitutable, optimal cooperative fiscal policies consist in setting government spending in each country so as to reduce intra-union imbalances, potentially at the expense of higher output gaps. Optimal fiscal policies reduce the welfare losses from business cycle fluctuations considerably. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We find evidence that product unit values vary with standard gravity variables in a different manner across sectors of the Chinese economy and run contrary to earlier findings for the USA. These results are not compatible with existing heterogeneous firm trade models with constant mark-up and the extension to include product quality. We construct a heterogeneous firm trade model with quality differences and spatial price discrimination, and show that the model provides plausible explanations for our empirical finds as well as other existing findings in the literature.","[Kneller, Richard; Yu, Zhihong] Univ Nottingham, Globalisat & Econ Policy Ctr GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England; [Kneller, Richard; Yu, Zhihong] Univ Munich, CESifo Ctr Econ Studies, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany; [Kneller, Richard; Yu, Zhihong] Univ Munich, Leibnitz Inst Econ Res, Marchioninistr 15, D-81377 Munich, Germany",University of Nottingham; University of Munich; Ifo Institut; University of Munich; Ifo Institut,"Kneller, R (通讯作者)，Univ Nottingham, Globalisat & Econ Policy Ctr GEP, Sir Clive Granger Bldg,Univ Pk, Nottingham NG7 2RD, England.",richard.kneller@nottingham.ac.uk,,"Yu, Zhihong/0000-0003-1533-3732; Kneller, Richard/0000-0002-4542-5358",Leverhulme Trust [F114/BF],Leverhulme Trust(Leverhulme Trust),"The authors are also affiliated to CESifo (the Center for Economic Studies and Leibnitz Institute for Economic Research at the University of Munich).

Therefore, it is crucial that policy makers concerned about it consider a variety of possible futures and not only the one that is perceived as the most likely. In particular, they should account for the possibility of sudden shocks in their decisions with the goal of making the system more robust. However, long-term power system models which are an important pillar of policy decision making are typically designed to determine the cost-minimal power system for a specific expected future; such a system is not necessarily the most robust one. By combining the classic investment optimization approach with the tools of Robust Decision Making we analyze the viability of different strategies that may potentially increase the robustness of a power system. For the case of the European power system we pursue a dedicated analysis with the European power system model LIMES-EU. Based on a total of more than 40,000 model runs, we find that strategies promoting the ability of countries to always produce at least 95% of their electricity demand domestically significantly help to reduce the loss of load in case of shocks. Such a strategy is not cost-optimal for the expected future without shocks; but the additional costs (about 0.1% of total system costs) are low compared to the benefits of significantly increasing the power system's robustness.

Further, the paper analyses the equilibrium dynamics of a variant of the model under various exogenous shocks, most prominently, idiosyncratic shocks to cover diverging developments of the different regions of an MU. A numerical analysis of the parameter calibration for saddlepath-stable behaviour is provided.

Leverage by the corporate sector has increased significantly since the financial deregulation of the mid-1980s. Empirical evidence shows that slow recoveries are associated with a significant drop in the growth rates of investment and bank loans, and with a surge in the growth rates of corporate bonds.

(i) Global financial risk shocks have significant effects on government bond yields, equity prices, CDS spreads, and exchange rates in the Fragile Five. (ii) The effects differ considerably across the fragile countries and the assets. (iii) These country differentiations are strongly related to macroeconomic fundamentals. Finally, (iv) global financial risk shocks have a greater immediate effect on local currency government bond and CDS markets than on FX and stock markets. (C) 2016 The Author.

ECM has two novel features: first, to reduce the cost of iteration on Bellman equation, ECM constructs policy functions using envelope conditions which are simpler to analyze numerically than first-order conditions. Second, to increase the accuracy of solutions, ECM solves for derivatives of value function jointly with value function itself. We complement ECM with other computational techniques that are suitable for high-dimensional problems, such as simulation-based grids, monomial integration rules and derivative-free solvers. The resulting value-iterative ECM method can accurately solve models with at least up to 20 state variables and can successfully compete in accuracy and speed with state-of-the-art Euler equation methods. We also use ECM to solve a challenging default risk model with a kink in value and policy functions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Calibrating and estimating a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model of Indonesia, we show that most of Indonesia's growth over the last decade has been driven by supply factors, especially rising multi-factor productivity (MFP) as Indonesia reaped the benefits of post-Asian-crisis structural reforms. The pace of multi-factor productivity growth has slowed since 2010, however, a decelerating trend reinforced by slower world growth. A series of interest rate cuts has successfully managed to offset some of those headwinds. However, absent further structural reforms to revive productivity growth, supportive monetary policy will not be sufficient to sustain long-term growth and poses inflation risks.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the factors affecting the well-being of Australian residents, and to examine whether the wellbeing of Australians born overseas is different from that of native-born Australians, with a special emphasis on the financial aspect of immigrants' well-being. Well-being in this study is defined by the respondents' own assessments of their satisfaction with life and financial well-being is measured by both objective and subjective measures. This analysis was carried out using data from the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants in Australia (LSIA) and the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA). The findings indicate that although initially lower, immigrants' life satisfaction tends to increase within 20 years in Australia to become equal to that of Australian-born residents. Lower life satisfaction of recent immigrants can be partially attributed to the lack of improvement in their relative financial status after migration, despite them having less difficulties with timely payments of basic bills than native-born residents. Cultural shock experienced by new settlers can also negatively. affect their well-being.

We incorporate an Expectation-Maximization algorithm for parameter estimation of the MMGARCH and find different structures in volatility level as well as shock persistence. MMGARCH is also able to cover asymmetric and long memory effects. Furthermore, a dissimilar memory structure in variance of WTI and Brent crude oil prices is observed which is supported by additional tests. Parameter estimation and comparison of the models reveal significant long memory and asymmetry in oil price returns. In regard of variance forecasting and Value-at-Risk prediction, it is shown that MMGARCH outperforms the aforementioned models due to its dynamic approach in varying the volatility level and memory of the process. We find MMGARCH superior for application in risk management as a result of its flexibility in adjusting to variance shifts and shocks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study explores the extent to which sanctions increase the likelihood of discriminatory government practices against one of the globally most vulnerable groups, ethnic groups. It is argued that sanctions contribute to the rise of official ethnic-based economic and political discrimination through contracting the economy and creating incentives for the target government to employ ethnic-based discriminatory policies. Using data on over 900 ethnic groups from 1950 to 2003, the results lend support for the theoretical claim that sanctions prompt the government to pursue ethnic-based discriminatory economic and political practices in multiethnic countries. The findings also indicate that multilateral sanctions are likely to be more harmful to the well-being of ethnic groups than sanctions levied by individual countries. Further, the negative effect of comprehensive sanctions appears to be greater than that of sanctions with moderate and limited impact on the target economy. The regime type of the target state, on the other hand, appears to have a significant role only in conditioning the hypothesized effect of sanctions on economic discrimination. Overall, this study's focus on a vulnerable segment of the target society - ethnic groups - offers a greater understanding of the consequences of sanctions. It also provides additional insight as to how, in multiethnic countries, political elites might domestically respond to external pressures to retain power.","[Peksen, Dursun] Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Clement Hall 437, Memphis, TN 38152 USA",University of Memphis,"Peksen, D (通讯作者)，Univ Memphis, Dept Polit Sci, Clement Hall 437, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.",dpeksen@memphis.edu,,,,,,,61,17,18,1,26,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1024-2694,1476-8267,,DEFENCE PEACE ECON,Def.

We also identify significant differences in the sources of labour wedge fluctuations across the considered economies. Overall, we find that the labour wedge movements and hence the welfare costs of business cycle fluctuations in Poland are connected with inefficient functioning of the labour market.

The best-fitting IGARCH(1,1)-t model that accounted for the day-of-week, seasonality and stock levels was used to measure the report effects on daily nearby cotton close-to-close futures returns. Prospective Plantings and WASDE reports appeared to be the most important sources of information in the cotton markets moving the conditional standard deviation of returns by an average of 14.4 and 9.6 percentage points, respectively. However, significant market reaction was not found for the other three reports.

Several studies have shown the presence of paradoxically high SI correlations for the developed countries with observed high IMC, and low SI correlations for the developing countries with observed low IMC. The studies accounting for structural breaks in model parameters provide dominant support for the decrease in SI correlations and increase in IMC after the switch from fixed to flexible exchange rate regime and the removal of policy restrictions on capital flows. The intertemporal optimisation approach to current account and the open-economy growth and dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models mainly provide theoretical predictions and suggest that it is possible to find high SI correlations in the wake of high IMC. The increases in international capital flows have been the natural corollary of the growth of international trade in goods and services and increases in foreign direct investment flows. It is these factors, rather than international trade in capital market securities (bonds and equities) driven by the diversification benefits of financial portfolios per se, that have been the key levers of international financial flows.","[Singh, Tarlok] Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia",Griffith University,"Singh, T (通讯作者)，Griffith Univ, Griffith Business Sch, Dept Accounting Finance & Econ, Brisbane, Qld 4111, Australia.",Tarlok.Singh@griffith.edu.au,,,,,,,223,15,15,0,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0963-8199,1469-9559,,J INT TRADE ECON DEV,J.

The conclusion is that even though there is a significant reduction in the welfare loss estimations in comparison to the other research, this does not demerit the need to strengthen competition policy.

Little is known, however, about how and whether such rules emerge endogenously in groups of potentially affected subjects. We experimentally investigate whether subjects vote for affirmative action rules, against, or abstain. If approved by the vote, a quota rule is implemented that favors women in one treatment, but members of an artificially created group based on random color assignment in another treatment. We find that quota rules based on gender are implemented frequently and do not affect the performance of men and women in a contest. Quota rules based on an arbitrary criterion, however, are less often approved and lead to strong individual reactions of advantaged and disadvantaged group members and to efficiency losses. These results show that the effects of affirmative action policies largely depend on whether these policies are viewed favorably within the affected groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This article investigates empirically how bilateral real exchange rate fluctuations influence international migration flows. To do so, we build a dataset of 30 OECD destination countries and 165 origin countries over the period 1980-2011 and estimate an equation derived from a micro-founded random utility maximization model that allows for unobserved heterogeneity between migrants and non-migrants.

Such a deviation can be optimal even if the input supplier can engage in price discrimination and can condition its input prices on the individual products that the firm manufactures. (ii) An outsourcing wave can arise in that concurrently outsourcing all inputs can be profitable for the firm even though outsourcing each input individually is unprofitable. (iii) More competition on the supplier market can decrease the multi-input multi -product firm's profit. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Assuming that the main components of effective governance are running satisfactory public health programmes aimed at decreasing overall mortality among the working-age population, creating fair labour market conditions and improving the regional institutional climate to encourage investment in fixed assets, we argue that sub-national institutions remain important for growth in post-Soviet Russia after 2000.

Such volatility is likely to be even more pronounced in initial public offering (IPO) markets where retail investors exert significant influence. I consider initial return volatility for IPOs pitched in Hong Kong, where the market organizer requires a sizeable fraction of shares on offer to be assigned to a retail subscription tranche. Within this context, I examine the pattern and determinants of IPO stocks' initial return volatility levels over their first 30days of seasoning'. I observe that IPO underpricing, market sentiment and float size figure as key explanatory factors. Results also reaffirm the importance of information asymmetry effects (Ritter, 1984; Beatty and Ritter, 1986; and Lowry et al., 2010). Larger IPO firms with tighter offer price spreads and more reputable underwriters exhibit noticeably greater price stability. I also assess Ljungqvist, Nanda and Singh's (2006) proposition that underpricing in hot' IPOs protects issuers and subscribers against a subsequent fall-off in issuer sentiment.

In the real world, managers are called on to fill entrepreneurial and leadership roles: sensing opportunities, developing and implementing viable business models, building capabilities, and guiding the organization through transformations. These entrepreneurial management tasks are part of the organization's capabilities, which also encompass embedded organizational processes that can be slow to change. An understanding of entrepreneurial management and organizational capabilities will contribute to more realistic economic models and a better understanding by policy makers of industrial dynamics and the requirements of innovation.

Their cooperation has been driven not only by economic and political factors, but also the failure of the existing global economic governance framework to satisfy the real needs of these countries. In this paper, we analyze how the BRICS moved from a financial category into a political group, and are progressively developing from a dialogue-based platform into a full-fledged mechanism of long-term coordination on a wide range of key issues relating to the world economy and politics. We also analyze how the BRICS have coordinated their positions in the G20, pushing for deep reform in global governance. Then, given the major hindrances to cooperation among the BRICS, including the challenge of economic transition, weak geopolitical links, complicated internal and external relations and inadequate governance capabilities, the present paper speculates on how the BRICS can use the opportunity arising from China taking the G20 presidency in 2016 to improve the cohesiveness and influence of the BRICS in terms of their agenda, organization and deliverables.","[Tian, Huifang] Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,"Tian, HF (通讯作者)，Chinese Acad Social Sci, Inst World Econ & Polit, Beijing, Peoples R China.",tianhf@cass.org.cn,,,National Social Sciences Fund Major Project [14ZDA081],National Social Sciences Fund Major Project,The author is grateful for the support of the National Social Sciences Fund Major Project (Grant.

We employ a new methodological framework to disentangle cross-crisis from temporal contagion effects. This allows us to extend to Africa a number of insights from the literature on financial crises (e.g., the mutual contagion effects between banking and currency meltdowns). Surprisingly, and critically for a study devoted to Africa, political upheavals are of modest relevance to predict financial crises.

Using the standard deviation, non-parametric kernel densities, and stochastic kernels we identify and study two distinct periods: a convergence from 1996 to 2007 and a polarization from 2007 to 2013. We further estimate a multi-level factor model to identify the contributions of continental, country and region-specific fluctuations. We show that the convergence prior to the recent crisis is solely accounted for by country factors, whereas the strong polarization afterwards can be attributed to both country and region-specific fluctuations.

For this purpose, we define a comprehensive concept of oligopolistic equilibrium to give account of a large set of competition regimes with varying competitive toughness. For two particular regimes, price competition and quantity competition, we show how, with strategic interactions, pro-competitive or anti-competitive effects now depend on the intersectoral elasticity of substitution as compared to the intrasectoral elasticity of substitution.","[d'Aspremont, Claude] Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium; [Ferreira, Rodolphe Dos Santos] Univ Strasbourg, BETA, 61 Ave Foret Noire, F-67085 Strasbourg, France; [Ferreira, Rodolphe Dos Santos] UCP, Catolica Lisbon Sch Business & Econ, Lisbon, Portugal",Universite Catholique Louvain; Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Universidade Catolica Portuguesa,"d'Aspremont, C (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Louvain, CORE, Voie Roman Pays 34, B-1348 Louvain, Belgium.",claude.daspremont@uclouvain.be; rdsf@unistra.fr,"Dos Santos Ferreira, Rodolphe/JZD-1090-2024",,,,,,25,15,15,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0938-2259,1432-0479,,ECON THEOR,Econ.

In this paper, we estimate the emission cost of sourcing (ECS), which originates from replacing domestic products by imports from countries with more CO2-intensive technologies. Using a structural decomposition analysis, we find that changes in sourcing patterns between 1995 and 2007 contribute (1) to reducing territorial emissions in high-wage countries (70% of their territorial emissions growth) and (2) to increasing territorial emissions in low-wage countries (30% of their territorial emissions increase). The net global effect, the ECS, amounts to 18% of total global CO2-emissions growth. Our results call the climate change policies based on territorial principles into question given that they disregard that differences in emission intensities between countries contribute to raising global emissions. In contrast, policies fostering the transfer of cleaner technologies to low-wage countries decrease the ECS.","[Hoekstra, Rutger] Stat Netherlands, Dept Stat Serv & Informat, The Hague, Netherlands; [Michel, Bernhard] Belgian Fed Planning Bur, Brussels, Belgium; [Michel, Bernhard] Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Suh, Sangwon] Univ Calif Santa Barbara, Bren Sch Environm Sci & Management, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA",Ghent University; University of California System; University of California Santa Barbara,"Michel, B (通讯作者)，Belgian Fed Planning Bur, Brussels, Belgium.;Michel, B (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, Dept Econ, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",bm@plan.be,"Suh, Sangwon/E-2019-2011","Suh, Sangwon/0000-0001-8290-6276; Hoekstra, Rutger/0000-0001-6531-9782",,,,,52,75,75,4,52,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0953-5314,1469-5758,,ECON SYST RES,Econ.

This paper studies China's rising domestic content in exports using firm- and customs transaction-level data. The approach embraces firm heterogeneity and hence reduces aggregation bias. The study finds that the substitution of domestic for imported materials by individual processing exporters caused China's domestic content in exports to increase from 65 to 70 percent in the period 2000-2007. Such substitution was induced by the country's trade and investment liberalization, which deepened its engagement in global value chains and led to a greater variety of domestic materials becoming available at lower prices.","[Kee, Hiau Looi] World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA; [Tang, Heiwai] Johns Hopkins Univ, Sch Adv Int Studies, 1717 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA",The World Bank; Johns Hopkins University,"Kee, HL (通讯作者)，World Bank, Dev Res Grp, 1818 H St NW, Washington, DC 20433 USA.",hlkee@worldbank.org; hwtang@jhu.edu,"liping, sun/AAW-1808-2021","liping, sun/0000-0002-4711-3518",World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program on Economic Development,World Bank's Multidonor Trust Fund for Trade and Development; Strategic Research Program on Economic Development,"We are also grateful for conference/seminar participants at the AEA, Barcelona GSE Summer Forum, Brandeis, CESIfo, Dartmouth, FREIT (UCSC), Georgetown, Graduate Institute-Geneva, GTDW, IMF/WB/WTO Workshop, Nottingham, Penn State-Tsinghua Conference, Colorado Boulder, USITC, and the World Bank for feedback.

A database consisting of 81 observations derived from 29 studies valuing the non-market impacts of hydropower electricity generation is constructed with the main aim to quantify and explain the economic values for positive and negative hydropower externalities. Different meta-regression model specifications are used to test the robustness of significant determinants of non-market values, including different types of hydropower impacts. The explanatory and predictive power of the estimated models is relatively high. Whilst controlling for sample and study characteristics, we find significant evidence for public aversion towards deteriorations of landscape, vegetation and wildlife caused by hydropower projects. There is however only weak evidence of willingness to pay for mitigating these effects. The main positive externality of hydropower generation, the avoidance of greenhouse gas emission, positively influences welfare estimates when combined with the share of hydropower in national energy production. Sensitivity to scope is detected, but not linked to specific externalities or non-market valuation methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Long-distance trade and social trust in the Viking age,ECONOMIC SYSTEMS,,,English,Article,,,,,,Long-distance trade; Trade norms; Social trust; Viking age; Scandinavia; Informal institutions; Oral culture; Ting legal system; Long-run socio-economic development,NETWORKS,"As the saying goes, it takes years to build up trust and only seconds to destroy it. In this paper, we argue that this is indeed the case when explaining trust formation in Scandinavia. Hence, in an attempt to explain why the Scandinavian welfare states hold the highest social trust scores in the world today, we argue that one possible historical root of social trust may be the long-distance trade practices of the Viking age. To manage the risk of being cheated, trade between strangers in an oral world required a strong informal institution of trust based trade norms out of necessity to deal with the risk of being cheated. In contrast to similar cases like the famous medieval Maghribi traders, who counted on writing (Greif, 1989), the punishment of cheaters could not be supported by written documents such as legal documents and letters, as the large majority of Vikings were non-literate. If a trader did not keep his word, social sanctioning by word of mouth was most likely the only method to discipline the cheater and prevent future free-rider behavior. The early rise of trust-based trade norms in Scandinavia is an overlooked factor in the region's long-term socio-economic development and social trust accumulation. This result points to the importance of free trade today, especially in poor countries with low levels of economic development and high rates of non-literacy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using a well-diversified portfolio of corporate loans from a Serbian bank between 2008 and 2012, we find three key determinants of loan default: exchange rate, lagged GDP growth rate, and loan size. Exchange rate depreciation is associated with an increase in the default rate whether the loan is denominated in foreign or local currency. By controlling for positive effects on revenue, we show that this finding can be attributed to an increase in the firms' net input costs due to the depreciation.","[Atanasijevic, Jasna] Univ Novi Sad, Fac Sci, Dept Math & Informat, Novi Sad 21000, Serbia; [Bozovic, Milos] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia",University of Novi Sad; University of Belgrade,"Bozovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Kamenicka 6, Belgrade 11000, Serbia.",milosbozovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Božović, Miloš/AAI-9753-2020","Božović, Miloš/0000-0002-5087-1977","Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [179005]","Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","We acknowledge the financial support of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia, grant No. 179005.",,27,9,9,0,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0012-8775,1557-9298,,EASTERN EUR ECON,East.

Experimental and empirical results support the view that managers tend to be regret averse. Under regret aversion a negative risk premium need not preclude the firm from exporting which would be the case if the firm were only risk averse. Exporting creates an implicit hedge against the possibility of regret when the realized spot exchange rate turns out to be high. The regret-averse firm as such has a greater ex ante incentive to export than the purely risk averse firm. Finally, we use a two-state example to illustrate that the firm optimally exports more (less) to the foreign country than in the case of pure risk aversion if the low (high) spot exchange rate is more likely to prevail. Regret aversion as such plays a crucial role in determining the firm's optimal allocation between domestic sales and foreign exports.","[Broll, Udo] Tech Univ Dresden, Dresden, Germany; [Welzel, Peter] Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany; [Wong, Kit Pong] Univ Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Technische Universitat Dresden; University of Augsburg; University of Hong Kong,"Welzel, P (通讯作者)，Univ Augsburg, Fac Business & Econ, D-86135 Augsburg, Germany.",peter.welzel@wiwi.uni-augsburg.de,"Welzel, Peter/I-7572-2015","Welzel, Peter/0000-0002-8298-8256",,,,,23,1,1,0,16,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1465-6485,1468-0475,,GER ECON REV,Ger.

The long-run properties of economic growth models are independent of energy and environmental policies. However, these policies affect capital accumulation and rates of productivity growth that determine the intermediate-run trends that are important for policy evaluation. Heterogeneity of different energy producers and consumers is critical for the implementation of energy and environmental policies. To capture this heterogeneity it is necessary to distinguish among commodities, industries, and households. Econometric methods are essential for summarizing information on different industries and consumer groups in a form suitable for general equilibrium modeling. In this paper we consider the application of econometric general equilibrium modeling to the U.S., the economy that has been studied most intensively. The framework for our analysis is provided by the Intertemporal General Equilibrium Model (IGEM) introduced by Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1990). The new version of the IGEM presented in this paper is employed for the evaluation of proposed legislation on climate policy by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2011).

When preference belongs to the class of harmonic absolute risk aversion (HARA), the risk premium is perfectly transferable within each partnership; thus a stable match minimizes the social cost of risk. In the systematic risk model, where agents are ranked by their holdings of a common risky asset, the convexity of the joint risk premium in joint risk size leads to negative assortative matching (NAM). In the idiosyncratic risk model, where agents are ranked by their independent riskiness in the sense of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD), NAM arises when preference exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA) in the sense of Ross and riskier background risk leads to more risk-averse behavior. However, NAM may fail to arise when riskier background risk leads to more risk-tolerant behavior. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Second, in companies with weak corporate governance, corporate social responsibility can result in more reduction in credit spreads, which suggests that corporate social responsibility performance contains more information when corporate governance is weak. Third, the correlation between corporate social responsibility and credit spreads tends to become weaker as institutional ownership increases.

At best, only relatively uneducated immigrant women in unskilled occupations may fit the profile of secondary workers, with slow skill mobility and low-status job-traps.

By constructing and analyzing a large dataset that combines information on 9,672 articles published in the top five economic journals from 1970 to 2000 with detailed yearly citation data obtained from Google Scholar, we find that published articles do have a life cycle that differs across fields of economic research (which we divide into the categories of applied, applied theory, econometric methods, and theory). Applied and applied theory papers are the clear winners in terms of citation counts. For the first years after their publication, they receive higher numbers of citations per year than papers in other fields of research do. They also reach a higher peak number of citations per year and apparently sustain those peak levels for longer, in addition to being cited over longer periods of time (i.e., they have a longer lifespan). Citation patterns are much less favorable for theoretical papers, which are the object of fewer citations per annum in the first years following publication, have lower peak numbers and a shorter lifespan. Econometric method papers are a special case; the pattern for most of these papers is similar to the pattern for theory papers, but the most successful papers (as measured by the number of citations) on econometric methods are also the most successful papers in the entire discipline of economics.

To this end, our framework combines a crime model a la Becker with a Salop circle. When law enforcement includes a fixed fine for illegal conduct, more intense competition due to a higher number of firms in the industry reduces the prevalence of crime, whereas more intense competition due to better substitutability between products may increase or decrease crime. In contrast, when the fine for corporate crime is proportional to profits, more intense competition unambiguously increases the prevalence of crime. In addition, we discuss the implications of the link between product market competition and corporate crime decisions for market entry and optimal law enforcement and elaborate on the relationship between law enforcement and a firm's ability to commit to refraining from the use of illegal practices.","[Friehe, Tim] Univ Marburg, Publ Econ Grp, Plan 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany; [Friehe, Tim] CESifo, Munich, Germany; [Baumann, Florian] Univ Bonn, Ctr Adv Studies Law & Econ CASTLE, Adenauerallee 42-42, D-53113 Bonn, Germany",Philipps University Marburg; Ifo Institut; University of Bonn,"Friehe, T (通讯作者)，Univ Marburg, Publ Econ Grp, Plan 2, D-35037 Marburg, Germany.;Friehe, T (通讯作者)，CESifo, Munich, Germany.",fbaumann@uni-bonn.de; tim.friehe@uni-marburg.de,,,,,,,57,8,9,0,22,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

We identify how associations attract the most productive firms or the least productive firms in an industry and explain how such associations differ in their intensive and extensive marginal contributions to social capital. We find that the level of regulatory stringency, association products including capital goods for members or lobbying to influence regulation, and government influenceability affect membership and contribution decisions. These results vary with firm productivity. Often, an increase in government influenceability increases social capital in associations composed of highly productive firms because they prefer to influence policy while less productive firms prefer more association-produced production inputs.

Evidence from Chinese private firms,CHINA ECONOMIC REVIEW,,,English,Article,,,,,,Minimum wage regulation; Offsetting behavior; China,FAMILY INCOMES; EMPLOYMENT; ECONOMICS,"To study how firms respond to minimum wage regulation in China, this paper empirically explores a number of dimensions along which firms adjust in response to minimum wage differences, using three waves of a national survey of Chinese private firms. Consistent with the predictions of economic theory, we find that private firms in China respond to minimum wage increases by cutting various fringe benefits such as pension and insurance, and by laying off low-skilled workers and short-term workers. Despite these adjustments, firms cannot fully mitigate the detrimental effects on firm profitability when faced with adverse demand shocks because of the wage rigidity introduced by minimum wage regulation. These findings highlight the unintended consequences of minimum wage regulation on the private sector in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (2011), more than half of rural migrant workers are married. Married couples' migration decisions are not purely individual responses to different social and economic opportunities, but jointly determined within a family unit. The current approaches that examine Chinese migration issues do not explicitly take into account the fundamental differences between personal and family decisions. We extend the current approaches to explicitly model joint migration decisions of married couples. Using the 2009 China data from the Rural-Urban Migration in China and Indonesia (RUMiCl) project, we examine the important determinants of couples' temporary migration decisions, such as the numbers of pre-school and school-age children. Our simulation and estimation results show that when analyzing married persons' migration choices, it is more desirable to use a multiple-choice model than a binary-choice model because 1) it more effectively deals with nonlinearities created by joint decision-making; and 2) it offers the possibility to study compositional change of joint migration outcomes.

However, methods used in the literature are primarily applied to American media and usually dependent on the two-party system. This paper attempts to detect and quantify the principal difference, or 'media bias', of Chinese media. We extract a document-term matrix from articles on the Eighteenth Party Congress in November 2012 from 21 Chinese newspapers from seven provinces, as well as the People's Daily. With this matrix, hierarchical clustering is subsequently used to divide newspapers into two groups. Using the dendrogram and intergroup dissimilarities, we can construct an index to indicate the direction and the magnitude of media bias. In our sample, newspapers from Zhejiang and Guangdong constitute one group, and the rest constitute the other group. The principal difference of Chinese media is reflected in two dimensions: central/local and political/economic. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

It is argued that, despite the enormous achievements of AI systems, it would be a serious mistake to suppose that such systems, unaided by human intervention, are as yet any nearer to providing robust solutions to the problems posed by Keynesian uncertainty. Under the radically uncertain conditions, human decision-making (for all its problems) has proved relatively robust, while decision making relying solely on deterministic rules or probabilistic models is bound to be brittle. AI remains dependent on techniques that are seldom seen in human decision-making, including assumptions of fully enumerable spaces of future possibilities, which are rigorously computed over, and extensively searched. Discussion of alternative models of human decision making under uncertainty follows, suggesting a future research agenda in this area of common interest to AI and economics.","[Smith, Robert Elliott] UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England",University of London; University College London,"Smith, RE (通讯作者)，UCL, Dept Comp Sci, London WC1E 6BT, England.",robert.elliott.smith@gmail.com,,,,,,,53,4,4,2,41,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,MAR 21,2016,10,,,,,,1,40,20167.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2016-7,0.0,,,40,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DH7HD,,"gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000372962400001,0

We show significant positive link between changes in the number of blockbusters on patent six months prior and returns in excess of pharmaceutical equity index.

We propose a novel measure of the prominence of a retailer's name, and show that it is also an important predictor of the organic traffic retailers enjoy from product searches through Google and Bing. We also show that failure to account for the prominence of retailers' names-as well as the endogeneity of retailers' positions in the list of search results-significantly inflates the estimated impact of screen position on organic clicks.

Recent empirical evidence has shown that the sharp increase in government bond yields cannot be attributed entirely to changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Contagion effects can occur, and self-fulfilling speculation may arise. In this paper, we develop a theoretical model in the spirit of the second-generation currency crisis models developed by Obstfled (1996). The model describes a strategic game between governments and private investors. Euro area countries face a trade-off as governments may either commit to and implement restrictive fiscal policies or default on debt. The commitment strategy may not be optimal if the fundamentals deteriorate. The policy maker lose part of their credibility, and governments are forced to default. In addition, we introduce uncertainty about the cost of default in the model, which is then able to account for a greater variety of equilibrium. Thus, when the evaluation of the cost of default is asymmetric, prophecies are not always realized and default does not occur. Simulations of the model then show that it offers insights, and can help to account for the situations of Greece and Italy during the sovereign debt crisis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

But is conflict spillover effectively stronger in SSA than elsewhere? To answer this question, we estimate models of civil war onset comparing SSA against the rest of the world (RoW). We find that in SSA a neighbour at war increases the probability of civil war onset by at least 1%. This is not negligible, considering that the unconditional probability of civil war onset is 1.1% in the global sample and 1.5% in the SSA sample. The spillover effect in the RoW is three times smaller than in SSA and, in general, statistically not different from zero. The results are robust to changes in the definition of neighbourhood and the inclusion of regional variables in the estimating equations to account for clustering effects. Finally, we provide evidence that refugee inflows and the artificial separation of ethnic groups explain part, but not all, of the spillover effect in SSA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The explanations proposed for the decline in the employment-to-population ratio have been of two broad types. One set of explanations emphasizes cyclical factors associated with the recession; the second set of explanations focuses on the role of longer-run structural factors. In this paper, we argue that while the decline in manufacturing and the consequent reduction in demand for less-educated workers put downward pressure on their employment rates in the pre-recession 2000-2006 period, the increased demand for less-educated workers because of the housing boom was simultaneously pushing their employment rates upwards. For a few years, the housing boom served to mask the labor market effects of manufacturing decline for less-educated workers. When the housing market collapsed in 2007, there was a large, immediate decline in employment among these workers, who faced not only the sudden disappearance of jobs related to the housing boom, but also the fact that manufacturing's steady decline during the early 2000s left them with many fewer opportunities in that sector than had existed at the start of the decade.","[Charles, Kerwin Kofi] Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Hurst, Erik] Univ Chicago, Booth Sch Business, Econ, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] Northwestern Univ, Econ, Evanston, IL USA; [Charles, Kerwin Kofi; Hurst, Erik; Notowidigdo, Matthew J.] Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA",University of Chicago; University of Chicago; Northwestern University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Charles, KK (通讯作者)，Univ Chicago, Harris Sch Publ Policy, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.;Charles, KK (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",kerwin.charles@gmail.com; erik.hurst@chicagobooth.edu; noto@northwestern.edu,"Hurst, Erik/W-4996-2019",,,,,,44,47,61,0,8,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

We show that the conditional choice probabilities and the choice-specific payoffs in these models are related in the sense of conjugate duality, and that the identification problem is a mass transport problem. Based on this, we propose a new two-step estimator for these models; interestingly, the first step of our estimator involves solving a linear program that is identical to the classic assignment (two-sided matching) game of Shapley and Shubik (1971). The application of convex-analytic tools to dynamic discrete-choice models and the connection with two-sided matching models is new in the literature.

We consider the US corn sector and its vertical links with food and ethanol (energy) markets. We find that ethanol is a source of imperfect price transmission in the food supply chain. Ethanol, however, alters price transmission only under a binding blender's tax credit and only from food to corn (not vice versa). Our results indicate that ethanol weakens the response of corn and food prices in terms of their level changes to shocks occurring in agricultural (corn and food) markets. The results are robust to different assumptions on the model parameters. Although market power has previously been identified as a source of imperfect price transmission in the food supply chain, our findings show that in the presence of ethanol, the imperfect price transmission may occur even if markets are perfectly competitive.

The large cohort of youth entering Africa's labour force is the best educated one the continent has seen, and Africa is witnessing its best growth performance in decades; yet jobs remain elusive in the formal wage sector. This is largely because African economies have hitherto failed to transform structurally from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity non-agricultural sectors and this, taken together with the high fertility and low infant mortality, has resulted in the structure of employment not changing much. Although many refer to the youth employment problem as the 'youth unemployment problem' in actual fact, (measured) unemployment in low-income sub-Saharan Africa (3%) and even in middle-income countries outside of Southern Africa, unemployment is not high as it is considered a 'luxury'. In the absence of formal wage jobs, youth have found innovative ways to express and exploit their talents and capabilities in the agriculture and household enterprises (informal sector). Given the large numbers of youth entering the labour market each year, and the weak structural transformation of most African economies, the informal sector will remain a major employer of youth, particularly the less skilled and less educated, for decades to come. There is therefore a need for a shift in policy thinking across Africa. It is imperative that policy makers make concerted efforts to raise productivity (and thus earnings) in the informal sector, rather than continue to focus exclusively on the formal wage sector. In this regard, policy makers need to learn from, and work with the youth to enable scalability of certain youth initiatives.","[Fox, Louise] Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Senbet, Lemma W.; Simbanegavi, Witness] African Econ Res Consortium, Nairobi, Kenya",University of California System; University of California Berkeley; African Economic Research Consortium (AERC),"Fox, L (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA.",fox.louise@outlook.com,,"Simbanegavi, Witness/0000-0003-3109-9528",ESRC [ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/N013344/1] Funding Source: researchfish,ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),,,24,49,50,3,38,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0963-8024,1464-3723,,J AFR ECON,J.

This study examines two related hypotheses: (i) that real exchange rate adjustment promotes the rebalancing of the current account and (ii) that a flexible nominal exchange rate facilitates real exchange rate adjustment and thus the rebalancing of the current account. Evidence from an event-study analysis for a large set of emerging-market economies over the period 1975-2008 indicates that real exchange rate adjustment has contributed significantly to reducing current account imbalances. The adjustment of current account deficits in countries with a fixed exchange rate regime typically occurs through an exchange rate crisis, and substantial costs in terms of forgone output are incurred. Vector-error-correction analysis supports the findings of the event study; namely, in the long run, real exchange rate movements facilitate current account adjustment.

We explore the driving factors behind the amount and allocation of public funds to agriculture, and behind the differential attention that various types of public investments receive in the process of making decisions on resource allocation. Agricultural public investments are more likely to be made that have two key features: higher attributability to politicians and donors of the output of public spending, and a shorter lag time between expenditures incurred and outputs produced. Evidence on geographical targeting of agricultural public funds corresponds more closely with theories suggesting that resources are used to sway communities opposed to the ruling party, rather than to reward political supporters. Examination of the effect of actors' and organisations' incentives and constraints on resource allocation in agriculture points to the importance of not treating government, the ruling party and other institutions as monolithic bodies; the paper instead highlights how differentiated interests within seemingly coherent institutions drive what gets public expenditure attention in the agricultural sector.","[Mogues, Tewodaj] Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div DSG, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA; [Do Rosario, Domingos] Univ Eduardo Mondlane, Dept Polit Sci & Publ Adm, Maputo, Mozambique",CGIAR; International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Eduardo Mondlane University,"Mogues, T (通讯作者)，Int Food Policy Res Inst, Dev Strategy & Governance Div DSG, 2033 K St NW, Washington, DC 20036 USA.",t.mogues@cgiar.org,,"Mogues, Tewodaj/0000-0002-3816-8445",Mozambique office of United States Agency for International Development,Mozambique office of United States Agency for International Development(United States Agency for International Development (USAID)),"Department of Political Science and Public Administration, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane.

Despite offering different answers to the question of where property rights come from, these diverse perspectives share a concern with organizational capacity, constraints, and legitimacy as explanations why organizations are able to supply private property rights. We use these shared concerns as a point of departure to investigate formal and informal private property rights in rural Afghanistan. We find that informal private property rights are more effective than formal private property rights because customary organizations fare better than the state on the dimensions of capacity, constraints, and legitimacy. More generally, these political' features of formal and informal organizations explain why self-governance works, as well as provide insight into the challenges confronting efforts in fragile states to establish formal private property institutions.","[Murtazashvili, Ilia; Murtazashvili, Jennifer] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Murtazashvili, I; Murtazashvili, J (通讯作者)，Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Publ & Int Affairs, Pittsburgh, PA USA.",imurtaz@pitt.edu; jmurtaz@pitt.edu,"Murtazashvili, Jennifer Brick/ABB-8461-2020","Murtazashvili, Jennifer Brick/0000-0003-4919-9287; Murtazashvili, Ilia/0000-0001-9096-9488",,,,,77,29,34,0,11,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",1744-1374,1744-1382,,J I ECON,J.

In our model, workers first make consumption decisions based on their gross income, and then treat debt servicing commitments as a substitute for saving. Workers' borrowing is induced by their desire to keep up with the consumption standard set by rentiers' consumption, reflecting an aspect of the relative income hypothesis. As a result of this consumption and debt servicing behavior, consumer debt accumulation and income distribution have effects on aggregate demand, profitability, and economic growth that differ from those found in existing models. We also investigate the financial sustainability of the Golden Age and Neoliberal growth regimes within our framework. It is shown that distributional changes between the Golden Age and the Neoliberal regimes, together with corresponding changes in consumption emulation behavior via expenditure cascades, suffice to make the Neoliberal growth regime unsustainable.

First we study this question within a traditional expected utility framework; then we apply Koszegi and Rabin's (2006, 2007) loss aversion model to account for reference-dependence in consumer preferences. Largely independent of the adopted framework, we find that the profit-maximizing loss probability for many commonly used parameterizations is close to 1/2. So in cases where the initial loss probability is low, insurers will have an incentive to increase it. This qualifies appeals to grant insurers market power to incentivize them to engage in loss prevention.","[Soetevent, Adriaan R.] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Soetevent, Adriaan R.] Univ Groningen, Tinbergen Inst, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Zhou, Liting] Tinbergen Inst, Rotterdam, Netherlands",University of Groningen; University of Groningen; Tinbergen Institute; Tinbergen Institute,"Soetevent, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.;Soetevent, AR (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, Tinbergen Inst, POB 800, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands.",a.r.soetevent@rug.nl; litingzhou1119@gmail.com,"Soetevent, Adriaan/AAA-2797-2022","Soetevent, Adriaan/0000-0003-3871-2401",,,,,32,1,1,1,7,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,MAR,2016,164,1,,,,,41,67,,10.1007/s10645-015-9259-7,0.0,,,27,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,DF6BD,,"Green Published, Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000371439100003,0

A matched Home-Foreign pair bargains simultaneously over the input price and the level of output, and competes a la Cournot with other matched pairs in markets. We find that the optimal Home tariff rate is strictly decreasing in the bargaining power of Home firms, and an increase in the Home firms' bargaining power might therefore raise Foreign profits. Under an endogenous market structure with entry followed by matching, the relationship between bargaining power and output is non monotone if the demand function is strictly concave or convex. This in turn induces a non monotone relationship between the optimal tariff and bargaining power for a class of demand functions. For linear demand, free trade is optimal irrespective of bargaining power. We show that non-monotonicity result is retained under endogenous bargaining power. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

How many levels of government should there be? How should state borders be drawn? We develop a model of political agency in which voters differ in their ability to monitor rent-seeking politicians. We find that rent extraction is a decreasing and convex function of the share of informed voters, because voter information improves monitoring but also reduces the appeal of holding office. As a result, information heterogeneity pushes toward centralization to reduce rent extraction. Taste heterogeneity pulls instead toward decentralization to match local preferences. Our model thus implies that optimal borders should cluster by tastes but ensure diversity of information. We also find economies of scope in accountability that explain why multiplying government tiers harms efficiency. A single government in charge of many policies has better incentives than many special-purpose governments splitting its budget and responsibilities. Hence, a federal system is desirable only if information varies enough across regions.","[Boffa, Federico] Free Univ Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy; Univ Barcelona, Inst Econ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; Univ Pompeu Fabra, CREI, Barcelona, Spain; Barcelona GSE, Barcelona, Spain",Free University of Bozen-Bolzano; University of Barcelona; Pompeu Fabra University; Centre de Recerca en Economia Internacional (CREI); Barcelona School of Economics,"Boffa, F (通讯作者)，Free Univ Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy.",,"Piolatto, Amedeo/Q-4747-2018; Ponzetto, Giacomo/A-9387-2013","Piolatto, Amedeo/0000-0002-3571-8069; Boffa, Federico/0000-0002-2394-9441; Ponzetto, Giacomo/0000-0002-7321-9826","Free University of Bolzano [WW82]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [ECO-2012-37131, JCI-2010-08414, ECO-2011-25624]; Government of Catalonia [2014-SGR-420, 2009-SGR-1157, 2014-SGR-830]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [RYC-2013-13838]; Barcelona GSE; BBVA Foundation",Free University of Bolzano; Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Spanish Government); Government of Catalonia(Generalitat de Catalunya); Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Barcelona GSE; BBVA Foundation(BBVA Foundation),"Boffa acknowledges financial support from the Free University of Bolzano (WW82); Piolatto from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ECO-2012-37131) and the Government of Catalonia (2014-SGR-420); Ponzetto from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (JCI-2010-08414 and ECO-2011-25624), the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (RYC-2013-13838), the Government of Catalonia (2009-SGR-1157 and 2014-SGR-830), the Barcelona GSE and the BBVA Foundation through its first grant for Researchers, Innovators and Cultural Creators.

Finally, we calibrate our model to the US data for the Information Technology revolution that happened in the 1980s and demonstrate that our model can moderately explain the data.

This paper raises the natural question whether the European statistical system was left at the station' while its U.S. counterpart departed', making it possible for measurement differences to become the primary suspect for the existing productivity gap. My retrospective review of the development path in the services sector productivity statistics suggests that Europe lags significantly behind the U.S. in the services producer price index program, both in terms of scope and timing of its implementation. Accordingly, the role of these measurement differences in the post-1995 Europe-U.S. productivity story cannot reasonably be ruled out. The paper concludes with a structured guess' that provides a circumstantial evidence on the benefits generated by the upgrades in the U.S. services sector statistics. The results show that these enhancements led to two kinds of benefits during the post-1995 period - a considerable reduction in the contribution of industries that traditionally dampened the aggregate productivity trend combined with a larger contribution of those that generally lifted it. This contrasts markedly with Europe where the contribution of these two sources remained unchanged in the meantime.","[Harchaoui, Tarek M.] Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands",University of Groningen,"Harchaoui, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen, NL-9700 AB Groningen, Netherlands.",t.m.harchaoui@rug.nl,,,"European Commission, Research Directorate General as part of the 7th Framework Programme [244709]","European Commission, Research Directorate General as part of the 7th Framework Programme","This paper was written as part of the INDICSER project, funded by the European Commission, Research Directorate General as part of the 7th Framework Programme, Theme 8: Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities, Grant Agreement no. 244709.

Using this novel approach, we show that austerity is always a drag on growth, and especially so in depressed economies: a 1% of GDP fiscal consolidation translates into a loss of 3.5% of real GDP over five years when implemented in a slump, rather than just 1.8% in a boom.","Fed Reserve Bank San Francisco, Davis, CA USA; Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA; NBER, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; CEPR, London, England",Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - San Francisco; University of California System; University of California Davis; National Bureau of Economic Research; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Taylor, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Dept Econ, Davis, CA 95616 USA.;Taylor, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Davis, Grad Sch Management, Davis, CA 95616 USA.",amtaylor@ucdavis.edu,,,,,,,60,176,189,3,37,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0013-0133,1468-0297,,ECON J,Econ.

Households choosing to live at the same place form a jurisdiction which produces congested local public services, which generates positive spillovers to other jurisdictions. In every jurisdiction, the production of the local public services is financed through a local tax based on households' wealth. Local wealth tax rates are democratically determined in every jurisdiction. Households consume the available amount of public services in their jurisdiction and a composite private good. Any household is free to leave its jurisdiction for another that would increase its utility. A necessary and sufficient condition to have every stable jurisdiction structure segregated by wealth is identified: the public services must be either a gross substitute or a gross complement to the private good.","[Oddou, Remy] Univ Paris West, Paris, France; [Oddou, Remy] Univ Paris West, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, Paris, France",,"Oddou, R (通讯作者)，Univ Paris West, EconomiX, 200 Ave Republ, Paris, France.",remy.oddou@free.fr,,,,,,,14,6,6,0,1,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

The novelty is the use of a set of six human capital indices: endowment, utilization, demography, productivity, support and health. It uses panel data estimation for 31 regions of China for 2002-2013 with the consideration of usual determinant variables in FDI study. The results suggest that foreign investors value the availability of human resources, both in terms of present (endowment) and future (demography) supply, as the most important factor in making their investment decisions. Health of labor force and quality of people working in scientific and technical fields were also found to be significant. Furthermore, local market size, infrastructure and location (being in coastal region) are significant determinants with western region, compared to central and northeastern regions, losing out the most to eastern region.

This adjustment process, commonly known as weather normalization, is required to properly determine a set of rates which yields the revenue requirement under the assumption of normal weather. Normal weather values that characterize long-term weather patterns are critical component of weather normalization. Conventionally, normal weather values are calculated using the Standard Climate Normal (SCN). The SCN for any given calendar day is the 30-year average of the associated weather observations for that calendar day. In the regulatory process the SCN can inadvertently introduce biases in the weather normalization adjustment. This study investigates the sources and mitigation of these biases.

Using a dataset containing more than 110 thousand Chinese private manufacturing firms, this paper is the first attempt to examine how unions' bargaining power affects firms' capital structures. We find that: (1) the firms' debt levels are often positively associated with their unions' bargaining powers; (2) when a firm is in financial distress, the management is more likely to issue more debt to strengthen its bargaining power against the union and increase its residual income; (3) compared with long-term debt, short-term debt is a better option for the management to increase its bargaining power and residual income. Our research indicates that the unions of private Chinese firms are an important policy instrument for the management rather than useless decorations, which provides valuable insights for us to understand the employee-employer relations and firms' capital structures in emerging economies.","[Fang, Mingyue] Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, 121 Zhangjialukou, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuxiao] Renmin Univ China, Sch Econ, Beijing, Peoples R China",Capital University of Economics & Business; Renmin University of China,"Fang, MY (通讯作者)，Capital Univ Econ & Business, Sch Econ, 121 Zhangjialukou, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China.",fmingyue@163.com,"Fang, Mingyue/JWA-3746-2024",,Beijing Natural Science Foundation [9154025]; National Social Science Foundation of China [15CJL019],Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); National Social Science Foundation of China(National Office of Philosophy and Social Sciences),"This work was supported by Beijing Natural Science Foundation [No. 9154025], National Social Science Foundation of China [No. 15CJL019].",,32,0,0,1,11,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1226-508X,1744-3873,,GLOBAL ECON REV,Global Econ.

Credit risk is the primary financial risk in banking system. Credit risk selection and management is critically important for bank's performance over time. Credit risk is defined as a risk of occurrence of losses due to counterparty's default of payments to the bank or as a risk of decrease in economic value of amounts due to the bank as a result of deterioration of counterparty's ability to repay amounts due to the bank. The objective of credit risk management is to minimize losses on the credit portfolio as well as to minimize the risk of occurrence of loans threatened with impairment exposure, while keeping expected level of profitability and value of credit portfolio at the same time. Identifying and rating of the credit risk is the essential first step in managing it effectively. Rating systems measure credit risk and differentiate individual credits and groups of credits by the risk they pose. For a bank it is very important to know this risk and make an evaluation as close as possible to reality. Our aim is to model the time evolution of the probability of a default loan in respect to client's rating using Markov chain, to estimate the reserve (risk) fund, and to assign credit risk margin taking into account client's rating.","[Blazekova, Ol'ga; Vojtekova, Maria] Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia",University of Zilina,"Blazeková, O (通讯作者)，Univ Zilina, Fac Operat & Econ Transport & Commun, Univ 1, Zilina 01026, Slovakia.",olga.blazekova@fpedas.uniza.sk; maria.vojtekova@fpedas.uniza.sk,"Vojtekova, Maria/P-4623-2016; Blazekova, Olga/Q-5607-2016","Vojtekova, Maria/0000-0001-9040-0443; Blazekova, Olga/0000-0003-2394-2351",[1/KKMaHI/2016],,"This paper is an output of the science project 1/KKMaHI/2016, FPEDAS University of Zilina and VEGA 1/0787/14 Research on quality of safety management in local government as a prerequisite for effective found spending.",,15,0,0,0,3,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,199,206,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800026,0

Galbraith's countervailing power argument to explore the deep history of U.S. income inequality. Two explanatory variables-institutional power and distributive conflict-have played an integral role in the shifting patterns of U.S. income inequality since the late nineteenth century. The commodified power of large firms, manifested in aggregate concentration and the markup, exacerbates inequality while the countervailing power of organized labor, manifested in union density and strike activity, mitigates inequality. One implication of this research is that U.S. income inequality is unlikely to diminish unless the labor movement (or a comparable social movement) is strengthened.","[Brennan, Jordan] Unifor, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Brennan, Jordan] Canadian Ctr Policy Alternat, Ottawa, ON, Canada",,"Brennan, J (通讯作者)，Unifor, Toronto, ON, Canada.;Brennan, J (通讯作者)，Canadian Ctr Policy Alternat, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",,,,,,,,35,4,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

Data regarding regional FDI movements as well as more detailed information about the projects under the investment incentives scheme were evaluated using various comparative criteria; to support the interpretation, practical examples and various qualitative criteria are also examined in brief. The results show that the activity of foreign investors in the South Bohemian region is lower than average, the causes identified being serious issues in the field of infrastructure, missing industrial traditions and features of the region that rather support further development of tourism and other service sectors.

Yet, these measures can become an impediment in international trade, especially for developing countries. Therefore, using an Egyptian firm-level data set and a new database on specific trade concerns raised in the TBT and SPS committees at the WTO, we analyse the effects of product standards on two related aspects: first, the probability to export (firm-product extensive margin), and second, the value exported (firm-product intensive margin). We merge this data set with a new database on specific trade concerns raised in the TBT and SPS committees at the WTO. Our main findings show that SPS measures imposed on Egyptian exporters have a negative impact on the probability of exporting a new product to a new destination. By contrast, the intensive margin of exports is not significantly affected by such measures.","[El-Enbaby, Hoda; Hendy, Rana] ERF, Cairo, Egypt; [Zaki, Chahir] Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt",Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"Zaki, C (通讯作者)，Cairo Univ, Fac Econ & Polit Sci, Cairo, Egypt.",chahir.zaki@feps.edu.eg,"Zaki, Chahir/AFQ-2972-2022","Hendy, Rana/0000-0001-8133-0201; El Enbaby, Hoda/0000-0002-3548-4637",,,,,32,21,21,2,36,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

We also consider the political economy of pairwise majority voting preferences for differing policies. Rawlsian redistribution is always defeated, though often by only a modest majority, while a constrained utilitarian policy, with equal transfers to unemployed and employed individuals-a universal basic income-wins a majority in all cases, which is robust to changes in the underlying productivity distribution.","[Fitzroy, Felix] Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Fitzroy, Felix] IZA, Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Nolan, Michael] Univ Hull, Ctr Econ Policy, Kingston Upon Hull HU6 7RX, N Humberside, England",University of St Andrews; University of Hull,"Fitzroy, F (通讯作者)，Univ St Andrews, Sch Econ & Finance, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland.",,,,,,,,15,1,1,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1463-6786,1467-9957,,MANCH SCH,Manch.

These methods confirmed that even though there is a wider media space dedicated to science, there are still many gaps that should be filled.

At the same time, the spatial, temporal and vehicle specific nature of the charge may cause unintended substitutions as traffic and accidents shift to other proximate areas, times and to uncharged vehicles. We demonstrate that, to the contrary, the congestion charge reduced accidents and the accident rate in adjacent areas, times and for uncharged vehicles.

Thus, the intention is to find out, if there is any change in interest rate pass-through caused by the financial crisis. To fulfil this intention, I use an ARDL modeling approach on two subsample of data covering the pre and post crisis period. The results suggest that the interest rate pass-through for large corporate loans rate is complete before the financial crisis, however, the strength of the pass-through is lesser by half after the financial crisis. Similarly, it is valid for the small corporate loans rate and for the mortgage loan rate. Although the interest rate pass-through is not complete in these cases, the pass-through is still weaker after the crisis.

Violating water systems are subject to intense regulatory and public scrutiny. The response of contaminant levels to violation status has not been explored empirically. This paper addresses this relationship through an event study using data on arsenic and nitrate levels in California. I find that violation status has a significant positive effect on nitrate levels post-violation, but no effect on arsenic levels. I also examine the effect of the 2006 arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level revision, finding a discontinuity in contaminant levels at revision. These results suggest that while public disclosure may deter systems from violating, once they go into violation the Public Notification Rule is not effective at encouraging a return to compliance.","[Grooms, Katherine K.] Southwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA",,"Grooms, KK (通讯作者)，Southwestern Univ, Dept Econ & Business, Georgetown, TX 78626 USA.",groomsk@southwestern.edu,,,,,,,15,6,10,0,76,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The first class of techniques is utilized to investigate macroeconomic behaviour by aggregating an ensemble of heterogeneous nonstationary time-series data and the second class of techniques examines the local dynamics of the microstructures in each time series. Moving window principal component analysis (PCA) and functional PCA (fPCA) are shown to extract collective signatures of the financial system for understanding macroeconomic behaviour, and the Synchrosqueezing and Markov switching techniques are used to study local dynamics within each individual time series. The integrated data analytics successfully identifies the diverse events from 1986 to 2012. All events, both major and minor, have been identified by fPCA. The major economic events, especially the 2008 Great Recession, along with several minor events, showed a strong leading indicator in the density index derived from Synchrosqueezing. The capability of this integrated analytics suite is demonstrated in this article, and it motivates further studies encompassing data sets from broader sectors. As a complement to existing model-driven approach, this would lead to achieving a robust and reliable method that can help in taking measures to avoid catastrophic collapse in the constantly evolving financial system.","[Guharay, Samar K.; Thakur, Gaurav S.; Goodman, Fred J.; Rosen, Scott L.] Mitre Corp, Mclean, VA USA; [Houser, Daniel] George Mason Univ, Dept Econ, Fairfax, VA 22030 USA",MITRE Corporation; George Mason University,"Guharay, SK (通讯作者)，Mitre Corp, Mclean, VA USA.",sguharay@mitre.org,"Houser, Daniel/JXX-4326-2024",,MITRE Innovation Program,MITRE Innovation Program,This work was supported by the MITRE Innovation Program.,,48,3,4,3,14,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

Based on the facts and trends of actual consumption it is obvious that fundamental changes are required not only in technological level but also in consumer's behaviour. Every country should promote and encourage consumers to adapt sustainable patterns of consumption. In order to promote more sustainable patterns of consumption it is important to investigate the factors that influence consumers buying behaviour towards green products. The aim of this paper is to analyse the factors that influence the consumer's behaviour towards green products in Albania. A quantitative approach is used for data collection. Data are being analysed through multivariate analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results of the study indicate that demographic variables have not a significant role in a consumer's decision-making process towards green products. On the other hand lifestyle and the consumer perceived effectiveness play's a significant role in consumer's decision making process towards green products in Albania. Also situational factors like availability of green products, price and quality have an important role in final decision making. The findings of this study will help decision makers and companies to find more efficient ways to influence consumers and to increase the market share of green products in Albania.","[Gumeni, Anita; Shalari, Ornela; Kote, Dhonat] Univ Tirana, Fac Econ, Saranda Branch, Tirana, Albania",University of Tirana (UT),"Gumeni, A (通讯作者)，Univ Tirana, Fac Econ, Saranda Branch, Tirana, Albania.",anitagumeni@yahoo.gr; ornelashalari@gmail.com; kotedonatos@yahoo.gr,,,,,,,22,0,0,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,580,586,,,,,,7,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800072,0

Its aim is to assess whether the common currency contributes to the convergence of economies in terms of selected macroeconomic indicators to comparable values. The analysis of the convergence is supported by discussion of the results of scientific literature and the results of the comparative analysis of cyclical alignment, or respectively misalignment, of the economies in the framework of economic cycle. The cyclical alignment/misalignment captures the extent of differences in the phase of the economic cycle, on which the economies are found due to the effect of asymmetric shocks. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of economies is studied in terms of the rate of growth/decline in inflation. The mobility of the labour factor in the framework of the European Union countries, which is one of the basic requirements of monetary integration, is analysed and evaluated on the basis of development of the long-tend unemployment indicator. All quantitative analysis include statistical data from the last decade. The results indicate that differentiated monetary policies can better face the asymmetric shocks, unlike some economies with euro currency, in which the common currency acts counterproductively - the problems of recession caused by the shocks are deepened rather than absorbed. The paper also discusses the causes of this, which include, for instance, the tendency of diversion from economic considerations to political aspects.","[Haskova, Simona] Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic","Institute of Technology & Business, Ceske Budejovice","Hasková, S (通讯作者)，Sch Expertness & Valuat, Inst Technol & Business, Okruzni 517-10, Ceske Budejovice 37001, Czech Republic.",haskovas@post.cz,"Hašková, Simona/N-3667-2019",,,,,,18,1,1,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,620,627,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800077,0

We examine behavior after the tournament and find evidence suggesting that bad tournament design can lead to workers being discouraged. This discouragement effect is strong for low ability workers but not for high ability workers.

The applied literature focuses mainly on countries with high recycling rates. We focus on a region with the lowest recycling rate in France, a country that recycles less than the European country average. We first apply polychoric principal components analysis to reduce the number of explanatory variables to a set of six factors. In a second step, we use a probit model to estimate the probability of waste sorting as a function of these factors. This model tests several hypotheses emerging from the recent literature on behavioural economics applied to households' selective sorting. This literature pays particular attention to the social influence on recycling behaviour, which has been studied mostly by sociologists and psychologists. The results of our empirical analysis confirm some of the findings in the literature. However, they also highlight some unique features, such as social influences having a negative impact on recycling. This finding contrasts with most of the literature, which finds a positive relationship of social influence on pro-environmental behaviour.","[Kirakozian, Ankinee] Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne, France; [Kirakozian, Ankinee] GREDEG CNRS, Valbonne, France",Universite Cote d'Azur; Universite Cote d'Azur; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),"Kirakozian, A (通讯作者)，Univ Nice Sophia Antipolis, Valbonne, France.;Kirakozian, A (通讯作者)，GREDEG CNRS, Valbonne, France.",Ankinee.Kirakozian@gredeg.cnrs.fr,,,,,,,56,44,50,2,110,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The tensions between employers and academia remain because of faculty staff's concerns that engaging with the employability agenda will lead to a diminution of academic standards and objectives (Gunn et. al. 2010). It is vital that universities produce graduates that economy needs, with the skills that employers value. Therefore, HE should take into account the employment needs of their students, including the generic skills and abilities needed in the workplace and reflect this in the strategy, curriculum and course design. With the objective to investigate the employers' views on what skills and attitudes are important for employment, in April 2015 a total of 134 questionnaires from employers from Croatia were collected. In these surveys employers value problem solving skills, learning skills, willingness to learn, as well as enthusiasm and intelligence as the most important for employability. The findings indicate that skills and attitudes which employers expect graduates to bring to the workplace, such as intelligence, enthusiasm and motivation, application of knowledge, problem solving and learning skills are weakly developed during HE. This study highlights the growing need that HEIs put more emphasis upon promoting employability of students through skills development based upon employers' priorities, upon structured approach to work placements, internships and work based learning opportunities, as well as meaningful partnerships with the employers. Strategic planning, as well as monitoring the effects of teaching at HEI in increasing the employability of students, is critical.","[Konig, Ljerka Sedlan; Koprivnjak, Tihana; Juric, Petra Mezulic] Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia",University of JJ Strossmayer Osijek,"Konig, LS (通讯作者)，Josip Juraj Strossmayer Univ Osijek, Fac Econ Osijek, Gajev Trg 7, Osijek, Croatia.",sedlan@efos.hr; tihana@efos.hr; pmezulic@efos.hr,"Juric, Petra Mezulić/AAU-6276-2020; Koprivnjak, Tihana/ABD-9652-2020; Koprivnjak, Tihana/ABE-5758-2020","Juric, Petra Mezulić/0000-0003-3660-5215; Koprivnjak, Tihana/0000-0001-9881-6419; Koprivnjak, Tihana/0000-0001-9881-6419",,,,,23,0,0,0,2,EKONOMSKI FAKULTET OSIJEKU-FAC ECONOMICS OSIJEK,OSIJEK,"GAJEV TRG 7, OSIJEK, 31 000, CROATIA",1848-9559,,,MEDUNAR ZNAN SIMP GO,,,2016,,,,,,,520,533,,,,,,14,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG6BK,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389895600053,0

In doing so, potential technological differences, i.e. technology gaps, are computed in a metafrontier framework taking into account that developed countries may use a different technology in producing innovation from their developing/transition counterparts. Using bootstrap DEA, we find that developing/transition countries exhibit, in average terms, twice the technology gap of that corresponding to developed economies. Based on innovation efficiency and technology gap measures, a typology of the European countries is introduced revealing features related to national strategic positioning, countries' absorptive capacity and knowledge spillover effects. The group of European innovation leaders is formed by Germany, Switzerland, Netherlands, Denmark, Austria, Iceland and Italy. Second-stage results imply that entrepreneurial activity motivated by necessity hinders the adoption of superior technology in producing innovation in Europe. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In doing so we pay special attention to the specification of model and parameter priors. We also investigate the heterogeneous effects of these predictors on spatial mobility across commuter zones in different average income quintiles.

Means to ensure a comparability of financial statements in the international context are the International Financial Reporting Standards which today play the role in the harmonization of accounting. In deciding whether such a set of standards is to be applied in enterprises, it is necessary to take into account a number of criteria, while each of the defined criteria has a different degree of significance. In addition to a one-off transition to the international accounting standards, the possibility how to ensure the comparability of financial statements is a gradual implementation of selected provisions of International Financial Reporting Standards into national accounting regulations. Financial statements provide important information, therefore it is appropriate for them to be as meaningful as possible in a global perspective without significant differences according to national adjustments. The results of the analysis performed in industrial enterprises in a selected region of the Czech Republic show that the main obstacle to the application of these standards in accounting of enterprises are the high costs.

Design/methodology/approach - The authors extract five-related properties of an industry with comparative advantage in a host nation from Bernard et al.'s (2007) international trade model with heterogeneous firms and attempt to empirically test their roles in a multinational enterprise's (MNE) M&A or greenfield investment decision, using the inward FDI data set in Korea from 1999 to 2006. Findings - The theoretical framework finds that the five properties derived from an industry with comparative advantage in a host country have mixed motives for M&A or greenfield. The empirical results show that selected conventional independent variables generally affect the M&A or greenfield entry mode decision with significance individually and that their impacts become more or less prominent when the authors employ interaction terms combining them with comparative advantages in the industries. Research limitations/implications - This implies that MNEs not only consider their own firm-specific advantages or other country-level factors for foreign market entries as the previous research generally found, but also seriously take into account industry-specific factors, especially industry-wide comparative advantages based on heterogeneous productivities of firms. Originality/value - This paper reconciles multinationals' strategic motives under an oligopolistic market with their efficiency gains under a monopolistic competitive market, which are considered as two main factors for cross-border M&A. Furthermore, this paper adds a new firm-level data set into entry mode research.","[Lee, Jaeho; Jang, Yong Joon] Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea",Kyung Hee University,"Jang, YJ (通讯作者)，Kyung Hee Univ, Dept Int Business & Trade, Seoul, South Korea.",yjjang@khu.ac.kr,"Jang, Yong Joon/AAJ-8754-2020","Jang, Yong Joon/0000-0001-5338-9804",Kyung Hee University [KHU-20120457],Kyung Hee University,This work was supported by a grant from the Kyung Hee University in 2012 (KHU-20120457).,,68,2,2,1,2,KOREA TRADE RESEARCH ASSOC,SEOUL,"4503 WORLD TOWER, 51, YEONGDONG-DAERO, GANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-729, SOUTH KOREA",,1229-828X,,J KOREA TRADE,J.

This is partly due to occupational desegregation, but largely due to a closing of the within-occupational gender pay gap. The article finds that men are more likely than women to be employed in jobs that require working to tight deadlines. These jobs are associated with higher pay, and the gender difference arises entirely as a consequence of such occupations being over-represented in male-dominated industrial sectors. However, the article also finds evidence of lower pay and higher work intensity (in terms of working at high speed) for women vis-a` -vis men employed within the same occupations. These differences are not significant on labour market entry but emerge subsequently over the life cycle, most likely as a result of family-related responsibilities but also as a consequence of unexplained factors that could include gender discrimination.","[Lindley, Joanne Kathryn] Kings Coll London, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Dept Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England",University of London; King's College London,"Lindley, JK (通讯作者)，Kings Coll London, Fac Social Sci & Publ Policy, Dept Management, Franklin Wilkins Bldg,150 Stamford St, London SE1 9NH, England.",joanne.lindley@kcl.ac.uk,,,,,,,15,2,2,2,11,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We study the problem of re-matching students to take advantage of these empty seats in a context where there are priorities to respect. We propose an iterative way in which each group may independently match and re-match students to its schools. The advantages of this process are that every iteration leads to a Pareto improvement and a reduction in waste while maintaining respect of the priorities. Furthermore, it reaches a non-wasteful match within a finite number of iterations. While iterating may be costly, as it involves asking for inputs from the children, there are significant gains from the first few iterations.

Rural development is defined as a process of sustainable development leading to significant improvement in quality of life for the total population in the region, and especially the poor. More than two-thirds of the world's poor population live in rural regions. South Africa has similar rural poverty statistics. Rural regions in this country have deteriorated over the last two decades due to a lack of sustainable support for these regions. The government has since 2010 prioritized rural development in an effort to intervene in poverty and poor service delivery, but the implementation of a comprehensive rural development strategy is still not integrated or successful. The research methodology included a theoretical review of rural development in South Africa, and a case study focusing on the Northern Free State region. The Methodology also included a qualitative assessment of the study region, indicating below average compliance with best practice principles. Requirements for successful rural development and best practice rural development guidelines were also formulated for the study region in reducing poverty and to stimulate development. Some of the research findings include the discovery that rural regions have the potential to be popular again for reasons such as a quality rural environment, technological space shrinking and food security. Rural development requires a strong and committed government: strategies should focus on specific labour intensive economic sectors, such as tourism and agro-processing which links to manufacturing. Of further significance is the development of indigenous knowledge as well as the protection and maintenance of rural towns as service centres.","[Meyer, Daniel Francois] North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa",North West University - South Africa,"Meyer, DF (通讯作者)，North West Univ, Potchefstroom, South Africa.",daniel.meyer@nwu.ac.za,,,,,,,54,0,0,0,4,VARAZDIN DEVELOPMENT & ENTREPRENEURSHIP AGENCY,VARAZDIN,"MIHANOVICEVA 4, VARAZDIN, 00000, CROATIA",1849-6903,1849-7535,,EC SOC DEVELOP,,,2016,,,,,,,466,484,,,,,,19,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG5DU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000389417100050,0

After a brief review of political and economical antecendents, it was concluded that in Spain, as well as in Iceland, the key explanatory factors of the deep economic imbalances are located at the institutional sphere. The excesses are related in both cases to political clientelism and to diverse corruptions practices, in such a way that even the alarming signs that preceded the official date of the economic crisis, no convenient measures were adopted in time. In this context, the crisis has played a catalyst role, accelerating the demands aimed at achieving a better performance of the democratic system in both countries. Distrust in politicians and in political parties, as well as in other formal institutions, has not been translated neither in lack of confidence in the democracy system per se, nor in poltical apathy. Moreover, the discontent has been in both cases translated into both formulae of more political informal participation and of a greater support to more direct democracy, though through differents channels and with different results. In the discussion, diverse hypotheses are explored in order to explain the main findings in the comparative analysis. On the one hand, some of the variables associated to small-states literature are taken into account, in order to argue the main differences found out between the Spanish and Icelandic cases. On the other, diverse hypotheses from the political science literature are considered in search of a plausible explanation of the major parallelisms found.","[Miragaya, Laura Cabiedes] Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Miragaya, LC (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Oviedo, Asturias, Spain.",lcabie@uniovi.es,,,,,,,44,0,0,0,7,"UNIV HUELVA, SERV PUBLICACIONES",HUELVA,"CAMPUS EL CARMEN, EDIFICIO MARIE CURIE, AVENIDA FUERZAS ARMADAS S-N, HUELVA, 21071, SPAIN",1576-0162,,,REV ECON MUND,Rev.

The analysis of work incentives was carried out for 2005-2013 based on a combination of measures estimated using the EUROMOD tax-benefit microsimulation model. The analysis revealed high disincentives to work at the bottom of the income distribution, dominated by the effect of cash social benefits compared to taxes or social insurance contributions. A strong trade-off between benefit adequacy and work incentives is built into the design of the national cash benefit system, particularly social assistance. The challenge for policy design is thus to encourage active labour market participation among low earners without eroding the minimum income protection floor.","[Navicke, Jekaterina] Vilnius Univ, Fac Philosophy, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, Univ St 9-1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania; [Lazutka, Romas] Vilnius Univ, Fac Econ, Econ Theory Dept, Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius University; Vilnius University,"Navicke, J (通讯作者)，Vilnius Univ, Fac Philosophy, Dept Social Policy & Social Work, Univ St 9-1, LT-01513 Vilnius, Lithuania.",jekaterina.navicke@fsf.vu.lt,,"Lazutka, Romas/0000-0003-0480-8894",European Commission [VS/2011/0445],European Commission(European Union (EU)European Commission Joint Research Centre),"The process of extending and updating EUROMOD is financially supported by the Directorate General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion of the European Commission [Progress grant number VS/2011/0445].",,31,3,3,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1406-099X,2334-4385,,BALT J ECON,Balt.

We use Bloomberg's Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Disclosure score covering the S&P500 firms in the period 2007-2011 which allows for the examination of both linear and nonlinear relationships to be considered. The results of the linear model suggest that there is a significant negative relationship between CSP and Return on Capital. However, the non linear models provide evidence of a U-shaped relationship between CSP and the accounting-based measures of CFP, suggesting that in the longer run CSP effects are positive. Most prominent among our results is that fact that by disentangling the ESG Disclosure score into its environmental, social and governance sub-components, we find that a U-shaped relationship exists only between the governance sub-component and CFP. A straightforward implication of our findings suggests that in order for CSR to serve the interests of the shareholders, a long-run planning and considerable resources should be dedicated at this direction, given that CSR expenditure pays off only after a threshold of CSP has been reached. Furthermore, the fact that governance is the key driver affecting the CSP-CFP relationship suggests that CSR investments should be directed to this component. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study uses Nigerian Enterprise Surveys data for 2010 to construct a direct measure of credit constraint. From propensity score estimations, the results show that access to formal credit matters and has a significant impact on enterprise performance indicators. Firms that are credit constrained have significantly lower output per worker, capital per worker, employment of labour and investment in fixed assets for expansion compared to firms that are not credit constrained. This is more pronounced for women-owned enterprises after adjusting for bias in the estimations and controlling for sampling weights. This suggests that one way to support the growth of enterprises in Nigeria is to make access to formal credit less stringent.

In dynamic hedging strategy, although adjusting positions frequently can reduce the risk of portfolio, it inevitably leads to outrageous trading cost. Applying the economic value function, this paper quantifies the value of avoided risk and compares it with the corresponding transaction costs. In this way, decisions can be made at each point, that is, investors can determine whether to dynamically adjust their positions or maintain original positions, thus optimizing the hedging strategy. Furthermore, the empirical results confirm that the strategy modified by economic value is more effective than traditional hedging strategy.

To achieve this objective the authors solved the problems: 1) the competitiveness of cities from the view of the comfort of living in the context of globalization is defined; 2) the competitiveness of cities and evaluation of total indicators characterizing the comfort of living is estimated; suggestions to improve it are justified; 3) an overview of best practices and global trends in the light of improving the competitiveness of cities is given, the directions of approaching these goals in Russian cities are defined. The subject of research is the factors determining the competitiveness of the city from the view of the comfort of living, and its object is the city as a socioeconomic system.

This has led to a vigorous debate as to whether widening inequality was somehow to blame for the crisis by driving private sector credit booms. Despite growing interest, empirical evidence on an inequality-fragility relationship is limited. Based on a panel analysis of 18 OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries for the years 1970-2007, this study provides evidence of a positive relationship between income concentration and private sector indebtedness, once other traditional drivers are controlled for. If confirmed, the implications of this result are as follows: (i) the view that the distribution of income is irrelevant to macroeconomic stability, as implicit in mainstream approaches, needs further investigation; and (ii) in order to make the financial system more robust, policy makers should cast the net wider than monetary policy and regulatory reforms and consider the effects of changes to distributive patterns.","[Perugini, Cristiano] Univ Perugia I, Perugia, Italy; [Perugini, Cristiano] FREN, Belgrade, Serbia; [Hoelscher, Jens] Bournemouth Univ, Poole BH12 5BB, Dorset, England; [Collie, Simon] Univ Brighton, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England",University of Perugia; Bournemouth University; University of Brighton,"Perugini, C (通讯作者)，Univ Perugia I, Dept Econ, Via A Pascoli 20, I-06014 Perugia, Italy.",cristiano.perugini@unipg.it,"Perugini, Cristiano/AAH-5782-2021; Holscher, Jens/G-1834-2018","Collie, simon/0000-0001-7038-8707; Holscher, Jens/0000-0001-6689-8392",EU,EU(European Union (EU)),"University of Perugia (I), Italy and FREN, Belgrade, Serbia (CP), Bournemouth University, UK (JH) and University of Brighton, UK (SC).

One of the positive effects of globalization is to ensure economic growth by increasing the ability of a society to produce goods and services to meet human needs, as well as by promoting efficiency and productivity and to create favourable conditions for foreign investment. Generally accepted measure of economic growth is the growth of real gross domestic product GDP. Benefit from economic growth and economic development is the improvement of the living standard, better social situation and greater public safety. In this paper we present the different measures of economic growth and the measures that affect the welfare of the country. The basic measure is the gross domestic product growth, but it alone does not guarantee an increase in living standards and social welfare. Therefore, a more effective measure of the benefits of economic growth describing more accurately its dimension is GDP per capita. However, some thinks that the GDP per capita is inaccurate indicator of welfare in the country. Therefore, in this paper we present the other selected indicators that are: the Human Development Index (MI) and a measure of Net Economic Welfare (NEW). To assess the impact of globalization on economic growth and welfare of its citizens in this paper we measure the acceleration of growth and welfare in the countries of the Group of Seven and Russia (until 2014 Group of Eight), BRICS (Russia, China, Brazil, India, South Africa), in the European Union and in countries of the Visegrad Group.","[Przybylska-Mazur, Agnieszka] Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland",University of Economics in Katowice,"Przybylska-Mazur, A (通讯作者)，Univ Econ Katowice, Dept Stat & Math Methods Econ, Ul 1 Maja 50, PL-40287 Katowice, Poland.",agnieszka.przybylska-mazur@ue.katowice.pl,"Przybylska-Mazur, Agnieszka/AAD-1816-2022",,,,,,17,2,2,1,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1816,1823,,,,,,8,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800225,0

Taking into consideration the taxation procedure, there is a difference mostly in the set-up of the tax base for the calculation of the tax liability. In the Czech Republic, the tax is calculated from a gross salary increased by an insurance paid by an employer, which results into the tax base increase so called super-gross salary. Then, the principle of the super-gross income means the determination base for the tax imposed on incomes of physical persons from the dependent activity is a gross salary increased by social security and health insurance making 34%. On the other hand, in the Slovak Republic the taxable salary is represented by a gross salary decreased by a value of the insurance paid by an employee and a non-taxable part of the tax base. In both countries, primarily in the field of the non-taxable parts of the tax base and tax allowances there are lots of differences that have an impact on the calculation of the net income of an employee. Concerning the payments of health and social insurance there are a lot of similarities in both countries, namely in the area of an amount of the insurance which oscillates around the same level.","[Psenkova, Yvetta] VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic",Technical University of Ostrava,"Psenková, Y (通讯作者)，VSB Tech Univ Ostrava, Fac Econ, Dept Accounting, Sokolska Trida 33, Ostrava 70200 1, Czech Republic.",yvetta.psenkova@vsb.cz,"Psenkova, Yvetta/G-2244-2018","Psenkova, Yvetta/0000-0003-3650-8124",,,,,11,6,6,0,2,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,1832,+,,,,,,3,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800227,0

One general conclusion has been that open economy considerations weaken the potential for a wage-led growth regime. However, this literature has largely ignored asset portfolio considerations and the stock and flow interactions that result from the feedback from savings to wealth and from wealth to the current account. This study develops a theoretical framework that specifies a fuller system of (instantaneous) flow equilibria embedded in a medium-run framework with stable steady-state stocks of real and financial assets. The balance-of-payments constraint that results ensures that simply raising the wage does not yield a higher stock of real capital. A lower markup may increase the steady-state stock of capital but only through the relative price channel. These results are much stronger than those derived in the existing literature, and more important, emerge regardless of whether the demand regime is wage-led or profit-led in the absence of international trade.","[Razmi, Arslan] Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA USA",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Amherst,"Razmi, A (通讯作者)，Univ Massachusetts, Dept Econ, Amherst, MA USA.",,,,,,,,13,2,2,0,0,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0160-3477,1557-7821,,J POST KEYNESIAN EC,J.

In this review, we first use the theory to present a unified treatment of the welfare effects of UI benefit levels and durations and derive convenient expressions of the full disincentive effect of UI. We then discuss recent estimates of the effect of UI benefit levels and durations on labor supply based on newly available administrative data and quasi-experimental research designs. Although our review of the new estimates confirms the range of negative labor supply effects of the previous literature, we show, based on the model, that these estimates are imperfect proxies for the actual disincentive effects. We also discuss several active areas of research on UI. These include the effect of UI on aggregate labor market outcomes, its effect on job outcomes, its long-term effects, its effects under nonstandard behavioral assumptions, and its interactions with other programs. We isolate several additional areas in need of further research, including estimates of the social value of UI, as well as the effects of UI in less developed countries.","[Schmieder, Johannes F.] Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA; [von Wachter, Till] Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Econ, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",Boston University; University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Schmieder, JF (通讯作者)，Boston Univ, Dept Econ, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",johannes@bu.edu; tvwachter@econ.ucla.edu,,,,,,,104,62,83,2,45,ANNUAL REVIEWS,PALO ALTO,"4139 EL CAMINO WAY, PO BOX 10139, PALO ALTO, CA 94303-0897 USA",1941-1383,,978-0-8243-4608-9,ANNU REV ECON,Annu.

This paper attempts to reveal a broader theoretical approach on the links between the spiritual intelligence of the leader and an organization's service quality. The scientific basis of the paper is the integration of two key insights related to different areas - spiritual intelligence and an organization's service quality. The problem of the paper is formulated as a question: what is the manifestation of the links between the spiritual intelligence of the leader and an organization's service quality? The aim of the paper was to disclose the manifestation of aforementioned links in the formed conceptual model of the interaction between the spiritual intelligence of the leader and an organization's service quality. The aim was achieved by performing the scientific literature analysis, synthesis, summary, comparison and interpretation of data. The analysis of scientific literature showed that SI touches core challenges currently faced by businesses, stimulates all areas of life, and gives individuals the ability to succeed in dealing with extraordinary situations. The importance of SI for the service quality of an organization is supported by the customers' satisfaction and perceptions of the quality of services, - which are significantly influenced by the behavior and attitudes of the service organization's employees - especially the leaders. The expression of the links between spiritual intelligence of the leader and an organization's service quality was revealed along with further research directions.","[Silingiene, Violeta; Skeriene, Sandrita] Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Silingiene, V; Skeriene, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, K Donelaicio St 73, LT-44029 Kaunas, Lithuania.",violeta.silingiene@ktu.lt; sandrita.skeriene@gmail.com,,,,,,,67,5,15,1,19,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

At the same time, the business cycle influences the commodity and asset prices. Whereas empirical evidence on the effect of commodity and asset prices on the long-run economic growth is ambiguous, most of the previous researches highlight a positive correlation in the short run. The aim of this article is to disentangle the short- and long-run co-movements between US historical business cycles and commodity and asset prices over the period 1859-2013. For this purpose, we use a time-frequency approach and we test the historical influence of oil, gold, housing and stock prices over the output growth. In contrast to other studies, we control for the effect of other prices and monetary conditions, using the wavelet partial coherency. In line with the previous works, we discover that co-movements between economic growth and commodity and assets prices manifest especially in the short run. We also find that stock returns and housing prices have a more powerful effect on the US economic growth rate than the oil and gold prices. The long-run co-movements are documented especially around the World War II. Finally, when controlling for the influence of the interest rate, inflation and other commodity and asset prices, co-movements become weaker in the short run. In general, the oil and housing prices lead the GDP growth, the US output leads the gold prices, while there is no clear causality direction between business cycle and stock prices.","[Tiwari, Aviral K.] IFHE Univ, IBS Hyderabad, Fac Management, Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India; [Albulescu, Claudiu T.] Politeh Univ Timisoara, Dept Management, Timisoara, Romania; [Gupta, Rangan] Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa",The ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education (IFHE); ICFAI Business School (IBS); Polytechnic University of Timisoara; University of Pretoria,"Gupta, R (通讯作者)，Univ Pretoria, Dept Econ, ZA-0002 Pretoria, South Africa.",rangan.gupta@up.ac.za,"ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/AAI-7850-2020; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/C-5556-2011","ALBULESCU, Claudiu Tiberiu/0000-0003-2875-1749; Tiwari, Aviral Kumar/0000-0002-1822-9263",,,,,75,15,15,2,19,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

The presence of women on corporate boards and their impact on enhancing the value constituent are critical attributes of a well-functioning board and a measure of sound corporate governance (CG). To a large extent, the value-based model of CG is affected by how corporate board directors pursue ethical values. The paper makes an attempt to consider whether the board gender diversity enhances or hinders the development of civilized relations within the firm. A combination of key shareholders' attitudes, beliefs and values and stakeholders' values seems to be an important prerequisite of value-based CG. In the first part of the article we overview recent efforts to increase the participation of women in boardrooms across the globe and present international evidence on how diversity of gender helps enhance workforce talent, streamlines decision-making, and strengthens a company's image. Though regulations and legislation to increase gender diversity on boards worldwide are changing the complexion of directors in some countries, the number of female directors is still relatively low- an average 12 percent. Then in the second part of the article we focus on a country-specific study and present the case of Russia. In Russian corporate boards the women's representation figure is twice as low as an average - women hold only 5.7 percent of corporate board seats. Special emphasis will be put on functioning women on boards of Russian companies with state participation.","[Tkachenko, Irina] Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8 Marta Str,Off 566, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia; [Pervukhina, Irina] Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8 Marta Str,Off 454, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia",Ural State University of Economics; Ural State University of Economics,"Tkachenko, I (通讯作者)，Ural State Univ Econ, 62,8 Marta Str,Off 566, Ekaterinburg 620144, Russia.",tkachenko@usue.ru; ivp@usue.ru,"Tkachenko, Irina N./B-3622-2017",,,,,,23,1,1,0,4,"UNIV ZILINA, FAC OPERATION & ECONOMICS TRANSPORT & COMMUNICATION",ZILINA,"UNIVERITIZNA 1, ZILINA, 010 01, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-8154-191-9,,,,2016,,,,,,,2198,2203,,,,,,6,Economics,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics,BG9IE,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000393253800273,0

We apply conditional extreme value theory (EVT) approach on daily returns of six stock market indices from SEE between 2004 and 2013. Predictive performance of value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) based on EVT is compared against several alternatives, such as historical simulation and analytical approach based on GARCH with a single conditional distribution. Model backtesting with daily returns shows that EVT-based models provide more reliable VaR and ES forecasts than the alternative models in all six markets. Unlike the alternatives, the EVT-based models cannot be rejected as VaR confidence level is increased. This emphasizes the importance of extreme events in SEE markets and indicates that the ability of a model to capture volatility clustering accurately is not sufficient for a correct assessment of risk in these markets.","[Totic, Selena] Univ Belgrade, Fac Org Sci, Belgrade, Serbia; [Bozovic, Milos] Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia",University of Belgrade; University of Belgrade,"Bozovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Belgrade, Fac Econ, Belgrade, Serbia.",milosbozovic@ekof.bg.ac.rs,"Božović, Miloš/AAI-9753-2020","Božović, Miloš/0000-0002-5087-1977","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [179005]","Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia","MB acknowledges financial support of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development of the Republic of Serbia [grant number 179005].",,48,8,10,0,10,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0003-6846,1466-4283,,APPL ECON,Appl.

To support such an assertion, I draw upon a specific Veblen-Minsky approach to a credit-money economy and its endogenous fragilities. I also maintain that, when financial markets are liberalized and private-interests-related self-regulation replaces public macro-prudential supervision, the financial system undergoes institutional deadlock and the ensuing confusion is transformed into a market gridlock. Markets then become unable to recover without public rescue operations of banks. The subsequent negative economic and social consequences are beyond the limits of any acceptable liberal ideology and scientific understanding. Therefore, systemic stability calls for a tighter macro-regulatory framework to remove the domination of speculative finance over economic decisions and activities.","[Ulgen, Faruk] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Dept Int Relat & Convent, St Martin Dheres, France",Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA),"Ülgen, F (通讯作者)，Univ Grenoble Alpes, Dept Int Relat & Convent, St Martin Dheres, France.",,"Ulgen, Faruk/T-9908-2019","ULGEN, Faruk/0000-0003-2625-6293",,,,,20,3,4,0,6,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0021-3624,1946-326X,,J ECON ISSUES,J.

This understanding is important because airlines must decide what design of loyalty program to choose in order to maximize the revenue, profit and the number of passengers. The authors develop and test theory proposing that specific design of loyalty program ensures better organizational performance. The purpose of this study is to examine the influence of loyalty programs on organizational performance of airlines. The methods of systemic analysis of scientific literature, secondary data analysis, comparative analysis, content analysis were used in order to reach the set purpose. Using a sample of airlines in the Baltic States, we conduct an empirical investigation of the influence of customer loyalty programs on organizational performance in airlines. The Mann-Whitney test was used to examine the differences within the organizational performance by the fact of holding a loyalty program. The results indicate that differences in loyalty programs matter. Airlines having a loyalty program can boast of a higher number of passengers carried than the ones that do not. Surprisingly no statistically significant relations were found between holding a loyalty program and airlines' revenue, profit. It follows that airlines must consider these effects before the allocation of long-term investments into customer loyalty programs.","[Vilkaite-Vaitone, Neringa; Papsiene, Palmira] Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania",Vilnius Gediminas Technical University,"Vilkaite-Vaitone, N; Papsiene, P (通讯作者)，Vilnius Gediminas Tech Univ, Sauletekio Ave 11, LT-10223 Vilnius, Lithuania.",neringavilkaite@gmail.com; palmira.papsiene@gmail.com,"Vilkaite-Vaitone, Neringa/C-4083-2015; Vilkaite, Neringa/ADU-5140-2022; Vilkaite-Vaitone, Neringa/GYA-4830-2022","Vilkaite-Vaitone, Neringa/0000-0002-4208-149X; Papsiene, Palmira/0000-0002-6824-4250",,,,,51,5,5,4,34,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

The concept explores the ways in which knowledge is involved in innovation processes and knowledge flows within and between organisations. Some limitation of this concept can be the fact that there is no clear method for identification of knowledge bases in regions. The aim of this paper is to propose appropriate indicators and methodology to empirically identify the knowledge base of a region. The second aim of this paper is to use this methodology for the identification of knowledge bases in the Czech regions. The methods used for the classification include the point method and cluster analysis. Based on the combination of these methods, the Czech regions are classified into four groups - those with a prevailing analytical, synthetic, analytical-synthetic, and synthetic-analytical knowledge base. The Capital City of Prague, the South Bohemian Region, and the South Moravian Region were among the ones with an analytical base. A synthetic knowledge base was identified in the Liberec Region, the Zlin Region, and the Vysocina Region. One of the two transitional types was found in the remaining regions. In real-life practice the findings can be applied, above all, to the implementation of regional innovation policies, which should always respect the characteristics of the given region.","[Zitek, Vladimir] Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Econ Policy & Publ Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic; [Klimova, Viktorie] Masaryk Univ, Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Fac Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic",Masaryk University Brno; Masaryk University Brno,"Zitek, V (通讯作者)，Masaryk Univ, Fac Econ & Adm, Econ Policy & Publ Econ, Dept Reg Econ & Adm, Lipova 41a, CZ-60200 Brno, Czech Republic.",zitek@econ.muni.cz; klimova@econ.muni.cz,"Zitek, Vladimir/I-5431-2015; Klimova, Viktorie/I-4345-2015","Zitek, Vladimir/0000-0003-4724-2210; Klimova, Viktorie/0000-0002-2880-0371",,,,,38,2,2,0,15,KAUNAS UNIV TECHNOL,KAUNAS,"LAISVES AL 55, KAUNAS, 44309, LITHUANIA",1392-2785,2029-5839,,INZ EKON,Inz.

Using a panel of 89 countries from 1973 to 2005, we find that, overall, while the implementation of financial liberalisation policies significantly raises the public debt growth rate, the adoption of financial re-regulation measures does not reduce it in a significant manner. Looking at the different typologies of financial sector policy changes, we show that restrictions to international capital flows contribute to a decline in the growth rate of public debt In contrast, the removal of entry barriers boosts public debt growth. Finally, our results suggest that financial reversals may help to reduce the growth rate of public debt only when the public debt-to-GDP ratio or the inflation rate is high. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The major difficulty in empirically assessing the relationship between incomes and saving rates is to construct a credible proxy for long-run income-purged of transitory fluctuations and measurement error. The Canadian Family Expenditure Survey provides us with both unusually good data on savings rates and potential predictors with which we can construct reliable long-run income proxies. Our empirical analysis suggests that the estimated relationship between saving rates and long-run incomes is sensitive to the predictor used to proxy long-run income. Nevertheless, our preferred estimates indicate that, except for poorest households (who simply do not save), saving rates do not differ substantially across predicted long-run income groups.","[Alan, Sule; Crossley, Thomas F.] Univ Essex, Colchester CO4 3SQ, Essex, England; [Atalay, Kadir] Univ Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Crossley, Thomas F.] Inst Fiscal Studies, London, England",University of Essex; University of Sydney; University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Atalay, K (通讯作者)，Univ Sydney, Sch Econ, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.",kadir.atalay@sydney.edu.au,,"Crossley, Thomas/0000-0003-0952-7450; Atalay, Kadir/0000-0001-7769-1450",Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney; Social and Economic Dimensions of an Aging Population (SEDAP) Research Program at McMaster University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC); ESRC (CPP) [RES-544-28-5001]; Economic and Social Research Council [RES-544-28-5001] Funding Source: researchfish,Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at the University of Sydney; Social and Economic Dimensions of an Aging Population (SEDAP) Research Program at McMaster University; Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)); ESRC (CPP); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"For helpful comments and suggestions we thank Kevin Milligan, Yuri Ostrovsky, and Garry Barrett, as well as the editor Robert Hill and two anonymous referees.

I consider these concerns as a benchmark for national preferences, and thus for the preferences of national central bankers in the EMU. I also test the existence of groups of national media (i.e., national publics) according to their shared expressed concerns. The results show that in the euro zone, similar concerns are shared by different country groups, corresponding to a group of countries from Northern Europe (Belgium, Finland, and the Netherlands), Southern Europe (Spain and Portugal), and the Periphery (Italy, Greece, and Ireland), but that there are two isolated countries (France and Germany), whose newspapers do not share the issues raised by the rest of the European newspapers.

We show that the presence of tax havens generates two conflicting channels in determining the growth effect. First, the public investment effect states that tax havens may erode tax revenues and in turn decrease the government's infrastructure expenditure, thereby reducing growth. Second, the tax planning effect of tax havens reduces marginal cost of capital and hence encourages capital accumulation so as to spur economic growth. The overall growth effect is ambiguous and is determined by the extent of these two effects. The welfare analysis shows that tax havens are more likely to be welfare-enhancing if the government expenditure share in production is low, or the initial income tax rate is high. Moreover, the welfare-maximizing income tax rate is lower than the growth-maximizing income tax rate if tax havens are present.","[Chu, Hsun] Tunghai Univ, Dept Econ, Taichung 40704, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Chengchi Univ, Acad Sinica, Inst Econ, Taipei, Taiwan; [Lai, Ching-Chong] Natl Sun Yat Sen Univ, Inst Econ, Kaohsiung 80424, Taiwan; [Cheng, Chu-Chuan] Feng Chia Univ, Taipei, Taiwan",Tunghai University; Academia Sinica - Taiwan; National Chengchi University; National Sun Yat Sen University; Feng Chia University,"Chu, H (通讯作者)，Tunghai Univ, Dept Econ, 1727,Sec 4,Taiwan Blvd, Taichung 40704, Taiwan.",hchu0824@gmail.com,,,,,,,40,4,4,0,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1097-3923,1467-9779,,J PUBLIC ECON THEORY,J.

In this setting, consumers' price elasticity of demand for a good is increasing in the good's relative price level, which affects the desired price markup of firms. In the literature, this setting is mainly used to improve the NK models in matching sluggishness of prices in the data. Our paper analyzes the monetary policy implications of the model. It is shown that unlike the cases of real wage rigidity and exogenous markup shocks, the endogenous markup setting does not improve the NK models in generating the inflation-output trade-off. It is also discussed that the optimal monetary policy in this environment is to target the flexible price equilibrium. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, we estimate a so-called steady-state Beveridge curve based on labour market flows. An outward shift of this curve implies decreasing matching efficiency. Second, we construct a mismatch index which enables us to calculate the contribution of sector mismatch to the increase in unemployment. Our analyses show little support for the hypothesis that mismatch is currently a significant problem for the Dutch labour market. At the aggregate level, the Beveridge curve has not shifted outwards. In addition, at most one-ninth of the Dutch unemployment rise can be attributed to sector mismatch, which is comparable to the contribution during the previous downturn.","[Erken, Hugo] Rabobank, Utrecht, Netherlands; [van Loon, Eric; Verbeek, Wouter] CPB Netherlands Bur Econ Policy Anal, The Hague, Netherlands",CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy,"Erken, H (通讯作者)，Rabobank, Utrecht, Netherlands.",h.p.g.erken@rn.rabobank.nl,,,,,,,43,7,7,0,15,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0013-063X,1572-9982,,ECONOMIST-NETHERLAND,Economist-Netherlands,DEC,2015,163,4,,,SI,,435,459,,10.1007/s10645-015-9257-9,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CW7MV,,Green Submitted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000365184200003,0

We show only a small negative reaction to these later stories, mostly in the two weeks following their publication.

The drug was associated with an incremental increase in life expectancy of four months. Drugs like ipilimumab have fueled the perception that the launch prices of new anticancer drugs and other drugs in the so-called specialty pharmaceutical market have been increasing over time and that increases are unrelated to the magnitude of the expected health benefits. In this paper, we discuss the unique features of the market for anticancer drugs and assess trends in the launch prices for 58 anticancer drugs approved between 1995 and 2013 in the United States. We restrict attention to anticancer drugs because the use of median survival time as a primary outcome measure provides a common, objective scale for quantifying the incremental benefit of new products. We find that the average launch price of anticancer drugs, adjusted for inflation and health benefits, increased by 10 percent annually-or an average of $8,500 per year-from 1995 to 2013. We argue that the institutional features of the market for anticancer drugs enable manufacturers to set the prices of new products at or slightly above the prices of existing therapies, giving rise to an upward trend in launch prices. Government-mandated price discounts for certain classes of buyers may have also contributed to launch price increases as firms sought to offset the growth in the discount segment by setting higher prices for the remainder of the market.","[Howard, David H.] Emory Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Howard, David H.] Emory Univ, Dept Econ, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA; [Bach, Peter B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Bach, Peter B.] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Ctr Hlth Policy & Outcomes, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Berndt, Ernst R.] MIT, Sloan Sch Management, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Conti, Rena M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Pediat, Chicago, IL 60637 USA; [Conti, Rena M.] Univ Chicago, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",Emory University; Rollins School Public Health; Emory University; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); University of Chicago; University of Chicago,"Howard, DH (通讯作者)，Emory Univ, Dept Hlth Policy & Management, Rollins Sch Publ Hlth, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.",david.howard@emory.edu; bachp@mskcc.org; eberndt@mit.edu; rconti@uchicago.edu,,"Conti, Rena/0000-0002-4190-1839",,,,,79,309,329,3,176,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",0895-3309,1944-7965,,J ECON PERSPECT,J.

He establishes that the unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the endogenous timing game corresponds to the simultaneous Nash equilibrium.

Highlighting the role of plain complementarity or substitutability, we obtain conditions under which leadership still emerges at the equilibrium of the endogenous timing game when capital ownership is considered.

The indices, and related relative income change (RIC) curves, are based on ratios of generalized mean incomes between two groups, which render them closely related to Zenga's inequality measures and Lorenz curve comparisons, when arithmetic means are used.

Buyers search sequentially for sellers but do not meet every seller with the same probability. Specifically, a fraction of the buyers' meetings lead to one particular large seller, while the remaining meetings lead to one of continuum of small sellers. In this environment, the small sellers would like to set a price that makes the buyers indifferent between purchasing the good and searching for another seller. The large seller would like to price the small sellers out of the market by posting a price that is low enough to induce buyers not to purchase from the small sellers. These incentives give rise to a game of cat-and-mouse, whose only equilibrium involves mixed strategies for both the large and the small sellers. The fact that the small sellers play mixed strategies implies that there is price dispersion. The fact that the large seller plays mixed strategies implies that prices and allocations vary over time. We show that the fraction of the gains from trade accruing to the buyers is positive and nonmonotonic in the degree of market power of the large seller. As long as the large seller has some positive but incomplete market power, the fraction of the gains from trade accruing to the buyers depends in a natural way on the extent of search frictions.

This study addresses this question from the perspective of equilibrium determinacy. In the model we use, prices are sticky and the working capital of firms is subject to asset values because of a lack of commitment. If credit market imperfections exist to a small degree, the Taylor principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium determinacy, and monetary policy response to asset price fluctuations is good from the perspective of equilibrium determinacy. However, if credit market imperfections exist to a large degree such that the collateral constraint is binding, then the Taylor principle no longer guarantees equilibrium determinacy, and monetary policy response to asset price fluctuations becomes a source of equilibrium indeterminacy. We find that the existence of credit market imperfections makes it unsuitable to initiate a monetary policy response to deal with asset price fluctuations. We also find that reductions in credit market imperfections can enlarge the indeterminacy region of the model parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While the cyclical adjustment literature has suggested a strong response of the primary surplus to the output gap, the time-series literature has tended to report a far smaller response. However, recent theoretical findings suggest that some of this difference may be due to the way in which the time-series literature has typically handled the issue of autocorrelation, in a way which is incompatible with the timing of automatic stabilizers. In order to find a way around this problem, we formulate and estimate a set of fiscal policy reaction functions for the euro area, which allow for the primary surplus to feature three components: a fast-moving (stabilizing) response to the output gap, a consolidating response to the debt-GDP ratio, and an exogenous, persistent fiscal policy shifter. When we formulate a fiscal reaction function in this way, our estimates are compatible in magnitude with previous estimates from the cyclical adjustment literature. Furthermore, based on a set of model comparison exercises in line with what has been done in the monetary policy literature, we argue that our specification explains the data better than does the more commonly used specification.

A parsimonious theory is developed based on asymmetric information between employers about the quantity of training. The labor market is modeled as a common value auction with an informed and an uninformed bidder. The novel feature of the game is that one of the bidders can make an unobservable investment that increases the value of the item before the auction. By randomizing the amount of training provided, an employer can create an endogenous adverse selection problem, enabling it to compress the wage structure and capture some returns from its training investment. The model generates continuous equilibrium wage and training distributions, and identical employees can receive different wage offers and training levels. A parametric example is used to illustrate how the shape of the wage distribution depends on the elasticity of production with respect to human capital. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The model generates a skill premium as well as residual wage inequality among identical workers. A trade liberalization increases the skill premium and likely increases residual inequality among high-skilled workers. The calibrated model generates results consistent with the prior literature examining the effect of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement on the Canadian labour market: a significant decrease in employment in manufacturing, but only a small change in unemployment and wages.","[Ritter, Moritz] Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Temple University,"Ritter, M (通讯作者)，Temple Univ, Dept Econ, Philadelphia, PA 19122 USA.",moritz.ritter@temple.edu,,,,,,,28,2,4,2,14,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0008-4085,1540-5982,,CAN J ECON,Can.

The efficacy of a drug is based on scientific evidence as well as on patient-specific characteristics. Patients do not possess information on either dimension of efficacy. Pharmaceutical firms observe the scientific data and use DTCA to convey this information to patients. Doctors observe both the scientific data and patient-specific characteristics, and provide treatment recommendations. We develop a model in which DTCA is followed by a doctor-patient signalling game. We show that truth-in-advertising regulation increases the credibility of DTCA and may increase both doctor-patient conflict and prescriptions for an expensive new drug-a market-stealing effect.

In light of a well-established TCE model, four attributes of transactions (i.e., asset-specificity, uncertainty, complexity, and frequency) are examined for three unregulated transactions between generating firms and final consumers. The qualitative analysis of attributes unfolds into a comparative analysis of theory-predicted governance strategies versus strategies observed in the marketplace. It is argued that Williamson's model continues to effectively predict the most efficient governance strategy in the sense of minimizing transaction costs and safeguarding idiosyncratic assets. Misalignment between theory predictions and observations, however, suggests that two additional concepts - implementability and reputation - must be examined alongside with Williamson's four attributes of transactions in order to better explain strategic decisions in Brazil's electricity market. Capital availability, existence of compatible partners, and reputation play crucial roles in explaining those decisions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[Signorini, Guilherme; Ross, R.

They specify a numerical model, with probability distributions of all parameters. The model is executed 30,000 times, and results are reported as probability of an outcome, based on the sample distribution. In order to ground the results in reality, the authors apply the model to Kenya. They show that preferential commitments in services could be immizerising.

A closer inspection of the data reveals that the weak results for the EU15 stem from comparisons with the US - the US has been able to generate a stronger growth response from its R&D spending. Possible explanations for the US advantage include higher private sector investment in R&D and stronger public-private sector linkages than in the EU. Hence, to reduce the innovation gap vis-beta-vis the US, it may not be enough for the EU to raise the share of R&D expenditures in GDP: continuous improvements in the European innovation system will also be needed, with focus on areas like private sector R&D and public-private sector linkages.","[Kokko, Ari] Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson] Sodertorn Univ, Stockholm, Sweden; [Tingvall, Patrik Gustavsson; Videnord, Josefin] Ratio Inst, Stockholm, Sweden; [Videnord, Josefin] Uppsala Univ, Uppsala, Sweden",Copenhagen Business School; Sodertorn University; Uppsala University,"Kokko, A (通讯作者)，Copenhagen Business Sch, Copenhagen, Denmark.",ako.int@cbs.dk,,"Kokko, Ari/0000-0003-4085-2868",,,,,63,14,14,2,8,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 18,2015,9,,,,,,,,201540.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-40,0.0,,,28,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY6ZN,,"Green Submitted, gold, Green Published",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366557400001,0

The five main findings are: (1) over the past two decades, much effort has gone into identifying the causal effects of school inputs; this work has produced results and should be expanded. (2) That said, particularly when it originates in small-scale experiments, such work is unlikely to produce a full road map for an evidence-based education policy. (3) There has been less work on the effects of educational inputs at the pre-school stage, and this may be a greater constraint to sound policy than at first appears. (4) There has also been progress on understanding the effects of incentives within education. (5) There is relatively less work surrounding the effects of inputs provided by parents and students, both in terms of resources and effort.","[Urquiola, Miguel] Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA; [Urquiola, Miguel] Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Urquiola, M (通讯作者)，Columbia Univ, New York, NY 10027 USA.;Urquiola, M (通讯作者)，Natl Bur Econ Res, New York, NY 10027 USA.",msu2101@columbia.edu,,,Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),Inter-American Development Bank (IDB),"The author thanks Sebastian Galiani, Patrick McEwan, and an anonymous referee for useful comments and suggestions.

The region is undergoing a demographic and epidemiological transition in which health problems are highly concentrated on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In light of this, the region faces two main challenges: (1) develop cost-effective policies to prevent NCD risk factors, and (2) increase access to quality healthcare in a scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the informal sector. This paper describes both alternative interventions to expand health insurance coverage and their trade-off with labor informality and moral hazard problems. The paper also focuses on obesity as a case example of an NCD, and emphasizes how lack of knowledge along with self-control problems would lead people to make suboptimal decisions related to food consumption, which may later manifest in obesity problems.","[Victoria Anauati, Maria; Weinschelbaum, Federico] Univ San Andres, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina; [Galiani, Sebastian] Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Galiani, Sebastian] NBER, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",Universidad de San Andres Argentina; University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park; National Bureau of Economic Research,"Galiani, S (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Dept Econ, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.;Galiani, S (通讯作者)，NBER, 3105 Tydings Hall, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",galiani@econ.umd.edu,"weinschelbaum, federico/S-5361-2019",,,,,,112,22,25,0,13,CENTRO INVESTIGACION & DOCENCIA ECONOMICAS-CIDE,CIUDAD DE MEXICO,"CARR MEXICO-TOLUCA 3655, SANTA FE, ALTAVISTA, CIUDAD DE MEXICO, ALVARO OBREGON, MEXICO",2198-3526,2196-436X,,LAT AM ECON REV,Latin.

Multidimensional poverty is measured in the dimensions of health, education, living standard and household environment using eight indicators and Alkire-Foster methodology. The unique contributions of the paper are inclusion of a direct economic variable (consumption expenditure, work and employment) to quantify the living standard dimension, decomposition of MPI across the dimensions and the indicators, and estimates of multidimensional poverty at the sub-national level. Results indicate that 43% of India's population are multidimensional poor with large regional variations. The average intensity of poverty was 45.5% with a MPI value of 19.3. Six states in India-Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and West Bengal who have a share of 45% of the total population-account for 58% of the multidimensional poor. Across regions, more than 70% of the population are multidimensional poor in the southern region of Chhattisgarh and the Ranchi plateau, while they comprise less than 10% in the regions of Manipur, Mizoram and Chandigarh. The economic poor have a weak association with health and household environment dimensions. The decomposition of MPI indicates that the economic dimension accounts for 22%, the health dimension accounts for 36%, the education dimension accounts for 11% and the household environment accounts for 31% of the deprivation. Based on these analyses, the authors suggest target based interventions in the poor regions to reduce poverty and inequality in India.","[Dehury, Bidyadhar; Mohanty, Sanjay K.] IIPS, Bombay, Maharashtra, India",International Institute for Population Sciences,"Mohanty, SK (通讯作者)，IIPS, Bombay, Maharashtra, India.",sanjayiips@yahoo.co.in,"Mohanty, Sanjay K/AAR-7658-2020","Mohanty, Sanjay K/0000-0001-9041-5952; Dehury, Bidyadhar/0000-0001-8708-6115",,,,,42,20,20,1,30,KIEL INST WORLD ECONOMY,KIEL,"HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL, D-24105, GERMANY",1864-6042,,,ECONOMICS-KIEL,Economics,NOV 10,2015,9,,,,,,,,201536.0,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2015-36,0.0,,,35,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CY6ZG,,"Green Submitted, gold",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366556700001,0

We find that the social influence of an agent is positively affected by the number of individuals she listens to.

In a similar case study of pantry staples such as salt and sugar, we show that chefs devote 12 percentage points less of their purchases to national brands than demographically similar nonchefs. We extend our analysis to cover 50 retail health categories and 241 food and drink categories. The results suggest that misinformation and related consumer mistakes explain a sizable share of the brand premium for health products, and a much smaller share for most food and drink products.

We find evidence that the impact of a TT would not be monotonic. A TT may be a good instrument to stabilize foreign exchange volatility only in normal times and/or in efficient markets. In contrast, a TT could be counterproductive in turbulent periods by increasing the volatility. In addition, by comparing a major currency pair (euro/dollar) and a minor currency pair (won/dollar), it appears that the potential stabilizing effect of a TT would be more clear-cut in the low volatility regime of a major currency pair, similar to the euro/dollar. Our results do not corroborate the previous studies that derived a monotonic and positive impact of a TT on volatility.","[Damette, Olivier] CNRS, BETA, Nancy, France; [Park, Beum-Jo] Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); Universite de Lorraine; Dankook University,"Park, BJ (通讯作者)，Dankook Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",bjpark@dankook.ac.kr,,"Damette, Olivier/0000-0002-7520-3780",Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea [NRF-2015S1A3A2046715]; BETA-CNRS; ERUDITE,"Ministry of Education of the Republic of Korea(Ministry of Education (MOE), Republic of Korea); National Research Foundation of Korea(National Research Foundation of Korea); BETA-CNRS; ERUDITE","The authors wish to warmly thank Jose Olmo for his help with the programming and they are also grateful to an anonymous referee and the Editor, Peter Egger, for useful comments on an earlier draft of the paper.

In this paper, I provide a definition of a good job based on various theories of the labour market: a job that involves a surplus captured partly by the worker. I use that definition to guide an empirical investigation of the existence and importance of good jobs. I conclude that good jobs do exist-that the labour market does not just function according to a Roy model with wage differentials reflecting only skill differentials, compensating differentials or bond posting-and that their impact on the overall wage structure is substantial.

It shows that there are two key factors at the center of the mechanism for the sudden U.S. transition from counter-cyclical to a-cyclical price movement in the early 1980s. First, the cost pass-through policy has been changed to ensure that the cyclical changes of input prices and/or labor productivity are absorbed more thoroughly and are thus reflected more frequently in profit markups than occurred prior to 1984. This relatively increased adaptability of the profit markups in the aggregate sense between the pricing periods cushions the direct effect of cyclical changes in the cost base on price cyclicality. Second, a structural change in the U.S. labor productivity's cyclical property has generated cost-base stability during the post-1984 period. Declines in hiring and firing costs and cutbacks in social security benefits have led the labor discipline effect to dominate the labor hoarding effect. This has allowed labor productivity to increase as the unemployment rate rises; thus, the cost base cyclicality has weakened, and prices have become less cyclical since 1984.","Korea Inst Local Finance, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea",,"Gu, GC (通讯作者)，Korea Inst Local Finance, Dept Econ, Seoul, South Korea.",gyun.gu@gmail.com,,"Gu, Gyun Cheol/0000-0002-9211-9097",,,,,57,1,1,0,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0026-1386,1467-999X,,METROECONOMICA,Metroeconomica,NOV,2015,66,4,,,,,661,685,,10.1111/meca.12086,0.0,,,25,Economics,Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics,CS8YL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362375700004,0

Unlike previous studies, we assume that the investment decision is made before the ETS is in place, and we allow CCS operating flexibility for new power plant investments. Thus, the plant may be run in CCS-off mode if carbon prices are low. We employ Monte Carlo simulation methods to account for uncertainties in the prices of CO2 certificates, other inputs, and output prices, relying on a realistic parameterization for a supercritical pulverized coal plant in China. We find that CCS operating flexibility lowers the critical carbon price needed to support CCS investment because it renders CCS investment less irreversible. For a low carbon price path, operating flexibility also implies that delaying the introduction of an ETS hardly affects plant CO2 abatement since the plant operator is better off purchasing emission certificates rather than operating the plant in CCS mode. Interestingly, for low carbon prices we find a U-shaped relation between the length of the delay and the economic value of the plant. Thus, delaying the introduction of an ETS may make investors worse off. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unmitigated outage losses were estimated to be US$2.01-23.92 per kWh for firms engaging in self-generation, and range from US$1.54 to 32.46 per kWh for firms without self-generation. We also find that firms engaging in self-generation would have suffered additional 1-183% outage losses had they not invested in self-generation. On the other hand, firms without self-generation would have reduced their outage losses by around 6-46% if they had engaged in self-generation. Further analyses, however, reveal that, although engagement in self-generation reduced outage losses, a firm engaging in self-generation may still suffer a greater unmitigated outage loss relative to a firm without a backup generator. The relative outage losses depend on the relative vulnerability of the operations of the two sets of firms to power interruption, and the relative generating capacity of a self-generating firm to its own required electricity loads. Policy reforms that allow firms, whose operations are highly vulnerable to outages, to make a binding contract with utilities in order to get preferential supply are recommended.

For that purpose we built a general equilibrium heterogeneous-agent model capable of exploring the relationship between fiscal policy variables and the endogenous cross-section distribution of income and wealth. The results show a quite impressive positive welfare gain despite significant transition costs. The simulations point to an increase of inequality during the initial transition period, reversing to more compressed distributions as the economy evolves to its final steady state equilibrium. Overall, the welfare gains are slightly biased towards wealthier individuals. Furthermore empirical data on the dynamics of some crucial variables during the consolidation period lend support to the model simulation results.","[Viegas, Miguel] Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, DEGEI, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Paula] Univ Porto, CEFUP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; [Ribeiro, Ana Paula] Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade de Aveiro; Universidade do Porto; Universidade do Porto,"Viegas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Aveiro, GOVCOPP, DEGEI, Campus Univ Santiago, P-3810193 Aveiro, Portugal.",mlbv@ua.pt; aribeiro@fep.up.pt,,"Ribeiro, Ana Paula/0000-0002-8974-7420; Viegas, Miguel/0000-0003-1390-4992",,,,,33,1,1,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1869-4187,1869-4195,,SERIES-J SPAN ECON,Series-J.

First, individuals appear to be active thieves for extremely short periods - in most cases in only one year, and fewer than 5% of thieves for more than three years out of the 15 years of data. Second, self-reported earnings from theft are generally very low and there is little evidence of successful criminals or consistent earnings from theft. Third, measures that proxy impatience (smoking, for example) are highly correlated with theft. Fourthly, thieves and non-thieves have similar earnings during the years of peak theft activity, but thieves have lower earnings in their late 20s (after most have long since stopped committing theft). Attrition of survey respondents, underreporting and incapacitation effects do not appear to explain this. There may be professional thieves too rare to show up in even large samples such as the NLSY.

In this article, we present a broad picture of trade in value added between the EU28 and East Asian countries. We find that East Asia is important as a final demand and supply chain export destination, especially for Northern European countries, while for CEE countries it is more important as an import source for both final demand and supply chain trade. Trade with East Asia is least important for Southern European countries. The production structure of an EU country seems to be one of the main factors explaining the importance of supply chain trade with East Asian countries.

The result shows the import intensity of exports is the highest among all variables. Alone, however, it does not contribute to a larger fall in imports. The larger decline in imports is evident if other components of aggregate demand also fall, particularly investment and consumption. A weakened credit condition will also exacerbate the fall in imports. In crisis periods more nuanced results are evident. Fiscal contractions seemed to have worsened the fall in imports during the 1997/1998 Asian financial crisis, exacerbated further by the fall in exports.

In addition to the increase in average quality of admitted students, our results suggest that positive effects of an admission policy change largely operate through the impact of a better quality of social interactions at class level on the average individual performances. Results are robust to several checks. Compared with other studies using a similar approach, our own provides evidence that selective admission policies can induce different educational outcomes in diverse geographic areas of the same national system of higher education.","[Carrieri, Vincenzo; D'Amato, Marcello] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Salerno, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo; D'Amato, Marcello] Ctr Labour Econ & Econ Policy CELPE, Salerno, Italy; [Carrieri, Vincenzo] Univ York, HEDG, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [D'Amato, Marcello] Ctr Studies Econ & Finance, London, England; [Zotti, Roberto] Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, I-84084 Fisciano, SA, Italy",University of Salerno; University of York - UK; University of Salerno,"Carrieri, V (通讯作者)，Univ Salerno, Dept Econ & Stat, Salerno, Italy.",vcarrieri@unisa.it; damato@unisa.it; rzotti@unisa.it,"Carrieri, Vincenzo/AAS-9319-2021; Zotti, Roberto/JUU-2335-2023; D'Amato, Marcello/AAE-1108-2020","Carrieri, Vincenzo/0000-0001-8742-3820; D'AMATO, Marcello/0000-0002-5772-3897",,,,,58,8,9,0,12,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

We develop a model of neoclassical growth and trade in which lower tariffs lead to increased gross domestic product (GDP) per worker via comparative advantage and specialization, and capital accumulation. We calibrate the model and simulate the tariff reductions that occurred between early 1962 and 1989. The model can explain 17 percent of South Korea's catch-up to the G7 countries in value-added per worker in the manufacturing sector. These gains, as well as most of the welfare gains, are driven by two key transmission channels: multistage production and imported investment goods.","[Connolly, Michelle] Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Durham, NC 27708 USA; [Yi, Kei-Mu] Fed Reserve Bank Minneapolis, Res Dept, Minneapolis, MN 55401 USA",Duke University; Federal Reserve System - USA,"Connolly, M (通讯作者)，Duke Univ, Dept Econ, Box 90097, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",mconnoll@duke.edu; Kei-Mu.Yi@mpls.frb.org,,,,,,,70,21,24,0,19,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7707,1945-7715,,AM ECON J-MACROECON,Am.

An applicant's observable features are seen by a remote bank, while her true credit quality is known only to a local bank. Without securitization, the remote bank does not compete because of a winner's curse. With securitization, in contrast, ignorance is bliss: the less a bank knows about its loans, the less of a lemons problem it faces in selling them. This enables the remote bank to compete successfully in the lending market.

Only a handful of papers, however, has explored the effects of monetary policy. In this paper we present an agent-based macroeconomic model where the interplay between credit market conditions and firms' balance sheets is key in the determination of endogenous fluctuations. We use the model as a simulation platform by which we perform several experiments of monetary policy. Simulations showed a clear nonneutrality of monetary policy, which finds its transmission mechanism in the credit channel. Besides, we also evaluated the performance of a monetary Authority whose reaction function was modelled according to a standard Taylor rule, which turns out to be quite successful as an effective macro-stabilization tool.","[Gatti, Domenico Delli] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Quantitat Methods & Econ Theory, I-20123 Milan, Italy; [Desiderio, Saul] Shantou Univ, Sch Business, Shantou 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; Shantou University,"Desiderio, S (通讯作者)，Shantou Univ, Sch Business, 243 Daxue Rd, Shantou 515063, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",domenico.delligatti@unicatt.it; saul1979@libero.it,,"Delli Gatti, Domenico/0000-0001-8819-090X","European Community's Seventh Program under Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities [225408]; Shantou University Scientific Research Foundation for Talents [NTF12013, NTF12014]",European Community's Seventh Program under Socio-Economic Sciences and Humanities; Shantou University Scientific Research Foundation for Talents,"We are grateful for insightful comments to participants to the WEHIA 2012 Workshop, Paris, June 2012, and to INET Young Scholar Initiative on Rethinking Macro-Finance seminars, Catholic University in Milan, University of Lille and University of Nice.

When the consumption of certain goods affects one's social status, this creates an externality, which results in two opposite effects in a society. Seeking higher status through positional goods gives individuals much incentive to supply labor but still allocates income for less nonpositional goods as well. In this case, differentiated taxes on positional goods work as corrective instruments to internalize the social cost stemming from status seeking. Furthermore, the differentiated taxes generate revenue that can be used to alleviate preexisting income tax distortion. We develop a game-theoretic model in which each individual with different labor productivity unknown to the others engages in a status-seeking game, where government has a revenue requirement. Then we show that under a condition in which utility is separable between positional goods and leisure, a revenue-neutral shift in the tax mix away from nonlinear income taxes toward positional-good taxes enhances welfare. Hence, the differentiated taxes on positional goods are necessary together with the nonlinear income taxes for an optimal tax structure. Moreover, the differentiated taxes on positional goods could reduce the progressivity of the nonlinear income taxes, which is the case that can easily apply to practical use.","[Hwang, Sanghyun] Korea Econ Res Inst, Seoul 150756, South Korea; [Nagac, Kadir] Zirve Univ, Dept Econ, Gaziantep, Turkey",Zirve University,"Hwang, S (通讯作者)，Korea Econ Res Inst, 45th Floor,FKI Tower,24 Yeoui Daero, Seoul 150756, South Korea.",shwang@keri.org; kadirnagac@gmail.com,,,,,,,18,0,0,1,9,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The cost of integration is a loss of flexibility in choosing the most suitable suppliers for a particular final product. I show that the firms who make the most specific investments in the production process have the greatest incentive to integrate. The theory provides novel insights into the understanding of numerous stylized facts such as the effect of financial development on the vertical structure of firms, the observed pattern from FDI to outsourcing in international trade, and the effect of technological obsolescence on organizations.","[Ursino, Giovanni] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, I-20123 Milan, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart,"Ursino, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Dept Econ & Finance, Via Lodovico Necchi 5 Off 311, I-20123 Milan, Italy.",giovanni.ursino@unicatt.it,"URSINO, Giovanni/I-3415-2018","URSINO, Giovanni/0000-0002-3458-322X",Associazione Borsisti Marco Fanno,Associazione Borsisti Marco Fanno,"This paper was written while I was visiting fellow at the Department of Economics at Harvard University thanks to financial support from the Associazione Borsisti Marco Fanno, which I gratefully acknowledge.",,39,6,6,0,19,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

Early studies focus on the efficiency, production technology and general performance features of Islamic versus conventional banks, whereas more recent work looks at profit-sharing and loss-bearing behaviour, competition, risks as well as other dimensions such as small business lending and financial inclusion. Apart from key exceptions, the empirical literature suggests no major differences between Islamic and conventional banks in terms of their efficiency, competition and risk features (although small Islamic banks are found to be less risky than their conventional counterparts). There is some evidence that Islamic finance aids inclusion and financial sector development. Results from the empirical finance literature, dominated by studies that focus on the risk/return features of mutual funds, finds that Islamic funds perform as well, if not better, than conventional funds - there is little evidence that they perform worse than standard industry benchmarks.","[Abedifar, Pejman] Univ St Andrews, Sch Management, St Andrews KY16 9AJ, Fife, Scotland; [Ebrahim, Shahid M.] Univ Durham, Sch Business, Durham Business Sch, Durham DH1 3HP, England; [Molyneux, Philip] Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales; [Tarazi, Amine] Univ Limoges, LAPE, F-87065 Limoges, France",University of St Andrews; Durham University; Bangor University; Universite de Limoges,"Molyneux, P (通讯作者)，Bangor Univ, Bangor Business Sch, Bangor, Gwynedd, Wales.",p.molyneux@bangor.ac.uk,"Tarazi, Amine/GQP-4387-2022; Abedifar, Pejman/ISB-5606-2023","Tarazi, Amine/0000-0001-8385-2994; Abedifar, Pejman/0000-0002-7648-7201; Molyneux, Philip/0000-0001-6210-7418",,,,,91,86,94,1,98,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0950-0804,1467-6419,,J ECON SURV,J.

To this end, we rely on a Global VAR approach that allows us to account for trade and financial inter-dependencies between countries. Considering a sample of 30 oil-exporting and importing economies over the 1980-2011 period, we find that the nature of the shock demand-driven or supply-driven matters in understanding the effects of oil price shocks on global imbalances. In addition, we show that the main adjustment mechanism to oil shocks is based on the trade channel, the valuation channel being at play only on the short run. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Empirical findings suggest that inflation stabilization and interest rate smoothing are the main objectives of monetary policy, with a very small role for output gap stabilization. Though the money growth rate is irrelevant as an argument in the Fed's objective function, its presence in structural equations improves model fit. Moreover, marginal likelihood comparisons show that the data favor Taylor rules over optimal policies. Finally, the way of describing monetary policy matters for macroeconomic dynamics.

The survey was designed to inform Industry Canada's policy development work (Quote from project Description from Industry Canada's website at http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/ic1.nsf/eng/01464.html and the need for copyright law reform in Canada in light of the technological innovation posed by P2P file sharing. The Journal of Evolutionary Economics published a study of the Industry Canada data by Andersen and Frenz (AF) in 2010 which claimed to show aEuro broken vertical bar no association between the number of P2P files downloaded and CD album sales (Andersen and Frenz 2010 ibid p 374), and aEuro broken vertical bar that P2P file-sharing is not to blame for the decline in CD markets. Music markets are not simply undermined by free music downloading and P2P file-sharing (Ibid p375). Our paper corrects a number of fundamental errors in this analysis of AF, in particular the fact AF biased their results by excluding from their analysis the group of consumers who had completely stopped purchasing CDs (potentially because of P2P activity) prior to 2005. This is the very group who were most responsive, or likely to have substituted P2P downloading for CD purchases. We use longitudinal analysis of how reported changes in P2P downloading by individuals related to their reported changes in CD demand between 2004 and 2005 to better test the hypothesis of whether P2P downloading may reduce CD demand. Contrary to AF's results we find negative and generally statistically significant partial correlations between CD purchases and P2P downloads under a number of specifications and sample definitions. The range of these estimated correlations is between -0.047 and -0.061. This implies that a 10 % growth in P2P downloads is associated with between a 0.47 and 0.61 % decline in CD purchases. Our estimated relationships between CD sales and P2P downloads are broadly consistent with market sales data up to the time of the Industry Canada survey, unlike AF.","[Barker, George] Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Maloney, Tim] Auckland Univ Technol, Fac Business & Law, Dept Econ, Auckland, New Zealand",Australian National University; Auckland University of Technology,"Barker, G (通讯作者)，Australian Natl Univ, ANU Coll Law, GPO Box 4, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.",george.barker@anu.edu.au; tim.maloney@aut.ac.nz,,,,,,,27,5,5,1,20,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0936-9937,1432-1386,,J EVOL ECON,J.

We hypothesize the non-robust results regarding the effects of aid on development in the previous literature to arise due to the effects of aid being insufficiently large to measurably affect aggregate outcomes. Using geo-coded data for World Bank aid to a maximum of 2,221 first-level administrative regions (ADM1) and 54,167 second-level administrative regions (ADM2) in 130 countries over the 2000-11 period, we test whether aid affects development, measured as night-time light growth. Our preferred identification strategy exploits variation arising from interacting a variable that indicates whether or not a country has passed the threshold for receiving the International Development Association's concessional aid with a recipient region's probability of receiving aid, in a sample of 478 ADM1 regions and almost 8,400 ADM2 regions from 21 countries. Controlling for the levels of the interacted variables, the interaction provides a powerful and excludable instrument. Overall, we find significant correlations between aid and growth in ADM2 regions, but no causal effects.","[Dreher, Axel] Univ Goettingen, Univ Heidelberg, KOF, CEPR,CESifo, Gottingen, Germany; [Lohmann, Steffen] Univ Goettingen, Gottingen, Germany",University of Gottingen; Ruprecht Karls University Heidelberg; Ifo Institut; University of Gottingen,"Dreher, A (通讯作者)，Univ Goettingen, Univ Heidelberg, KOF, CEPR,CESifo, Gottingen, Germany.",mail@axel-dreher.de; steffen.lohmann@wiwi.uni-goettingen.de,"Dreher, Axel/AAN-1839-2020","Dreher, Axel/0000-0002-7227-3599",,,,,51,54,59,4,23,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

Different approaches to estimate the gravity equation, i.e. reduced-form or more structural, have been proposed. This paper examines the role of adding-up constraints as the key difference between structural gravity with multilateral resistance indexes and reduced-form gravity with simple fixed effects by exporter and importer. In particular, estimating gravity equations using the Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood estimator (Poisson PML) with fixed effects automatically satisfies these constraints and is consistent with the introduction of multilateral resistance indexes as in Anderson and van Wincoop (2003).

This advice rests on the assumptions that the sum of the elasticities of demand and supply in Caricom countries is greater than one, that free trade prevails, and that the pass-through effects following the devaluation are complete. However, useful as the theory of devaluation may be for the industrial countries where it was developed, it is not necessarily an effective policy instrument within the context of most less developed countries because, in addition to other things, it ignores their colonial social and economic structures.

The cartel instability is rooted in the observation that, upon cartel formation, the relative positions of firms are often fixed which may lead some growth-conscious members to be discontent. This incongruity between a cartel member's allocated market share and its desired market share may result in systematic deviations and the eventual collapse of the cartel. This hypothesis is then taken to the German cement cartel of 1991-2002. We argue that Readymix was such a discontent cartel member and, using a rich pricing data set, are able to characterize how Readymix deviated, how other firms responded, and how it led to the collapse of the cartel.

This research differs from past studies in that it analyzes the effect of the rapid expansion in higher education in Taiwan with emphasis on the cohort effect, specifically examining the effect of changes both in intra-cohort relative supply and the aggregate relative supply on college returns. Besides, when estimating the aggregate relative supply of college graduates, this study takes into account the substitutability between younger and older educated workers. We present evidence that the expansion policy has significantly depressed college premiums for workers of all ages, but the adverse effect is particularly concentrated among the younger cohorts. Furthermore, we found the elasticity of substitution between college and high school graduates to be 3-4 times higher than in developed countries. We also found the important role played by the demand side, likely linked to technological progress and changes in export structure toward the more technologically intensive. As a consequence, the expansion of higher education and increase in the relative demand for higher-educated workers, along with high elasticity of substitution between college and high school graduates, led to the rigid low college premiums.","[Huang, Li-Hsuan] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Chungli 32054, Taiwan; [Huang, Hsin-Yi] Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Chungli 32054, Taiwan",National Central University; National Central University,"Huang, LH (通讯作者)，Natl Cent Univ, Dept Econ, Chungli 32054, Taiwan.",huang@mgt.ncu.edu.tw; juliahuang0828@gmail.com,,"Huang, Li-hsuan/0000-0002-1490-1307",National Science Council of Taiwan [NSC 97-2410-Z-008-002],"National Science Council of Taiwan(Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan)",Financial support was provided by the National Science Council of Taiwan under grant NSC 97-2410-Z-008-002.

In a differentiated products setting I show that when entry costs or the consumer valuation of the product are high enough or when consumer heterogeneity is sufficiently low, an incumbent monopolist will prefer less than full protection and thus allow the piracy of its own product. When the consumer valuations for the good are high, then there is no market expansion effect of illegal copying and consumers might end up worse-off because of piracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We show that repairing the welfare loss from such a cost reduction for any requires firm exit.","[Jansen, Thijs] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [van Lier, Arie; van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Tilburg Univ, Dept Org & Strategy, NL-5000 LE Tilburg, Netherlands; [van Witteloostuijn, Arjen] Univ Antwerp, Antwerp Ctr Evolutionary Demog, B-2020 Antwerp, Belgium",Maastricht University; Tilburg University; University of Antwerp,"Jansen, T (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, Dept Quantitat Econ, POB 616, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",m.jansen@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,"van Witteloostuijn, A./0000-0002-0287-5965",,,,,11,1,2,0,23,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

Numerous empirical studies have compared turnout across PR and MR. However, the empirical evidence is mixed. I show theoretically and experimentally that the comparison of turnout across PR and MR depends on the size of the minority but the empirical papers on the topic do not control for it. I also show that, in both theory and data, PR improves minority representation at a minute cost to efficiency if the size of the minority is sufficiently large. However, the representation of a small minority does not show a remarkable improvement under PR, unlike what the theory predicts. I conjecture that, under PR, there is a discouragement effect for the small minority because the PR system that I employ has an election threshold. As a result, the impact of the voting system on representation may be sensitive to both the size of the minority and the degree of proportionality.","[Kartal, Melis] Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, A-1090 Vienna, Austria",University of Vienna,"Kartal, M (通讯作者)，Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, Oskar Morgenstern Pl 1, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",melis.kartal@univie.ac.at,,,Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS) at New York University; Vienna Center for Experimental Economics (VCEE) at University of Vienna,Center for Experimental Social Science (CESS) at New York University; Vienna Center for Experimental Economics (VCEE) at University of Vienna,"I am grateful to Guillaume Frechette, Alessandro Lizzeri and, especially, Andrew Schotter for their support and encouragement.

The final wealth effect on consumption is the combination of two effects: The effect of the interest rate shock on wealth and the effect of wealth on consumption. The results for the Spanish economy indicate that the relative importance of each component varies with the term considered. Both types of wealth are important but the financial wealth effect dominates that of the housing wealth for all terms. It is only in the long run when both effects become similar.

This process can be nuanced, however, when net returns for some farmers may not be positive. We investigate how social learning influences demand for a resource-conserving technology in eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. We identify potential adopters through an experimental auction and randomly select a subset to adopt. We exploit this variation in adoption across networks to estimate network effects on demand for the technology one year later using a second auction. Technology benefits vary, and network effects are completely conditional on benefits. Having a benefiting adopter in one's network increased demand by over 50%, whereas having a non-benefiting adopter had no effect. These effects are strong enough to bring average demand in line with expected benefits. For many farmers, however, demand remains below the market price, suggesting that network effects will lead to increased-but not rapid widespread-adoption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Users of the statistics may incorrectly view them as error free or may incorrectly conjecture error magnitudes. This paper discusses strategies to mitigate misinterpretation of official statistics by communicating uncertainty to the public. Sampling error can be measured using established statistical principles. The challenge is to satisfactorily measure the various forms of nonsampling error. I find it useful to distinguish transitory statistical uncertainty, permanent statistical uncertainty, and conceptual uncertainty. I illustrate how each arises as the Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically revises GDP estimates, the Census Bureau generates household income statistics from surveys with nonresponse, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusts employment statistics. I anchor my discussion of communication of uncertainty in the contribution of Oskar Morgenstern (1963a), who argued forcefully for agency publication of error estimates for official economic statistics.","[Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA; [Manski, Charles F.] Northwestern Univ, Inst Policy Res, Evanston, IL 60208 USA",Northwestern University; Northwestern University,"Manski, CF (通讯作者)，Northwestern Univ, Dept Econ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.",,"Manski, Charles/AAV-7497-2021",,"National Science Foundation [SES1129475]; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1129475] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Department of Economics and Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University.

This approach combines the classical quantile regression with a nonlinear analysis technique and presents the advantages of discovering the heterogeneous nonlinearity of the Phillips curve across quantiles of the inflation distribution. For the empirical illustration, we compare three types of the Phillips curve models in the quantile regression framework. Empirical results for the United States show that the hybrid Phillips curve model outperforms the other twain terms of goodness of fit and prediction ability. We find that the shape of the Phillips curve for the United States is nonlinear and asymmetric, and varies considerably across quantiles. We also provide a novel look at the inflation changes by estimating the conditional density of inflation given different output gap levels, with the numerical results indicating that an increase of the output gap boosts the level of inflation as well as raises the uncertainty of inflation. Our findings imply that the effectiveness of monetary policy mainly depends on the phase of the economic cycle and the inflation uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using region-by-cohort variation in the percentage of the Jewish population as a quasi-experiment, we find that German children who were at school-age during the persecutions have fewer years of schooling on average in adulthood. Moreover, these children are less likely to finish high school and go to college. These results are robust after controlling for regional unemployment and income per capita, wartime destruction, Nazi and Communist Party support, compulsory schooling reform, migration, urbanization, and mortality.","[Akbulut-Yuksel, Mevlude; Yuksel, Mutlu] Dalhousie Univ, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada",Dalhousie University,"Akbulut-Yuksel, M (通讯作者)，Dalhousie Univ, 6214 Univ Ave, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada.",mevlude@dal.ca; mutlu@dal.ca,,,,,,,36,25,27,0,13,AMER ECONOMIC ASSOC,NASHVILLE,"2014 BROADWAY, STE 305, NASHVILLE, TN 37203 USA",1945-7731,1945-774X,,AM ECON J-ECON POLIC,Am.

The analysis suggests that the failure to appropriately account for model uncertainty may have previously led to biased estimates. The results from a sample of 23 OECD countries over 1975-2000 indicate that after controlling for unobserved country heterogeneity, there is no robust link, neither positive, nor negative, between output growth and fiscal federalism. Clearly, widely recognized issues of endogeneity and causality that are typical to the empirical growth literature in general remain unresolved.

For this reason it is important to understand the behavioral as well as the theoretical properties of different tournament structures. Given that laboratory experiments have consistently found high levels of overbidding in contests, one might suspect that double-elimination tournaments would generate substantially more total investment than single-elimination tournaments despite the two types of tournaments generating theoretically equivalent expected aggregate investment. This paper reports a set of laboratory experiments designed to test this comparison. The results indicate that aggregate investment is similar between the two tournaments, despite behavioral differences in bidding strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

While more information can help hold the government to account, it may also give policymakers an incentive to meddle with the work of bureaucrats. This paper develops a model of biased information gathering to examine how different disclosure rules and the degree of independence of government agencies affect citizen welfare. Disclosure rules and agency independence interact in subtle ways. We find that secrecy is never optimal and yet insulating the agency from political pressure, so that its information is always unbiased, may also not be socially optimal. A biased information-gathering process can benefit the government by helping it to shape public opinion. But it can also benefit the public, by curbing the government's tendency to implement its ex ante favored policy, thus mitigating the agency conflict between policymakers and the public.

We study the outsourcing decision in a duopoly under decreasing but uncertain market rates for components, given that outsourcing increases the substitutability of the final products. We find that there is at least one firm that eventually outsources component production because it cannot differentiate its product enough by in-house production to justify the (eventually) higher costs. The follower outsources at a lower market rate or may even remain vertically integrated. The follower thus incurs the (eventually) much higher in-house component costs longer, while the low substitutability is enjoyed by both firms. Under endogenous roles, firms thus engage in a preemption game to be the first to outsource. We also find that firms generally outsource at lower market rates if uncertainty is higher, but seek to preempt at remarkably higher market rates if substitutability remains low.

These findings relate to debates surrounding the effects of the conflict mineral regulations.

A key determinant of cross-hauling is held to be the heterogeneity of commodities, which is estimated using national data. However, contrary to the authors' findings for Finland, CHARM does not generate reliable estimates of Hubei's sectoral exports, imports and volume of trade, although it is more successful in estimating sectoral supply multipliers. The poor simulations of regional trade are attributed to the fact that Hubei is a relatively small region, where there is a large divergence between regional and national technology and pattern of final demand. The simulation errors are decomposed into components reflecting differences between regional and national technology, final demand and heterogeneity. The third component is found to be the least important of the three sources of error.","[Flegg, Anthony T.] Univ W England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England; [Huang, Yongming] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Ind Univ Res Collaborat, Inst Dev Cent China, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China; [Tohmo, Timo] Univ Jyvaskyla, Sch Business & Econ, Jyvaskyla, Finland",University of West England; Wuhan University; University of Jyvaskyla,"Huang, YM (通讯作者)，Wuhan Univ, Ctr Ind Univ Res Collaborat, Inst Dev Cent China, Wuhan 430072, Peoples R China.",hym@whu.edu.cn,"Huang, Yongming/O-9454-2016","Huang, Yongming/0000-0003-0033-9277; Tohmo, Timo/0000-0002-1189-2257",Chinese National Social Science Grant [13BJL049]; Ministry of Education [12YJA790054]; Academy of Finland [251071]; Academy of Finland (AKA) [251071] Funding Source: Academy of Finland (AKA),Chinese National Social Science Grant; Ministry of Education; Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Academy of Finland (AKA)(Research Council of Finland),Yongming Huang's research was supported by Chinese National Social Science Grant [13BJL049] and Social Science Grant of Ministry of Education [12YJA790054].

The maximal aggregate volatility is attained in a noise free information structure in which the agents confound idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks, and display excess response to the aggregate shocks, as in Lucas [14]. For any given variance of aggregate shocks, the upper bound on aggregate volatility is linearly increasing in the variance of the idiosyncratic shocks. Our results hold in a setting of symmetric agents with linear best responses and normal uncertainty. We establish our results by providing a characterization of the set of all joint distributions over actions and states that can arise in equilibrium under any information structure.

Most of these studies focused on assessing total factor productivity (TFP) in Chinese mainland provinces but suffered from methodological wealcnesses by assuming constant returns to scale (CRS) for the production frontier and/or incorrectly modeling variables returns to scale (VRS) technology taking into account bad output such as carbon dioxide emissions. Our paper offers a right non-parametric programming framework based on weak disposability and VRS assumptions to estimate environmental growth convergence among Chinese regions characterized by size heterogeneity. We explicitly separate regional efficiency gaps into two components: The first studies the technical catching-up process on each one (technical effect), and the second reveals convergence or divergence in the combinations of input and output among regions (structural effect). Moreover, carbon shadow price levels for provinces can be derived through the dual version of our activity analysis framework. Our empirical work focuses on 30 Chinese regions from 1997 to 2010. The results emphasize that environmental growth convergence among regions has mainly relied on the structural effect. We find that the structural effect largely depends on the pollution cost convergence and not on the evolution of the relative prices of capital or labor. The carbon shadow price is increasing at an annual rate of 2.5% and was evaluated around 864 yuan per ton in 2010 in China while regional estimates show significant disparities at the beginning of the period.

We admit both positive transfers (fees) and negative transfers (compensations), which implies not only that the policy-maker can commit to not listen but also that the lobby can commit to not talk. In a binary action space, we solve the game for all timings, prior beliefs, information structures, and valuation parameters. We identify the settings in which the policy-maker strategically discourages the lobby's participation by announcing an unacceptable transfer.

With changing fundamentals - financial innovation - we can account for half of the empirical price boom, suggesting there may well be room for self-fulfilling prophecies.

The price of investment has a decreasing trend relative to that of consumption because of investment-specific technological progress. If the prices of investment goods are sticky, a benevolent planner puts weight on stabilizing these prices, which works to raise the optimal target rate of inflation in terms of the price of consumption. The estimated model shows a high degree of price stickiness in an investment sector and the resulting optimal target rate of inflation is significantly positive. This result is robust to an extended model in which the prices of some categories of investment goods are flexible. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We use a large dataset of Chinese manufacturing firms to assess whether industrial agglomeration lowers the minimum productivity level required for exporting and whether it increases a firm's probability of exporting. Semi-parametric quantile regressions reveal that the productivity advantage of exporters against non-exporters is markedly smaller in agglomerated regions. Furthermore, a parametric estimation of an export entry model indicates that the agglomeration of incumbent exporters contributes significantly to export participation, although its magnitude is limited. These spillover effects are generated not only by the agglomeration of exporting foreign invested firms (FIFs), but also, more importantly, by that of indigenous Chinese exporters. Intact, the agglomeration of exporting FIFs only contributes to the export entry of FIFs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Lottery players on the buyer side tend to avoid buying tickets which are similar to the previous winning ticket, in accordance with the Gambler's Fallacy (Clotfelter and Cook 1993; Terrell 1994). At the same time, buyers tend to prefer purchasing tickets from previously winning sellers, despite the fully random nature of wins, in accordance with Hot-Hand Fallacy (Croson and Sundali 2005). These behavioral biases provide an opportunity for ticket sellers to increase their expected profits by adjusting features of the lottery portfolios they sell. We find that sellers make changes to their portfolio size, commission rate, self-purchase rate, and number choices in response to previous events, in ways that are consistent with responding to the Hot-Hand Fallacy belief, and which also lend a degree of support for responding to the Gambler's Fallacy belief. Our results show evidence of participants in a market accommodating their choices to the biased beliefs of other participants in order to gain an advantage in expected profits.

We formulate a difference-in-difference design, where we compare the change in labour earnings across matched workers with a high and low level of education who experience the same type of health shocks. Our results suggest major heterogeneity in the effects, where a given health shock has a greater relative negative impact on low-skilled individuals/individuals with a low level of education. These results hold across different types of health shocks and become more pronounced with age. Low-skilled workers are also more likely to leave the labour force and receive disability insurance, sickness insurance, and unemployment benefits following a health shock. Our results suggest that heterogeneity in the effect of health shocks offers one explanation as to how the educational gradient in health arises.","[Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, IZA, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Lundborg, Petter] Lund Univ, Ctr Econ Demog, S-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Nilsson, Martin] Uppsala Univ, IFAU Uppsala, Uppsala, Sweden; [Nilsson, Martin; Vikstrom, Johan] UCLS, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden; [Vikstrom, Johan] IFAU Uppsala, SE-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Lund University; Lund University; Uppsala University,"Lundborg, P (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, IZA, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",johan.vikstrom@ifau.uu.se,,,"Swedish Council of Working Life and Social Research FAS [2004-2005, 2009-0826]",Swedish Council of Working Life and Social Research FAS(Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life & Welfare (Forte)),Swedish Council of Working Life and Social Research FAS (dnr 2004-2005 and dnr 2009-0826).,,23,23,24,0,8,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0030-7653,1464-3812,,OXFORD ECON PAP,Oxf.

Bribes are offered sequentially, according to an exogenously given order. Restricting attention to pure strategies (and imposing a certain refinement), I study the efficient equilibria of this game. In any such equilibrium, whenever the first mover offers a strictly positive bribe, this bribe is given by his surplus: his valuation minus the payoff that he would have received in the dominant-strategy equilibrium of the auction. I derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such an equilibrium. I also extend this equilibrium's construction to a model with general valuations, not necessarily IPV.

It concentrates on households with an only boy and is larger for middle-school than primary-school children. Increases in public education spending are associated with significant reduction in school tuition, which is homogeneous across households of different income levels.

Agents face a non-zero probability of death in adulthood. Parental health affects the health status of their children at birth, and health status in adulthood depends on health in childhood. An autonomous increase in life expectancy has an ambiguous impact on growth, because of an adverse effect on the public-private capital ratio. If life expectancy depends endogenously on health status, multiple equilibria may emerge. A reallocation of public spending toward either health or infrastructure may put the economy on a convergent path to a high-growth, high productivity steady state. However, escaping from a health-induced poverty trap can occur only if the quality of public spending is sufficiently high.","Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England",University of Manchester,"Agénor, PR (通讯作者)，Univ Manchester, Manchester, Lancs, England.",pierre-richard.agenor@manchester.ac.uk,,,,,,,38,14,15,1,30,SPRINGER WIEN,WIEN,"SACHSENPLATZ 4-6, PO BOX 89, A-1201 WIEN, AUSTRIA",0931-8658,1617-7134,,J ECON,J.

We hypothesised that Australian ADIs are prone to extreme shocks experienced by their US and UK counterparts. We define four discrete events for the Australian banking sector in terms of the number of banks exceeding an extreme value at some time. The extreme value is defined as the 90th percentile on the negative tail of the distribution of changes in the distance to default obtained through the Black-Scholes-Merton formula. Then we fit a multinomial logistic model (MLM) to relate these events to the number of exceedances (extreme events) occurring in the US and the UK in the previous day for the time period from September 2006 to September 2011.

During the Great Moderation, the inflation targeting regime worked well. Central banks used the interest rate to stabilize inflation, and-subject to inflation being controlled-stabilized the level of demand. Fiscal policy exerted discipline over the public-sector deficits, thereby-indirectly-managing the level of public debt. Such 'fiscal housekeeping' worked well, because the monetary authorities were stabilizing the economy. But once private-sector deleveraging led to the Great Recession, and interest rates hit their zero bound, the outcome could no longer be managed by monetary policy. Recovery depended on the 'automatic stabilizers': output and tax revenues have fallen, public debt has been created, and assets have been created which a deleveraging private sector wishes to hold. But the effect has been very gradual. Recovery would have been faster if fiscal policy had been responsible for the restoration of full employment, in an environment which tolerated the necessary rises in public debt. Conversely, policies of austerity, designed to reduce public debt, have slowed the recovery. Growth will not be resumed until the private sector begins to invest strongly again, creating the financial assets which the private sector wishes to hold, thereby enabling public debt to be retired. This has not yet happened because the private sector, correctly, does not believe that macroeconomic policy is capable of sustaining a strong recovery.","[Allsopp, Christopher] Univ Oxford, New Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Allsopp, Christopher] Oxford Inst Energy Studies, Oxford, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford St Antonys Coll, Dept Econ, Polit Econ Financial Markets Programme, Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England; [Vines, David] Univ Oxford, Oxford Martin Sch, INET, Eth & Econ Programme, Oxford OX1 2JD, England; [Vines, David] Australian Natl Univ, Crawford Sch Publ Policy, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia; [Vines, David] Ctr Econ Policy Res, Oxford, England",University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Australian National University; Centre for Economic Policy Research - UK,"Allsopp, C (通讯作者)，Univ Oxford, New Coll, Oxford OX1 2JD, England.",christopher.allsopp@new.ox.ac.uk; david.vines@economics.ox.ac.uk,,,,,,,104,7,7,1,17,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0266-903X,1460-2121,,OXFORD REV ECON POL,Oxf.

The model demonstrates that when an economy features a high opportunity of upward mobility and high risk of downward mobility, it attains a unique equilibrium where unskilled, low-income agents support a low redistribution because of the hope of upward mobility in future. In contrast, the economy attains multiple equilibria when mobility opportunity and risk are low: one is an unskilled-majority equilibrium defined by low mobility and the other is a skilled-majority equilibrium defined by high mobility. The paper gives a comparison between the political equilibrium and the social planner's allocation in terms of mobility, and shows that the skilled-majority equilibrium realizes mobility close to the optimal one.","[Arawatari, Ryo] Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Ono, Tetsuo] Osaka Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Toyonaka, Osaka 5600043, Japan",Nagoya University; Osaka University,"Arawatari, R (通讯作者)，Nagoya Univ, Grad Sch Econ, Chikusa Ku, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",arawatari@soec.nagoya-u.ac.jp; tono@econ.osaka-u.ac.jp,,"Ono, Tetsuo/0000-0002-9838-828X",Nomura Foundation,Nomura Foundation,The authors would like to thank associate editor and two anonymous referees for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The case is based on the importance of the income effect. In particular it is important to avoid a problematic characteristic of some popular demand systems which we term effective homotheticity. This characteristic compromises the ability of counterfactual analyses to distinguish different sized welfare effects at different income levels.

This paper reports on an experiment performed both online and in the laboratory, designed to strengthen the internal validity of decisions elicited over the Internet. We use the same subject pool, the same monetary stakes and the same decision interface, and control the assignment of subjects between the Internet and a traditional university laboratory. We apply the comparison to the elicitation of social preferences in a Public Good game, a dictator game, an ultimatum bargaining game and a trust game, coupled with an elicitation of risk aversion. This comparison concludes in favor of the reliability of behaviors elicited through the Internet. We moreover find a strong overall parallelism in the preferences elicited in the two settings. The paper also reports some quantitative differences in the point estimates, which always go in the direction of more other-regarding decisions from online subjects. This observation challenges either the predictions of social distance theory or the generally assumed increased social distance in internet interactions.","[Hergueux, Jerome] Univ Strasbourg, Inst Polit Studies, Strasbourg, France; [Hergueux, Jerome] Sci Po, Dept Econ, Paris, France; [Hergueux, Jerome] Harvard Univ, Berkman Ctr Internet & Soc, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Univ Lorraine BETA, F-54035 Nancy, France; [Jacquemet, Nicolas] Paris Sch Econ, Paris, France",Universites de Strasbourg Etablissements Associes; Universite de Strasbourg; Institut d'Etudes Politiques Paris (Sciences Po); Harvard University; Universite de Lorraine; Paris School of Economics,"Jacquemet, N (通讯作者)，Univ Lorraine BETA, 13 Pl Carnot, F-54035 Nancy, France.",jhergueux@cyber.law.harvard.edu; Nicolas.Jacquemet@univ-lorraine.fr,"Jacquemet, Nicolas/F-4736-2010","Jacquemet, Nicolas/0000-0002-5056-9225",CES [2012-70]; European Research Council (ERC),CES; European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),"This paper is a revised and augmented version of CES Working Paper no 2012-70.

Retirees can invest in risky assets, purchase fairly priced immediate or deferred lifetime annuities, and are eligible for a targeted safety net pension. We match baseline parameters to current Australian settings and conduct scenario analyses over a wide range of individual preferences and financial market outcomes. Except where individuals need to insure a consumption floor, both immediate and deferred annuity purchases are largely crowded out by the means-tested public pension. Welfare losses caused by zero annuitisation are small compared with the losses caused by completely annuitising all savings, particularly if wealth at retirement is low.

However, introducing endogenously determined structural breaks to account for changes in exchange rate regimes provides more mixed evidence. While there is still little evidence for coordination in nominal terms, some degree of coordination among real rates emerges. The limited evidence for exchange rate coordination can be explained by the diverse exchange rate regimes prevailing in these economies, signaling differences in policy objectives.","Asian Dev Bank, India Resident Mission, New Delhi 110021, India",,"Sen Gupta, A (通讯作者)，Asian Dev Bank, India Resident Mission, 4 San Martin Marg, New Delhi 110021, India.",asengupta@adb.org,,"Sen Gupta, Abhijit/0000-0003-3689-2189",,,,,22,0,0,0,5,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,SINGAPORE,"5 TOH TUCK LINK, SINGAPORE 596224, SINGAPORE",0217-5908,1793-6837,,SINGAP ECON REV,Singap.

It identifies several factors that determine the fastest rate at which the population can grow without engendering declining living standards. We then apply the framework to Britain and find a dramatic increase in sustainable population growth at the time of the Industrial Revolution, well before the beginning of modern levels of income growth. The main contributions to the British breakout were technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role. In addition to solidifying the link between the Industrial Revolution and rising living standards, this research reconciles the gradualist and limited Crafts-Harley view of the Industrial Revolution with a dramatic and rapid change in Britain's macroeconomic character.

In so doing, individual as well as panel unit root tests have been applied on a dataset consisting of 52 Japanese manufacturing industries spanning the period 1974-2008. The evidence generated is rather mixed in a sense that the inter-industry profit rates tendency to gravitate towards the economy's average rate of profit depends on the idiosyncratic characteristics of each industry. However, the rate of profit of regulating capitals, as this is reflected in the incremental rate of profit, displays gravitational behaviour around the economy-wide incremental rate of profit, the movement of which is found to be linked to the rate of return in the stock market. These results lend support to those who contend that the classical theory of competition is an area where further research is warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As an empirical illustration, we demonstrate that using PMA to account for model uncertainty can lead to large gains in box office prediction accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The impact on the balance sheets of banks also operates through size in Germany, Italy and France; liquidity in Germany; and capital in Spain. During the financial crisis, the direct impact of monetary easing on loan provisions relative to other assets has decreased in Germany and France, while its indirect impact has increased for smaller banks in France and less liquid banks in Germany. These results suggest that monetary policy easing has supported relatively more French small banks and German banks with liquidity constraints.","European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany",European Central Bank,"De Santis, RA (通讯作者)，European Cent Bank, D-60311 Frankfurt, Germany.",roberto.de_santis@ecb.int,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,429,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",1350-4851,1466-4291,,APPL ECON LETT,Appl.

Assuming that hospitals wish to maximize the number of their own patients who receive a kidney, they may have an incentive to withhold some of their incompatible donor-patient pairs and match them internally, thus harming social welfare. We study mechanisms for two-way exchanges that are strategyproof, i.e., make it a dominant strategy for hospitals to report all their incompatible pairs. We establish lower bounds on the welfare loss of strategyproof mechanisms, both deterministic and randomized, and propose a randomized mechanism that guarantees at least half of the maximum social welfare in the worst case.

The main result gives an axiomatization of preference relations greater than or similar to represented as follows: f greater than or similar to g double left right arrow integral u(f) dp + eta(p) >= integral u (g) dp for all p is an element of Delta, where u is an affine utility index over a convex set X of consequences, eta : Delta -> [0, infinity] is an ambiguity index, and A is the set of priors over the state space S. This representation has a natural interpretation as a weighted unanimity rule, with the function 77 reflecting the weight given to a prior and higher values of 77 corresponding to priors given less weight. Bewley's incomplete preferences can be identified precisely with the addition of transitivity or independence, and a prior receives weight either 0 if plausible or infinity when discarded. Also, by adding only completeness, we recover subjective expected utility, i.e., the lack of transitivity implies incompleteness Finally, we find a strong connection of our model with the class of variational preferences.

Two senders transmit information to a receiver over a 2 x 2 state space. Despite overall misaligned interests, full revelation is achieved in equilibrium by having the senders truthfully reveal along distinct dimensions. Our experimental findings confirm that more information can be extracted with two senders in a multidimensional setting. The extent to which information is transmitted depends on whether dimensional interests are aligned between a sender and the receiver, the sizes of the message spaces, and the specification of out-of-equilibrium beliefs.

Based upon empirical evidence, we develop an overlapping generations model with environmental quality and endogenous environmental culture. Environmental culture may be costlessly transmitted intergenerationally, or via costly education. The model predicts that for low wealth levels, society is unable to free resources for environmental culture. In this case, society will only invest in environmental maintenance if environmental quality is sufficiently low. Once society has reached a certain level of economic development, then it may optimally invest a part of its wealth in developing an environmental culture. Environmental culture has not only a positive impact on environmental quality through lower levels of consumption, but it also improves the environment through maintenance expenditure for wealth-environment combinations at which, in a restricted model without environmental culture, no maintenance would be undertaken. Environmental culture leads to a society with a higher indirect utility at steady state in comparison to the restricted model. Our model leads us to the conclusion that, for societies trapped in a situation with low environmental quality, investments in culture may induce positive feedback loops, where more culture raises environmental quality which in turn raises environmental culture. We also discuss how environmental culture may lead to an Environmental Kuznets Curve. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper the intermittent characteristics of wind power are modelled as a stochastic parameter in a long-term TIMES model of the Danish heat and electricity sector. To our knowledge, this is not a common approach in long-term investment models, and has not been done previously in TIMES, where the short-term uncertainty of wind power is normally taken into account by a deterministic constraint that ensures excess back-up capacity. In our model, the stochasticity gives lower total energy system costs, significant lower investments in wind power, less expected electricity export and higher expected biomass consumption compared to using the traditional deterministic approach. Also, the deterministic investment strategy can be insufficient in periods with poor wind conditions. Based on our findings, we recommend using a stochastic representation of intermittent renewables in long-term investment models to provide more solid results for decision makers.

To re-balance Eurozone growth, the mainstream solution is a deflationary policy of 'internal devaluation' (i.e. cutting the wage share by as much as 30%) in the deficit countries. The 'progressive' view holds that the surplus countries should adjust by raising their wage shares. We argue that both sides of this debate are wrong and unhelpful. Europe's trade imbalances are determined by domestic and world demand-whilst RULC divergences play only a negligible role. Eurozone growth can only be revived when Eurozone demand growth is restored, not by lowering wages here and/or raising them there. The current deflationary adjustment forced on the wage-led economies of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain is self-destructive: it is a 'confidence killer', not only deepening the free fall of southern European incomes but also damaging their productive base and productivity growth. The outlook is depressing-further increases in already high unemployment rates, inequality measures and poverty rates inconceivable in prosperous Europe just a few years ago-and arguably dystopian.","[Storm, Servaas; Naastepad, C.

We conclude that there are channels through which changes in energy prices will have the following cause-effect relationships. First, a rise in energy price as a negative technology shock will raise the costs of providing capital services per unit of capital, thereby reducing output. Second, a rising energy price distorts the intertemporal choices of households and firms, creating downward pressure on the expected future return on capital. Third, an energy price shock places upward pressure on the marginal costs associated with an increase in inflation. Numerical simulation results show that a positive energy price shock has a positive effect on energy technology improvements. In addition, the effects of energy price shocks can be mitigated by nominal rigidities, and interest rate rules will determine the magnitude of those effects. Using the efficient frontier method, we also show that optimal monetary policy in China should help control energy price volatility.","[Wang, Yunqing] Shanghai Finance Univ, Sch Int Finance, Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yunqing] Fudan Univ, Financial Res Ctr, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Qigui] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Antai Coll Econ & Management, Econ, Shanghai 200030, Peoples R China",Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting & Finance; Fudan University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Wang, YQ (通讯作者)，Shanghai Finance Univ, Sch Int Finance, Econ, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",prowang0319@163.com; qgzhu@sjtu.edu.cn,"Zhao, Yi/JFA-7988-2023",,Ministry of Education in China; Project of Humanities and Social Sciences for the Youth [14YJC790129]; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2014M550205]; Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China [11AZD031]; Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China [14ZDA013],"Ministry of Education in China(Ministry of Education, China); Project of Humanities and Social Sciences for the Youth; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China; Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China","This work is supported by the Ministry of Education in China, Project of Humanities and Social Sciences for the Youth (Project No. 14YJC790129), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2014M550205), Key Project of the National Social Science Fund of China (11AZD031) and Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China (14ZDA013).",,31,7,7,0,33,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0818-9935,1467-8411,,ASIAN-PAC ECON LIT,Asian-Pac Econ.

Long-term patterns derived from repeated estimations of cross-sectional micro-level data from 31 consecutive annual household surveys show that less-educated groups are not systematic losers of the transformation as positive externalities of agglomeration are both significant and widespread in the leading region.

Along with modeling the overall price level, we also separately model the price levels of consumer goods and consumer services, controlling for other factors that commonly influence the price level in an economy, such as income, trade openness, fiscal dominance, the intensity of local market competition and real money supply. Our results suggest that, in addition to already established adverse economic outcomes of corruption (such as lower growth, an inefficient public sector, underinvestment and increased cost of doing business), corruption in emerging economies also increases the general price level, thus in turn affecting the overall cost of living. This effect of corruption is twice as strong for consumer services as for consumer goods.

This downscaling procedure is complemented by an adjustment rule ensuring that the sub-flows match the superordinate flow in sum. The approximation improves along several iteration steps. The algorithm unfolds its strength through the flexible combination of multiple, possibly incomplete proxy data sources.

For example, many states have been mandating the use of employment verification (E-Verify) systems to confirm work eligibility. Some of the consequences of these E-Verify mandates remain unclear. In this article, we focus on the effect of anti-illegal immigrant laws on foreign investment. Specifically, we exploit the state-level and time variation in the enactment and implementation of E-Verify mandates to explore if punitive measures against the firm impact states' ability to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). We quantify FDI through the employment by U.S. affiliates owned by foreign firms. Our results suggest that E-Verify mandates adversely affect employment among these majority-owned U.S. affiliates and, therefore, work against states trying to attract FDI.","[Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina] San Diego State Univ, Dept Econ, San Diego, CA 92182 USA; [Bansak, Cynthia] St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, Canton, NY 13617 USA; [Zebedee, Allan A.] Clarkson Univ, Sch Business, Potsdam, NY 13699 USA",California State University System; San Diego State University; Saint Lawrence University; Clarkson University,"Bansak, C (通讯作者)，St Lawrence Univ, Dept Econ, 23 Romoda Dr, Canton, NY 13617 USA.",camuedod@mail.sdsu.edu; cbansak@stlawu.edu; azebedee@clarkson.edu,"Zebedee, Allan/GNP-4902-2022; Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/AAI-7730-2020; Islam, Md/Q-8401-2018","Amuedo-Dorantes, Catalina/0000-0002-4750-309X;",Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) at San Diego State University; University of Roehampton,Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER) at San Diego State University; University of Roehampton,We are indebted to discussants and participants at the 2013 IZA/SOLE and 2013 ASSA meetings.

A general formula for such distribution of productivity is obtained, using the detail-balance condition necessary for equilibrium in the Ehrenfest-Brillouin model. We also carry out an empirical analysis on the average number of workers in given productivity sectors on the basis of an exhaustive dataset in Japan. The theoretical formula succeeds in explaining the two distinctive observational facts in a unified way, that is, a Boltzmann distribution with negative temperature on low-to-medium productivity side and a decreasing part in a power-law form on high productivity side.","[Aoyama, Hideaki] Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto, Japan; [Iyetomi, Hiroshi; Yoshikawa, Hiroshi] Univ Tokyo, Grad Sch Econ, Tokyo, Japan",Kyoto University; University of Tokyo,"Aoyama, H (通讯作者)，Kyoto Univ, Grad Sch Sci, Kyoto, Japan.",hideaki.aoyama@gmail.com,,,Program for Promoting Methodological Innovation in Humanities and Social Sciences by Cross-Disciplinary Fusing of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,Program for Promoting Methodological Innovation in Humanities and Social Sciences by Cross-Disciplinary Fusing of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,"The authors would like to thank Yoshi Fujiwara, Yuichi Ikeda and Wataru Souma for helpful discussions and comments during the course of this work. and Toshiyuki Masuda, Chairman of The Kyoto Shinkin Bank for his comments on Japanese small to medium firms.

The article presents a model of the review process in a top journal, in which authors know their paper's quality whereas referees obtain a noisy signal about quality. Increased signal noisiness, lower submission costs and more published papers all reduce the average quality of published papers in the journal. The model allows analyzing how the submission cost, the accuracy of referees and the number of published papers affect additional equilibrium characteristics. Implications of the model for journal policies are also discussed.","Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel",Ben Gurion University,"Azar, OH (通讯作者)，Ben Gurion Univ Negev, Dept Business Adm, IL-84105 Beer Sheva, Israel.",azar@som.bgu.ac.il,"AZAR, OFER H/F-1666-2012","AZAR, OFER H/0000-0003-0154-327X",,,,,26,7,7,0,7,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,BERLIN,"GENTHINER STRASSE 13, D-10785 BERLIN, GERMANY",1935-1682,,,BE J ECON ANAL POLI,B E J.

The estimation process generates own-price, income, and cross-price elasticities for all three goods. Implied per capita beer and cigarette consumption elasticities of per capita health care expenditures, suggested by our baseline estimates, are 0.83 and 0.14, respectively. These results are robust to a number of specification tests. Simulations suggest that yearly marginal medical costs amount to approximately $12 per bottle and 27 cents per cigarette in the short run (in 2012 dollars). These results are likely to be driven by the much larger corresponding increases in the consumption of binge drinkers and heavy smokers.

We use data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) that includes both a measure of financial risk preference and measures of cognitive ability for a representative sample of individuals aged 50+ in 11 European countries. The availability of a large set of variables in SHARE allows us to control for potential confounding factors that may be related to both cognitive skills and risk attitudes. Conditional on socio-demographic characteristics, about half of the age-related cross-sectional difference in willingness to take risks can be explained by a noisy measure of cognitive skills. Further analyses indicate this is a lower bound estimate due to attenuation bias resulting from measurement error in the measure of cognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
