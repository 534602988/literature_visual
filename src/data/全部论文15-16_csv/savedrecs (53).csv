Unfortunately, the structural parameters governing DSGE models are not identified when the driving process behind the model follows an unrestricted VAR. This finding implies that parameter estimates derived from recent attempts to estimate DSGE models with generalized driving processes should be treated with caution, and that there always exists a tradeoff between identification and the risk of model misspecification. However, these results also make it easier to address the issue of model misspecification by making it computationally easier to check the validity of cross-equation restrictions.","[Reicher, Claire A.] Inst Weltwirtschaft, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany",Institut fur Weltwirtschaft an der Universitat Kiel (IFW),"Reicher, CA (通讯作者)，Inst Weltwirtschaft, Kiellinie 66, D-24105 Kiel, Germany.",claire.reicher@ifw-kiel.de,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,3,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

A key finding is that time-of-day (ToD) pricing can enhance or worsen the economics of PV systems. Moreover, increased responsiveness of electricity demand to its price diminishes the effectiveness of ToD pricing in the absence of net metering, but does not affect it otherwise. An application to plausible conditions in the State of Indiana, USA, shows that current policies are unlikely to trigger adoption by a risk-neutral forward-looking residential customer. However, adoption of PV systems can be induced if the Federal Tax Credit is increased to cover 48% of capital cost (instead of the current 30%), which could imply a cost to the Federal Government of about $0.95/kW of installed capacity depending on the panel's size. We demonstrate that implementation of ToD pricing can trigger adoption under a range of on- and off-peak price combinations. But our analysis also shows that the cost-effectiveness of ToD pricing is enhanced at higher ratios of on-peak to off-peak prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents evidence on the socioeconomic and psychological factors that explain international immigrants' decisions to stay in the Canary Islands. The data are modelled using a latent class binary approach that allows two types of migrant to be considered according to their level of probability of staying at the destination. The results show that psychological factors (negative emotions, expectations, social integration) are more important for those migrants with a low probability of staying. In addition, the circumstances at the destination (Spanish language, years of stay, number of migrations, remittances) are significant only for those migrants with a high probability of staying. These results have implications for immigration policies in both the origin and host regions.","[Leon, Carmelo J.; Hernandez Aleman, Anastasia] Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Appl Econ Anal, Inst Turismo & Desarrollo Econ Sostenible TiDES, E-35017 Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain",Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,"León, CJ (通讯作者)，Univ Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Appl Econ Anal, Inst Turismo & Desarrollo Econ Sostenible TiDES, E-35017 Las Palmas Gran Canaria, Las Palmas, Spain.",cleon@daea.ulpgc.es,,", Anastasia/0000-0002-1265-2722",Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2011-30365],Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),Financial support is acknowledged from Project ECO2011-30365 of the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology.,,52,3,4,1,17,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

This paper brings together technological spillovers from FDI with impacts on regional innovation through industrial structure. This is important for China as a recipient of FDI which is both regionally skewed and unevenly distributed. Results indicate that inward FDI has positive effects on regional innovation, but that industrial specialization diminishes the positive effects of FDI whilst a more diversified industrial structure enhances spillovers from inward FDI.","[Wang, Yuandi] Sichuan Univ, Sch Business, 29 Wangjiang Rd, Chengdu 610064, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Ning, Lutao; Prevezer, Martha] Univ London, Sch Business & Management, Francis Bancroft Bldg,Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Li, Jian] Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11 Lushan South Rd, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China",Sichuan University; University of London; Queen Mary University London; Hunan University,"Li, J (通讯作者)，Hunan Univ, Sch Business Adm, 11 Lushan South Rd, Changsha 410082, Hunan, Peoples R China.",wangyuandi@scu.edu.cn; l.ning@qmul.ac.uk; lijian_phd@126.com; M.J.Prevezer@qmul.ac.uk,"wang, KiKi/JFZ-3334-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71302133]; Youth Project of Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Funding [13YJC790154]; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [20130181120057]","National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Youth Project of Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Funding; Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education(Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP))","This research was sponsored by project grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant number 71302133], Youth Project of Ministry of Education, Humanities and Social Sciences Planning Funding [grant number 13YJC790154], and Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education [grant number 20130181120057].",,97,72,76,7,122,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The most prominent goals include a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction of the economy and an increase in the share of renewable energy in the whole energy sector. Since the long run effects of these policy measures are hard to assess, science-based policy evaluation methods are needed to identify weak points and areas with a need for action. This paper presents the results of the German Energy Reference Forecast with a focus on the electricity sector. It is based on an investment and dispatch model for the European electricity sector over the planning horizon of the 'Energiewende' up to 2050, with an emphasis on the time period up to 2030. We find that almost all targets of the German 'Energiewende' are not reached, for the case in which no further measures are undertaken. In particular reductions in GHG emissions fall short to the target value. Contrary to the negative results, e.g., regarding GHG-emissions as well as gross electricity consumption, generation from renewable energy sources will exceed the policy's target value.

Experts and scholars argue that utilities need to innovate their business models, and transform from commodity suppliers to service providers. The transition from a product-oriented, capital-intensive business model based on tangible assets, towards a service-oriented, expense-intensive business model based on intangible assets may present great managerial and organizational challenges. Little research exists about such transitions for capital-intensive commodity providers, and particularly energy utilities, where the challenges to servitize are expected to be greatest. This qualitative paper explores the barriers to servitization within selected Swiss and German utility companies through a series of interviews with utility managers. One of them is 'asset transformation', the shift from tangible to intangible assets as major input factor for the value proposition, which is proposed as a driver for the complexity of business model transitions. Managers need to carefully manage those challenges, and find ways to operate both new service and established utility business models aside. Policy makers can support the transition of utilities through more favorable regulatory frameworks for energy services, and by supporting the exchange of knowledge in the industry.

Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Sevilla, Bilbao and Zaragoza are surveyed, and two periods are compared: 2001 and 2011. The main driving factor behind the evolution of urban density is the huge and fast arrival and settlement of immigrants. This article explores these transformations through exploratory spatial data analysis and classic econometric models that relate urban density with distance to central business district. The presence of spatial effects is tested: spatial lag and error models are considered. Spatial error models are estimated. Two main consequences of real state bubble are as follows: (1) spatial autocorrelation has grown and (2) in Madrid, Barcelona and Zaragoza central areas with high urban density are larger than before. From a methodological point of view, the introduction of spatial effects in the classical urban population density models implies a clear reduction in the explaining power of distance.","[Martori, Joan Carles; Madariaga, Rafa; Oller, Ramon] Univ Cent Catalunya, Univ Vic, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona, Spain",Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (UVic-UCC),"Martori, JC (通讯作者)，Univ Cent Catalunya, Univ Vic, Dept Econ & Empresa, Barcelona, Spain.",martori@uvic.cat; rafa.madariaga@uvic.cat; ramon.oller@uvic.cat,"Martori, Joan-Carles/K-8641-2014; Madariaga, Rafa/AAA-6733-2019; Oller, Ramon/G-4676-2015","Martori, Joan-Carles/0000-0002-8400-5487; Madariaga, Rafa/0000-0002-2530-7813; Oller, Ramon/0000-0002-4333-0021",Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad [MTM2012-38067-C02],Ministerio de Economa y Competitividad(Spanish Government),The authors gratefully thank Jordi Surinach for his valuable suggestions on previous drafts of the paper.

With these data we are able to estimate different types of binary, multinomial and ordered logit models to capture different types of inter- or intra-sector or region employment mobility. As we will see the different categories of employment mobility are influenced by different factors such that we cannot simply talk about 'labour mobility', but rather need to be specific regarding each particular form of employment mobility. Our results show that urbanisation and industrial diversity are not just associated with greater intra-regional mobility, as is emphasised by the agglomeration literature, but also greater inter-regional mobility.","[Simonen, J.; Svento, R.] Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland; [McCann, P.] Univ Groningen, Fac Spatial Sci, Dept Econ Geog, Landleven 1, NL-9747 AD Groningen, Netherlands",University of Oulu; University of Groningen,"Simonen, J (通讯作者)，Univ Oulu, Oulu Business Sch, Dept Econ, POB 4600, Oulu 90014, Finland.",jaakko.simonen@oulu.fi,"; McCann, Philip/C-6307-2013","Simonen, Jaakko/0000-0001-9528-279X; McCann, Philip/0000-0003-0389-0654",Academy of Finland; Yrjo Jahnsson foundation,Academy of Finland(Research Council of Finland); Yrjo Jahnsson foundation,"The authors are grateful for valuable suggestions from two anonymous referees and financial support from the Academy of Finland and Yrjo Jahnsson foundation.

We applied the autoregressive conditional jump intensity (ARJI) model, combining with the generalized conditional heteroscedasticity (GRACH) method, to describe the volatility process and jump behavior in the global oil market. We separated the oil price shocks into positive and negative parts, to analyze whether oil price volatility had symmetric impacts on China's metal markets. We further used the likelihood ratio test to examine the symmetric effect of oil price shocks. In addition, we considered the jump behavior in oil prices as an input factor to investigate how China's metal markets are affected when jumps occur in the global oil market, in contrast to the existing research paying little attention to this issue. Our results indicate that crude oil price shocks have significant impacts on China's metal markets and the impacts are symmetric. When compared with aluminum, copper is more easily affected by oil price shocks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The Executive Order requires federal agencies to evaluate the impact of federal regulations on supply, distribution and use of energy. This study examined the impact of EO 13211 on United States environmental and conservation regulations proposed and promulgated by federal agencies. The study found that during rule making proceedings, EO 13211 had almost no effect on environmental and conservation actions taken by federal agencies. Most federal agency rules, both proposed and final, evaluating energy impacts pursuant to EO 13211 found no significant energy action and accordingly did not necessitate further regulatory review.

This paper gives new empirical evidence on internal migration's macroeconomic impact factors in Sweden from 1967 to 2003. Variables from the labour market, demography and geography serve as explanatory factors. The dynamic panel model's estimation contradicts recent results arguing that wage differences play no role in migration in Sweden. The paper's results suggest that wages and unemployment rates work as push and pull factors. These results are constant over time, not a development following the solidarity wage policy's break-up. While younger people are more likely to move, the increasing female labour force participation has hampered migration, especially in recent years.","[Gartner, Svenja] Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ Hist, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden",University of Gothenburg,"Gärtner, S (通讯作者)，Univ Gothenburg, Sch Business Econ & Law, Dept Econ Hist, Box 720, SE-40530 Gothenburg, Sweden.",svenja.gartner@econhist.gu.se,,"Gartner, Svenja/0000-0001-5131-1982",,,,,56,15,15,1,18,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Less agency cost is a plausible explanation when family businesses perform better than non-family businesses. Nonetheless minimizing agency cost through trust and strong social and emotional bonds in the family can lead to lower financial performance in several cases, because control is less strong. This way self-interested goals of family members lead to less good performance of the whole business. So less agency cost is not enough to make a general explanation. In stewardship theory the manager is not self-interested, but a long term oriented altruist. Based on strong social and emotional bonds the manager wants to follow financial and non-financial goals according to the needs of the family. Therefore, in the frame of stewardship theory performance can be lower in several cases, because resources are used up for non-financial goals. Both agency and stewardship theory says managers avoid risks for short or long term goals. In behavioural agency model family business managers is not seen as risk avoiders. Instead they avoid loss even if it means riskier decisions. They preserve the socioemotional wealth of the family, what is the most important capital for them. Family businesses in benign environment can follow long term non-financial goals. However, the manager is able to act as a homo economicus in a hostile environment, when socioemotional wealth is endangered. Behavioural agency model can explain why family business performance measures are inconsistent. In different circumstances family businesses risk tolerance is not static, socioemotional wealth is used as a reference point. So behavioural agency model can predict when will act a family business manager as an agent and raise financial performance to avoid loss. And it can tell us when is the time to follow family goals and let the usually short time oriented financial numbers be less impressive.","[Farkas, Gergely] Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kalvaria Sgt 1, Szeged, Hungary",Szeged University,"Farkas, G (通讯作者)，Univ Szeged, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Kalvaria Sgt 1, Szeged, Hungary.",farkas.gergely@eco.u-szeged.hu,,,,,,,40,0,0,1,11,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-592-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,135,144,,10.7441/dokbat.2016.14,0.0,,,10,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6IP,,"Green Submitted, Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000466741400014,0

Increasing transfer of transactions to electronic space determines the growth of the number of illegal digital operators and promotes consumers' involvement in digital shadow trade. Scientific literature does not contain any universal definition of digital shadow economy. Hence, the variety of terms, interpretations and features relevant to this phenomenon is rather wide, which determines the necessity to define the precise concept of digital shadow economy from the point of view of consumers as active participants in this field. This article is aimed at definition of the concept of digital shadow economy from consumers' position and identification of the measures would discourage potential consumers from participation in digital shadow economy. To increase the size of the survey sample, the method of snowball was engaged. The results of the research have revealed that consumers are inclined to distinguish criminal activities (drugs, prostitution, credential steals, etc.) from illegal economic activities, which also violate established legal norms and regulations. The participants of the survey perceive that the activities of digital shadow economy are performed exceptionally in electronic space without official registration of business and evading tax payment. Participation in digital shadow economy is voluntary and mutually beneficial to both transaction parties (a trader and a consumer). With reference to the results of consumers' evaluation, definition of digital shadow activities as illegal ones, development of the efficient legal framework, containing clearly established criminal and/or administrative responsibility for a consumer as a party of digital shadow transaction, public announcement and availability of the information on illegal e-traders in e-space, availability of appropriate protection software, more intensive supervision and control, establishment of e-police department and assurance of the sufficient number of supervising officers can be considered the most efficient measures of digital shadow economy prevention.

Building on the previous literature, this study extends the analysis beyond the county with the casino to explore the effects experienced by neighboring counties using both a difference-in-differences estimation and a spatial Durbin model. Real per capita county income is found to increase in counties with casinos, while unemployment drops. Neighboring counties also experience significant increases in income, though to a lesser magnitude, while unemployment rates are unaffected. Where adjacent counties each have casinos, a competition effect is found that reduces the impacts below what either county would have experienced without competition. Neighboring counties that have casinos experience increases in income and decreases in unemployment similar to counties without casinos that are adjacent to casino counties.","[Geisler, Karl R.] New Mexico State Univ, Dept Econ Appl Stat & Int Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA; [Nichols, Mark W.] Univ Nevada, Dept Econ, Reno, NV 89557 USA",New Mexico State University; Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE); University of Nevada Reno,"Geisler, KR (通讯作者)，New Mexico State Univ, Dept Econ Appl Stat & Int Business, Las Cruces, NM 88003 USA.",geisler@nmsu.edu; mnichols@unr.edu,,"Geisler, Karl/0000-0001-9998-4211",,,,,32,7,10,0,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The main objective of this study is to improve the financial gain while respecting the makespan (i. e. applying safe floats) in stochastic projects. Next, instead of the traditional use of float which prescribes a fixed delay in the start of activity in any condition, we use release dates as the by-product of above-mentioned method to reduce the variation in time and NPV of the project with less computational effort. The project models are simulated in SAS Simulation Studio. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used to design the experiments, interpret the results and predict the solution.

In the first part of the paper is analyzed recent development of the food security indicators in the European countries, then multivariate analysis is used to reduce dimension of the data. Countries were sorted into classes according their food security performance.

University students do not usually engage in a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, excessive alcohol drinking among students is truly a health problem. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to examine the association between alcohol drinking and healthy behaviors in undergraduate students from a large public technical university in the south of Poland (Europe). METHODS: A cross-sectional study was used with participants of 283 second year undergraduate students, aged 22 years (SD = 2.92), including 88 (31%) students of Physical Education and 195 (69%) students of the Technical Faculty. The study used self-administered questionnaires of the Alcohol Drinking Scale (ADS) and the Health Behavior Inventory (HBI), which includes the following subscales: healthy habits nutrition (HHN), preventive behavior (PB), positive adjustments (PA), and healthy practices (HP). RESULTS: Alcohol drinking was negatively correlated with the total HBI and also with two subscales: HHN and PPB. The female students drank significantly less alcohol than the male students and presented with a higher level of health behavior, both in the total HBI and in the individual HBI subscales, except for PA. Students of Physical Education drank more alcohol, and scored higher in preventive behaviors, than the students of Technical Faculties. CONCLUSION: It seems necessary to conduct general health education as part of prevention programs at the university, especially for male undergraduate students in the Physical Education faculty.","[Rogowska, Aleksandra] Univ Opole, Inst Psychol, Opole, Poland; [Wojciechowska-Maszkowska, Bozena; Borzucka, Dorota] Opole Univ Technol, Fac Phys Educ & Physiotherapy, Opole, Poland",University of Opole; Opole University of Technology,"Rogowska, A (通讯作者)，Univ Opole, Inst Psychol, Opole, Poland.",arogowska@uni.opole.pl; b.wojciechowska-maszkowska@po.opole.pl; d.borzucka@po.opole.pl,"Rogowska, Aleksandra Maria/J-3398-2013","Rogowska, Aleksandra Maria/0000-0002-4621-8916; Borzucka, Dorota/0000-0002-7402-4457",,,,,44,4,8,0,22,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,622,630,,10.12955/cbup.v4.822,0.0,,,9,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000092,0

In cell cultures, mycoplasma are extracellular parasites, usually attached to the external surface of a cell membrane. Many researchers use a mixture of penicillin and streptomycin in the cell culture to prevent contamination. Material and methods: We prepared cell cultures of lymphocytes from peripheral blood of 12 subjects and used micronucleus, assay which is the standard method, for detection of micronuclei in binuclear lymphocytes. Results: Use of standard antibiotics does not protect cell cultures against mycoplasma contamination. Penicillin has no effect on mycoplasma since mycoplasma lack cell wall. Streptomycin inhibits about half the mycoplasma strains but is ineffective against others. In fact, mycoplasma is generally resistant to most antibiotic mixtures commonly used in cell culture. We didn't find any mycoplasma contamination in the cell culture where penicillin-streptomycin mixture was absent, but confirmed infection in the culture containing mixture of antibiotics. Conclusion: Antibiotics and mixture of antibiotics like penicillin-streptomycin mixture does not protect the cell culture against mycoplasma contamination. Hence, contamination can spread rapidly to other cell lines through aerosol droplet dispersion.","[Velickova, Nevenka; Milev, Misko; Sumanov, Gorgi; Petrova, Biljana] Univ Goce Delcev, Fac Med Sci, Stip, North Macedonia",Goce Delcev University of Stip,"Velickova, N (通讯作者)，Univ Goce Delcev, Fac Med Sci, Stip, North Macedonia.",nevenka.velickova@ugd.edu.mk,"Milev, Misko/JQV-6596-2023","Milev, Misko/0000-0002-8120-4771","University Goce Delcev from Stip, Republic of Macedonia","University Goce Delcev from Stip, Republic of Macedonia","The results of the research are parts of the study financially supported by University Goce Delcev from Stip, Republic of Macedonia.",,7,1,1,0,4,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,763,766,,10.12955/cbup.v4.846,0.0,,,4,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, Green Accepted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000115,0

This paper focuses on investigating the influential factors of China's energy intensity using provincial-level panel data from 1985 to 2012. More specifically, we try to identify which factor is relatively more important to pay attention to. A novel approach based on evolutionary computation is proposed to intelligently mine the intrinsic relations between observed phenomena and to let the important factors automatically emerge from the discovered nonlinear models. However, due to China's vast territory and significant heterogeneities, this approach may fail to examine some detailed or hidden information when analyzing the country as a whole. Instead, we concentrate on the provincial level because the provinces play vital roles in reducing energy intensity in China. From our analytical results, the main findings are as follows: (1) the Total Population is the most important influential factor across China's provinces, while the Energy Price Index has the least impact; and (2) the provinces could be naturally classified into four categories based on the primary factors emerged from data, and such classification could reveal more about the true underlying features of each area.

It examines the impacts of those different specifications and economic factors on the spillovers between those considered markets. The results show that the impacts of the own shocks (petroleum on petroleum and currency on currency) are statistically significant and positive in almost all cases as expected for the models of natural gas and WTI oil, irrespectively of the currency considered. The asymmetry effect is stronger in the oil than in the natural gas markets. There is stronger and significant evidence that uncertainty affects volatility much more the mean. For the WTI oil, almost all policy and other uncertainty measures lead to an increase in the conditional variance. For currencies, coefficients are commonly significant independent of the presence of petroleum commodities in the bivariate model. The striking result for natural gas is the limited statistical relevance of the economic policy and other uncertainty measures due to the long contracts that characterize this market. Finally, common macroeconomic forces associated with the business cycle can drive these petroleum and currency markets and may cause jumps and co-jumps in the volatility of these markets. The conclusion provides policy implications of the paper's results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact of increasing wind power capacity on the optimal generation mix and generator profitability is analyzed for a test case that approximates the electricity market in Texas (ERCOT). We analyze three market policies that may support resource adequacy: Operating Reserve Demand Curves (ORDC), Fixed Reserve Scarcity Prices (FRSP) and fixed capacity payments (CP). Optimal expansion plans are comparable between the ORDC and FRSP implementations, while capacity payments may result in additional new capacity. The FRSP policy leads to frequent reserves scarcity events and corresponding price spikes, while the ORDC implementation results in more continuous energy prices. Average energy prices decrease with increasing wind penetration under all policies, as do revenues for baseload and wind generators. Intermediate and peak load plants benefit from higher reserve prices and are less exposed to reduced energy prices. All else equal, an ORDC approach may be preferred to FRSP as it results in similar expansion and revenues with less extreme energy prices. A fixed CP leads to additional new flexible NGCT units, but lower profits for other technologies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, we make use of secondary statistics on tourism and wind turbine locations at the level of German municipalities.

This paper derives a criterion comparing prices versus tradable quantities in terms of expected welfare, given uncertainty, optimal policy and endogenous cost structure. I show that one cannot determine which regulatory instrument that induces the highest expected welfare based on the relative curvatures of the cost and benefit functions alone. Furthermore, optimal policy involves different production (or price) targets across the regulatory instruments, and does not equalize marginal costs and expected marginal benefits under prices. The reason is that firms choose a cost structure which induces too large variance in consumption of the public good under prices, and the regulator has to compensate for this when determining optimal policy. Because no such negative externality arises under quantities, the relative performance of prices is deteriorated. A numerical illustration suggests significant impact. Finally, either regulatory instrument may induce the highest technology investment levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To tackle the challenge and realize sustainable development, the Chinese government launched the Energy-Saving Generation Dispatch (ESGD) in 2007. In the ESGD scheme, generating units are dispatched based on fuel consumption rates and pollutant emission intensities from low to high. However, annual generation quotas still widely exist With the mandatory shutdown of small-capacity and low-efficiency thermal generating units in 2006-2010, most of the currently running thermal generating units are large-capacity and highly efficient units. The additional improvement of the overall energy efficiency under this situation is a key problem for the Chinese electric power industry. To this end, a new type of ESGD framework is designed in this paper. Sequential coordination among yearly, monthly, day-ahead and real-time generation schedules is proposed. Based on the framework, the corresponding models are formulated. Empirical analysis is conducted using the realistic data obtained from the Guangdong Power Grid Corporation. Four generation dispatch modes are compared. The results indicate that the proposed ESGD mode can further reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions. Hopefully, this paper can provide a valuable reference for policy making in the Chinese power sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We consider imposing such positivity constraint in local historical average (LHA) in nonparametric kernel regression framework. It is also extended to the semiparametric single index model when multiple predictors are used. We construct the constrained LHA estimator via an indicator function which operates as model-selection between the unconstrained LHA and the bound of the constraint (zero for the positivity constraint). We smooth the indicator function by bagging, which operates as model-averaging and yields a combined forecast of unconstrained LHA forecasts and the bound of the constraint. The local combining weights are determined by the probability that the constraint is binding. Asymptotic properties of the constrained LHA estimators without and with bagging are established, which show how the positive constraint and bagging can help reduce the asymptotic variance and mean squared errors. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to show the finite sample behavior of the asymptotic properties. In predicting U.S. equity premium, we show that substantial nonlinearity can be captured by LHA and that the local positivity constraint can improve out-of-sample prediction of the equity premium.","[Lee, Tae-Hwy; Ullah, Aman] Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA; [Tu, Yundong] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Tu, Yundong] Peking Univ, Ctr Stat Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China",University of California System; University of California Riverside; Peking University; Peking University,"Lee, TH (通讯作者)，Univ Calif Riverside, Dept Econ, Riverside, CA 92521 USA.",taelee@ucr.edu; yundong.tu@gmail.com; aman.ullah@ucr.edu,"ullah, aman/JQW-5104-2023","ullah, aman/0000-0002-7822-9222","UCR Academic Senate; National Natural Science Foundation of China [71301004, 71472007]",UCR Academic Senate; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors thank the Joint Editor (Rong Chen), the Associate Editor, and three anonymous referees for many valuable suggestions that helped improve the article.

In this study, impact of the low emission vehicles is assessed using AIM/Enduse model with 10 regions in Japan. The model is revised to integrate power generation sector and to separate the transportation demand into small, medium and large size vehicles in order to reflect the availability of BEV and fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) in each vehicle size. In the Reference case, hybrid vehicle accounts for more than a half of transport demand in 2050. However, by introducing the carbon tax to achieve the 2 degree target, the share of both BEV and FCEV in 2050 reaches around 90% and 60% in passenger and freight transport, respectively. In addition, electricity demand pattern is transformed by demand side management in 2050 while integrating more intermittent renewable energy into electricity system. As a result, the CO2 emissions from transport sector in 2050 decreases by approximately 81% compared to the 1990 level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Consumers felt they did not receive a fair price for electricity exported to the network and feared that changes in utility prices could render their investment uneconomical. Concerns regarding members of industry may be allayed by certification schemes, but these remain voluntary and limited in effectiveness. These findings underscore the need for increased government activity in providing independent information to consumers and regulating the solar industry, including commitments to long term policies and certification schemes.

Our results are consistent with empirical evidence in several respects. A standardized EMS increases the internal control at the cost of introducing some degree of rigidity that entails an endogenous setup cost. Standardized systems are more prone to be adopted by big and well established firms and under tougher environmental policies. Firms with standardized EMS tend to devote more effort to abatement although this effort results in lower pollution only if public incentives are strong enough, suggesting a complementarity relationship between standardized EMS and public policies. Emission charges have both a marginal effect on abatement and a qualitative effect on the adoption decision that may induce a conflict between private and public interests. As a result of the combination of these two effects it can be optimal for the government to distort the tax in a specific way in order to push the firm to choose the socially optimal EMS. The introduction of standardized systems can result in win-win situations where firms, society and the environment get better off. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

To enable researchers and policy makers to use the wealth of collective knowledge obtained through these expert elicitations we develop and present a set of assumptions to harmonize them. We also aggregate expert estimates within each study and across studies to facilitate the comparison. The analysis showed that, as expected, technology costs are expected to go down by 2030 with increasing levels of R&D investments, but that there is not a high level of agreement between individual experts or between studies regarding the technology areas that would benefit the most from R&D investments. This indicates that further study of prospective cost data may be useful to further inform R&D investments. We also found that the contributions of additional studies to the variance of costs in one technology area differed by technology area, suggesting that (barring new information about the downsides of particular forms of elicitations) there may be value in not only including a diverse and relatively large group of experts, but also in using different methods to collect estimates.

Despite the recent proliferation of papers dealing with knowledge transfer by multinational enterprises (MNEs) in China, there is limited work investigating the role of geographic space on knowledge transfer. Given the growing interest in knowledge transfer by MNEs, the lack of research on geographic space in the Chinese context is a significant gap in our knowledge. In response, we have conducted what we believe to be the first study on the relationship between geographic space and knowledge transfer by the Japanese MNEs to their subsidiaries in China. The paper reviews the relevant literature from which it develops a theoretical model which is then tested empirically. We then provide empirical results on the relationship between geographic space, perceived distance and knowledge transfer. A LISREL model is employed to study the impact of the latent variables associated with geographic space on knowledge transfer. Based on the results, this study provides useful insights for economic geographers who wish to study knowledge transfer between parent companies and their subsidiaries across geographic space.","[Jasimuddin, Sajjad M.] Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France; [Li, Jun] Lvshunkou Econ Dev Zone, Dalian, Peoples R China; [Perdikis, Nicholas] Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, Dyfed, Wales",Kedge Business School; Aberystwyth University,"Jasimuddin, SM (通讯作者)，Kedge Business Sch, Marseille, France.",sajjad.jasimuddin@kedgebs.com; ijun611@hotmail.com; nip@aber.ac.uk,,,,,,,140,19,20,1,35,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

With the success of these efforts, heated debates have surfaced in a number of U.S. states about the impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers. We performed a scoping analysis using a financial model to quantify the financial impacts of customer-sited PV on utility shareholders and ratepayers and to assess the magnitude of these impacts under alternative utility conditions. We find that customer-sited PV generally reduces utility collected revenues greater than reductions in costs leading to a revenue erosion effect and lost future earnings opportunities. We also find that average retail rates increase as utility costs are spread over a relatively smaller sales base. We analyze these results under various assumptions about utility operating and regulatory environments and find that these impacts can vary greatly depending upon the specific circumstances of the utility. Based on this analysis, we highlight potential implications for policymakers and identify key issues warranting further analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Drawing on the Regional Innovation Systems (RIS) approach, we argue that local development dynamics result from the interaction of various subsystems: science, politics, public administration, industry, finance, intermediaries and civil society. The analysis of the involved subsystems and their interaction shows how energy transitions are shaped by different individual and organisational actors as well as institutions on the local level. Empirical evidence from case studies on the German cities of Emden and Bottrop illustrates our theoretical conceptualisation of energy transitions. We conclude by presenting characteristic interaction patterns for energy transition drawn from the two cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a survey-based regional input-output table, values of delta are derived for the German federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. Furthermore, an extended formula - called industry-specific FLQ (SFLQ) - is introduced which allows for variation in delta by industry. Finally, the advantage of the SFLQ is demonstrated and evidence is found of a close relationship between the spatial concentration of an industry at the national level and its propensity to import goods and services from other regions.","Hamburg Inst Int Econ, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany",,"Kowalewksi, J (通讯作者)，Hamburg Inst Int Econ, Heimhuder Str 71, D-20148 Hamburg, Germany.",kowalewski@hwwi.org,,,,,,,24,53,56,1,26,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The objective of the study is to explore qualitatively why the energy security situation has not improved. To answer the 'why' question, the study opens up a new perspective by analyzing the relationship between energy security and energy policies from the macroeconomic reform perspective. This study discusses major reforms that took place over 30 years. It is found that China's macroeconomic reform has restricted the formation of China's energy policies and determined its energy security situation. In essence, China's energy policies are only a reaction to the macroeconomic measures. In other words, China's energy policies are not originally intended to improve energy security, but passive reactions to China's macroeconomic reform. This explains why China did not improve its energy security situation despite 30 years of reform. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We provide evidence for a significantly negative link between volatility spreads and expected returns at the daily and weekly frequencies. We argue that this link is driven by the information flow from option markets to stock markets. The documented relation is significantly stronger for the periods during which (i) S&P 500 constituent firms announce their earnings; (ii) cash flow and discount rate news are large in magnitude; and (iii) consumer sentiment index takes extreme values. The intertemporal relation remains strongly negative after controlling for conditional volatility, variance risk premium, and macroeconomic variables. Moreover, a trading strategy based on the intertemporal relation with volatility spreads has higher portfolio returns compared to a passive strategy of investing in the S&P 500 index, after transaction costs are taken into account.","[Atilgan, Yigit; Demirtas, K.

Calls for more substantively multipolar, comparative and cosmopolitan modes of urban theory-making have been circulating for more than a decade now, and they have begun to spawn a range of alternative approaches to urban studies. But in practice, the challenge of more worldly, comparative theorization has been unevenly met, often more through difference-finding and deconstructive manoeuvres than through projects of urban-theoretical renewal and reconstruction. The provisional outcome has been interpreted as an impasse in urban theory; some are even reporting its death. While these reports are surely premature, there are risks as well as opportunities in the embrace of particularism and polycentrism in urban studies, especially if this impedes: first, the effective realization of comparative methodologies; second, the theoretical interrogation of pan-urban processes and patterns, relationally understood; and third, constructive dialogue across theoretical traditions, notably at the interface between political economy and postcolonialism.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada",University of British Columbia,"Peck, J (通讯作者)，Univ British Columbia, Dept Geog, 1984 West Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z2, Canada.",jamie.peck@ubc.ca,"Peck, Jamie/A-9072-2009",,,,,,108,218,243,7,139,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The global management and financing of electric utilities promoted their rapid expansion throughout the Western world, but the evolution of electricity systems in each country greatly diverged according to the timing of industrialisation and local conditions. The article shows that the evolution, profitability and extent of electricity systems depended upon economic conditions, market structures and the natural resources available in each country. While we identify similar trends of electricity production and consumption, the structure of both electricity markets reveals great contrasts. A very profitable electricity system which primarily served the Pampas region became consolidated in Argentina, while the early development of hydroelectricity associated with more diversified regional production made way for a less profitable, but more extended and equitable system in Spain.","[Bartolome, Isabel] Univ Seville, Seville, Spain; [Lanciotti, Norma] Univ Nacl Rosario, RA-2000 Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina; [Lanciotti, Norma] Consejo Nacl Invest Cient & Tecn CONICET, Buenos Aires, DF, Argentina",University of Sevilla; National University of Rosario; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET),"Bartolomé, I (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",,"BARTOLOMÉ-RODRÍGUEZ, ISABEL/K-5165-2014","BARTOLOMÉ-RODRÍGUEZ, ISABEL/0000-0001-9219-2916",,,,,72,0,0,0,9,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Outcomes were modelled for 396 possible generation portfolios, each with 10,000 simulations of possible fuel and carbon prices and electricity demands. In 2030, the lowest expected cost generation portfolio includes 60% renewable energy. Increasing the renewable proportion to 75% slightly increased expected cost (by $0.2/MWh), but significantly decreased the standard deviation of cost (representing the cost risk). Increasing the renewable proportion from the present 15% to 75% by 2030 is found to decrease expected wholesale electricity costs by $17/MWh. Fossil-fuel intensive portfolios have substantial cost risk associated with high uncertainty in future gas and carbon prices. Renewables can effectively mitigate cost risk associated with gas and carbon price uncertainty. This is found to be robust to a wide range of carbon pricing assumptions. This modelling suggests that policy mechanisms to promote an increase in renewable generation towards a level of 75% by 2030 would minimise costs to consumers, and mitigate the risk of extreme electricity prices due to uncertain gas and carbon prices.

This paper uses a multi-regional CGE model to evaluate two types of renewable support schemes; a subsidy scheme like a feed-in tariff (FIT) with a direct price impact for final consumers and a subsidy scheme without any price impact. We assess the CO2 consequences of both approaches, as well as their impact on economic activity in terms of GDP, industrial structure, electricity generation structure, and regional final demand elasticities of electricity. We find that a support scheme with price impact is much more effective in reducing CO2 emissions while the difference in GDP between the two policies is small. We estimate that the price implications of the support scheme allow for an additional emissions reduction of 113 Mt CO2-or 0.07% of total emissions-in China during 2020-2035. The support scheme with a price impact does not lead to a negative impact on the Chinese economy although there are significant differences among regions. In addition, while the whole country faces an approximately unitary electricity elasticity demand, we find significant differences in electricity demand elasticities among Chinese regions.

It extends the evolution of an n-person prisoner's dilemma within actual geographical space, integrating an agent-based model with GIS, in conflicting spatial interactions that ultimately lead to the decline of cooperation. The spatial agent-based model captures the response strategies of autonomous individuals in a landscape that contextualizes both the natural and the built environment. The result suggests that the loss of context preservation could lead to the extinction of cooperation, the opposite of the earlier findings. This theoretical framework thus serves as a basis for the analysis of collective strategic decisions about the use of a common resource from a game theoretical perspective.","[Anantsuksomsri, Sutee] Chulalongkorn Univ, Fac Architecture, Bangkok, Thailand; [Anantsuksomsri, Sutee] Waseda Univ, Waseda Inst Adv Study, Tokyo, Japan; [Tontisirin, Nij] Thammasat Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Bangkok, Thailand",Chulalongkorn University; Waseda University; Thammasat University,"Tontisirin, N (通讯作者)，Thammasat Univ, Fac Architecture & Planning, Bangkok, Thailand.",nij@ap.tu.ac.th,"Anantsuksomsri, Sutee/AAT-1265-2021; Tontisirin, Nij/K-1353-2015","Tontisirin, Nij/0000-0002-7706-194X; Anantsuksomsri, Sutee/0000-0002-2302-1782",,,,,24,4,5,1,27,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Using European Energy Exchange data from 2000 to 2015, we find rather high volatility in the years 2000-2009 but also that the weekly price range has significantly declined in the period following the year 2009. This period is characterised by active regulation under the Energy Industry Law (EnWG), the EU Emissions Trading Directive (ETD) and the Renewable Energy Law (EEG). In contrast to the preceding period, price jumps are smaller and less frequent (especially for day-time hours), implying that current policy measures are effective in promoting renewable energies while simultaneously upholding electricity market stability. This is because the regulations strive towards a more and more flexible and market-oriented structure which allows better integration of renewable energies and supports an efficient alignment of renewable electricity supply with demand.

We investigate economic, ecological, social and energy system related factors that drive municipalities to strive for energy self-sufficiency with a focus on electricity supply. The empirical data for this study is based on insights generated through expert interviews (N=19) with mayors, energy experts and scientists as well as a quantitative study among mayors and energy officers (N=109) of German municipalities. Results show that environmental awareness, tax revenues and greater independence from private utilities are positively related to the mayors' attitude towards the realization of energy self-sufficiency. Furthermore, citizens, the political environment, the mayor's political power, and his/her financial resources are relevant factors for a municipality striving for energy self-sufficiency. Policymakers need to decide whether or not to support mayors in this development. For suitable policy interventions, the results suggest the importance of an integrated approach that considers a combination of identified factors. Finally, we propose a morphological box to structure different aspects of energy self-sufficiency and categorize the present study. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, whereas research on natural resources frequently seeks to understand policy outcome through a geopolitical prism, when it comes to electricity studies the prism is always economic or technical. Hence, this study is a first attempt to identify the geopolitical dimension of cross-border electricity grids. The study argues that success in establishing electricity grids requires identifying how the geopolitical dimension interplays with the physical dimension. To examine the role of these geopolitical bottlenecks, the study examines negotiation protocols, spanning over 15 years, on establishing ten grid connections between Israel and its Arab neighbors. It finds that electricity geopolitics has been used both as a platform for deeper international cooperation and as a stick against neighboring states. When policies are driven by a peace dividend, proposals for grid connection appear to evolve and overcome the dependency and the security-economy bottlenecks. When relations deteriorate, proposals for grid connections appear to undergo reconsideration and to be held hostage by higher politics. If, when and how electricity grids materialize is a function of the nature of the electricity network as a twofold package and of the ability of the planning process to accommodate geopolitical uncertainty.

Seven types of LDV simulation models (including gasoline, diesel, and hybrid cars) were generated based on the AVL CRUISE program and the LDV sales ratio was used to estimate the CACE value of five companies in Korea. The prediction accuracy of the LDV models was validated using chassis dynamometer test data. Then, the effectiveness of the CACE reduction strategies was investigated based on the developed LDV simulation models. From the results of this study, it was revealed that all of the companies cannot satisfy the 2020 CACE regulation by just adopting a single strategy. In order to solve this problem, two types of CACE plans that combined several strategies (reducing the mass drag and fuel consumption rate, and adding a hybrid module, etc.) were proposed. After implementing the two types of CACE, plan, it was predicted that five companies will be able to satisfy the 2020 CACE regulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to determine the appropriate model and decide the preferred estimator, the Hausman test was performed. The PMGE model emerged as the most efficient of the three estimators. Also, the results obtained revealed a bi-directional causality between economic growth and electricity consumption in these countries, which supports the feedback hypothesis. As a result, this implies that if these countries adopt or implement any energy or electricity conservation policies, this may have a negative impact on its economic growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite the importance of CCS, however, studies of technology and demand forecasting for CCS are scarce. This study bridges this gap in the body of knowledge on this topic by forecasting CCS technology and demand based on an integrated model. For technology forecasting, a logistic model and patent network analysis are used to compare the competitiveness of CCS technology for selected countries. For demand forecasting, a competition diffusion model is adopted to consider competition among renewable energies and forecast demand. The results show that the number of patent applications for CCS technology will increase to 16,156 worldwide and to 4,790 in Korea by 2025. We also find that the United States has the most competitive CCS technology followed by Korea and France. Moreover, about 5 million tCO(2)e of GHG will be reduced by 2040 if CCS technology is adopted in Korea after 2020. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The ban was eventually lifted in early 2016. This paper examines the shifts of global trade flows and strategic refinery investments in a spatial, game theoretic partial equilibrium model. We consider detailed oil supply chain infrastructure with multiple crude oil types, distinct oil products, as well as specific refinery configurations and modes of transport. Prices, quantities produced and consumed, as well as infrastructure and refining capacity investments are endogenous to the model. We compare two scenarios: an insulated US crude oil market, and a counter-factual with lifted export restrictions. We find a significant expansion of US sweet crude exports with the lift of the export ban. In the US refinery sector, more (imported) heavy sour crude is transformed. Countries importing US sweet crude gain from higher product output, while avoiding costly refinery investments. Producers of heavy sour crude (e.g. the Middle East) are incentivised to climb up the value chain to defend their market share and maintain their dominant position. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As a first step in testing the proposal, it presents a simple Monte-Carlo simulation, illustrating some of the workings of the method of assessment and demonstrating the kind of results it will be able to supply. This on-going work will assist policy makers take better informed decisions about the size, structure and organisation of a nuclear regulator and the cost-effective funding of its accountability system. It will assist in striking a balance between efficiency and resilience of regulatory decision-making processes. It will also promote the involvement of stakeholders and allow them to have a more meaningful impact on regulatory decisions, thereby enhancing the robustness of the regulatory system and potentially trust and confidence.

Such a typology articulates the importance of consumer behavior in the policy design for a transition, and the relevance for the market to select target subjects of policy during the deployment stage of clean technology innovation. We apply this typology to policy instruments of China's new energy vehicle (NEV) industry between 1991 and 2015 in order to explain the industry's rapid growth. The focus of China's policy mix has transited from government-selection to market-selection, and from producer-orientation to consumer-orientation. Other than the new typology, this paper traces the entire history of policy transition within China's NEV industry, and finds the transition to be a result of policy learning, thus contributing to future empirical studies of this industry.

We fill this gap by combining an analysis of outage vulnerability with an examination of infrastructure acceptability, using a unique data set from 15 EU countries with household-level information on both aspects of power provision. We find only limited evidence of a positive relationship between local residents' sensitivity to outages and their acceptability of new energy infrastructure projects. This stresses the importance of creating awareness amongst stakeholders on how planned infrastructure expansions relate to energy security for their own household. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This is frequently attributed to the unexpected high increase in renewable power generation. Using a parsimonious fundamental model, we determine the respective impact of supply and demand shocks on electricity futures prices. The used methodology is based on a piecewise linear approximation of the supply stack and time-varying price-inelastic demand. This parsimonious model is able to replicate electricity futures prices and discover non-linear dependencies in futures price formation. We show that emission prices have a higher impact on power prices than renewable penetration. Changes in renewables, demand and installed capacities turn out to be similarly important for explaining the decrease in operation margins of conventional power plants. We thus argue for the establishment of an independent authority to stabilize emission prices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite this, the role of supply chain actors has been largely overlooked in strategies seeking to encourage the installation of more sustainable domestic heating technologies. With reference to central heating, this paper responds through an ethnographic analysis of how plumbers' merchants and sales representatives can influence the work of heating installers in the United Kingdom. It applies two dimensions of the concept of 'social capital': relational and structural. Relational social capital focuses on the trust, loyalty and reciprocity at play in relations, whilst structural social capital considers how the strength of tie can influence those to whom people turn for advice and support. Together, these ideas demonstrate how relationships amongst these groups can serve to influence product choice and facilitate information exchange. The paper concludes by discussing how these supply chains might be engaged with as a means of encouraging the installation of low carbon domestic technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This approach responds to the increasing requirement of decision support systems to assess complex effects of urban policies because through linking the bid-rents with hedonic prices, it is possible to connect the quantity estimates of the spatial interaction models with the value estimates of the hedonic price approach. The combined methodology is applied to Terceira Island to assess the spatial and economic impact of the decrease in activity of Lajes Military Airfield on employment and on the real estate value of the island. The SIM distributes employment and population by the 31 zones of Terceira Island in the Azores given the distances between zones, the basic employment per zone, the average distances for commuting and shopping and the space available for urban activities. The model's friction parameters are iteratively calibrated to secure that estimated average commuting and shopping distances are equal to those observed in reality; bid-rents are also calibrated to guarantee that the demand for space in each zone does not overcomes the available sspace for urban activities per zone. The SIM is coded and integrated in MATLAB 2013a. Afterward, a hedonic price regression is estimated to explain house prices in relation to the calibrated bid-rents and house typologies. The effect of the Lajes Military Airfield drawdown is estimated by the SIM, which evaluates the impacts on employment and population, and a hedonic price regression is subsequently performed with the new SIM bid-rents,to appraise the new real estate value. Results show that the Lajes Military Airfield reduction of 750 basic employment will result not only in a decrease of 1552 total employments and 3502 of the 56,437 residents of the island but also in a loss of 55 million a,not sign in real estate value. The method has proved its usefulness and effectiveness for predicting the impacts of exogenous shocks in complex urban systems.","[Borba, Joao O.; Dentinho, Tomaz Ponce] Univ Acores, Rua Capitao Joao dAvila,Cab 155, P-9700851 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores,"Dentinho, TP (通讯作者)，Univ Acores, Rua Capitao Joao dAvila,Cab 155, P-9700851 Angra Do Heroismo, Portugal.",tomazdentinho@uac.pt,"Dentinho, Tomaz Ponce/ABG-8885-2020","Dentinho, Tomaz Ponce/0000-0002-7409-2345",,,,,34,4,5,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The panel cointegration test results show a long-run relationship between particulate matter emissions, trade openness, and economic growth. We find that increased trade openness leads to environmental degradation for the global sample. However, the results differ according to the income of countries. Trade openness has a benign effect on the environment in high-income countries, but a harmful effect in middle- and low-income countries. These results are generally robust to different measures of trade openness and environmental quality. Interestingly and significantly, the results are consistent with the popular notion that rich countries dump their pollution on poor countries. Finally, we find evidence of a feedback effect between trade openness and particulate matter emissions for the global sample as well as different income groups of countries. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It applies the bounds testing approach to cointegration to time series data at individual country levels over the period from 1970 to 2011. The study finds that energy consumption is cointegrated with real GDP per capita, industrial output, imports, foreign direct investment, credit to private sector, urbanization and population. Furthermore, the sign and magnitude of long-run estimates vary significantly for a single country and across countries depending on the energy consumption variable used. Overall, the findings confirm the leading role of economic growth, industrial output, population and urbanization. Economic growth, industrial output and population have positive effects on energy consumption in the majority of countries. Given the urgent need to address climate change, African countries should adopt policies to improve energy efficiency and accelerate transition toward renewable energy. The African Renewable Energy Initiative launched at the 21st session of the United Nations Conference of the Parties (COP21) is an opportunity for African countries to provide and maintain widespread access to reliable and affordable environmentally cleaner energy to meet the requirements of rapid economic growth and improved living standards.

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Leveque (2015), study only 26% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This paper revisits the firm in the region' and the region in the firm' dichotomy through the case of Tesco's retail expansion in Asia. It focuses on the tension between the transference of proven key capabilities to the host economies Tesco has entered, and strategic localization, primarily for customer-facing, corporate culture, regulatory and institutional reasons. It is demonstrated how the retailer has pursued a multi-scalar adaptive approach that goes beyond any standardized/localized dichotomy to respond to differences between and within national markets. In the process, this paper provides evidence of genuine two-way knowledge flow between the home market and subsidiaries, between subsidiaries themselves, and of subsidiaries granted autonomy and the ability to flex their strategies.","[Wood, Steve] Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England; [Coe, Neil M.] Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, AS2,03-01,1 Arts Link, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore; [Wrigley, Neil] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Surrey; National University of Singapore; University of Southampton,"Wood, S (通讯作者)，Univ Surrey, Surrey Business Sch, Guildford GU2 7XH, Surrey, England.;Coe, NM (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Geog, AS2,03-01,1 Arts Link, Kent Ridge 117570, Singapore.;Wrigley, N (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",sm.wood@surrey.ac.uk; geonmc@nus.edu.sg; n.wrigley@soton.ac.uk,"Coe, Neil/AAN-8902-2020; Wrigley, Neil/B-3224-2011","Coe, Neil/0000-0001-7720-5061; Wood, Steve/0000-0001-5028-7458",,,,,105,25,25,1,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, existing estimates for CO2 storage capacity are very uncertain. This uncertainty is due to limited geological knowledge, a lack of large-scale research on CO2 injection, and different assessment approaches and parameter settings. Hence storage scenarios represent a method that can be used by policy makers to demonstrate the range of possible storage capacity developments, to help interpret uncertain results and to identify the limitations of existing assessments. In this paper, three storage scenarios are developed for China by evaluating China-wide studies supplemented with more detailed site- and basin specific assessments. It is estimated that the greatest storage potential can be found in deep saline aquifers. Oil and gas fields may also be used. Coal seams are only included in the highest storage scenario. In total, the scenarios presented demonstrate that China has an effective storage capacity of between 65 and 1551 Gt of CO2. Furthermore, the authors emphasise a need for action to harmonise storage capacity assessment approaches due to the uncertainties involved in the capacity assessments analysed in this study.

As low carbon energy (ICE) will play a pivotal role in reducing CO2 emissions, our paper is to assess the extent and the conditions under which a carbon ETS can deliver LCE investment in China. We chose wind technology as a case study and a real-option based model was built to explore the impact of a number of variables and design features on investment decisions, e.g. carbon and electricity price, carbon market risk, carbon price floor and ceiling and on-grid ratio. We compute critical values of these variables and features and explore trade-offs among them. According to our work, a carbon ETS has a significant effect on wind power plant investment although it cannot support investment in wind power on its own. Carbon price stabilization mechanisms such as carbon price floor can significantly improve the effect of carbon ETS but the critical floor to support investment is still much higher than the carbon price in China pilot ETSs. Our results show that other policy measures will be needed to promote low-carbon energy development in China. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Investment decisions for adopting new technologies are costly and sometimes risky because technological investments are irreversible. To simulate the process, comprehensive technological adoption regarding investment timing was used in a management decision support model. The constructed model is structured as follows: 1) historical demand paths analysis; 2) application of statistical data validity tests; 3) the forecast of market parameters regarding data arrays using the geometric Brownian motion method, based on Monte Carlo simulation; 4) determination of technological life cycle using a Hodrick-Prescott filter; 5) technological adoption time-window determination; and 6) calculation of company net present values (NPV) based on change in free cash-flow. The model for mature 5G mobile markets, created and empirical tested, was performed in relation to 18 largest Europe mobile service providers, as potential decision makers operating across 33 countries. Results confirmed that selection of the technological investment time depends on companies' strategic financial decisions and financial state. The performed simulations revealed the consequence of 5G technology investment for investor roles, clustered according to financial data within a 5-year period (2010-2014). The analyzed companies were assigned to roles of pioneers-innovators, pragmatics, followers, or laggards. Finally, it is assumed and argued that financial parameters indicate the willingness to adopt new technologies in a global technologically changing environment.","[Adamauskas, Saulius; Krusinskas, Rytis] Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Kaunas, Lithuania",Kaunas University of Technology,"Adamauskas, S (通讯作者)，Kaunas Univ Technol, Sch Business & Econ, Kaunas, Lithuania.",saulius.adamauskas@ktu.lt; rytis.krusinskas@ktu.lt,"Krusinskas, Rytis/ABG-9619-2020","KRUSINSKAS, RYTIS/0000-0002-0964-588X",,,,,63,0,0,0,4,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,248,256,,10.12955/cbup.v4.853,0.0,,,9,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000036,0

The practices of health care workers are viewed as intricate activities with influential prospects. Studies have shown that the simple delivery of written strategies or procedures is unsuccessful more often than not, managerial supervision along with adequate feedback is generally regarded as being the more effective method. Complex interventions can also be considered to be more effective than simple ones, the implementation of urgent cost effective trials is necessary in establishing a more efficient guiding policy.

Three aspects are studied: 1) Legislation related to this activity; 2) The contracts that were signed between gas companies and city councils and the relationships between both, and 3) Competition with electricity. Additionally, three stages are defined: 1) 1841-1880; 2) 1880-1913, and 3) 1941-1936. Between 1841 and 1859 we see the consolidation of standard contracts with city councils. Between 1860 and 1870 changes were incorporated into contracts with city councils to ensure better service. At the same time a series of standards related to gas meters were passed, together with some related to city councils' contributions to public lighting. The decade of the 1880s was marked by the appearance of electricity. From the beginning of the 20th century to 1913 central government sought to guarantee the regularity and continuity of supply, and from 1914 to 1936 there was greater intervention by the state.","[Fernandez-Paradas, Mercedes] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad de Malaga,"Fernández-Paradas, M (通讯作者)，Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain.",,,,,,,,96,1,1,0,1,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The most famous and available inhibitor, kojic acid, has several side effects and is not completely safe for use. OBJECTIVES: This paper describes the study of inhibitory influence of halogen boroxine K-2[B(3)0(3)F(4)OH] on tyrosinase. The research was prompted by the ability of this compound to inhibit enzymes through metal ion chelation as well as its synthesis and application in cosmetic skin products that produce no serious side-effects. METHOD: Tyrosinase activity was measured by spectrophotometric analysis for the appearance of dopachrome pigment at a wavelength of 475 nm. Tyrosinase exhibited typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. RESULTS: Tests of the proposed inhibition of the enzyme tyrosinase showed that K-2[B3O3F4OH] had weak inhibitory properties. CONCLUSION: It will be necessary to search for new ways of antitumor mechanisms that differ from those of previous results.","[Marasovic, Maja; Milos, Mladen] Univ Split, Fac Chem & Technol, Dept Biochem, Split, Croatia; [Coric, Zrinka] Univ Split, Fac Chem & Technol, Split, Croatia; [Galic, Borivoj] Univ Sarajevo, Fac Sci, Dept Chem, Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herceg",University of Split; University of Split; University of Sarajevo,"Marasovic, M (通讯作者)，Univ Split, Fac Chem & Technol, Dept Biochem, Split, Croatia.",maja.marasovic@ktf-split.hr; mladen@ktf-split.hr,"Marasović, Maja/D-9311-2017; Milos, Mladen/D-4966-2017",,Croatian Science Foundation,Croatian Science Foundation,All research was a part of the project The study of bioactive compounds from Dalmatian plants: their antioxidant character and impact on enzyme inhibition and health under the guidance of project lider Prof. dr. sc.

Assessment of economic viability of farms has suggested that in Lithuania, support is the main external factor of continued viability of small-and mid-sized farms, while the unequal distribution of the tax burden reduces economic viability of farms and they become nonviable. The problem put forward in the research is what taxation system would create conditions for the farmers' farms to remain viable, irrespective of the support. Alternatives on improvement of farmer taxation system are proposed. The paper presents the practice of farmer taxation in other countries and analysis of scientific literature on the subject, on the basis of which the model for improvement of farmer's profit taxation, as well as social and healthcare insurance contribution is put forward. This model would ensure more equal distribution of tax burden between the farms of different sizes, which would allow the farms to remain viable irrespective of the scopes of the received support.","[Miceikiene, Astrida; Girdziute, Laura] Aleksandras StulginskisUniv, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Univ 10-323, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania",Vytautas Magnus University,"Miceikiene, A (通讯作者)，Aleksandras StulginskisUniv, Fac Econ & Management, Inst Econ Accounting & Finance, Univ 10-323, LT-53361 Akademija, Kauno R, Lithuania.",Astrida.Miceikiene@asu.lt; Laura.Girdziute@asu.lt,,,,,,,21,5,5,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,350,360,,10.15414/isd2016.s5.05,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500041,0

The research included 132 quoted companies in Croatia that apply IFRSs. The research results showed that investment property has a relatively small share in the structure of total assets of quoted companies in Croatia, which is probably one of the reasons why related accounting estimates published in the notes are brief and incomplete. The general conclusion is that the notes regarding accounting estimates on investment property are composed of definitions set in the standard, instead of providing more transparent information for investors and other interested users of financial statements. As expected, the companies with the higher share of investment property have shown greater level of transparency, providing additional information which is not required by the standards.

On the basis of theoretical approaches, case studies and interdisciplinary surveys, the paper provides insight into how screens projecting media and interactive installations in city spaces can inspire people to become active on many levels. The research is focused, both on temporary and permanent art installations, that support new technologies to encourage people to interact with art objects and become actors in an urban performance. Media and interactive art can positively contribute to the urban landscape, foster public involvement, increase intensity of public life, and effectively enhance the identity of urban communities. The paper shows that, despite this potential for media architecture and interactive art projects, specific pre-conditions are needed for their success in urban environments. The paper focuses on the convergence of scale between the intervention itself and the assumed urban strategy, as well as on the time allowed for individual perception and active participation of people in the particular urban art scenario. As the research shows, the promotion of art pieces, through guided tours of the city, tends to reduce the perception of the installations themselves and almost excludes social interactions. Thus, while not so spectacular in scale, image, or number of visits, modest interventions that involve locals and allow time for relationship building between people, could be most effective in reaching urban renewal objectives.","[Urbanowicz, Katarzyna; Nyka, Lucyna] Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Gdansk, Poland",Fahrenheit Universities; Gdansk University of Technology,"Urbanowicz, K (通讯作者)，Gdansk Univ Technol, Fac Architecture, Gdansk, Poland.",k.urbanowicz@pg.gda.pl; lnyka@pg.gda.pl,"Urbanowicz, Katarzyna/H-5791-2018; NYKA, Lucyna/H-5796-2018","Urbanowicz, Katarzyna/0000-0002-6369-7074; NYKA, Lucyna/0000-0003-2064-7605",,,,,21,0,0,4,29,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,591,596,,10.12955/cbup.v4.819,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000087,0

This is done by analysing 46 operational offshore wind farms commissioned after 2000. An increase of the Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) is found that is linked to the distance to shore and depth of more recent wind farms and commodity prices. Analysis results indicate that these two factors are only responsible for about half of the observed CAPEX increase, suggesting other factors such as turbine market with limited competition also led to an increasing CAPEX. Using CAPEX, Annual Energy Production, Financings costs and Operational Expenditures, the development of average Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCoE) is shown to increase from 120 (sic)/MWh in 2000 towards 190 (sic)/MWh in 2014, which is a direct result of the CAPEX increase. The results indicate very different LCoE values among European countries, from currently about 100 Euro/MWh in Denmark and Sweden to 150-220 Euro/MWh in all other countries investigated suggesting an effect of national policy frameworks on the LCoE of offshore wind energy.

Using institutional data and survey data, weaknesses in the incentive structure that affect regional development can be identified. The entrepreneurial disparities among regions are analysed at the country and regional levels using a penalty for bottleneck methodology. The methodology allows public policy action to be coordinated at both national and regional levels. It is found that GEDI provides a valuable tool for understanding regional differences across Spanish regions.","[Acs, Zoltan J.] London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Szerb, Laszlo] Univ Pecs, Fac Business & Econ, H-7622 Pecs, Hungary; [Ortega-Argiles, Raquel] Univ Groningen, Fac Econ & Business, NL-9700 AV Groningen, Netherlands; [Aidis, Ruta] George Mason Univ, Sch Publ Policy, Arlington, VA 22201 USA; [Coduras, Alicia] Inst Empresa, Sch Business, Madrid, Spain",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of Pecs; University of Groningen; George Mason University; IE University,"Acs, ZJ (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Management, London WC2A 2AE, England.",z.j.acs@lse.ac.uk; szerb@ktk.pte.hu; r.ortega.argiles@rug.nl; raidis@gmu.edu; alicia.coduras@ie.edu,"Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/AAG-1944-2020; acs, zoltan j/I-5496-2013; Laszlo, Szerb/AAC-5918-2022; Ortega-Argiles, Raquel/HLG-1131-2023; Coduras, Alicia/JCO-1493-2023","Ortega-Argilés, Raquel/0000-0002-7783-2230; Laszlo, Szerb/0000-0002-6964-7422;",OTKA Research Foundation [NK 69283],OTKA Research Foundation(Orszagos Tudomanyos Kutatasi Alapprogramok (OTKA)),Laszlo Szerb would like to thank the OTKA Research Foundation [NK 69283] for financial support.

It explicitly accounts for the interplay between transmission infrastructure and renewable generation capacity expansion. We confirm earlier findings that, on aggregate, pan-European transmission capacity expansion constitutes a no-regret option for integrating increasing shares of variable renewables. It leads to positive social returns on investment in all mitigation scenarios under analysis. However, the reduction in total discounted system costs stemming from transmission capacity expansion is modest in magnitude. Over the period 2010-2050 it reaches a maximum of 3.5% for a case with massive expansion compared to one in which the status quo remains. In technical terms this means that the optimum is rather flat and taking into account regional and local benefits and distributional aspects could alter the evaluation of the economic benefits. A crucial finding is that the configuration of pan-European transmission infrastructure and the importance of specific country-connections, i.e. a Southern versus a Northern solution, hinges on the relative development of specific investment costs for solar and wind technologies over the next decades.

In this paper, we investigate economy-wide energy rebound effects by developing a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for Georgia, USA. The model adopts a highly disaggregated sector profile and highlights the substitution possibilities between different energy sources in the production structure. These two features allow us to better characterize the change in energy use in face of an efficiency shock, and to explore in detail how a sector-level shock propagates throughout the economic structure to generate aggregate impacts. We find that with economy-wide energy efficiency improvement on the production side, economy-wide rebound is moderate. Energy price levels fall very slightly, yet sectors respond to these changing prices quite differently in terms of local production and demand. Energy efficiency improvements in particular sectors (epicenters) induce quite different economy-wide impacts. In general, we expect large rebound if the epicenter sector is an energy production sector, a direct upstream/downstream sector of energy production sectors, a transportation sector or a sector with high production elasticity. Our analysis offers valuable insights for policy makers aiming to achieve energy conservation through increasing energy efficiency. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Critical to the success of this strategy is to know whether consumers are willing to pay to increase the proportion of electricity generated from renewable energy in their electricity portfolio. There are a number of studies in the literature that report a wide range of willingness to pay estimates. In this study, we used a meta-regression analysis to determine how much of the variation in willingness to pay reflects true differences across the population and how much is due to study design, such as survey design and administration, and model specification. The results showed that factors that influence willingness to pay, such as renewable energy type, consumers' socio-economic profile and consumers' energy consumption patterns, explain less variation in willingness to pay estimates than the characteristics of the study design itself. Because of this effect, we recommend that policy makers exercise caution when interpreting and using willingness to pay results from primary studies. Our meta-regression analysis further shows that consumers have significantly higher willingness to pay for electricity generated from solar, wind or generic renewable energy source (i.e. not a specific source) than hydro power or biomass.

However, whereas in some of these countries (e.g., Germany), numerous SECs have been founded, there are other countries, such as Spain, where the creation and growth of SECs has been much slower. The purpose of this article is to analyse the case of Spain, to determine the causes of the lack of SECs in this country, and to propose actions adapted to the Spanish context aimed at accelerating the creation of SECs. To facilitate these tasks, we have taken the German case as a reference. The key finding is that, in contrast to Germany, in Spain, SECs have scarcely contributed to the development of RE (Renewable energy) infrastructures, despite having similar incentives for renewable electricity (until recently). Moreover, in Spain, these incentives have been drastically cut recently. Therefore, it has become even more difficult to finance a renewable electricity generation plant. That is why strategies in sectors other than renewable electricity have been suggested for the encouragement of SECs in Spain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aims were to assess the associated land use requirements, conflicts with existing land use, and the influence of legislation on the environmental impact. The factors involved in estimating the suitability for placement of shale gas well pads were analysed, as well as the potential land and water requirements to define 2 technology-based scenarios, representing the highest and lowest potential environmental impact. 2 different legislative frameworks (current and restrictive) were also assessed, to give 4 combined scenarios altogether. Land consumption and allocation patterns of well pads varied substantially according to the modelled scenario. Potential landscape fragmentation and conflicts with other land users depended mainly on development rate, well pad density, existing land-use patterns, and geology. Highly complex landscapes presented numerous barriers to drilling activities, restricting the potential development patterns. The land used for shale gas development could represent a significant percentage of overall land take within the shale play.

In this study, we draw on international and domestic stakeholder inputs to a governmental inquiry in Australia to show how RE projects might be approved in shortened timeframes with reduced associated costs. The process mapping and stakeholder analysis demonstrates that RE supply projects can benefit from standardized approval processes and documentation, a 360 degrees deep engagement with stakeholders, and expanded electricity grid access in resource areas, augmented through supportive public policy and planning frameworks. In addition, stakeholder objections to project approval and implementation streamlining were used to contrast the efficacy of the proposed changes in policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. and Dolfsma W. The euro and its impact on the number, size, performance and regional spread of European mergers and acquisitions, Regional Studies. The macroeconomic effects of the euro have been extensively studied. The literature has, however, paid significantly less attention to the microeconomic consequences and few authors have considered if and how the euro has impacted firm-level decision-making. This paper explores if, how and in what way the euro has impacted one firm-level decision: whether to merge with or acquire another firm. This paper builds a sample of 19362 acquisitions, announced in the period 1990-2014. It shows that the euro has dramatically increased the number, size and performance of European mergers and acquisitions. Importantly, it also notes that the euro has altered the geographic spread of European acquisitions. The paper reports that since the introduction of the euro, acquirers have made increasingly distant acquisitions and have preferred targets in peripheral regions to those in the core. The results also hint at the suggestion that the euro may have led acquirers to prefer Eurozone to non-Eurozone targets. From a policy perspective, it is concluded, therefore, that the euro has significantly impacted firm behaviour and has contributed, in a positive sense, to regional integration.","[McCarthy, Killian J.; Dolfsma, Wilfred] Univ Groningen Sch Econ & Business, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands",,"McCarthy, KJ (通讯作者)，Univ Groningen Sch Econ & Business, Nettelbosje 2, NL-9747 AE Groningen, Netherlands.",k.j.mccarthy@rug.nl,,"McCarthy, Killian/0000-0002-3999-9881",,,,,49,12,18,0,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In particular, debates about economic benefits, energy security and environmental impact have been provoked by the proposed Keystone XL pipeline expansion intended to take bitumen from northern Alberta in Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast in Texas. Drawing on data from recent surveys conducted by the Pew Research Center, this article asks a series of questions. What levels of support for (and opposition to) the pipeline exist among the American public? What are the roles of political factors (such as party identification and ideology), economic attitudes, environmental attitudes and proximity to the proposed pipeline route in shaping attitudes toward the pipeline? And how do political factors and proximity to the pipeline interact? We find that partisanship and ideology drive attitudes toward the Keystone XL pipeline, and that the effect of ideology is attenuated by proximity to the proposed route. The policy implications of these findings for energy infrastructure siting controversies are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Both learning effects imply that the degree of randomness in the responses is larger in initial choice situations than in subsequent ones. As a result, it has been suggested to include an Instruction Choice Set (ICS) prior to the choices used for generating benefit estimates. However, an ICS may induce a starting point effect biasing Willingness to Pay (WTP) estimates. Subsequent choices may not only be influenced by the levels of the cost attribute, but also by the levels of the non-cost attributes shown in the ICS. Using a split sample treatment, we investigate whether starting point effects are induced by the inclusion of ICSs depending on different combinations of cost and non-cost attribute levels. Employing data from a CE on water quality changes, we test whether a starting point effect related to the design of the ICS exists, and whether effects differ in terms of the number of status quo choices and WTP estimates. The results indicate that the ICS designs do influence WTP without entailing strong learning effects. Therefore, inclusion of an ICS might cause 'more harm than good'. If, however, an ICS inclusion is nonetheless judged to be beneficial, we recommend to design them carefully in a way that is in line with respondents' common beliefs regarding attribute trade-offs.

Designed as remedies for parameter uncertainty and estimation errors in portfolio selection problems, these alternative portfolio strategies deliver substantially better out-of-sample performance. In this article, we first show how to solve a general portfolio selection problem in a linear regression framework. Then we propose to reduce the estimation risk of expected returns and the variance-covariance matrix of asset returns by imposing additional constraints on the portfolio weights. With results from linear regression models, we show that portfolio weights derived from new approaches enjoy two favorable properties: sparsity and stability. Moreover, we present insights into these new approaches as well as their connections to alternative strategies in literature. Four empirical studies show that the proposed strategies have better out-of-sample performance and lower turnover than many other strategies, especially when the estimation risk is large.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Appl & Computat Math & Stat, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"Li, JH (通讯作者)，Univ Notre Dame, Dept Appl & Computat Math & Stat, 156 Hurley Hall, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",jiahan.li@nd.edu,,,,,,,36,45,50,2,35,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

However, its high cost prevents its rapid deployment and affects its affordability in emerging economies. International financial institutions (IFIs) have emerged as key players to enable CSP in emerging economies, especially when cooperating with national policymakers. Through the analysis of two CSP plants in India and Morocco where IFIs provided the lion's share of finance, this paper aims to assess the effectiveness of their support and estimate the impact of IFIs financing on electricity production costs and mobilization of private investments. The two case studies show that public financial institutions can play a leading role in reducing the cost of CSP support on public budgets by providing concessional loans in countries where public and/or private finance would be too expensive, or extending maturities where commercial investors are present but poorly suited for project finance. Finally, we show that, combined with competitive tariff setting mechanism (tenders and auctions), public financial support can also be a cost-effective tool to engage private investors in CSP.

These shifts had major effects on domestic employment in those sectors of the coal, natural gas, wind and solar industries involved in operations and maintenance (O&M) activities for electricity generation. Using an economic input-output model, we estimate that the coal industry lost more than 49,000 jobs (12%) nationally over the five-year period, while in the natural gas, solar, and wind industries, employment increased by nearly 175,000 jobs (21%). We also combine published ratios for jobs per unit of fuel production and per megawatt of power plant capacity with site-specific data on fuel production and power plant retirements, additions and capacity changes to estimate and map direct job changes at the county level. The maps show that job increases in the natural gas, solar and wind industries generally did not occur where there were significant job losses in the coal industry, particularly in West Virginia and Kentucky.

Section 111 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) allows for greenhouse gas emission regulation by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In June 2014, EPA issued the Clean Power Plan that proposes regulation of existing power plants via a best system of emission reduction or BSER. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions caused by electricity generation is one of the main motivations for increasing wind power and other renewable energy use, and this option is included in the BSER. This paper applies Monte Carlo simulation with a two-stage power flow optimization framework to analyze the potential CO2 emission reduction with 10% and 20% wind penetration using the proposed BSER. The results show that EPA's BSER does achieve significant emission reduction, but an increase in cost of electricity and load curtailment can result if significant wind is installed without other measures.

J. The regional economic impacts of biofuels: a review of multisectoral modelling techniques and evaluation of applications, Regional Studies. The regional economic impact of biofuel production depends upon a number of interrelated factors: the specific biofuels feedstock and production technology employed; the sector's embeddedness in the rest of the economy, through its demand for local resources; and the extent to which new activity is created. These issues can be analysed using multisectoral economic models. Some studies use input-output (IO) and social accounting matrix (SAM) modelling frameworks, whilst a nascent computable general equilibrium (CGE) literature has begun to examine the regional impact of biofuel development. This paper reviews, compares and evaluates these approaches for modelling the regional economic impacts of biofuels.","Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Fraser Allander Inst, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland",University of Strathclyde; University of Glasgow,"Allan, GJ (通讯作者)，Univ Strathclyde, Dept Econ, Fraser Allander Inst, Sir William Duncan Bldg,130 Rottenrow, Glasgow G4 0GE, Lanark, Scotland.",grant.j.allan@strath.ac.uk,,"Allan, Grant/0000-0002-1404-2768",,,,,74,13,13,1,62,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

J. Cultural intermediaries in the digital age: the case of independent musicians and managers in Toronto, Regional Studies. This paper explores the limitations of the contemporary do-it-yourself model of music production and the recent shift towards re-specialization in Toronto in Ontario, Canada. It argues that freelance managers are re-emerging as key intermediaries who catalyse and facilitate new organizational forms and strategic partnerships between creative workers. Attention is paid to how digital technologies and shifting market dynamics influence and alter the relationships and contracts between these individuals. The spatial concentration of managers and other 'helpers', including fashion designers, photographers and web designers, is also used to explain why music production remains clustered in space despite the decentralizing potential of digital technologies.","Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Innovat & Ind Dynam CIND, Dept Social & Econ Geog, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden",Uppsala University,"Hracs, BJ (通讯作者)，Uppsala Univ, Ctr Res Innovat & Ind Dynam CIND, Dept Social & Econ Geog, Box 513, S-75120 Uppsala, Sweden.",brian.hracs@kultgeog.uu.se,,,,,,,47,58,69,5,38,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

But such approaches tend to overlook the situations of cities from the Global South and emerging countries concerned with strong energy demand growth. The development of urban natural gas networks is an understudied response to such a challenge. Focusing on three cities, Istanbul, Cairo and Sfax (Tunisia), the article analyses the factors and the governance of these energy transitions. It uses a geographical approach to such processes that highlight the mutual influence of the territory in its material and political dimensions and of the policy goals and tools in the implementation. The development of urban gas networks rests upon the proximity of gas deposits. It is determined by metropolitan strategies for economic development as well as by programs aiming to cut energy subsidies. Though urban gas networks have a strong potential for restructuring the physical and social landscapes in cities, the dominant commercial approach taken by energy utilities and morphological constraints in the urban fabric limit their universalization. Natural gas is part of a mix of energies at the urban level and often competes with other energy forms, specifically renewables (like solar water heaters). Lastly, the development of urban natural gas networks sparks heated politics in relation to unfulfilled energy demand and affordability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To realize the goals of this study, a pollution model was established applying the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) methodology. The results revealed that the pollution haven hypothesis does exist in Vietnam because capital increases pollution. In addition, imports also increase pollution which indicates that most of Vietnam's imported products are energy intensive and highly polluted. However, exports have no effect on pollution which indicates that the level of exports is not significant enough to affect pollution. Moreover, fossil fuel energy consumption increases pollution while renewable energy consumption has no significant effect in reducing pollution. Furthermore, labor force reduces pollution since most of Vietnam's labor force is in the agricultural and services sectors which are less energy intensive than the industrial sector. Based on the obtained results, the EKC hypothesis does not exist because the relationship between GDP and pollution is positive in both the short and long run. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

To achieve this operation, in article is suggested to carry out analysis of the rate of return on assets, compared with interest rates in the financial market, as well as forecast of the interest rate and portfolio adjustment.

Elderly people, or third-agers, have come to make up an increasing percentage of the population in both developed countries and developing ones like Brazil. A major challenge for the elderly in this context is their adaptation to the demands of the modern world, especially in relation to Internet use. Nowadays these people have started to show a greater interest in new technologies. According to a study conducted in Brazil (CGI, 2009), usage frequency among older consumers who access the Internet is as follows: 47% daily, 29% at least once a week, 17% at least once a month and 7% less than once a month. These data confirm the promising market represented by elderly people. Given the change in population structure, combined with the considerable technological development resulting from the growth of Internet use in day-to-day life, it is important to understand Internet usage among elderly consumers. To analyze this, it is important that future studies concern themselves with the purpose of use, frequency of access and the future impacts that the Internet may have upon such customers. This theoretical article is organized with such questions in mind. Based on the literature, we have constructed a model to be tested in a subsequent study to help identify the relationships between the several variables surrounding this consumer behavior and the use of the Internet.

A paradigm shift has resulted in geographic expansion, different organizational structures and relations, and overall higher degree of variety and complexity of business activities.

In this paper we aim to study the influence of the austerity measures deemed by the economic and financial meltdown on one of the most vulnerable and important systems in any country: healthcare. The empiric approach uses panel data analysis to highlight the effects of the economic crisis on each of the 34 analyzed countries, during the time span 2006-2012. The advantage of this method resides in the ability to offer both cross-time and cross-section results, as well as interactions. Our findings show a consistent tendency of European governments to diminish the spending on healthcare during the crisis, leading to the increase of out of pocket payments is some countries, which do not have a robust health insurance policy and a decrease in the number of people accessing healthcare services in the other countries. Another notable result is that there is a consistent delay between the economic crisis and the impact on healthcare, yet, when the shock is felt it is most likely to have an influence for some time, even after the economy has recovered. Some side effects could even be permanent as it is the case with hospitals being closed or personnel being laid off. The findings in this paper suggest that in times of economic crisis, the right approach is to maintain the spending levels in healthcare, since otherwise people are exposed to even greater risks such as catastrophic spending, disease or even death.

Balanced regional development is needed and can be initiated through a spatial system approach, where the growth centers and their hinterlands are developed simultaneously as an integrated system. The aim of this research is to define new growth centers that can stimulate the optimal utilization and interaction between regional resources for generating more balanced and efficient development. Three interrelated models are developed to address this: (1) an inter-regional input-output (IRIO) optimization model to generate optimal resource use and improve development performances, (2) a transport model to determine an optimal inter-regional input-output network, and (3) a P-median model to define new growth centers and their hinterland areas. Results from the first model show that setting land resource limitations, demand compliance, and goals to increase economic growth, people's income, and government tax can create higher and equally distributed value of total output. The second model indicated that the optimal flow of input-output increased intensity of economic transaction among provinces, although it was still dominated by interaction between Java and Sumatra. The third model identified seven new growth centers comprising Medan, Tanjungpinang, Palembang, Balikpapan, Gorontalo, Makassar, and Ternate.","[Pribadi, Didit Okta; Putra, Andi Syah; Rustiadi, Ernan] Bogor Agr Univ, Ctr Reg Syst Anal Planning & Dev CRESTPENT P4W, Bogor 16143, Indonesia; [Pribadi, Didit Okta] Indonesian Inst Sci, Bogor 16003, Indonesia; [Rustiadi, Ernan] Bogor Agr Univ, Dept Soil Sci & Land Resources, Bogor 16680, Indonesia",Bogor Agricultural University; National Research & Innovation Agency of Indonesia (BRIN); Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI); Bogor Agricultural University,"Pribadi, DO (通讯作者)，Bogor Agr Univ, Ctr Reg Syst Anal Planning & Dev CRESTPENT P4W, Jalan Pajajaran, Bogor 16143, Indonesia.",diditpribadi@yahoo.com; andi_syp@yahoo.com; ernan@indo.net.id,"Putra, Andi Syah/AAU-2840-2020; Pribadi, Didit Okta/AAP-9749-2020; Putra, Andi Syah/AAU-3429-2020; Rustiadi, Ernan/AGN-2713-2022","Putra, Andi Syah/0000-0003-2263-8155; Pribadi, Didit Okta/0000-0002-1794-7781; Rustiadi, Ernan/0000-0001-8663-794X",Ministry of Culture and Education Republic of Indonesia through National Strategic Competitive Research Program,Ministry of Culture and Education Republic of Indonesia through National Strategic Competitive Research Program,"The research is funded by the Ministry of Culture and Education Republic of Indonesia through National Strategic Competitive Research Program Year 2010.

But no final answers were received during the few decades of research. This paper represents a research of what factors influence investors' opinions regarding expectations of future evolution of an economy. This subject is important because investors' overconfidence can cause economic bubbles that may severely affect a capital market (Brown and Cliff, 2004). A lack of confidence may also have a series of negative impacts on a market. The study focuses on Romania, by using the CFA Romania Macroeconomic Confidence Index in an empirical research to find whether past events influence financial analysts regarding future expectations and which of these factors influence them most. The sample of research consists of three years of monthly data regarding the CFA Romania Macroeconomic Confidence in correlation with a few distinct macroeconomic figures (monthly information about unemployment rate, average personal income, inflation rate, short term interest rates, index performance for Bucharest Stock Exchange, foreign direct investments in Romania as well as Romanian business condition). After performing the Jarque-Bera test of normality and after testing the data for autocorrelation, cross correlation, multicollinearity, the analysis of correlation and regression was performed. The conclusion is that financial analysts are influenced by past economic data in the moment they form their expectations about future economic conditions. As a result, they may be considered as being rational. There is a high correlation between the CFA Romania Macroeconomic Confidence Index and the considered macroeconomic indicators.

The Hunter economy's strong basis in fossil fuel production and consumption is challenged by civil society campaigns employing environmental justice discourses. This paper analyses how two civil society campaigns in the Hunter region ('Stop T4' and 'Groundswell') have countered the regional hegemony of fossil fuel interests from an environmental justice perspective. However, the discursive dominance of the jobs versus environment' frame hinders efforts to build solidarity amongst local environmental justice goals on the one hand, and workers and union aspirations for secure, quality jobs on the other. Long-term structural decline of global coal markets adds pressure for economic transition. We argue that campaigns to open up possibilities for transition away from fossil fuel dependency to a post carbon society can be strengthened by engaging with the 'just transition' discourses that are typically associated with organised labour. Doing so can create synergy for social change by aligning community and labour movement interests. Inclusive social movement partnerships around this synergy must address structural disadvantage that creates social and economic insecurity if communities are to prevail over the fossil fuel sector's hegemony.

Although schemes are commonplace in some countries, in 'learning countries' where building-level technologies make up the majority of heating systems there are numerous barriers to introducing DH. Local governments are seen as key actors in helping to create a 'shared vision' for DH amongst stakeholders. This study uses interviews with stakeholders from a range of sectors in the UK (an example of a learning country) to examine the visions of local actors for developing DH and the types of national policy that would support local implementation of these visions. The analysis shows that in engaging with DH development local governments seek multiple types of value. Realising this value will most likely happen by taking a long-term, planned approach to development. In contrast, national government policy is geared towards techno-economic criteria and may lead to only a minority of potential sites being developed, without realisation of wider social or environmental benefits aligned to local visions. The work highlights the importance of local strategic planning, enabled by aligned national policy, in realising the full economic, environmental and social benefits of DH. (C) 2016 The Authors.

However, insufficient investment, the lack of transport infrastructure and an unwieldy regulatory environment are inhibiting the sector from reaching its full potential. Looking ahead, growing environmental concerns combined with sharp falls in coal prices and the on-going shale gas revolution call into question the sustainability of an energy strategy based almost exclusively on fossil fuels. This viewpoint challenges Indonesia's current energy policy and proposes ways to increase its energy efficiency and use of renewables. In particular, its gas sector should be further developed to plug the gap until sufficient renewable energy, especially geothermal, comes on line. Government control over the oil industry via state-owned Pertamina should be gradually reduced. Clarifying, streamlining and publicising simple regulations in energy, especially regarding land rights and on-shore processing, and removing foreign ownership restrictions will help bring much needed investment. The pressure on the environment of natural resource exploitation should also be addressed by properly defining property rights and regulations regarding forest land, and implementing a positive implicit carbon price.

To analyse the determinants of inter-provincial migration hypotheses from the classical migration theory, the new economic geography, gravity approach, and the new economics of labour migration have been derived. All traditional assumptions could be confirmed. Inter-provincial differentials of urban poverty and differentials in inequality do matter. Inequality is regarded as opportunity and motivation to move. The analysis of push-pull factors of gross migration suggests that pull factors are average wages, unemployment rates, urbanization and income disparity. Urban poverty can be regarded as a counter-pull factor. Rural poverty and average wage are push factors.","[Gries, Thomas; Kraft, Manfred; Simon, Manuel] Univ Paderborn, Econ Dept CIE, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Gries, T (通讯作者)，Univ Paderborn, Econ Dept CIE, Warburger Str 100, D-33098 Paderborn, Germany.",thomas.gries@notes.upb.de; manfred.kraft@notes.upb.de; manuel.simon@paderborn.com,"Simon, Manuel/HNS-7267-2023",,,,,,78,23,25,5,74,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

We construct an agent-based version of Hotelling's two-stage game of spatial competition and explore the possibilities of creating synergies between the two approaches. Game theoretic insights into strategic behavior and equilibrium states can provide useful theoretic underpinnings for agent-based approaches in regional science. By combining the two, we can model micro-based social order as it emerges out of local interactions. The use of agent-based modelling in the context of a multistage game is new and hence provides a valuable contribution to both streams of the literature. We show that combining the two approaches is feasible, also in the context of a more complex two-stage game. The model correctly reproduces the analytical results and also allows for more complex situations. As an example, we show the effect of different levels of consumer tastes for variety in Main Street. The reconstruction of Hotelling's model of spatial competition opens up a wide variety of possibilities for further extensions that can lead to a better understanding of the variations we observe in reality. For some extensions, the use of a single-stage model would probably be more feasible though.","[van Leeuwen, Eveline; Lijesen, Mark] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,"van Leeuwen, E (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, De Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",e.s.van.leeuwen@vu.nl,,"Van Leeuwen, Eveline/0000-0002-3262-7030; Lijesen, Mark/0000-0002-2881-1361",,,,,36,9,10,1,12,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

We argue that the volatility risk premium, loosely defined as the difference between realized and implied volatility, can best be understood when viewed as a systematically priced bias. We first use ultra-high-frequency transaction data on SPDRs and a novel approach for estimating integrated volatility on the frequency domain to compute realized volatility. From that we subtract the daily VIX, our measure of implied volatility, to construct a time series of the volatility risk premium. To identify the factors behind the volatility risk premium as a priced bias, we decompose it into magnitude and direction. We find compelling evidence that the magnitude of the deviation of the realized volatility from implied volatility represents supply and demand imbalances in the market for hedging tail risk. It is difficult to conclusively accept the hypothesis that the direction or sign of the volatility risk premium reflects expectations about future levels of volatility. However, evidence supports the hypothesis that the sign of the volatility risk premium is indicative of gains or losses on a delta-hedged portfolio.","[Fan, Jianqing] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fan, Jianqing] Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA; [Fan, Jianqing] Fudan Univ, Sch Data Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Imerman, Michael B.] Lehigh Univ, Perella Dept Finance, Bethlehem, PA 18015 USA; [Dai, Wei] Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08540 USA",Princeton University; Princeton University; Fudan University; Lehigh University; Princeton University,"Fan, JQ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Dept Operat Res & Financial Engn, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Fan, JQ (通讯作者)，Princeton Univ, Bendheim Ctr Finance, Princeton, NJ 08544 USA.;Fan, JQ (通讯作者)，Fudan Univ, Sch Data Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China.",jqfan@princeton.edu; mbi212@lehigh.edu; weidai@princeton.edu,"Fan, Jianqing/B-2115-2008","Dai, Wei/0009-0008-5157-9063",National Science Foundation (NSF) [DMS-0704337]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1206464] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,National Science Foundation (NSF)(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"We thank participants at the 2015 China International Conference in Finance (CICF); the 2015 FMA meetings in Orlando; the 20th Annual Conference on Pacific Basin Finance, Economics, Accounting, and Management at Rutgers University; and the Second Measuring Risk Conference at Princeton University as well as the Finance Department Seminar Series at Rutgers Business School.

It is particularly important for the establishment and success of energy service companies (ESCOs) acting in the vulnerable environment of the vast but highly energy-inefficient Russian market. This study systematically explores common risk factors and causes of risk associated with EPC projects executed in three Russian sectors: (1) industrial; (2) housing and communal services; and (3) public. Several interviews with the Russian EPC experts were accomplished and a qualitative risk assessment by using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) approach. The data were obtained from a web-based questionnaire survey conducted among Russian EPC project executors. For each focus sector, a specific preference-based ranking of the identified risk factors and causes of risk was derived. The AHP results show that causes of risk related to the financial and regulatory aspects contribute most to the riskiness of EPC projects performed in all three focus sectors in Russia, calling for the special attention of EPC policy- and business-makers. Due to sectorial particularities and different actors involved, we conclude that there is a need for elaboration of sector-specific contractual schemes for EPC projects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The approach presented here adds novelty in terms of a realistic socioeconomic differentiation by employing dwelling/household archetypes (DHAs) and neighbourhood clusters at the Output Area (OA) level. These archetypes are combined with a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to generate optimum (minimum cost) technology configurations and operation schedules. Even in the baseline case, without any LCT penetration, a substantial deviation from the standard load profile (SLP) is encountered, suggesting that for some neighbourhoods this profile is not appropriate. With the application of LCTs, including heat pumps, micro-CHP and photovoltaic (PV), this effect is much stronger, including more negative residual load, more variability, and higher ramps with increased LCT penetration, and crucially different between neighbourhood clusters. The main policy implication of the study is the importance of understanding electrical load profiles at the neighbourhood level, because of the consequences they have for investment in the overarching energy system, including transmission and distribution infrastructure, and centralised generation plant. Further work should focus on attaining a superior socioeconomic differentiation between households. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential opposition of fishermen may hinder the development of MRE projects and the provision of benefit schemes could to enhance acceptance. Benefit schemes refer to additional voluntary measures that are provided by a developer to local stakeholders. The aim of this study is to explore the issue of the provision of benefit packages to local fishing communities and financial compensation measures for fishermen who may be impacted by MRE projects. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fourteen fishermen from three separate case study sites around the island of Ireland where MRE projects were being developed. In addition, ten company fisheries liaison officers (CFLOs) who have worked on MRE projects in the UK and Ireland were also interviewed. The interviews were analysed under the headings of local employment, benefits in kind, compensation and community funds and ownership of projects. Analysis shows that there is uncertainty among fishermen over whether they would benefit or gain employment from MRE. Provision of re-training schemes and preferential hiring practices could be used by MRE developers to reduce this uncertainty. There was also agreement between fishermen and CFLOs on the need for the provision of an evidence-base and a standard approach for the calculation of disruption payments. A formal structure for the provision of benefit schemes for fishermen would be useful. Furthermore, schemes that provide a range of benefits to fishermen and other stakeholders over the lifetime of a MRE project are more likely to be successful at enhancing acceptance.

This study shows that cost distribution is an important explanation for variations in public support for various climate policies. Using individual-level data on industry of employment and support for a range of climate policies, we find that those employed in the fossil fuel industry are less likely to support climate policies that are particularly costly to their industry, but are as likely as everybody else to support policies with lower costs to the industry. This finding challenges the traditional bifurcation between climate change skeptics and acceptors. Furthermore, we find that opposition to renewable energy by large fossil fuel producers and consumers, identified in the political economy literature, is not uniformly found among these companies' employees. The most important implication of this study for policy makers is that support for climate policies is sensitive to the compensation of exposed groups and stimulation of alternative avenues for employment.

The widespread use of diesel pumps is an economic problem due to the inefficiency and high cost of said pumps. Could rural electrification improve the situation? We estimate the relationship between village electrification and the counts of electric and diesel pumps in India, 1982-1999. We find that, in addition to increasing the number of electric pumps, rural electrification also greatly increases the number of diesel pumps. While initially surprising, these results make sense in an environment characterized by frequent power outages and constant quality problems. If rural electrification increases the number of electric pumps and promotes irrigated agriculture, the demand for diesel pumps also grows because many farmers need a reliable pump that does not depend on electricity. Without improvements in the supply of electricity through rational power sector reforms, India cannot stop the spread of diesel pumps through rural electrification. For energy and development economists, the results are novel because previous econometric work has largely focused on industrial uses of power. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We propose two models in which conditional volatilities feature comovement and study them using U.S. macroeconomic data. The first model specifies the conditional volatilities as driven by a single common unobserved factor, plus an idiosyncratic component. We label this model BVAR with general factor stochastic volatility (BVAR-GFSV) and we show that the loss in terms of marginal likelihood from assuming a common factor for volatility is moderate. The second model, which we label BVAR with common stochastic volatility (BVAR-CSV), is a special case of the BVAR-GFSV in which the idiosyncratic component is eliminated and the loadings to the factor are set to 1 for all the conditional volatilities. Such restrictions permit a convenient Kronecker structure for the posterior variance of the VAR coefficients, which in turn permits estimating the model even with large datasets. While perhaps misspecified, the BVAR-CSV model is strongly supported by the data when compared against standard homoscedastic BVARs, and it can produce relatively good point and density forecasts by taking advantage of the information contained in large datasets.","[Carriero, Andrea] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England; [Clark, Todd E.] Fed Reserve Bank Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44114 USA; [Marcellino, Massimiliano] Bocconi Univ, Dept Econ, IGIER, I-20100 Milan, Italy; [Marcellino, Massimiliano] CEPR, I-20100 Milan, Italy",University of London; Queen Mary University London; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - Cleveland; Bocconi University,"Carriero, A (通讯作者)，Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Econ & Finance, London E1 4NS, England.",a.carriero@qmul.ac.uk; todd.clark@clev.frb.org; massimiliano.marcellino@unibocconi.it,,"Marcellino, Massimiliano/0000-0002-8737-2768; CARRIERO, ANDREA/0000-0002-4409-2870; Clark, Todd/0000-0002-4985-1709",Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K010611/1]; ESRC [ES/K010611/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/K010611/1] Funding Source: researchfish,Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"The views expressed herein are solely those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland or the Federal Reserve System.

This outcome can differ not only contingent on the EU ETS Phase, but also on firms' generation mix. Moreover, stock markets may react differently to EUA increases in comparison to decreases, thus asymmetrically. By using daily data from January 2008 to July 2014, this article analyses long-run equilibrium relations and short-run interactions between the aggregated electricity industry stock market returns and EUA price changes. Moreover, we test if the relationship between EUA price variations and electricity stock returns is asymmetric and if the carbon price effect and the asymmetry are power firm-specific. Adding to earlier studies, we initially provide an inspection of the individual impact of EU ETS Phase II and on-going Phase III; followed by a comparative analysis between power firms which core activity relies on renewable energy sources and those whose sources are fundamentally non-renewable ones. A statistically significant positive long-run impact of EU ETS on the aggregated power sector stock market return is found concerning Phase II and works asymmetrically. Moreover, evidence is provided demonstrating that asymmetry and EUA effects are power firm-specific. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, we use a copula model with asymmetric margins to produce forecast densities with the scope for severe departures from symmetry. Empirical and skew t distributions are employed for the margins, and a high-dimensional Gaussian copula is used to jointly capture cross-sectional and (multivariate) serial dependence. The copula parameter matrix is given by the correlation matrix of a latent stationary and Markov vector autoregression (VAR). We show that the likelihood can be evaluated efficiently using the unique partial correlations, and estimate the copula using Bayesian methods. We examine the forecasting performance of the model for four U.S. macroeconomic variables between 1975:Q1 and 2011:Q2 using quarterly real-time data. We find that the point and density forecasts from the copula model are competitive with those from a Bayesian VAR. During the recent recession the forecast densities exhibit substantial asymmetry, avoiding some of the pitfalls of the symmetric forecast densities from the Bayesian VAR. We show that the asymmetries in the predictive distributions of GDP growth and inflation are similar to those found in the probabilistic forecasts from the Survey of Professional Forecasters. Last, we find that unlike the linear VAR model, our fitted Gaussian copula models exhibit nonlinear dependencies between some macroeconomic variables.

Time-use is relevant to energy when consumption tracks the time a device is used. Cluster analysis is a promising approach to identify time-use patterns. If clusters with particularly long time use and thus high energy consumption emerge, these groups could merit targeted policy intervention. We investigate these ideas via an empirical study of time use for television watching in the U.S. Three clusters were identified. In 2013, the average time spent watching television by Clusters 1, 2 and 3 are dramatically different: 1.1, 3.5 and 7.7 h per day respectively. While members of Cluster 3 are only 14% of the total population they represent 34% of TV energy consumption. The population of Cluster 3 tends to be older, less employed and less educated. Energy savings per adopter is much larger for Cluster 3, suggesting much higher benefits from efficient devices. These results are relevant to the design of efficiency programs, indicating potential for variable rebates and/or tiered communication. With variable rebates, utilities would offer higher incentives to high-use customers. In tiered communication, utilities would devote more resources to engage customers with larger savings potential.

Using a bottom-up statistical approach, this analysis explores determinants of household energy consumption using data from the most recent National Housing Survey. The primary objective is to tease out the impacts of various factors on the domestic energy consumption spectrum across different population groups. The aim of this approach is to neutralize conventional factors affecting energy consumption (age of house, total area, etc.) to finely analyze the impact of other determinants including those relating to household characteristics and other control variables. First, we define homogeneous consumption groups of households by using multivariate statistical techniques, namely the Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Ascending Hierarchical Classification. Second, we use standard OLS regression to explore the effects of various factors on domestic energy consumption among homogeneous groups of households. This multivariate analysis exercise has led us to identify four main consumption typologies. Results revealed that energy prices were the most important factors determining domestic energy consumption. In addition, this study showed that occupant characteristics significantly affect domestic energy use. Results of this research call for combine all efforts, multiple strategies and smart policies, to incorporate household and consumption behaviors in managing domestic energy consumption.

Because of the often widespread availability of hard production factors, most cities increasingly compete for attracting non-material production factors whose role, in light of the more widespread diffusion of physical production factors, may ultimately determine their long-run economic success. Against this background, our paper focuses on a relatively neglected non-material factor, viz. urban risk attitude. In fact, cities offer the competitive and challenging environment where individual characteristics of actors may enjoy their highest returns; risk-loving and innovative individuals may sort in large urban agglomerations. The paper tests whether cities attracting such individuals and, thus, enjoying a more positive and open attitude towards risk, tend to innovate more. The empirical analysis of the paper is based on the most recent (2008/2009) wave of the European Values Study. Micro- data on about 80,000 individuals located in different EU urban areas are used to calculate city-specific attitudes towards risk that go beyond individual characteristics. This city-level risk attitude variable is then used within a knowledge production function approach, as an explanatory variable for urban innovation (patent applications to the European Patent Office) along with more traditional knowledge determinants (human capital and R&D expenditures). Our empirical results show that cities with a more open and positive attitude towards risk ceteris paribus also tend to be more innovative. In addition, we find that, unlike traditional knowledge production factors, this factor faces no decreasing returns. While further research might be beneficial in order to more precisely pinpoint the extent of such effects, our findings appear to be robust and suggest a positive role for the urban attitude towards risky endeavours in explaining urban innovation.","[Caragliu, Andrea] Politecn Milan, ABC Dept, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, I-20133 Milan, MI, Italy; [Del Bo, Chiara F.] Univ Milan, DEEM Dept, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, MI, Italy; [Nijkamp, Peter] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Kourtit, Karima] KTH Royal Inst Technol, Dept Urban Planning & Environm, Drotting Kristinas VAG 30, S-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Nijkamp, Peter] Adam Mickiewicz Univ, Dept Spatial Econ, Wieniawskiego 1, PL-61712 Poznan, Poland",Polytechnic University of Milan; University of Milan; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Royal Institute of Technology; Adam Mickiewicz University,"Del Bo, CF (通讯作者)，Univ Milan, DEEM Dept, Via Conservatorio 7, I-20122 Milan, MI, Italy.",andrea.caragliu@polimi.it; chiara.delbo@unimi.it; karima.kourtit@abe.kth.se; p.nijkamp@vu.nl,"karima, karima/AAH-3200-2019; Caragliu, Andrea/AAI-2320-2020; DEL BO, CHIARA F./L-1555-2017","karima, karima/0000-0002-7171-994X; Nijkamp, Peter/0000-0002-4068-8132; DEL BO, CHIARA F./0000-0002-8684-5383; Caragliu, Andrea/0000-0003-0865-3404",,,,,82,19,21,1,31,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The resulting impact is potentially devastating for the country's growth prospects. Traditionally, lack of an affordable and reliable fuel supply for power generation, coupled with ineffective institutions and an unfavourable investment climate, have resulted in Ghana's electricity sector performing poorly. In light of the 2007 discovery of natural gas reserves in Ghanaian waters, this paper examines whether domestic gas could advance the performance of the electricity sector, and if so, how. The results of our analysis show that utilization of gas reserves in Ghana's gas-to-power market is an economically superior strategy compared to an export-oriented utilization scheme. The lack of an effective regulatory framework for investment, skill shortages, and an inefficient electricity pricing structure continue to be the main constraining factors.

The results revealed: (1) that China performs lower than Australia in clean technology in the primary, manufacturing, energy sectors due to their overuse of coal and inefficient sectoral production processes, and (2) that China had a 30.94 Mt surplus of bi-lateral CO2 emissions in 2010-2011 and (3) overall global emissions were reduced by 20.19 Mt through Australia-China trade in 2010-2011. The result indicates that the greater the energy efficient a country among the trading partners the lower will be the overall global CO2 emissions. Global emissions decreased mainly because China consumed Australian primary products rather than producing them. Australia is an energy efficient producer of primary products relative to China. The bilateral trade compositions and trade volume played an important role in lowering global emissions and therefore one can view proposed China Australia Free trade Agreement positively in reducing global emissions. However, for the sustainable development, China should strengthen clean energy use and both countries should adopt measures to create an emission trading scheme in order to avoid protectionism in the form of future border price adjustments.

Resilience revisited: assessing the impact of the 2007-09 recession on 83 Canadian regions with accompanying thoughts on an elusive concept, Regional Studies. Viewing the 2007-09 recession as an exogenous shock, the paper proposes an assessment of the resilience' of 83 Canadian regions using four standard metrics: population, employment, unemployment and employment rates. For each metric, regions are evaluated on three posited dimensions of resilience': resistance, rebound and recuperation. The results point to generally responsive regional economies with a range of reactions to the recessionary shock a priori compatible with the notion of resilience'. However, the range of observed responses, depending on metrics used, methods applied and contextual considerations, leaves much room for interpretation, making it difficult to exclude players. The assessment serves in turn as a laboratory for a reflection on resilience' as a useful analytical concept in regional studies. It is concluded that the operational definition of resilience' remains problematic.","[Dube, Jean] Univ Laval, Pavillon Felix Antoine Savard,2325 Rue Biblioth, Quebec City, PQ G1V 0A6, Canada; [Polese, Mario] Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, 385 Sherbrooke East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada",Laval University; University of Quebec; Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS),"Polèse, M (通讯作者)，Inst Natl Rech Sci, Ctr Urbanisat Culture Soc, 385 Sherbrooke East, Montreal, PQ H2X 1E3, Canada.",jean.dube@esad.ulaval.ca; mario.polese@ucs.inrs.ca,"Dubé, Jean/L-1751-2019","Dubé, Jean/0000-0003-3445-3449",Canada Research Chairs Program,Canada Research Chairs Program(Canada Research Chairs),The Canada Research Chairs Program is thanked by the authors for its financial support.

We convened workshops in Alice Springs, Australia to build capability to identify no-regrets energy-related housing or transport activities and strategies. In preparation, we interviewed policy actors and constructed three new housing-related future scenarios.

Empirical evidence shows that both firm exports and multinational activity are affected by trade liberalization episodes. We account for the strong positive correlation between exports and FDI by developing a general-equilibrium model featuring firm heterogeneity, trade and FDI with final and intermediate products. Different geographical spaces are considered to quantify the effect of a preferential trade agreement (PTA) on supply-mode decisions, for both partner and excluded countries. The model sheds new light on the mechanisms through which geography reshapes the concentration of economic activities both inside and outside the PTA area. Resumen Este articulo examina como responden las estrategias de acceso a mercados a cambios en el nivel de integracion, mediante exportaciones e inversion extranjera directa (IED). Las pruebas empiricas muestran que tanto las exportaciones de las empresas como la actividad multinacional se ven afectadas por la ocurrencia de casos de liberalizacion comercial. Se tuvo en cuenta la fuerte correlacion positiva entre las exportaciones y la IED mediante el desarrollo de un modelo de equilibrio general que incluyo la heterogeneidad de las empresas, el comercio y la IED con productos finales e intermedios. Se consideraron diferentes espacios geograficos para cuantificar el efecto de un acuerdo comercial preferencial (ACP) en las decisiones sobre la modalidad de la oferta, tanto para los socios como para los paises excluidos.

TIMs literature has neglected or subordinated social and ecological regional conditions. This research adopts a broader perspective by: (i) studying an interscalar intergovernmental network aimed at meeting tridimensional sustainable development (SD) goals; and (ii) showing why this arrangement is successful. The network members are the regional government and provincial councils, which act as network promoters, and the municipalities. We model the network as a platform for integrating both pre-existing idiosyncratic resources and emergent resources/benefits that come from rich and regular interactions (in the shape of learning, enjoyment, reputation, identification, and attitude towards citizen participation); resources integration leads to network member satisfaction. This view is supported by data concerning a network in a Spanish autonomous community (region), Castile-La Mancha. We see this study as a first step towards more systematic research on what might be termed territorial sustainability models'. Resumen Gran parte de la investigacion regional hasta la fecha se ha centrado en la cadena de innovacion-competitividad-crecimiento, que esta implicita en los modelos de innovacion territoriales (MIT). La literatura sobre los MIT ha descuidado o restado importancia a las condiciones regionales sociales y ecologicas. Esta investigacion adopta una perspectiva mas amplia mediante: (i) el estudio de una red intergubernamental interescalar orientada a satisfacer los objetivos de desarrollo sostenible tridimensional; y (ii) una demostracion de por que es exitosa esta estructura. Los miembros de la red son el gobierno regional y los concejos provinciales, quienes actuan como promotores de la red, y los municipios. La red se modela como una plataforma que integra tanto recursos idiosincrasicos ya existentes como recursos/beneficios emergentes, procedentes de interacciones abundantes y regulares (tales como el aprendizaje, disfrute, reputacion, identificacion, y la actitud hacia la participacion ciudadana); la integracion de recursos conduce a la satisfaccion de los miembros de la red. Esta opinion esta respaldada por los datos procedentes de una red en una comunidad (region) autonoma espanola: Castilla-La Mancha. El estudio se plantea como un primer paso hacia una investigacion mas sistematica sobre lo que podria denominarse como 'modelos de sostenibilidad territorial'.","[Echebarria, Carmen; Barrutia, Jose M.; Apaolaza, Vanessa; Hartmann, Patrick] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Bizkaia, Spain; [Aguado, Itziar] Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Geog, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente S-N, Vitoria 01006, Alava, Spain",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,"Echebarria, C; Barrutia, JM; Apaolaza, V; Hartmann, P (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Econ & Business Adm, Ave Lehendakari Agirre 83, Bilbao 48015, Bizkaia, Spain.;Aguado, I (通讯作者)，Univ Basque Country UPV EHU, Fac Geog, C Francisco Tomas & Valiente S-N, Vitoria 01006, Alava, Spain.",carmen.etxebarria@ehu.es; josemaria.barrutia@ehu.es; itziar.aguado@ehu.es; vanessa.apaolaza@ehu.es; patrick.hartmann@ehu.es,"Aguado-Moralejo, Itziar/F-5781-2016; Hartmann, Patrick/J-7948-2012; Apaolaza, Vanessa/AAB-2801-2019; BARRUTIA, JOSE/G-2405-2011; MORALEJO, ITZIAR AGUADO/AAA-3929-2021; ECHEBARRIA, CARMEN/G-2391-2011","Aguado-Moralejo, Itziar/0000-0003-2166-065X; Hartmann, Patrick/0000-0001-5922-3098; ECHEBARRIA, CARMEN/0000-0002-4923-7370; APAOLAZA IBANEZ, VANESA/0000-0003-3252-3036",Spanish Government [ECO 2010-20792]; Basque Government [GIC 12/57-IT 601-13]; University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) [UFI 11/51],Spanish Government(Spanish Government); Basque Government(Basque Government); University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU),"The research was funded by the Spanish Government (Grant number ECO 2010-20792), the Basque Government (Grant number GIC 12/57-IT 601-13) and the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) (Grant number UFI 11/51).

A critical income ensuring positive housing consumption can be determined. The empirical analysis of districts in North Rhine-Westphalia suggests that conditions on the housing market, income levels and several variables depicting a district's social environment are important drivers of homelessness: high rents and relatively few vacant small flats lead to an increase in homelessness. The condition of vacant flats significantly affects homelessness levels too. Homelessness also increases when the share of those with a very low income is higher, since this makes it more difficult to reach the critical income.

Scholars are now positing that energy policy needs to move beyond essentialised understandings of people positioned as the problem and seek to involve household members as part of the solution. Joining this conversation, we explore the energy narratives of low-income people aged 60 years and over, living in private sector housing. Participants shared their energy efficiency stories during focus groups conducted in the Illawarra, Australia. The paper explores how Foucault's concept of governmentality may help inform energy efficiency programs by paying close attention to the way in which individual energy choices made under certain circumstances create who an individual becomes. Learning from participants, our governmentality analysis revealed the tyrannies of thrifty domestic energy conduct. We illustrate our argument drawing on the examples of practices relating to clothing and lighting. We outline how governmentality analysis can be used by researchers, policy makers and practitioners to assist people to safely negotiate energy efficiency in their domestic lives.

This study provides emission projections for China up to 2030 given current policies and a selected set of enhanced policies, and compares the results with projected CO2 emission trajectories that are consistent with the announced target for 2030. The projections are based on existing scenarios and energy system and land use model calculations. We project that the 2030 CO2 emission level consistent with a peak in CO2 emissions by 2030 ranges from 113 to 11.8 GtCO(2). The corresponding total GHG emission level ranges from 13.5 to 14.0 GtCO(2)e in 2030. Current policies are likely not to be sufficient to achieve the 2030 targets, as our projected total GHG emission level under current policies ranges from 14.7 to 15.4 GtCO(2)e by 2030. However, an illustrative set of enhancement policy measures, all of which are related to national priorities, leads to projected GHG emission levels from 13.1 to 13.7 GtCO(2)e by 2030 - and thus below the levels necessary for peaking CO2 emissions before 2030.

Coal-fired power plants are a major source of mercury pollution worldwide and are expected to be the first key sector to be addressed in China under Minamata Convention. A best available technique (BAT) adoption model was developed in the form of a decision tree and cost-effectiveness for each technological option. Co-benefit control technologies and their enhancement with coal blending/switching and halogen injection (HI) can provide early measures to help China meet the Minamata Convention obligations. We project future energy and policy scenarios to simulate potential national mercury reduction goals for China and estimate costs of the control measures for each scenario. The Minamata Medium scenario, equivalent to the goal of the US Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule, requires the application of activated carbon injection (ACI) and HI on 30% and 20% of power plants, respectively. The corresponding total costs would be $2.5 billion, approximately one-fourth the costs in the US. An emission limit of 3 mu g/m(3) in 2030 was identified as a feasible policy option for China to comply with Minamata Convention. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Content marketing is a new division of digital marketing. It has a revolutionary nature, and has changed the way of communication with customers, from a one-way, broadcasting, approach to a customercentric. Due to the development of social media and user generated marketing, modern companies are learning to consider customer journey in their digital marketing strategy. Content marketing plays an important role for business-to-business (B2B) companies due to the higher (than for business-to-customers (B2C) companies) dependence on customers. The latter could be explained by longer purchase decision time, smaller amount of customers and longer business relationships. It is often believed that large global companies disseminate best practices due to high level of available resources, process optimisation and the effectiveness level. The aim of the current research is to identify by means of a content analysis whether the largest global B2B companies listed in Global 500 make use of the concept of the customer journey in their digital marketing strategy.

One of these is detecting the length of stay outliers (LOS) accounting for an important share of hospital costs. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factors facilitating identification of hospital LOS outliers. A total of 4570 patients were analyzed. To select the outliers, I used the inter-quartile method, using the median and the inter-quartile distance. The LOS outliers comprised 5,4% of the study sample and accounted for almost 15% of total hospital costs and 25% of total inpatient days. The median and range of the total costs for LOS outliers were (sic) 3145,26 (1930,54-4670,88). The status of an LOS outlier was associated with age and type of admission. Eighty three percent of the LOS were admitted to the hospital in an acute way. Most of the LOS outliers (56% of all LOS outliers) were younger than the mean for the study population. There was no significant correlation between the reason for discharge, the type of department or the gender and being an LOS outlier. It is concluded that identifying the LOS outliers can contribute to better knowledge of hospital costs and help the management of these institutions control those costs. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Traditional budgeting methods are widely used across many different businesses, however they remain the subject of much discussion among managers, economists and academics alike. Over the last few decades a growing scepticism can be observed with regards to the efficacy and poor adaptability of budgeting in the current business environment. The criticisms centre around the annual basis of budgets and the preference to use budgeting as a control tool. The introduction to this paper presents an overview of the trends within the discipline of budgeting on the basis of a literature review of publications and information garnered from scientific databases. The main part of the study presents the results of a survey focused on the budgeting process in the business environment. The sample consists of medium-sized and large Czech companies. The main objective of the survey was to assess the predictability of selected factors in the business environment through the budgeting process and to assess how effectively budgeting can adapt to market changes.","[Dokulil, Jiri] Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic",Tomas Bata University Zlin,"Dokulil, J (通讯作者)，Tomas Bata Univ Zlin, Fac Management & Econ, Mostni 5139, Zlin 76001, Czech Republic.",dokulil@fame.utb.cz,,"Dokulil, Jiri/0000-0003-3990-1781",Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin [IGA/FaME/2016/005],Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin,This work was supported by the Internal Grant Agency of Tomas Bata University in Zlin under project number IGA/FaME/2016/005.,,20,0,0,1,7,TOMAS BATA UNIV ZLIN,ZLIN,"NAM T G MASARYKA 5555, ZLIN, 760 01, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7454-592-4,,,,2016,,,,,,,111,117,,10.7441/dokbat.2016.11,0.0,,,7,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BM6IP,,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000466741400011,0

The aim of this paper is to point out the secure position of organic food in retail in Slovak Republic. Purpose of the paper was supported by the primary information that has been obtained on the basis of the questionnaire survey implemented in the Slovak Republic. Based on the results obtained, we found out that most consumers buy organic products currently in various supermarkets and hypermarkets. A significant factor which influences the purchase of organic food is age. We can state that consumers in retirement age buy organic food at least. This fact is based on the assumption that their purchasing power is low and consumers in this age do not like to change their normal consumer behavior. On the contrary, more young consumers are in favor of these products and are much more accessible to the changes and use different ways to be sufficiently informed and compared with pensioners, their purchasing power is higher.","[Kubelakova, Andrea; Kosiciarova, Ingrida] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Kubelaková, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Mkt & Trade, Trieda A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",a.kubelakova@gmail.com; ingrida.kosiciarova@gmail.com,"Košičiarová, Ingrida/AAX-6180-2020","Košičiarová, Ingrida/0000-0003-3763-0826",,,,,1,3,3,3,10,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,1036,1042,,10.15414/isd2016.s13.04,0.0,,,7,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500123,0

These measures would help minimize the presence of contractors in the construction market who do not actually perform the construction and installation work on their own, and to achieve the desired level of profitability of 8 to 10%.","[Oparin, Sergey] Petersburg State Transport Univ Emperor Alexander, Chair Econ & Management Construct, St Petersburg, Russia; [Chepachenko, Nikolay; Yudenko, Marina] Petersburg State Transport Univ Emperor Alexander, Dept Econ & Management Construct, St Petersburg, Russia",Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University; Emperor Alexander I St. Petersburg State Transport University,"Oparin, S (通讯作者)，Petersburg State Transport Univ Emperor Alexander, Chair Econ & Management Construct, St Petersburg, Russia.",oparinsg@mail.ru; nvchepachenko@mail.ru; mnuspb@mail.ru,"Oparin, Sergey/GWQ-4745-2022",,,,,,15,2,2,0,7,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,179,186,,10.12955/cbup.v4.759,0.0,,,8,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000026,0

It uses the heights of military recruits in the towns of Zalamea la Real and Nerva between 1852 and 1935 (birth cohorts of 1832-1914). The majority of the mining population of Nerva, which had become independent from Zalamea la Real in 1885, was concentrated close to Minas de Riotinto, following the extraordinary influx of immigrants, mostly attracted by the British company RTCL after establishing its operations there in 1873. The anthropometric results reveal that: 1) the height of males decreased slightly among the cohorts of the decades 1850-1870, whose childhood and adolescence coincided with the beginning of the mining boom; 2) the inequality (measured by CVs, percentiles and ratios of short-stature subjects) increased among the cohorts of the 1870s, made up of immigrants, principally in Nerva. During this period, the gap between the height of the native population and the immigrants also increased, as did the gap between the literate and illiterate populations. Finally, 3) the improvement in the biological welfare of the cohorts corresponding to 1880-1890 was undermined in the subsequent decades due to the impact of the mining crisis. In the lead-up to the Great War, the height of the miners in Nerva was no different to that of the rural population of Zalamea in the mid-nineteenth century.","[Perez de Perceval Verde, Miguel A.; Miguel Martinez-Carrion, Jose; Pascual Martinez-Soto, Angel] Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain",University of Murcia,"Verde, MAPD (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",,"Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/E-4219-2016; de Perceval Verde, Miguel MPPV Pérez/K-8169-2014; MARTINEZ-SOTO, ANGEL PASCUAL/K-7677-2014","Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/0000-0002-8918-8833; MARTINEZ-SOTO, ANGEL PASCUAL/0000-0003-4257-454X","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) [HAR2010-21941-C03-01, HAR2010-21941-C03-02, HAR2010-20684-C02-02, HAR2013-47182-C2-2-P, HAR2014-56428-C3-1-P, HAR2014-56428-C3-3-P]; Fundacion Seneca (Agency for Science and Technology.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to present psychosocial work factors and their relationship to musculoskeletal symptoms among computer workers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ) for assessing psychosocial factors at work was used to assess 800 computer workers. RESULTS: The results showed that most respondents often worked at a high pace; sometimes received support from superiors, and were little satisfied with work. There was a positive correlation (r = 0.3) between quantitative demands at work and neck symptoms. CONCLUSION: Particular attention should be paid to psychosocial factors of the work environment, especially those with a significant high risk of workers acquiring musculoskeletal symptoms, in relation to assistance in the work environment, management, workload, and increasing autonomy at work.","[Prodanovska-Stojcevska, Viktorija; Jovanovska, Tanja; Rajchanovska, Domnika; Filov, Izabela; Bogdanova, Biljana] Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Coll Med, Bitola, North Macedonia; [Jovanovic, Jovica] Univ Nis, Fac Med, Nish, Serbia",St. Clement of Ohrid University of Bitola; University of Nis,"Prodanovska-Stojcevska, V (通讯作者)，Univ St Kliment Ohridski, Coll Med, Bitola, North Macedonia.",prodanovska.stojcevska@gmail.com,,,,,,,31,2,2,1,1,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,669,675,,10.12955/cbup.v4.830,0.0,,,7,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000100,0

Recent food spikes were raising concerns on the food and nutrition security at all its levels (global, national, household and individual). In this paper we estimate demand for food diversity in Kosovo. Theoretical framework suggests that food diversity serves as a proxy for food and nutritional status at the household level. Here we employ standard OLS in order to estimate the impact of income (and other determinants) on the demand for the food diversity. Further, we compute relevant anthropometric indicator (Body Mass Index) in order to access the state of the FNS at the individual level. For the purpose of empirical estimation we use the HBS data on Kosovo covering the period 2005-2012. The main findings suggest that food diversity in Kosovo marked important improvement over the time period observed, reflecting the impact of rising income as a key determinant of the food diet. The pattern of the household food consumption remained diversified over the time period observed, but restricted by the low level of income. Food diversity in the urban households is significantly higher than in rural areas. Individual variables in the most of the cases were determined as significant. Anthropometric estimates were evidencing that prevalence of undernourishment is particularly critical in the case of school-age children, while the main nutritional problem among the adults is overweight.","[Qineti, Artan; Braha, Kushtrim; Pokrivcak, Jan; Rajcaniova, Miroslava] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia; [Cupak, Andrej] Natl Bank Slovakia, Imricha Karvasa 1, Bratislava, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra; National Bank of Slovakia,"Qineti, A (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ Policy, Tr Andreja Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",artan.qineti@gmail.com,"Pokrivcak, Jan/O-4941-2014; Rajcaniova, Miroslava/GNP-5216-2022; Qineti, Artan/AAD-8740-2019; Braha, Kushtrim/C-8260-2017; Cupak, Andrej/AAS-9503-2020","Rajcaniova, Miroslava/0000-0003-4688-7690;",,,,,39,0,0,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,964,975,,10.15414/isd2016.s12.08,0.0,,,12,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500114,0

It is hoped that these measures will play an active role in reviving the industry of arts and crafts, and enhancing the overall development of this industry.","[Wang, Ning] Guangdong Ind Tech Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Guangdong Industry Polytechnic,"Wang, N (通讯作者)，Guangdong Ind Tech Coll, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,2,0,0,0,1,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-0042,,978-1-60595-400-4,DESTECH TRANS SOC,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI1PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406675600082,0

The article outlines five phases of Israeli political engagement with climate change from 1992 until 2013 when the National GHG Emissions Reduction Plan was defunded. Israel was motivated to develop its climate policy by international norms: OECD membership and the 2009 UN Summit in Copenhagen. Although the eventual Plan may not have significantly reduced Israel's emissions, it contained immediate cost-effective, energy efficiency measures. Despite rhetorical support for renewable energy, in practice, most Israeli leaders consistently perceive ensuring supply of fossil fuels as the best means to achieve energy security. The gas finds thus effectively ended a potentially significant switch towards renewable energy production. The development of commercially competitive Israeli renewable energy technology may change this prevailing economic calculus alongside renewed international and domestic leadership and a resolution of the region's conflicts. Although Israel's political circumstances are idiosyncratic, the dynamics shaping its climate policy reflect wider trends such as competing economic priorities and failure to consider long term energy security.

The annual growth rate of the Brazilian power sector is about 4%/year with a growing capacity addition of fossil fuels, which indicates a deterioration regarding sustainability. This work utilizes multi-criteria analysis coupled with composite indicators to infer the sustainability evolution of the power generation sector in Brazil from 2010 to 2016. Seven criteria were considered: emission of greenhouse gases, immobilized area, use of fuel resources, water use, morbidity, energy generation reliability and energy efficiency. The assessment evidenced wind power and nuclear power plants as the most sustainable options for capacity addition after hydropower. Co-generation and combined cycle technologies should be encouraged in natural gas and biomass projects in order to reduce impacts on sustainability. The assessment is interdisciplinary and admits tradeoffs amongst different impacts and benefits, for instance, environmental impacts versus energy generation reliability. It is proposed that sustainability assessments be incorporated to the formal process of decision making in order to reduce opposition and facilitate obtaining consensus among different stakeholders.

The second step uses the club assignments in a dynamic space-time panel data model to assess long-run dynamic direct and spillover responses of regional income levels to changes in initial period endowments for clubs that were identified.

J,"Murray, B; Rivers, N",,,,"Murray, Brian; Rivers, Nicholas",,,British Columbia's revenue-neutral carbon tax: A review of the latest grand experiment in environmental policy,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Review,,,,,,Carbon tax; Evaluation; Policy; Emission price,,"In 2008, British Columbia implemented the first comprehensive and substantial carbon tax in North America. By 2012, the tax had reached a level of C$30/t CO2, and it covers about three-quarters of all greenhouse gas emissions in the province. This paper reviews existing evidence on the effect of the tax on greenhouse emissions, the economy, and the distribution of income, and provides new evidence on public perceptions of the tax. Empirical and simulation models suggest that the tax has reduced emissions in the province by between 5% and 15% since being implemented. At the same time, models show that the tax has had negligible effects on the aggregate economy, despite some evidence that certain emissions-intensive sectors face challenges. Studies differ on the effects of the policy on the distribution of income, however all studies agree that the effects are relatively small in this dimension. Finally, polling data shows that the tax was initially opposed by the majority of the public, but that three years post-implementation, the public generally supported the carbon tax.

Using the 2005-07 American Community Survey, this paper analyses the extent of geographical disparities in occupational segregation by race/ethnicity across US states. The results show that there is a great geographical variation in segregation. A large part is driven by spatial disparities in workers' characteristics, mainly due to differences in the distribution of ethnic/racial minorities and their immigration/linguistic profiles. Taking these characteristics into account reduces this variation and reshapes the segregation map, with the highest segregation moving from states in the Southwest to those in the East Central region, where minorities face more segregating labour markets.","[Gradin, Carlos; Del Rio, Coral; Alonso-Villar, Olga] Fac CC Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada, E-36310 Vigo, Spain; [Del Rio, Coral] EQUALITAS, Delhi, India",Universidade de Vigo,"Gradín, C (通讯作者)，Fac CC Econ, Dept Econ Aplicada, Campus Lagoas Marcosende S-N, E-36310 Vigo, Spain.",cgradin@uvigo.es; crio@uvigo.es; ovillar@uvigo.es,"del Rio, Coral/M-5560-2019; GRADIN, CARLOS/AAH-9326-2019; Alonso-Villar, Olga/K-4348-2014","del Rio, Coral/0000-0002-3173-3624; GRADIN, CARLOS/0000-0001-7744-0707; Alonso-Villar, Olga/0000-0002-7355-0279","Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [ECO2010-21668-C03-03, ECO2011-23460]; Xunta de Galicia [10SEC300023PR, CN2012/178]; Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)",Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad(Spanish Government); Xunta de Galicia(Xunta de Galicia); Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER)(European Union (EU)Spanish Government),Financial support from the Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad [grant numbers ECO2010-21668-C03-03 and ECO2011-23460]; the Xunta de Galicia [grant numbers 10SEC300023PR and CN2012/178]; and the Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER) is gratefully acknowledged.,,36,19,20,3,43,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

While the application of behavior-based method is promising, the challenge exists to achieve efficiently sustainable behavioral change. Based on multi-period observation of energy behavior at the Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, this paper presents a model-based approach aimed to improve the nationally popular and deep-seated benchmark setting strategy for normative feedback used in home energy reports. The improved approach has its merits of countering the undesirable boomerang effect and enhancing the effectiveness of normative feedback targeting different personalities. By introducing a modified opinion dynamics model, this paper simulates the process of energy behavior change and therefore identifies the driver and elementary rules of behavioral change. In particular, the paper defines various behavioral zones in accordance with people's personality and proposes a new customized energy reporting mechanism that maps normative benchmark to personality trait. The new energy reporting policy has strong industrial implication for promoting behavior-based method towards a sustained energy conservation movement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Containerization has spatially fragmented the physical functions of US ports by reducing the friction of moving freight through ports to inland destinations.

This study contributes to an emerging qualitative energy research (QER) literature by deploying an analytical approach that explores comparison of data from two UK projects ('Carbon, Comfort and Control' and 'Conditioning Demand') concerned, in broad terms, with householder-LCTs interactions - primarily associated with the production and maintenance of thermal comfort. In-depth, and in many cases repeat, interviews were conducted in a total of 18 households where devices such as heat pumps and thermal feedback lamps had recently been installed. We discuss this comparative process and how a reflexive reading of notions of (and strategies associated with) credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmablity enabled new ways of working and thinking with existing data.

The empirical assessment of the NK-DSGE model is based on a conditional sequence of likelihood-based tests conducted in a vector autoregressive (VAR) system, in which both the low- and high-frequency implications of the model are addressed in a coherent framework. If the low-frequency behavior of the original time series of the model can be approximated by nonstationary processes, stationarity must be imposed by removing the stochastic trends. This gives rise to a set of recoverable unit roots/cointegration restrictions, in addition to the short-run cross-equation restrictions. The procedure is based on the sequence LR1 -> LR2 -> LR3, where LR1 is the cointegration rank test, LR2 is the cointegration matrix test, and LR3 is the cross-equation restrictions test: LR2 is computed conditional on LR1 and LR3 is computed conditional on LR2. The Type I errors of the three tests are set consistently with a prefixed overall nominal significance level. A bootstrap analog of the testing strategy is proposed in small samples. We show that the information stemming from the individual tests can be used constructively to uncover which features of the data are not captured by the theoretical model and thus to rectify, when possible, the specification. We investigate the empirical size properties of the proposed testing strategy by a Monte Carlo experiment and show the empirical usefulness of our approach by estimating and testing a monetary business cycle NK-DSGE model using U.S. quarterly data.

But do financial and commercial traders who participate in spot oil trading also respond to changes in international politics? We construct a firm-level dataset for all U.S. oil-importing companies over 1986-2008 to examine how these firms respond to increases in political distance between the U.S. and her trading partners, measured by divergence in their UN General Assembly voting patterns. Consistent with previous macro evidence, we first show that individual firms diversify their oil imports politically, even after controlling for unobserved firm heterogeneity. However, the political pattern of oil imports is not entirely driven by the concerns of hold-up risks, which exist when oil transactions via term contracts are associated with backward vertical FDI that is subject to expropriation. In particular, our results indicate that even financial and commercial traders significantly reduce their oil imports from U.S. political enemies. Interestingly, while these traders diversify their oil imports politically immediately after changes in international politics, other oil companies reduce their oil imports with a significant time lag. Our findings suggest that in designing regulations to avoid harmful repercussions on commodity and financial assets, policymakers need to understand the nature of political risk.

Overall, we track 3267 shale gas violations, noting that environmental violation rates increase from 2007 to 2009, remain high through 2010, and then drop in 2011 and thereafter. Violations related to spills and erosion were most commonly issued. A single change in policy resulted in a 45% decrease in environmental violation rates. Furthermore, for every 1% increase in wells drilled per inspections conducted, there was a 0.56% decrease in environmental violation rates. Similar effects were not found for administrative violations. Operator identity, price of gas, and other major policies were not significantly correlated with violation rates. In comparing conventional and shale gas extraction compliance we found that shale gas development entails more risk related to spills and solid waste management, while conventional development entails more risk associated with cementing and casing issues, and site restoration.

Specifically, we explore how two commonly used terms to describe this issue - fracking or shale oil or gas development - serve as issue frames and influence public opinion. Extending existing research, we suggest that these frames elicit different top-of-mind associations that reflect positive or negative connotations and resonate with people's political ideology. These associations, in turn, help explain direct and indirect framing effects on support/opposition as well as whether these effects differ by political ideology. Results of a split-ballot, national U.S. survey (n=1000) reveal that people are more supportive of the energy extraction process when it is referred to as shale oil or gas development versus fracking, and this relationship is mediated by greater perceptions of benefit versus risk. Political ideology did hot moderate these effects. Further analysis suggests that these findings are partly explained by the tendency to associate frocking more with negative thoughts and impacts and shale oil or gas development more with positive thoughts and impacts. However, these associations also did not vary by political ideology. We discuss implications for communicating risk regarding energy development. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these potential benefits are highly dependent on the market characteristics and the policy interventions. We use simulation to study the effects of different alternatives for the expansion and operation of the interconnector Finland-Russia on the Finnish market (a high-price area). Our results show that the current trading arrangement, where a single trader owns the transmission rights, and limits the trade during peak hours to avoid capacity charges in Russia, is beneficial for Finland at the current interconnection capacity. However, if the interconnector is expanded, the behaviour of the trader would create significant distortions in the Finnish market. We also analyse the pros and cons of maintaining a strategic reserve in Finland in combination with the different scenarios of interconnection expansion and trading arrangements. We conclude that in the absence of trust in imports, the need for a strategic reserve is undeniable. This will slightly reduce the economic benefits of integration for Finnish consumers, but it will significantly improve reliability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We propose a new two-step procedure that allows testing for further long-run equilibrium relations with possibly different persistence levels. The first step consists of estimating the parameters of the model under the null hypothesis of the cointegration rank r = 1, 2, horizontal ellipsis , p - 1. This step provides consistent estimates of the order of fractional cointegration, the cointegration vectors, the speed of adjustment to the equilibrium parameters and the common trends. In the second step we carry out a sup-likelihood ratio test of no-cointegration on the estimated p - r common trends that are not cointegrated under the null. The order of fractional cointegration is reestimated in the second step to allow for new cointegration relationships with different memory. We augment the error correction model in the second step to adapt to the representation of the common trends estimated in the first step. The critical values of the proposed tests depend only on the number of common trends under the null, p - r, and on the interval of the orders of fractional cointegration b allowed in the estimation, but not on the order of fractional cointegration of already identified relationships. Hence, this reduces the set of simulations required to approximate the critical values, making this procedure convenient for practical purposes. In a Monte Carlo study we analyze the finite sample properties of our procedure and compare with alternative methods. We finally apply these methods to study the term structure of interest rates.","[Lasak, Katarzyna] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & OR, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Lasak, Katarzyna] Tinbergen Inst, NL-1082 MS Amsterdam, Netherlands; [Velasco, Carlos] Univ Carlos III Madrid, Dept Econ, E-28903 Getafe, Spain",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Tinbergen Institute; Universidad Carlos III de Madrid,"Lasak, K (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Econometr & OR, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.",k.a.lasak@vu.nl; carlos.velasco@uc3m.es,"Velasco, Carlos/K-7112-2014","Velasco, Carlos/0000-0001-5913-0107",Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I [ECO2012-31748]; CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation [DNRF78]; Tinbergen Institute in the Netherlands,Spanish Plan Nacional de I+D+I; CREATES - Center for Research in Econometric Analysis of Time Series - Danish National Research Foundation; Tinbergen Institute in the Netherlands,"The authors are very grateful to the Associate Editor and two referees, Niels Haldrup, Lennart Hoogerheide, Soren Johansen, Siem Jan Koopman, Morten Orregaard Nielsen, and participants at various seminars and conferences for helpful comments and suggestions.

This study investigates the allocation of economic subsidies to jatropha cultivation by using adoption models at both the community and household levels in Chiapas. At the community level, we compared socioeconomic and environmental variables of the communities that adopted jatropha to non-adopters. At the household level, 420 farm households were surveyed to analyse both the determinants of adoption and the extent of adoption (i.e. hectares dedicated to jatropha). The variables determining adoption were analysed at both levels using generalised linear models. The extent of jatropha adoption was assessed using ordinary least squares multiple regression. Quantitative data was complemented with key stakeholder interviews and focus groups. Results show that subsidies tend to be allocated to larger, better-connected communities which have access to better services. Within adopter communities, the subsidy is distributed among households that have more resources, better risk-coping strategies, better access to information, more experience with similar technologies and whose attitude towards risk is positive. This study provides lessons that can be useful for the introduction of new energy crops to better reach the target group and ultimately achieve the aims of energy promotion strategies.

Using a recently developed coarsened exact matching (CEM) technique, this paper examines the impact of research and development (R&D) activities on the performance of firms in China's coal mining industry. Our empirical results reveal that firms in China's coal industry that conduct R&D are more productive and their sales are higher. However, as far as the firm profitability and market shares are concerned, whether or not a firm in China's coal industry conducts R&D makes no difference. We find that foreign direct investment in China's coal mining industry leads to a significant decrease in the market share of domestic firms and its impact on productivity, sales and profitability of domestic firms is insignificant. The empirical results presented in this paper suggest that policies that encourage domestic firms in China's coal mining industries to conduct R&D can increase domestic production thereby reducing reliance on imports. Furthermore, productivity gains arising from R&D activities can also help Chinese mining firms to improve their competitive position in the international market. However, there is a need for restricting foreign direct investment in China's coal mining industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The barriers to entry into the Swedish heat market were extremely high as long as heat distribution were considered natural monopoly, but were recently lowered due to the introduction of a regulated third party access (TPA) system in the DH sector. This study assesses the potential impact on greenhouse gas emissions and cost-based heat price in the DH sector when farmers vertically integrate into the heat supply chain and introduce more local and agricultural crops and residues into the fuel mix. Four scenarios with various degree of farmer integration, were assessed using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and by analysis of the heat production costs. The results show that full integration of local farm and forest owners in the value chain can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and lower production costs/heat price, if there is an incentive to utilise local and agricultural fuels. The results imply that farmer participation in the DH sector should be encouraged by e.g. EU rural development programmes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is performed by constructing a baseline scenario without the ETS and assessing the impacts of the ETS, as currently designed. The results indicate that the ETS will start to impact emissions primarily after 2025 due to the prevalence of a sizable allowance surplus. The impact of approved (i.e. back-loading and 2.2% linear reduction factor (LRF)) and proposed (i.e. market stability reserve (MSR)) policy interventions and the inclusion of aviation, could accelerate the exhaustion of surplus and increase emission reductions during the investigated period. However, these measures would be insufficient to restore the scarcity of allowances and the corresponding carbon price before the start of ETS Phase IV, and the effectiveness of EU-internal abatement cannot be guaranteed until 2023. The effectiveness could be further reduced in the case of the economic shocks or the exclusion of international aviation. To restore the scarcity of allowances, other reform options are necessary. This paper extends the reasoning for the early removal of the back-loaded 900 Mtonne allowances by 2020 and broadening the scope of ETS to other sectors with potential high demand for allowances.

Regional convergence and aggregate business cycle in the United States, Regional Studies. The existing literature on convergence largely ignores the effect of aggregate fluctuations on the evolution of income disparities. However, if regional disparities follow a distinct cyclical pattern in the short run, the period of analysis should be chosen with great care to avoid distortions in the results. By analysing convergence among forty-eight conterminous US states through the distribution dynamics approach, it is shown that these distortions could be quite sizeable. Moreover, when convergence is analysed over an appropriate period that includes only complete cycles (1989-2007), results show that regional disparities exhibit a pro-cyclical behaviour and that the underlying long-run tendency is towards divergence.","[Magrini, Stefano; Gerolimetto, Margherita] Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, SSE Adv Sch Econ Venice, Dept Econ, I-30121 Venice, Italy; [Duran, Hasan Engin] Izmir Inst Technol, City & Reg Planning Dept, TR-35430 Urla Izmir, Turkey",Universita Ca Foscari Venezia; Izmir Institute of Technology,"Magrini, S (通讯作者)，Univ Ca Foscari Venezia, SSE Adv Sch Econ Venice, Dept Econ, Cannaregio 873, I-30121 Venice, Italy.",s.magrini@unive.it; margherita.gerolimetto@unive.it; enginduran@iyte.edu.tr,"MAGRINI, Stefano/IWE-3082-2023; Duran, Hasan Engin/AAU-9498-2021","MAGRINI, Stefano/0000-0001-6999-4558; Duran, Hasan Engin/0000-0002-0743-9943; Gerolimetto, Margherita/0000-0002-7604-2667",,,,,53,19,23,0,20,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Cultural factors are often absent from analyses of economic change and development, divorcing the nature of social places from the economic spaces within which they are situated. In response to this, the paper seeks both to conceptualize and to operationalize a framework of place-based culture. It develops a framework capturing the economic culture and community culture of places, and examines the relationship between the two, as a means of developing a broader understanding of the notion of culture than is usually considered by the extant literature. Empirically, the paper utilizes Wales as a reference region, with its culture compared with other regions of the UK, along with an analysis of cultural differences found across its localities. Overall, considerable variability is found in the cultural characteristics across both regions and localities, with the type of community culture embedded in places often found to be associated with the prevailing economic culture in these places, suggesting a strong symbiotic association.","[Huggins, Robert] Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales; [Thompson, Piers] Nottingham Trent Univ, Nottingham Business Sch, Nottingham, England",Cardiff University; Nottingham Trent University; University of Nottingham,"Huggins, R (通讯作者)，Cardiff Univ, Sch Planning & Geog, Ctr Econ Geog, Cardiff CF10 3WA, S Glam, Wales.",hugginsr@cardiff.ac.uk; piers.thompson@ntu.ac.uk,"Thompson, Piers/R-5828-2019","Thompson, Piers/0000-0003-1961-7441",Welsh Government - New Ideas Social Research Fund,Welsh Government - New Ideas Social Research Fund,"The research upon which this paper is based was funded by the Welsh Government via its New Ideas Social Research Fund.

This article tries to fill this gap, and its purpose is to describe the impact of the different types of ownership on the size and diversity of supervisory boards in the Polish two-tier board model. In this study, panel data analysis is applied in order to examine whether there are differences in supervisory board size and gender diversity on supervisory boards with foreign, managerial, state and financial investor ownership. Amongst others, the results reveal that state ownership positively influences supervisory board diversity and managerial ownership is positively associated with supervisory board diversity. Moreover, financial investor ownership positively affects supervisory board size. The paper also explains how these relationships influence on the supervisory boards of Polish listed companies.

Financial repression allowed the Treasury to pay low nominal interest, which was negative because of the strong inflation during the early Francoism and the twilight of the regime. The paper concludes that Franco regime issued much of its debt to finance investments outside the government budget, whose deficits were much lower than the huge volume of issued public debt. The poverty of the Treasury forced Franco governments to pay its policy of nationalization and industrialization with public debt, both in the autarky and during the development plans period. The lack of resources prevented Franco's Treasury repay their debts; eventually public debt was wiped out by inflation tax and financial repression. This, along economic growth, made sovereign debt sustainable under the Franco regime.","Univ Alcala, Madrid, Spain",Universidad de Alcala,"Comín, FC (通讯作者)，Univ Alcala, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,56,2,2,0,5,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,2385-3247,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

We assume, considering the differences in present living conditions in both countries that there are significant differences in the motivation level of service sector employees. Subjects of the research were comparable hotels situated at the foot of mountains in the mentioned countries and in the towns with similar level of tourism, infrastructure and regional development. A questionnaire with closed questions was used to analyse the motivation level. Socio-demographic and qualification characteristics of employees were explored in the first part of the questionnaire. Individual motivation factors were included in the second part. Through them we acquired general information relating to motivation. Respondents evaluated individual motivation factors by one of the five levels of importance. On the basis of sample sizes and their independence a two-sample t-test was used to evaluate the significance and F-test was used to test the variances. The null hypothesis about the equality of individual motivation factors was tested at the significance level alpha = 0.05. Significant differences were determined in the motivation factors, i.e. the opportunity to apply one's own ability, information about achieved performance results, moving up the corporate ladder, prestige, self-actualization, social benefits, mission of the company, education and personal growth, relation to the environment, recognition and basic salary. The result of the paper is the finding that despite the economic differences between countries the level of employee motivation of the studied subjects in Slovakia and in Austria is very similar. Therefore, the arrangement proposal for improvement in the area of employee motivation can be the same in both regions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Consequently, the primordial task the research and especially the specialists with expertise in economy and ecology have is the creation of a vision as widely accepted as possible on a sustainable society in the long run, which would be capable not just of offering prosperity in the conditions of significant biophysical constraints of the real world, in a way that would be correct and equitable, for as many as possible, namely for the largest part of the biosphere, starting from the human communities and ending with the most insignificant species, many of them not yet researched. A session on the competitiveness of the forestry sector examined the actual contribution of the wood and other forest products to the European economy and employment, on examples coming from France, Romania and the United Kingdom. The conclusion showed that this competitiveness encourages managerial innovation, stimulates the formation of partnerships and lies at the basis of the common efforts of making the forest economically and ecologically viable and that the consolidation of the capabilities is an essential factor for success. The participants continued by examining the need for efficient supply chains and the local forest-related governance strategies from different areas. This session clearly highlighted the fact that, in order to be able to contribute to the socioeconomic development of the rural areas, the rural companies in charge with wood collection need price policies that have to adapt to the conditions of the local market. Sustainable forest exploitations occupy an important place in the future of the common agricultural policy and someday the support offered to the forest by the European Union in the long run should focus more on the adoption of sustainable production methods able to reconcile the economic, social and environmental interests.

In the present paper, we propose a model of Games theory, where players are the teacher and the student. The purpose of this model is to theoretically demonstrate how those two educational actors reach an agreement, regarding the decisions they will make in terms of pupil evaluation by the teacher.","[Manolescu, Marin; Talvan, Magdalena] Univ Bucharest, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Bucharest, Romania",University of Bucharest,"Manolescu, M (通讯作者)，Univ Bucharest, Fac Psychol & Educ Sci, Bucharest, Romania.",manole_manolescu@yahoo.com; talvanmag@gmail.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,1,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,455,460,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900074,0

These variables were chosen due to their relevance for the transport industry and taking into account the fact that each country has its sustainability targets imposed by the European Union. Currently with the increasing freight and transport demand, the European Union is looking for better ways to facilitate transportation channels that are more eco-friendly and more efficient in terms of the energy consumption levels. Whether we consider, rail, road or air transport, sustainability is a key component that needs to be included in each country's infrastructure development strategy. There are three types of country clusters being analyzed using the mentioned variables and the key principles of the sustainability concept and several recommendations are highlighted were the ratio between cost structures, air pollution and sustainability targets is not very well balanced. The main idea of this comparative study is to assess what countries are similar to Romania in terms of the values of the sustainability transport indicators imposed by the European Union and to consider what initiatives those countries have taken in order to reach that particular level. Finally the authors propose several measures that Romania could reapply from other countries in order to achieve a sustainable development in transport.","[Marin, Georgiana; Mateiu, Alexandra] Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania",Bucharest University of Economic Studies,"Marin, G (通讯作者)，Bucharest Univ Econ Studies, Bucharest, Romania.",maringeorgiana57@yahoo.com; alexandra_mateiu@yahoo.com,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,4,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,479,484,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900078,0

Pairs of sites selected had similar annual rainfall totals but differed in mean annual temperature by 2-4 degrees C. For drier areas Chiredzi was hypothesised to represent Matobo, and for wetter areas Kadoma was hypothesized to represent Mazowe/Goromonzi 2050s climates. Differences in crop management strategies and gender issues vary across sites. At the drier analogue pair, higher proportions of households grew small grains in Chiredzi compared to Matobo. Implications are for increased uptake of small grains, in 2050s climates for Matobo farmers. Gender issues include labour for production and processing of the small grains, against a background of male labour migration. For wetter climates, soil and water management strategies are important options for smallholders. Accesses to draft power, labour, agricultural assets, social and financial capital in differently managed households are important for increasing adoption of effective crop management strategies.","[Musiyiwa, Kumbirai; Nyamangara, Justice] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Matopos Res Stn, POB 776, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe; [Filho, Walter Leal] Hamburg Univ Appl Sci, Fac Life Sci, D-21033 Hamburg, Germany; [Harris, David] Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Nairobi, Kenya",CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT); Hochschule Angewandte Wissenschaft Hamburg; CGIAR; International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid-Tropics (ICRISAT),"Musiyiwa, K (通讯作者)，Int Crops Res Inst Semi Arid Trop, Matopos Res Stn, POB 776, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.",kmusiyiwa2001@yahoo.com,"Leal, Walter/AAU-6997-2021; Leal, Walter/ACX-9082-2022; Nyamangara, Justice/HFZ-7630-2022","Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Leal, Walter/0000-0002-1241-5225; Nyamangara, Justice/0000-0002-5249-7747",,,,,17,6,7,0,9,SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, D-14197 BERLIN, GERMANY",1610-2010,,978-3-319-13000-2; 978-3-319-12999-0,CLIM CHANG MANAG,,,2015,,,,,,,109,117,,10.1007/978-3-319-13000-2_9,0.0,,,9,"Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agriculture, Multidisciplinary; Environmental Studies",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,BF2JL,,Green Accepted,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000380473000009,0

This study addresses this question by examining the relative potential of private and public compensation. We conduct a Choice Experiment (CE) that investigates household preferences of compensation for the local siting of a hypothetical wind park. Households chose among different alternatives, where each alternative was characterized by three varying attributes: the number of turbines, the level of private compensation, and the level of public compensation. Results indicate the wind park imposes welfare losses to local residents and non-local recreational users, with about 35% of these losses corresponding to non-use values. Findings show that households prefer public compensation to private compensation, with household's willingness to accept being lower with public compensation than private compensation. This finding suggests that estimates of local resistance to wind development depends on the compensation mechanism. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Case-specific insights show the key role that modern uses of energy and modern agricultural technologies could play in increasing productivity and revenues, in minimizing environmental degradation, and in promoting local development. Generalizable insights demonstrate the value of using sector-specific micro-structural frameworks and scenario analysis for assessing different technologies mixes in the energy and agriculture planning process.

Economically, they are highly dependent on international trade; they have limited domestic markets, too small to provide significant scale economies; their exports are constraint by their isolation and remote location. We provide an overview of current energy situation in SIDS, their goals to adopt low carbon economic development paths, policies already in place or required to achieve the goals and challenges to implement their plans and strategies. The focus is on energy policy landscape that needs to be addressed in order to scale-up renewable energy technologies needed to stimulate low carbon economic growth. We find that SIDS face four key barriers to renewable energy development: information to improve the energy information network by strengthening existing information systems and building awareness of renewable energy; financing mechanisms for renewable energy projects, including regional loan structures and technical assistance to banks; policy supports to implement regulatory frameworks that enable renewable energy development; and building technical capacity among players in the renewable energy field.

In this paper, we present a mechanism for bridging the gap between individual agency and regional outcomes of that agency in simulation. We use agents to develop very rich behavioral understanding of their surroundings in simulation. We then sweep through the information that agents generate when determining how to execute their transition rules, using schemes that mine agent states to produce mental maps of varied aspects of their dynamics. From agents' mental maps, we define and visualize regions as geographies that are conjured from the unique, autonomous, local, and personal insight that agents can provide. We demonstrate the utility of the scheme, with application to indoor movement scenarios in which fleeting regions form amid agents interactions with each other and their built surroundings. Our approach is extensible beyond these applications and could be of broader use for other explorative scenarios in regional science.","[Torrens, Paul M.] Univ Maryland, Geosimulat Res Lab, Inst Adv Comp Studies UMIACS, Dept Geog Sci,Ctr Geospatial Informat Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Torrens, PM (通讯作者)，Univ Maryland, Geosimulat Res Lab, Inst Adv Comp Studies UMIACS, Dept Geog Sci,Ctr Geospatial Informat Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",torrens@geosimulation.com,,,"National Science Foundation [1340984, 1343123, 1441177]; Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) [1340984] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities [1664275, 1441177] Funding Source: National Science Foundation; Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie [1343123] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Computer & Info Scie & Enginr; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC)(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering (CISE)); Directorate For Engineering; Emerging Frontiers & Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Engineering (ENG)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO)); Divn Of Social and Economic Sciences; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","This material is based in part upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers 1340984, 1343123, and 1441177.

The hydrologic and economic components of these impacts require complex models to reflect both the environment's physical and individuals' behavioral responses to climate change. This paper describes a model that combines the strengths of the State Wide Economic Agricultural Production Model (SWAP), an agricultural economic optimization model, and Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP), a climate-driven hydrological model. A step function approximation of water demand curves from SWAP is used in an iterative search process to estimate crop land allocation based on annual regional water availability and economic value. SWAP value functions serve as input for an optimal discretization of water demand functions. The methodological integration of the SWAP and WEAP models creates the EconWEAP model. This paper shows the improved analytic ability of this integration by comparing agricultural revenues from WEAP vs. EconWEAP. Results for EconWEAP runs in the California's Central Valley show a significant increase in revenues for the Central Valley, maintaining the same hydrology, through the economically optimal allocation of water. This integration approach can be applied to other types of economic and hydrologic models.","[Howitt, Richard] Univ Calif Davis, Agr & Resource Econ, Davis, CA USA; [Forni, Laura G.; Young, Charles; Purkey, David] Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA 02144 USA; [Medellin-Azuara, Josue] Univ Calif Davis, Civil & Environm Engn, Davis, CA USA; [Tansey, Michael] US Bur Reclamat, Washington, DC 20240 USA",University of California System; University of California Davis; University of California System; University of California Davis,"Forni, LG (通讯作者)，Stockholm Environm Inst, Somerville, MA 02144 USA.",Laura.forni@sei-us.org,"Medellin-Azuara, Josue/AAH-4059-2020","Medellin-Azuara, Josue/0000-0003-1379-2257",US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) [R11PX20186],US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR),This study was funded in part by US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) under Contract R11PX20186.

Based on the statistical simulation model by Araar and Verme (2012), this study estimates the regional variability of direct welfare effects of removing fuel subsidies in Nigeria. Uncompensated subsidy removal is estimated to increase the national poverty rate by 3-4% on average. However, uniform cash compensation that appears effective at the national average, is found to fail to mitigate price shocks in 16 of 37 states thus putting livelihoods (and public support for reforms) at risk. States that are estimated to incur the largest welfare shocks, coincide with hotspots of civil unrest following Nigeria's 2012 subsidy reform attempt. The study illustrates how regionally disaggregated compensation can be revenue neutral, and maintain or reduce pre-reform poverty rates in all states. Overall, it highlights the importance of understanding differences in vulnerability, and designing tailored social protection schemes which ensure public support for subsidy reforms.

Nowadays, a significant and increasing segment of generation is renewable. But renewable production cannot be scheduled on request since its generation is dependent on nature (wind, sun, ...). In this context, demand-side management (DSM) would help since it would be advisable for part of the flexibility to be provided by the demand. The integration of renewable production and demand-side management (DSM), are compared in this work for Spain throughout 2008-2014. First a qualitative model, based on the linearization of the wholesale market, is employed to explore some hypotheses. A set of scenarios are then examined to quantify the main effects on the market. The results show that DSM exhibits the best performance in terms of economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, as well as for the reduction of load peaks and losses in the system, what suggests the convenience of promoting plans for the replacement of equipment with other more efficient as well as the implementation of real-time tariffs.

Environmental Protection Agency regulations will likely lead to the retrofit, retirement, or replacement of coal-fired power plants while the state Renewable Portfolio Standards will continue to drive large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources, primarily wind. Combined, these changes in the generation fleet could have profound implications for the operations of the power system. In this paper, we aim to better understand the interaction between coal plant retirements and increased levels of wind power. We extensively analyze the operations of the PJM electricity system under a broad set of scenarios that include varying levels of wind penetration and coal plant retirements. Not surprisingly, we find that without transmission upgrades, retirement of coal-fired power plants will likely result in considerable transmission congestion and higher energy prices. Increased wind penetration, with high geographic diversity, could mitigate some of the negative effects of coal plant retirement and lead to a significant reduction in air emissions, but wind forecast error might impose operational constraints on the system at times of peak load.

The effectiveness of the downstream FIT policy has attracted the attention of academia and government. Using the quarterly data of listed solar PV companies between 2009 and 2015, this paper provides an empirical analysis regarding the effects of the downstream FIT policy. We find that (1) the FIT policy has significantly enhanced the inventory turnover of listed PV firms and improved their profitability; (2) the FIT policy has significant effects on the inventory turnover of midstream companies and mixed industry-chain companies mainly engaged in downstream operations; (3) FIT policy is more favorable towards increasing the inventory turnover of private enterprises.

Primary data from this fleet is used to construct a Life Cycle Cost (LCC) model, providing an empirical LCC result. The model is then used to forecast possible scenarios using cost estimates for next generation technologies. The methodology follows the Australian/New Zealand Standard for Life Cycle Costing, AS/NZS 4536:1999. The model outputs a dollar value in real terms that represents the LCC of each bus transportation technology. The study finds that Diesel buses deliver the lowest Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). The diesel-electric hybrid bus was found to have a TCO that is about 10% higher than conventional diesel. The premium to implement and operate a hydrogen bus, even if industry targets are attained, is still substantially greater than the TCO of a conventional diesel bus, unless a very large increase in the diesel fuel price occurs. However, the hybrid and hydrogen technologies are still very young in comparison to diesel and economies of scale are yet to be realised. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Since public opinion affects the policy choices of government, we investigate how arguments regarding carbon offsetting's economic efficiency, effectiveness, and ethicality, which have been key points in the public debate, impact the public's preferences. We fielded an online framing experiment in the United States (N=995) to empirically identify how arguments for and against carbon offsetting influence public preferences for the inclusion of offsetting in national GHG mitigation policy. We find that the public's support for international offsetting increases and support for reductions at their source (i.e. within firms' own operations) diminishes when considerations of economic efficiency gains are at the forefront. Support for offsetting declines when individuals are confronted with arguments concerning its effectiveness and ethicality, which suggests that future policies will require clear standards of additionality in order to address these concerns. Moreover, we find that how carbon offsetting is framed matters even amongst climate skeptics and support could potentially be enhanced via improved communication on efficiency gains.

These labels are self-created and closely related to the user's career status, life style, personal interests, and many others. Thus, they are of great interest for online marketing. To model their joint behavior with network structure, a complete data model is developed. The model is based on the classical p(1) model but allows the reciprocation parameter to be label-dependent. By focusing on connected pairs only, the complete data model can be generalized into a conditional model. Compared with the complete data model, the conditional model specifies only the conditional likelihood for the connected pairs. As a result, it suffers less risk from model misspecification. Furthermore, because the conditional model involves connected pairs only, the computational cost is much lower. The resulting estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. Depending on the network sparsity level, the convergence rate could be different. To demonstrate its finite sample performance, numerical studies (based on both simulated and real datasets) are presented.","[Huang, Danyang] Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Yin, Jun] Peking Univ, Sch Elect Engn & Comp Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shi, Tao] Ohio State Univ, Dept Stat, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Wang, Hansheng] Peking Univ, Guanghua Sch Management, Beijing, Peoples R China",Renmin University of China; Peking University; University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; Peking University,"Huang, DY (通讯作者)，Renmin Univ China, Sch Stat, Beijing, Peoples R China.",dyhuang89@126.com; cherry.yinjun@gmail.com; tao.shi.atwork@gmail.com; hansheng.wang@qq.com,,"Wang, Hansheng/0000-0003-2386-0209","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [11131002, 11271032]; Center for Statistical Science at Peking University; U.S. National Science Foundation [1007060]; Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences [1007060] Funding Source: National Science Foundation",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Center for Statistical Science at Peking University; U.S. National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Mathematical & Physical Scien; Division Of Mathematical Sciences(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS)),"This research is supported in part by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, 11131002, 11271032), the Center for Statistical Science at Peking University, and U.S. National Science Foundation (No. 1007060).",,15,8,9,4,38,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

The analysis confirms a city-wide employment density-wage elasticity and an economically significant density-wage elasticity at the neighbourhood level that attenuate sharply with distance. Panel estimates over 20 years suggest a neighbourhood density-wage elasticity of about 3%, while the city-wide elasticity is about 1%. It is argued that the neighbourhood level is more prone to capture learning, e.g. through knowledge and information spillovers. This interpretation is supported by (1) significantly larger neighbourhood elasticities for university educated workers and (2) sharper attenuation with distance of the effect for such workers.","[Andersson, Martin] Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; [Andersson, Martin] Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ, Lund, Sweden; [Klaesson, Johan; Larsson, Johan P.] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CEnSE, Gjuterigatan 5, SE-55318 Jonkoping, Sweden; [Larsson, Johan P.] Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Gjuterigatan 5, SE-55318 Jonkoping, Sweden",Lund University; Blekinge Institute Technology; Jonkoping University; Jonkoping University,"Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, Ctr Innovat Res & Competence Learning Econ, Box 118, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden.;Andersson, M (通讯作者)，Blekinge Inst Technol, Dept Ind Econ, Lund, Sweden.;Klaesson, J; Larsson, JP (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, CEnSE, Gjuterigatan 5, SE-55318 Jonkoping, Sweden.;Larsson, JP (通讯作者)，Jonkoping Int Business Sch, Swedish Entrepreneurship Forum, Gjuterigatan 5, SE-55318 Jonkoping, Sweden.",martin.andersson@circle.lu.se; johan.klaesson@jibs.hj.se; johan.p.larsson@jibs.hj.se,"Andersson, Martin/AAB-5164-2021","Klaesson, Johan/0000-0001-8752-0428; Larsson, Johan P./0000-0001-7432-7442","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [2011-80]; Swedish Research Council [349200680]; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [2010-07370]","Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS)(Swedish Research Council Formas); Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems(Vinnova)","This research was supported by a financial grant from the Swedish Research Council for Environment, Agricultural Sciences and Spatial Planning (FORMAS) [grant number 2011-80].

To overcome this endogeneity problem, we take advantage of jumps in the marginal income tax rate, which is a regression discontinuity (RD) idea. This RD, in turn, makes the average income tax rate kink-continuous', which is a regression kink (RK) idea. We provide a simple economic model resulting in the RD and RK features, explain how to implement RK in practice, and then apply our methods to Korean male data. Our main RK-based labour supply elasticity estimate 7.16% turned out to be insignificant with t-value 1.52, but it is much larger than most estimates in the literature. This may be attributed to, among other things, the facts that the RK instrument is unique, that RK identifies only the local elasticity at the kink point and that RK requires large data as regression derivatives are estimated.","[Kim, Young-sook] Korean Womens Dev Inst, Seoul 122707, South Korea; [Lee, Myoung-jae] Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea",Korea University,"Kim, YS (通讯作者)，Korean Womens Dev Inst, Seoul 122707, South Korea.;Lee, MJ (通讯作者)，Korea Univ, Dept Econ, Seoul 136701, South Korea.",youngkim@kwdimail.re.kr; myoungjae@korea.ac.kr,,"Lee, Myoung-jae/0000-0002-3935-7491",National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government [NRF-2014S1A2A2027803],National Research Foundation of Korea Grant - Korean Government,"The authors are grateful to the Editor and anonymous reviewers for their detailed comments.

It distinguishes three modes of electricity performance: a) net generation per capita, b) installed capacity and c) labour productivity. The empirical model spans the period 1975-2011 and uses panel data econometric techniques. Our analysis reveals that there is a strongly significant interaction impact on the level of electricity performance between regulation and competition. The empirical findings do confirm that a robust independent regulatory scheme must be implemented in order to achieve a competitive electricity market. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

As such, these models pool the annual stored precipitation plus other water supplies and assume that this total water supply can be allocated by time and place. This water pooling approach treats precipitation and irrigation water as fully substitutable. In many irrigated areas, however, a significant amount of water used by crops comes from precipitation. In fact the majority of the global irrigation systems are supplemental to rainfall and, in this context, precipitation and water stored in reservoirs are not fully substitutable. By using primary data from a watershed in Brazil, where precipitation and supplemental water use occur, this paper shows that standard models under-estimate the predicted drought impacts. The paper investigates this issue by setting up two model specifications of regional net-revenue maximization based on a calibrated economic programming model integrated with a mass balance hydrologic model. In one model the substitution between precipitation and irrigation water is explicitly formalized and in the other precipitation and irrigation water are aggregated together in a single water supply. The models are used to estimate and predict the short-run impacts of precipitation cuts on irrigation reservoir levels and the impacts of lower irrigation water supply on farmers' agricultural income. In comparing the results, we find that the standard aggregated hydroeconomic model under-estimates losses in expected returns to farmers and also results in less variability of returns under stochastic rainfall.

In theory, high-powered incentive regulation, such as revenue-caps, induces firms to cost-efficient behavior independent of underlying model. However, anecdotal evidence shows regulated firms occasionally maintaining cost-inefficiency under incentive regulation even under slumping profitability. We present a model for firm-level efficiency under a regime with a probability of failure explaining this phenomenon. The model is based on the hypothesis that the regulatory choice of method can be associated with intrinsic flaws leading to judicial repeal and replacement of it by a low powered regime. The results show that the cost efficiency policy is proportional to the type of firm (cost of effort), value of time (discount factor) and the credibility of the method (risk of failure). A panel data set for 2000-2006 for 128 electricity distributors in Sweden is used to validate the model predictions (radical productivity slowdown, failing profitability and efficiency) at the launch and demise of a non credible regulation method. The work highlights the fallacy of viewing incentive regulation as a method independent instrument, a result applicable in any infrastructure regulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary data for calculating originated from the database of the Information System of the Green Savings Programme by the State Environmental Fund of the Czech Republic. The calculated value of abatement cost was between 12 (heat pumps and biomass boilers) and 272 (sic) t CO2-1(low-energy houses). The shortest payback time-periods were calculated for insulation at 11.2 and 3.8 years respectively, without and including the provided subsidy.

We argue that the informal recruitment channel may increase job-education mismatches both directly (by inducing some workers to undertake careers in industries, professions, or firms where their comparative productive advantage is not fully exploited) and indirectly by negatively affecting spatial flexibility. In order to test these hypotheses, we estimate probit models with self-selection using ISFOL Plus survey data providing information on labour market entry channels, job-related migration and a subjective measure of overeducation. We find a robust positive impact of the use of the informal channel on overeducation and a robust negative effect of the use of this channel on migration. On the other hand, we find that migration reduces overeducation only in some geographical areas of the Italian territory. Overall, these findings suggest that a reform of employment services in Italy is needed in order to favour spatial flexibility, reduce the use of the informal channel and enhance the quality of job-education matches.","[Meliciani, Valentina] Univ Luiss Guido Carli, Dept Business & Management, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy; [Radicchia, Debora] ISFOL, Inst Dev Vocat Training Workers & Social Policies, Corso Italia 33, I-00197 Rome, Italy",Luiss Guido Carli University,"Meliciani, V (通讯作者)，Univ Luiss Guido Carli, Dept Business & Management, Viale Romania 32, I-00197 Rome, Italy.",vmeliciani@luiss.it; d.radicchia@isfol.it,,,,,,,33,10,10,0,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This study assesses the extent and severity of fuel poverty in Vermont. It analyzes energy burdens in Vermont by household income deciles, using data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. Approximately 71,000 people suffered from fuel poverty in Vermont in 2000, and in 2012 the number rose to 125,000, or one in five Vermonters. Startlingly, fuel poverty grew 76 percent during this period. Excess winter deaths, caused potentially by fuel poverty, kill more Vermonters each year than car crashes. The article then provides 12 policy recommendations based on a small sample of elite semi-structured research interviews. These include suggestions that the Vermont legislature better fund investments in weatherization among low-income households; that community groups and social service agencies scale up the training of energy efficiency coaches; that state agencies endorse improvements in housing efficiency and appropriate fuel switching; and that utilities and fuel providers offer extra assistance for disconnected households and allow for on-bill financing of efficiency improvements.

We contribute to the literature by including a knock-out barrier option in an n-fold compound real option model to take account of immediate project failure in a multi-stage sequential investment project. Our model allows to explicitly incorporate the default possibility of large-scale energy infrastructure projects. In our case study of hydrogen infrastructure development, we find that even for the least conservative valuation method no profitable business case can be made for the development of hydrogen as a sustainable transportation mode. However, we do provide some suggestive scenarios that plausible tax schedules can be designed to overcome the starting problems for hydrogen infrastructure development. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Population dynamics and regional social security sustainability in Italy, Regional Studies. Making due allowances for differences in demographics, the labour market and internal migration dynamics, this study analyses the sustainability of the Italian pension balance at a regional level. A worsening of the elderly dependency ratio and a decline in birth and employment rates have generated a negative trend, particularly for regions in southern Italy, characterized by early retirement and an increase in migration outflows. The suggestion is that a decentralized pension policy is not a Pareto- efficient solution because it would favour the sustainability of the pension balance in northern regions over those in the South.","[Bonasia, Mariangela; De Siano, Rita] Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Business, I-80132 Naples, Italy; [Bonasia, Mariangela; De Siano, Rita] Univ Naples Parthenope, CRISEI, I-80132 Naples, Italy",Parthenope University Naples; Parthenope University Naples,"Bonasia, M (通讯作者)，Univ Naples Parthenope, Dept Econ & Business, Via G Parisi 13, I-80132 Naples, Italy.",mariangela.bonasia@uniparthenope.it; desiano@uniparthenope.it,"De Siano, Rita/AAE-7184-2021",,,,,,41,3,4,1,27,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, many un-electrified communities would prefer access to electricity via the national grid rather than off-grid technologies. Electricity planning based on cost efficiency alone could therefore be undermined by political pressure from discontented communities that are assigned off-grid technologies. Using a case study of un-electrified communities in Ghana, we develop an electricity planning algorithm based on hierarchical lexicographic programming and consider specifications where the priorities are adjusted to give weight to (1) cost efficiency and (2) political economy considerations so that communities with larger populations (and therefore votes) are given priority in terms of grid electrification. The results emphasise the need to incorporate the political economy considerations in the national planning of universal electrification, showing significant regional differences in terms of where grid extensions ought to be placed. Incorporating a political economy perspective in national planning also suggests that the most important policy trade-offs shift from considering the grid versus off-grid balance to focussing more on the effectiveness of grid investment in providing universal access.

It is examined the significant role of social media, the use and the rise of social networks. The use of social media marketing represents a strong factor in developing a CRM strategy. CRM considers the client the center of a business and orientates the marketing policy in this direction. Based on case studies and questionnaires, this article analyzes the necessity of transition from traditional CRM to social CRM. Although social CRM is a relatively new domain, the researchers are very interested in how CRM can emerge with social media. The study emphasizes examples of how companies can benefit from the use of social media, growing sales and profitability, creating advertisements, acquiring new customers, retaining them and make them loyal. Organizations should adapt to the rise of this new trend - social media. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, focusing on the overall road network structure of the community and its surrounding area before and after the community opening, we establish the Variable Cell Transmission Model (VCTM model). In this model, the roads will be segmented and a new concept--traffic flow is proposed based on the transfer characteristics of cellular. Furthermore, we characterize the road traffic capacity by means of three traffic flow state evaluation indexes which are the average travel speed, the traffic impedance and the congestion delay. Secondly, with the help of MATLAB, we abstract the target community network structure into a complex network model, and then by inputting the three description parameters, namely the degree distribution, the average path length and the clustering coefficient into VCTM model and using the VISSIM software for simulation, we get the output of the three traffic flow state evaluation indexes, thus establishing the community vehicle traffic model. Then, corresponding to the road network structures of different communities and their different surrounding environments, five complex network models are constructed, which are respectively named the closed community model, the regular network model, the random network model, the small world network and the scale-free network model. Among those models, the closed community model corresponds to the community opening anterior network structure and the other 4 characterize the road network structures after the opening of community. By inputting the 5 kinds of complex network traffic model into the community vehicle traffic model, we can quantitatively compare the effects of the opening of different types of residential area on the road traffic according to the results of the model. the influence of the opening and the opening of each type on the road traffic was quantitatively compared. Through analysis, we can get that the regular network model traffic carrying capacity is the worst, while the scale-free network traffic carrying capacity optimal. Finally, through the comparison and analysis of the above results, we get the effects of the opening of different types of community on the road network structures and the road traffic capacity. Based on the results we have got, we put forward several rationalization proposals about the community opening to the urban planning and traffic management department.","[Feng, Shi] North China Elect Power Univ, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China",North China Electric Power University,"Feng, S (通讯作者)，North China Elect Power Univ, Baoding 071000, Peoples R China.",1361214913@qq.com,,,,,,,7,0,0,0,5,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",2352-5398,,978-94-6252-288-6,ADV SOC SCI EDUC HUM,,,2016,87.0,,,,,,785,787,,,,,,3,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8WB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392733200162,0

Thus far, the phenomenon of digital shadow economy has not been universally defined either by scientists or by institutions responsible for the combat with shadow economy. Traditional shadow economy is commonly estimated applying direct and indirect methods possessing their strengths and weaknesses. As a result, final estimations of shadow economies are rather variant. For instance, with reference to Schneider (2014), the scope of shadow economy in Lithuania achieved 27 per cent rate in 2014 whereas the figure estimated by Lithuanian Department of Statistics composed 15 per cent rate. It can be presumed that the divergence of the results has been determined by application of different shadow economy estimation methods. The interviews with the experts of shadow economy have revealed that although the volumes of e-trade and e-transactions are increasing, indicators of digital shadow are not still included in the estimations of shadow economy.

Using bothGIS and statistical analysis at the block group level, we confirm the presence of inner-city cold spots in both cities using statistical measures. We also find that both bank density and distance are significantly correlated with income and other demographic and economic variables. Statistical tests show that banking deserts are poorer and less white than other block groups. Regression analysis shows that for Buffalo, but not Milwaukee, the number of banks in an area is significantly related to income, distance from the CBD, and population density; the vacancy rate is significant while racial makeup is not.","[Hegerty, Scott W.] NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60625 USA",,"Hegerty, SW (通讯作者)，NE Illinois Univ, Dept Econ, Chicago, IL 60625 USA.",S-Hegerty@neiu.edu,"Hegerty, Scott/AAF-5659-2020","Hegerty, Scott William/0000-0002-0999-561X",,,,,16,28,32,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Under these circumstances, new water allocation mechanisms based on the involvement of stakeholders are needed, for an efficient and fair allocation of water and income among users. This paper develops a cooperative game theory framework in order to analyze water management policies that could address scarcity and drought in a typical arid and semiarid basin in Southeastern Spain. The results provide clear evidence that achieving cooperation reduces drought damage costs. However, cooperation may have to be regulated by public agencies, such as a basin authority, when scarcity is very high, in order to protect ecosystems and maintain economic benefits. The cooperative game theory solutions and stability indexes examined in this paper demonstrate the importance of incorporating the strategic behavior of water stakeholders in the design of acceptable and stable basin-wide drought mitigation policies.

Russian and European approaches to the agricultural university education are different but have a lot of similarities. According to leading ratings authors chose top ten agrarian universities of Russia and Europe, analyzed their system of quality assurance. As a result there are five most popular instruments of quality assurance in agricultural university education of Russia and Europe: licensing; governmental accreditation; certification according to ISO 9001, ESG; rating among agricultural universities; public accreditation. In conclusion authors proposed to create an Agriculture Employers Union, aggregated organizations from different fields of agriculture. It can work out requirements for graduates of agricultural universities and accredit educational organizations.

This has raised concerns about national air quality, considering the serious air pollution associated with the long-range transport of Chinese air pollutants. In the present study, we simulated air pollution levels for 2027 considering the changes in electricity power plants of South Korea proposed by the sixth Basic Plan for Long-Term Electricity Supply and Demand (6th BPE, 2013-2027). Compared to the emissions in 2010, the emissions of CO, NOx, SOx, and PM10 from electricity supply in the Incheon, Gyunggi, Gangwon, Chungnam, and Gyeongnam regions will increase by 20-50% in 2027. The resulting number of days on which pollution levels exceeded the national air quality standards for 03 and PM10 will increase by fewer than 6 days in all regions, which seems to be a minor increase. However, that of NO2 over the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA, including Incheon, part of Gyunggi, and Seoul) showed a marked increase of more than 21 days. Therefore, an impact from secondary air pollution, such as acid rain and PM2.5 formation, can be expected, although this requires quantification. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The data were collected through eye tracking using the SMI RED 250 device. In-depth interviews were used to acquire a more detailed understanding of the opinion of the respondents. The research was conducted during December 2014 and January 2015 in the Eye Tracking Laboratory at Mendel University. 35 respondents representing generation Y were involved in this research. The main objective was to determine their attention to product placement, brand recall and their attitudes to product placement. Several parts of movies and TV shows were shown to the participants and their attention was measured through the eye tracker. Although the viewers looked at the products, they often were not able to recall them afterwards. The brand recall was higher when they were familiar with the brand. The results show that the audience is more strongly affected by prominent product placement than by subtle placement. The audience is able to remember an audio-visual product placement better than an audio or visual placement. Men are more sensitive to product placement related to male product categories (cars, alcohol and sexual health products). Women on the other hand are more sensitive to product placement related to fashion products.","[Slovackova, Tereza; Soucek, Martin] Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Slovácková, T (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Business & Econ, Zemedelska 1, Brno, Czech Republic.",xslovack@mendelu.cz; martin.soucek@mendelu.cz,,,,,,,13,0,0,1,16,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,874,884,,10.15414/isd2016.s11.03,0.0,,,11,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500105,0

Therefore, each year flows into the agricultural sector in the EU countries huge amounts of money. Analysed period of 1999 - 2009 has been divided into two equally long period of time, in the middle of which the Slovak Republic entered the EU and the agrarian policy has changed from purely national to the EU common agricultural policy (Cap). Important reform of the CAP in 2003 was the Fischler reform, by which the single payments decoupled from production and began to provide per hectare of agricultural land. In this paper, we explore how our entry into the EU has been translated into the economy of the selected commodity (wheat) and how the support effected the rate of profitability and the economic income result during this period. For the assessment of the production of wheat, we used indicators such as the yield per hectare, the total and the unit costs, prices, total support. Two indicators have been chosen of the cost-profitability: profitability without support and profitability with the support and the hypothesis was set, by which we explore the development of these indicators per production areas that we divide on less-favoured and favoured. By the hypothesis we verify whether selected indicators confirm the natural expectation that in the better production areas will be achieved their more favourable values. Thanks to the subsidies the economic income results in I. and also in the II. period got from the negative values only to a positive outcome.","[Urbanova, Maria] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Urbánová, M (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Management, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra 94976, Slovakia.",urbanovam@uniag.sk,"Urbanova, Maria/F-6826-2019","Urbanova, Maria/0000-0003-4281-7329",,,,,12,0,0,0,2,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,83,91,,10.15414/isd2016.s1.08,0.0,,,9,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500009,0

Based on theories that highlight the importance of democracy and institutional quality for provision of public goods, the aim of the paper is to analyse the degree to which the level of per capita household electricity consumption in African countries can be attributed to the countries' democratic status and their institutional quality. We rely on regression analysis employing a pooled data set for 44 African countries over the time period 1996-2009. The analysis shows that democracy and institutional quality both have significant positive effects on per capita household consumption of electricity. Our results have implications for how energy sector reforms are promoted in developing countries.

I use Indian data on rural micro enterprises employing less than ten workers in the manufacturing sector to find that trade liberalization, measured by a fall in the tariff, is associated with a larger increase or a smaller decrease in output, capital-labour ratio and labour productivity in districts with a larger number of bank branches per capita. Evidence is consistent with strong complementarities between trade liberalization effects, and the economic dynamism and access to financial intermediation associated with greater bank presence in the enterprise's location. The study underscores that trade liberalization can be beneficial to micro entrepreneurs under certain conditions and emphasizes reallocation resulting from trade liberalization. The study hence highlights the role for development policy in exploiting gains from trade.","Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa",University of Cape Town,"Sundaram, A (通讯作者)，Univ Cape Town, Sch Econ, ZA-7701 Cape Town, South Africa.",asha.sundaram@uct.ac.za,"Sundaram, Asha/S-2694-2019","Sundaram, Asha/0000-0003-1864-8019",Goekjian fund,Goekjian fund,"I sincerely thank the two anonymous referees for their comments.

Several policies and reforms have been implemented by the government to address the poor performance of the power generation, transmission and distribution sectors of the electricity industry. Also various strategies were employed by the government which includes encouraging private sector participation, diversification of the energy generation sources and promoting energy efficiency for sustainable development. In addition the government has spent billions of dollars since 2001 in the construction of new power generation facilities, transmission lines and distribution centers to boost the power supply. It has deregulated the generation and distribution sectors to encourage private sector participation and empowers the Energy Commission of Nigeria to embark on programs and strategies that can boost energy generation from renewable sources.

This paper examines the influence of local technology leaders on the attractiveness of regions for inward research and development (R&D) investments in an analysis of location choices for 196 cross-border R&D investments in EU-15 countries, 2003-08. While the strength of the regional technology cluster attracts inward R&D investments, investors are discouraged by a concentration of technology activities due to the presence of regional technology leaders. This effect occurs primarily if leaders organize their R&D in the region to reduce knowledge outflows to collocated firms - by drawing on intra-firm cross-border knowledge flows and complementary contributions of multiple R&D units.","[Belderbos, Rene] Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-3000 Antwerp, Belgium; [Belderbos, Rene] UNU MERIT, Maastricht, Netherlands; [Belderbos, Rene] Maastricht Univ, Sch Business & Econ, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands; [Somers, Dieter] Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium",KU Leuven; Maastricht University; Maastricht University; KU Leuven,"Somers, D (通讯作者)，Univ Leuven, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Managerial Econ Strategy & Innovat, Campus Antwerp,Korte Nieuwstr 33, B-2000 Antwerp, Belgium.",Rene.belderbos@kuleuven.be; Dieter.somers@kuleuven.be,,,,,,,88,15,17,3,51,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

It then shows that there is no connection between distance to KIBS suppliers and propensity to innovate. These results point to a Christallerian logic whereby innovators seek out KIBS (irrespective of distance), but whereby mean distances tend to be greater between users and innovation-related KIBS suppliers (located in central places), reflecting the different geographies of manufacturing users and service suppliers.","[Shearmur, Richard] McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada; [Doloreux, David] Univ Ottawa, Telfer Sch Management, Ottawa, ON K1N 6N5, Canada; [Doloreux, David] KEDGE Business Sch, F-33405 Talence, France",McGill University; University of Ottawa; Kedge Business School,"Shearmur, R (通讯作者)，McGill Univ, Sch Urban Planning, 815 Sherbrooke West, Montreal, PQ H3A 2K6, Canada.",Richard.shearmur@mcgill.ca; David.doloreux@telfer.uottawa.ca,"Doloreux, David/Y-7368-2019","Doloreux, David/0000-0001-7101-2170",Industry Canada (Economic Development Canada); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada,Industry Canada (Economic Development Canada); Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC)),"This study was financed in part by Industry Canada (Economic Development Canada), and in part by two ordinary research grants from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada held, respectively, by Richard Shearmur and David Doloreux.",,49,42,45,5,92,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

EMI could be further extended with coordinated policies in carbon pricing, renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS), and feed-in-tariffs (FIT) in the ASEAN countries. Using a linear dynamic programming model, this study quantitatively assesses the impacts of EMI and the above-mentioned policies on the development of renewable energy in the power generation sector of the region, and the carbon emissions reduction achievable with these policies. According to our results, EMI is expected to significantly promote the adoption of renewable energy. Along with EMI, FIT appears to be more cost-effective than RPS and is recommended for the ASEAN region, albeit political barriers for policy coordination among the countries might be a practical concern. In addition, an RPS of 30% electricity from renewable sources by 2030, which is considered politically a low-hanging fruit, would achieve moderate improvements in carbon emissions reductions and renewable energy development, while incurring negligible increases in the total cost of electricity.

More specifically, it examines market integration before and after the closures of eight nuclear power plants that occurred within a period of a few months in Germany during 2011. The short- and- long run interrelationships of daily electricity spot prices, from November 2009 to October 2012, in: APX-ENDEX, BELPEX, EPEX-DE, EPEX-FR, NORDPOOL, OMEL and SWISSIX; and wind power in the German system are analysed. Two MGARCH (Multivariate Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity) models with dynamic correlations are used to assess spot market behaviour in the short run, and a fractional cointegration analysis is conducted to investigate changes in the long-run behaviour of electricity spot prices. Results show: positive time-varying correlations between spot prices in markets with substantial shared interconnector capacity; a negative association between wind power penetration in Germany and electricity spot prices in the German and neighbouring markets; and, for most markets, a decreasing speed in mean reversion.

This can cause them to submit offer curves closer to their marginal cost curves, which sets market-clearing prices closer to competitive benchmark price levels. These lower wholesale market-clearing prices are the competitiveness benefit consumers realize from the transmission expansion. This paper quantifies empirically the competitiveness benefits of a transmission expansion policy that causes strategic suppliers to expect no transmission congestion. Using hourly generation-unit level offer, output, market-clearing price and congestion data from the Alberta wholesale electricity market from January 1, 2009 to July 31, 2013, an upper and lower bound on the hourly consumer competitiveness benefits of this transmission policy is computed. Both of these competitiveness benefits measures are economically significant, which argues for including them in transmission planning processes for wholesale electricity markets to ensure that all transmission expansions with positive net benefits to electricity consumers are undertaken.

Quality of government and the returns of investment: examining the impact of cohesion expenditure in European regions, Regional Studies. This paper sets out to examine the relationship between the quality of local and regional governments and regional economic performance, linking government quality to the returns of European Union Structural and Cohesion Funds. Using primary data on government quality collected by the Quality of Government Institute, combined with World Bank Global Governance Indicators data, a two-way fixed effect panel regression model is conducted for a total of 169 European regions during the period 1996-2007. The results of the analysis underline the importance of government quality both as a direct determinant of economic growth as well as a moderator of the efficiency of Structural and Cohesion Funds expenditure. The analysis finds that both European Union investments targeting regions and quality of government simultaneously make a difference for regional economic growth, but that above a threshold of cohesion expenditure - calculated at more than Euro120 of cohesion expenditure per capita per year - government quality improvements are a far more important and realistic option for regional development than additional public investment. In many of the regions receiving the bulk of Structural Funds, further improvements in economic growth would require massive amounts of additional investment, unless the quality of government is significantly enhanced.","[Rodriguez-Pose, Andres] London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, London WC2A 2AE, England; [Garcilazo, Enrique] Directorate Publ Governance & Terr Dev OECD GOV, Reg Dev Policy Div, F-75775 Paris 16, France",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD),"Rodríguez-Pose, A (通讯作者)，London Sch Econ, Dept Geog & Environm, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",a.rodriguez-pose@lse.ac.uk,"Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/B-8746-2008","Rodríguez-Pose, Andrés/0000-0002-8041-0856",European Research Council under the European Union [269868]; European Research Council (ERC) [269868] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government),This paper would not have been possible without the financial support of the European Research Council under the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)/ERC [grant agreement number 269868].,,37,195,201,10,107,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Other estimators can be employed, such as the FM-OLS, that are root NT-consistent irrespective of whether exogeneity is present or not. Using the difference between the former and the latter estimator, we construct a test statistic which diverges at a rate root NT under the null of endogeneity, whilst it is bounded under the alternative of exogeneity, and employ a randomization approach to carry out the test.

In particular, the cap-and-trade mechanism has been regarded as an effective way to control emissions. This is a market-based approach focused on the efficient allocation of initial emissions allowances. Based on the grandfather allocation method, this paper develops an alternative method derived from Boltzmann distribution to calculate the allowances. Further, with fully considering the relationship between the regional authority, power plants and grid company, a three-level multi-objective model for carbon emission allowance allocations in the power-supply industry is presented. To achieve tripartite equilibrium, the impacts on electricity output, carbon emissions and carbon intensity of the allocation method, allocation cap, and emission limits are assessed. The results showed that the greatest impact was seen in the emission limits rather than the allocation cap or allocation method.

Public transportation has been argued as an alternative strategy for meeting the rising transportation demands of the growing world, especially the poor, in a sustainable and energy efficient way. The present study analyzes an important yet under-researched question - what are the long-term energy and emission implications of an electric rail based passenger transportation system for meeting both long and short distance passenter transportation needs? We analyze a suite of electric rail share scenarios with and without climate policy. In the reference scenario, the transportation system will evolve towards dominance of fossil based light-duty vehicles. We find that an electric rail policy is more successful than an economy wide climate policy in reducing transport sector energy demand and emissions. Economy wide emissions however can only be reduced through a broader climate policy, the cost of which can be reduced by hundreds of billions of dollars across the century when, implemented in combination with the transport sector focused electric rail policy. Moreover, higher share of electric rail enhances energy security for oil importing nations and reduces vehicular congestion and road infrastructure requirement as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This methodology allows for the formal analysis of the interactions among economic agents and, therefore, it is particularly useful for the study of economic decisions regarding spatial issues. For this reason, a quantitative systematization of the use of this tool on regional economics research is a relevant topic in the agenda concerned with progress in regional science. In this paper we study research in regional economics and provide a quantitative retrospective of the use of game theory in this field. Our main goal is twofold. First, we intend to categorize the contributions in the use of this analytical tool - by main research subjects, by authors' affiliations, by journal, etc. - using a bibliometric approach. Second, by analysing co-authoring and using social network analysis, we want to test the existence of structures of knowledge upon which distinct co-authorship emerges. The results of this research provide a framework for analysing the potential use of game theory in regional economics, suggesting new future research directions.","[Silva, Sandra T.] Fundacao Univ Porto, Fac Econ, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal; CEF UP, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal",Universidade do Porto,"Silva, ST (通讯作者)，Fundacao Univ Porto, Fac Econ, Rua Dr Roberto Frias, P-4200464 Oporto, Portugal.",sandras@fep.up.pt; imota@fep.up.pt; 100421007@fep.up.pt,"Silva, Sandra T./M-9110-2019","Silva, Sandra T./0000-0002-8843-3999; Grilo, Filipe/0000-0002-6558-7573; Mota, Isabel/0000-0001-6101-8261",Portuguese 'Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia',Portuguese 'Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia'(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),CEF.UP is funded by the Portuguese 'Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia'.,,52,4,5,1,50,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

Insights on cost reductions are obtained from a detailed stakeholder survey conducted amongst the European wind power industry in 2012. Overall, a rather more optimistic view of the scope for cost reductions in offshore technology is presented than has previously been evident in empirical analysis. From the analysis we conclude that the wind power industry has experienced a decoupling process of the offshore supply chain from its onshore counterpart with diverging technological requirements. For policy-makers, it is essential to acknowledge that barriers to adoption and the consequent needs for subsidies among the players in the onshore and offshore supply chains seem to differ, and that a micro-level analysis of the innovations and risks involved at the various stages in the supply chain is necessary.

Our constructed simultaneous confidence band can be used to address important hypothesis testing problems, such as whether the local autocorrelation process is indeed time-varying and whether the local autocorrelation is zero. In particular, our result provides an important generalization of the R function acf()to locally stationary Gaussian processes. Simulation studies and two empirical applications are developed. For the global temperature series, we find that the local autocorrelations are time-varying and have a V shape during 1910-1960.

In this paper, we use both weekly national and daily city-specific (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne) data to investigate the extent to which retail fuel prices in Germany adjust to changes in the international crude oil price. At the national level with weekly prices, we find positive asymmetries for both gasoline and diesel within the period 20032007, reflecting that retail prices react more swiftly to crude oil price increases than decreases. In contrast, for 2009-2013, we observe symmetric adjustment and negative asymmetry for retail diesel and gasoline prices, respectively. The city level analysis supports our findings in the latter time period. Thus, regulatory measures aimed at the retail fuel market over recent years seem to have been effective, and, contrary to consumers' perception, we find no evidence for excessive market power or collusion.

Approximately 43% of the Park is publically owned and protected to remain forever wild. Despite regulatory measures aimed at protecting the natural resources of the Adirondacks, surface water quality is threatened by acid and mercury deposition. This paper uses data on 12,001 property transactions over 9 years in the 12 counties that comprise the Adirondack Park to explore how property owners value lake water quality using fixed effects hedonic analysis. We find that multiple measures of water quality have significant effects on property values including lake acidity, the presence of water milfoil, an invasive species, and the presence of loons, an indicator species. This research provides valuable insight into how water quality and associated ecosystem health are capitalized into property values. Moreover, this research helps partially quantify air pollution impacts on Adirondack property values and could be used to justify additional regulations to further restrict sulfur and mercury emissions which are negatively impacting the Park.

The currency is regarded as a superior medium of exchange for conducting underground transactions. The paper aims to estimate the size of informal economy using Gutmann approach for quarterly data covering the period 2000-2014. Thus, the study analyzes the ratio of currency to overnight deposits in order to estimate the amount of informal sector. The main idea behind this approach is that a rise in currency stocks and payments is likely a good indicator of transactions which are not reported to the government authorities. The method requires the choice of a base period where the ratio of currency in circulation to overnight deposits is minimum, and the empirical results are fairly sensitive to the choice. The empirical results pointed out that the ratio of underground economy to official economy reaches the value of 19% at the beginning of 2000 and follows a decreasing trend during the period 2000-2008.

A panel data regression is employed in order to explore the influence of selected determinants. The theoretical factors at companies' level and market determinants are taken into consideration - leverage, liquidity, equity volatility, risk free interest rate, slope of term structure, market return and market volatility. The role of observed variables is investigated in three periods - before, during and after the financial crisis and within the individual rating groups. The results are consistent with theoretical assumptions in most of the cases. The theoretical determinants have an explanatory power, but the power of individual variables was different in the particular periods.

The paper asserts that the strike activity was concentrated in specific regions and sectors. It presents indicators of the number of strikers relative to the number of workers employed across all sectors during this period, and thus underlines the undeniable impact of the conflict in manufacturing and, especially, the textile industry. Next, it attempts an analysis of these industrial disputes through the study of three components: business structure and the markets, the growth of unionism, and the interventionism of the state. The complex interaction of these factors led to extensive conflict in the textile industry, which ultimately provoked significant changes in working conditions in the sector.","Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain",Universidad de Cadiz,"Primicia, EM (通讯作者)，Univ Cadiz, Cadiz, Spain.",,,,,,,,55,1,1,0,3,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The paper shows how Catalan cotton textile producers faced the hard and changing circumstances that the country went through during the period 1780-1840. Three different periods have been established according the origins of the raw cotton marked in Barcelona. First, during the last two decades of the 18th century, spun cotton coming from Malta was progressively substituted by raw cotton coming from the American Spanish Colonies. The second one lasted from 1797-1814 and in this period a diversification process took place with the arrival of Brazilian and Motril cottons. Finally, after the Spanish War against Napoleon, raw cotton coming from the USA gradually became the main sort traded on the Barcelona market, especially after 1830.","[Sanchez, Alex] Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Barcelona, Spain; Univ Barcelona, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Sánchez, A (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Ctr Estudis Antoni de Capmany, Barcelona, Spain.",,"Valls-Junyent, Francesc/H-2052-2015; Sánchez, Alex/H-4198-2015",,,,,,48,3,3,0,2,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The most dramatic changes with respect to energy policies have occurred as a response to nuclear accidents, yet the accidental and unintended effects of coal policies are also important in influencing the trajectory. The newly emerging climate debate prevented the coal industry from acting as a substitute for the diminishing share of nuclear power. In 2011 the conservative government announced the Energiewende ('energy transformation') and decided to reduce the amount of fossil fuels from 80% of the energy supply to 20% by 2050. However, while the verdict on nuclear was unequivocal with a final phase-out date of 2022, the share of coal in the electricity market did not decrease and the amount of carbon dioxide released into the air slightly increased from 2011 to 2013. There are growing conflicts over the immediate costs and practicalities of coal replacement. Consequently, the future of coal in Germany is still relatively open and contested.

We find that varying the dynamics of agent interaction causes the emergence of differential degree distributions as well as nonlinear dynamics in social and spatial inequalities. The scale-free property of degree connectivity vanishes when tie formation dominates tie dissolution, with power laws re-emerging when tie dissolution is of equal strength or stronger than tie formation. Furthermore, we find a nonlinear relationship between network density and agent inequality in social resources. In particular, multiple phase transitions occur where the relationship is positive in one phase but negative in another. This suggests that, contrary to intuition, higher connectivity can have an adverse distributional impact by benefiting the already privileged. Critically, we find a tradeoff between agent inequality and spatial inequality where the geographic concentration of social resources accompanies a more equal distribution of connectivity. Finally, the disadvantage of agents with limited spatial reach is exacerbated as network density increases. Our results thus highlight the importance of distinguishing between social and spatial inequality in policymaking.","[Cho, Jae Beum] Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA; [Mansury, Yuri S.] IIT, Dept Social Sci, Chicago, IL 60616 USA; [Ye, Xinyue] Kent State Univ, Dept Geog, Kent, OH 44242 USA",Cornell University; Illinois Institute of Technology; University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem,"Cho, JB (通讯作者)，Cornell Univ, Dept City & Reg Planning, Ithaca, NY 14850 USA.",jc2664@cornell.edu; ymansury@iit.edu; xye5@kent.edu,"ye, xinyue/A-7677-2011","ye, xinyue/0000-0001-8838-9476",,,,,66,1,1,1,15,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

This finding points to an energy efficiency gap: the energy-saving technology provided in private markets appears not to include all the technologies that produce net private benefits. The gap exists if the costs of energy-saving technologies are lower than the present value of fuel reductions, and hidden costs- undesirable aspects of the new technologies - do not exceed the net financial benefits. This study examines the existence of hidden costs in energy-saving technologies through a content analysis of auto reviews of model-year 2014 vehicles. Results suggest that it is possible to use fuel-saving technologies on vehicles without imposing hidden costs. For each technology examined, reviews with positive evaluations outnumbered those with negative evaluations. Evidence is scant of a robust relationship between vehicles' use of energy-saving technologies and negatively rated operational characteristics, such as handling or acceleration. Results do not provide evidence for hidden costs as the explanation of the efficiency gap for vehicle fuel-saving technologies.

Using the supply of steel to a passenger car as a case study, the effects of a steel price increase on cost structures and price at each step of the supply chain were assessed. Since the prices of emission allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading System fall well below those required to unlock investments in low-CO2 production processes in the integrated steelmaking industry this paper seeks to pave the way for a discussion on complementary policy options. The results of the analysis suggest that passing on the compliance costs of the steel industry would have only marginal impacts on costs and prices for the end-use sectors (e.g., on the production cost or selling price of the passenger car). Under the assumptions made herein, at a carbon price of 100 (sic)/tCO(2), the retail price of a mid-sized European passenger car would have to be increased by approximately 100-125 (sic)/car (<0.5%) to cover the projected increases in steel production costs.

We argue that the Brazilian integrated electric sector resembles a common-pool resources problem, and as such it should incorporate, in addition to the centralized operation for power dispatch already in place, demand side management, behavioral strategies, and smart grids, attained through a new business and regulatory model for utilities. The paper proposes several measures to attain a more sustainable and productive electricity distribution industry: decoupling revenues from volumetric sales through a fixed maximum load fee, which would completely offset current disincentives for energy efficiency; the creation of a market for negawatts (saved megawatts) using the current Brazilian mechanism of public auctions for the acquisition of wholesale energy; and the integration of technologies, especially through the growth of unregulated products and services. Through these measures, we believe that Brazil could improve both energy security and overall sustainability of its power sector in the long run. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, we are interested in investigating whether an increase in gasoline taxes has a more negative impact on the demand than a-similar in magnitude- increase in the pre-tax price of gasoline for different fuel types. We estimate fuel consumers' responses using a rich set of robust panel data models considering potential dynamic effects and endogeneity problems. We find evidence to confirm the existence of asymmetric responses for the demand of unleaded fuels and agricultural diesel fuel. However we cannot support this statement for the regular diesel case: for this fuel both the tax-exclusive price and the tax elasticities are roughly the same. This result agrees with the fact that diesel drivers tend to be better informed about changes in both fuel prices and taxes. Some implications in terms of fiscal policy and pollution and climate change policy are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Union (EU) has introduced political instruments for systemic RE innovation by integrating resources from different thematic and geographic areas. However, using these instruments to establish an ecosystem for systemic innovation remains unexplored. This study develops a framework for evaluating the systemic innovation performance of networks through a time-series analysis of network structural properties. Overall, EU-funded innovation networks have not evolved in a systemic direction. First, the network exhibits densely connected local clusters for technology exploration and market exploitation of RE innovation, which are disconnected from each other. Over time, the gap between the two phases has weakened with increasing connectivity, but the local clusters supporting either explorative or exploitative activities have diminished. The existing networking linkages among organizations are considered ineffective because their positions in the network tend to display a mismatch with their innovation patterns. This research presents policy suggestions for optimizing the exploration and exploitation activities in the EU's funding program and their complementarities to establish a systemic innovation environment in the RE sector.

The evaluation of the effectiveness of such policies, however, is fragmented, which raises a need for a comprehensive analysis. This paper aims to assess whether and how policies promoting renewable energy investment have achieved the intended goals. It employs five broadly defined criteria - market, uncertainty, profitability, technology, and financial resources - to build an index to assess respectively if such policies have helped create a market for renewable energy, maximize potential profits, reduce risks relating to the investment, develop and adopt new technologies, and improve the access to financial resources. Each criterion is reflected by three indicators. Values of each indicator are converted into ordinal values for analysis. The index not only scans comprehensively all relevant renewable energy investment policies in the East Asia Summit countries, but also provides systematic and quantitative measures to compare the effectiveness of policies in these countries with respect to the creation of market, the degree of uncertainty, the potential of profitability, the development and adoption of technology and the accessibility of financial resources.

Domestic debt has high cost, short tenors, and variable interest rates, adding 30% to the cost of renewable energy compared to renewable energy projects elsewhere. Foreign debt is as expensive as domestic debt because it requires costly market-based currency hedging solutions. We investigate a government-sponsored foreign exchange facility as an alternative to reducing hedging costs. Using the geometric Brownian motion (GBM)(2) as a representative stochastic model of the INR-USD foreign exchange rate, we find that the expected cost of providing a currency hedge via this facility is 3.5 percentage points, 50% lower than market. This leads to an up to 9% reduction in the per unit cost of renewable energy. However, this requires the government to manage the risks related to unexpected currency movements appropriately. One option to manage these risks is via a capital buffer; for the facility to obtain India's sovereign rating, the capital buffer would need to be almost 30% of the underlying loan. Our findings have significant policy implications given that the Indian government can use this facility to make renewable energy more competitive and, therefore, hasten its deployment.

The Belgian population register constitutes a rich and unique database of yearly migrant inflows and stocks broken down by nationality, allowing us to empirically explain the location choice of newly arriving immigrants at the municipality level. Specifically, we aim at separating the network effect from other location-specific characteristics such as local labor or housing market conditions and the presence of public amenities. Our main contribution to the migration literature is to model labor and housing market variables as operating at different levels, assuming that immigrants first select a region roughly corresponding to a labor market and subsequently choose a municipality within this region that maximizes their utility. Among other things, this allows us to shed new light on the still ongoing discussion in the literature concerning the impact of labor market characteristics on the location of immigrants. We find that the spatial repartition of immigrants in Belgium is determined by both network effects and local characteristics. The relative importance of the determinants of location choice varies by nationality, as expected, but for all nationalities, local factors matter more than networks.","[Jayet, Hubert] Univ Lille, Fac Sci Econ & Sociales, CNRS, LEM,UMR 9221, Bat SH2 Cite Sci, F-59655 Villeneuve Dascq, France; [Rayp, Glenn; Ruyssen, Ilse] Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Fac Business & Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium; [Ukrayinchuk, Nadiya] Univ Lille, Fac Sci Jurid Polit & Sociales, CNRS, LEM,UMR 9221, Pl Deliot 1, F-59000 Lille, France",Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS); Ghent University; Universite de Lille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute for Humanities & Social Sciences (INSHS),"Ruyssen, I (通讯作者)，Univ Ghent, SHERPPA, Fac Business & Econ, Tweekerkenstr 2, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.",Hubert.Jayet@Univ-lille1.fr; Glenn.Rayp@Ugent.be; Ilse.Ruyssen@Ugent.be; Nadiya.Ukrayinchuk@Univ-lille2.fr,"Rayp, Glenn/AAF-8330-2020","Ruyssen, Ilse/0000-0002-8259-4492",,,,,57,8,9,2,23,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

In this work, we observe some data on the Italian participation in the CoM and ELENA program, while highlighting the role the Energy Service Companies have in these contexts. By referring to the specific experience of the Province of Foggia (an intermediary government body in southern Italy), we also discuss how some recent changes in the Italian legislation, aimed at abolishing the provinces (considered as preferred supporting structure of the CoM), imposed the identification of another supraterritorial entity. This is to substitute the Province of Foggia as coordinator in the dialog between the local territory and the European Union institutions on the climate-energy theme. In this sense, the choice of the Chamber of Commerce represents a novelty. With regard to this, some considerations on the appropriateness of this choice are developed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Taking advantage of the equivalence relation between conditional logit and Poisson, we estimate a location-choice model using the Poisson fixed-effects estimator. Origin-destination fixed effects are incorporated to account for the persistent spatial structure of the immigrants' settlement patterns and to control for potential violations of the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption. The Poisson regression model is estimated for seven different groups of immigrants according to world regions or countries of origin. Our modelling strategy has important empirical implications, with magnitudes and/or signs of the estimated coefficients changing in the expected directions. It is found that newly arriving immigrants tend to settle in low-to-middle-income locations in the suburban reaches of the Madrid metro area. Moreover, the effects of the size of local communities of established immigrants are found to be insignificant and even negative in several instances, reflecting hetero-local settlement preferences and/or the saturation of local networks causing in-group job rivalry, respectively.","[Peeters, Ludo] Hasselt Univ, Dept Business Econ, Agoralaan Gebouw D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium; [Chasco, Coro] Autonomous Univ Madrid, Dept Appl Econ, Avda Francisco Tomas & Valiente 5, E-28049 Madrid, Spain",Hasselt University; Autonomous University of Madrid,"Peeters, L (通讯作者)，Hasselt Univ, Dept Business Econ, Agoralaan Gebouw D, B-3590 Diepenbeek, Belgium.",ludo.peeters@uhasselt.be; coro.chasco@uam.es,"Chasco, Coro/L-2577-2013; Chasco, Coro/IUN-0313-2023","Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979; Chasco, Coro/0000-0001-8098-9979",Research Foundation-Flanders [K801112N]; Spanish Ministry of Education and Science [ECO2012-36032-C03-01]; UAM-Santander Project [8a Convocatoria],Research Foundation-Flanders(FWO); Spanish Ministry of Education and Science(Spanish Government); UAM-Santander Project,"The research for this paper was partly conducted during a sabbatical leave by the first author at the Lawrence R.

Based on the energy technology innovation theory, factors that may influence the transition of coal resource-based economy were categorized into four types, including: innovation policy, innovation input, innovation ability, and innovation organization. Hypotheses were proposed regarding the mechanisms of these factors. Data were collected from surveys administered to 314 Chinese energy firms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses. Ten of fifteen hypotheses were retained based on the reliability tests, validity tests, and SEM. The results show that the four proposed factors are crucial in transforming the coal resource-based economy, and the effects become statistically significant through three intermediate variables, namely, transition of energy consumption structure, correction of resource wealth investment, and improvement of transition environment.

These local supply business models can offer significant benefits to the electricity system, but also generate economic, social, and environmental values that are not well accounted for in current policy or regulation. This paper uses the UK electricity supply market to investigate new business models which rely on more complex value propositions than the incumbent utility model. Nine archetypal local supply business models are identified and their value propositions, value capture methods, and barriers to market entry are analysed. This analysis defines 'complex value' as a key concept in understanding business model innovation in the energy sector. The process of complex value identification poses a challenge to energy researchers, commercial firms and policy makers in liberalised markets; to investigate the opportunities for system efficiency and diverse outcomes that new supplier business models can offer to the electricity system.

In this study we present a cost-effectiveness approach: given a goal of decarbonization, the objective is to accomplish this at minimum cost. For residential building energy, we show that total cost is minimized by equating marginal cost of building energy conserved with marginal cost of obtaining carbon-free energy, where we express costs of both in dollars per kWh. We describe how the cost of solar photovoltaic energy provides an upper bound on the marginal cost of carbon-free energy and thus an upper bound on marginal cost of conserved energy-one should not necessarily spend more on energy conservation than the cost of photovoltaic energy (though there are several caveats). A case study from Vermont, USA illustrates these principles and implementation issues with marginal analysis of energy conservation. From a policy perspective, the principles presented suggest that either carbon taxes or carbon limits could be used to decarbonize building energy at minimum cost, but that approaches using renewable-energy subsidies or prescriptive building codes result in greater decarbonization costs to society. This suggests that new policy approaches be adopted. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper attempts to fill this information gap by empirically quantifying electricity consumption efficiency for a sample of more than 7,000 households. Adopting the recently introduced 'frontier demand function' due to Filippini and Hunt (2011) but extending it into the metafrontier context - to control for structural heterogeneity arising from location type - it is shown that consumption efficiency is little more than 60% on average. This implies huge potential for energy reduction via the expansion of schemes to promote energy efficiency. City households, which are the wealthiest in the sample, are shown to define the metafrontier demand function (and hence have the potential to be the most efficient households), but at the same time exhibit the largest inefficiencies. These facts together allow for a potential refinement on the household energy ladder concept, suggesting that wealth affords access to the best technologies thereby increasing potential energy efficiency (the 'traditional view of the household energy ladder), but complementary to this these same households are most inefficient. This has implications for numerous areas of policy, including for example the design of energy assistance schemes, identification of energy education needs/priorities as well more refined setting of subsidies/tax-credit policies.

In this paper, we propose a global meta-frontier non-radial directional distance function approach to measure the CO2 emissions performance of Chinese manufacturing sectors during the period of 1990-2012. This approach allows us to simultaneously consider technological heterogeneity in manufacturing, non-radial slacks, and undesirable outputs. The global level of environmental technology is incorporated into the efficiency model to improve discriminating power and comparability. The results indicate significant differences in CO2-emissions-reduction performance among five broad groups of Chinese manufacturing industries. The global technologies/innovators group is the most efficient under meta-frontier technologies, with the smallest technology gap. Meanwhile, the energy-/resource-intensive commodities group is, on average, the least efficient. Therefore, the Chinese government should implement targeted policies that encourage firms in the global technologies/innovators group to increase market share while supporting those in the energy-/resource-intensive commodities group to upgrade their technologies.

The common sustainability components, i.e. economy, environment, and society, are integrated into evaluation of the feasibility, rationality, and uncertainty of the energy mix alternatives. A three stage model has been applied for this sustainability appraisal. The first level deals with alternative technologies for electricity production, the second with alternative mixtures of technologies for meeting electricity needs by 2050, and the third takes into account the expected timing of shutting-down existing old power plants and constructing the new ones. Technology alternatives cover both conventional and renewable energy sources: coal fired, gas fired, biomass fired, oil fired, nuclear, hydro, wind, and photovoltaic. The results show that only mixtures of nuclear, hydro, and gas fired technologies are reliable and rational in the context of meeting expected energy needs. The expected share of energy produced by wind and photovoltaic technology is between 8% and 15%, which makes them less sustainable than other technologies. Eventually, they do not meet sustainability goals from the economic and social points of view. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The decomposition of changes in CO2 emissions at sectoral level are broken down into six effects: carbonization, energy intensity, technology, structural demand, consumption pattern and scale. The results are interesting, not only for researchers but also for utility companies and policy-makers as soon as past and current political mitigation measures are analyzed in line with such results. The results allow us to conclude that the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol together with European Directives related to the promotion of RES seem to have a positive impact on CO2 emissions trends in Spain. After reviewing the current mitigation measures in Spain, one policy recommendation is suggested to avoid the rebound effect and to enhance the fight against Climate Change that is tax benefits for those companies that prove reductions in their energy intensity ratios.

Corporate social responsibility activities are considered as volunteer efforts made by corporations whereby they satisfy their customers and other stakeholders socially and increase their firm value regarding to their community and social environment as a whole. Meeting the stakeholder expectations and maintaining firm sustainability are two major expected outcomes of social responsibility activities and reporting these efforts within the scope of non-financial indicators. Within the scope of this study tourism and finance industries of G8 countries which are considered as leaders about emerging issues and policy developers are going to be evaluated with respect to corporate social responsibility reporting levels. Recent standards set out by international authorities such as Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) are used as evaluation criteria in order to reveal the utmost efforts made by corporations included in tourism and finance industries.

This paper aims at investigating energy policy-related inequalities across social classes with respect to three dimensions highlighted by environmental-justice theories: income distribution, procedures producing unequal distributional outcomes, and cultural and political recognition of vulnerable and marginalised social groups. These inequalities can be exacerbated or reduced by social diffusion processes, both vertical and horizontal. These processes include policy instruments intending to lower energy consumption in the residential sector. To empirically ground the analysis, two countries with contrasting patterns of income inequalities, Portugal and Belgium, are compared on the basis of qualitative data collected in 2009-2011. We discuss the relevance of integrating the social diffusion dimension in energy policies and propose several policy instruments to do so. One of our main contribution is to argue that both vertical and horizontal diffusion across social classes, if adequately translated into policy instruments, can boost the uptake of residential energy retrofits and other energy saving practices.

Slightly degraded areas had the most abundant snail species, but areas heavily disturbed had high species diversity and incidence of individuals.

In doing so, it presents a model with N+1 individuals who communicate with each other. The model explains that individuals can be tolerant and obtain a valuable outcome if their communication partners are also tolerant enough to make their communication smooth. Consequently, when individuals are sufficiently differentiated and have frequent opportunities to communicate, there exist multiple equilibria in which all individuals could be either tolerant or intolerant.

We employ a seemingly unrelated regression model, with quarterly time-series data from the Korea District Heating Corporation (KDHC)-a public utility that covers about 59% of the DH system market in South Korea-over the 1987-2011 period. The explanatory variables are price of labor, price of material, capital cost, and production level. The results indicate that economies of scale are present and statistically significant. Thus, expansion of its DH business would allow KDHC to obtain substantial economies of scale. According to our forecasts vis-a-vis scale economies, the KDHC will enjoy cost efficiency for some time yet. To ensure a socially efficient supply of DH, it is recommended that the KDHC expand its business proactively. With regard to informing policy or regulations, our empirical results could play a significant role in decision-making processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First of all, for the minority groups and for mainstream social groups, the social and economic value of knowledge is relevant. Intangible cultural heritage is expressed through process, phrases, know-how, and abilities-that include associated objects and cultural spaces - that people distinguish as component of their cultural heritage. Spread through generations and constantly recreated, it ensures humanity with a sense of identity and continuity. Secondly, different sectors of the economy, for instance: rates of growth and development, the volumes of outflow of foreign exchange, infrastructure development, new management techniques and the training experience are certainly contributing to the economic and social development of a country. Safeguarding intangible cultural heritage is a valuable source of the economy. Safeguarding activities must therefore always involve the society, people and, where appropriate, individuals that bear such heritage. The global wealth of traditions is the principal motivation for travel, with tourists seeking to find out about new cultures and to experience the global difference of performing arts, handcrafts, rituals and cuisines. The cultural cooperation stimulates by such meeting prompts discussion, builds understanding and encourage tolerance and peace. Persons who realize these values, everywhere in the world have their own way for spreading their knowledge and skills, for the most of the times relies on word of mouth rather than written texts. In conclusion, the intangible cultural heritages create bridges between past, present and future; they make continuity and change the structure of the society with experiences like transition and transcendence.

Do urban social enterprises benefit from agglomeration? Evidence from four UK cities, Regional Studies. This paper examines the relevance of clustering theory for an understanding of the location of social enterprises (SEs). This is accomplished through an analysis of the extent to which managers of SEs in four major UK cities perceive themselves to benefit from agglomeration effects. The paper concentrates on two broad sets of agglomeration processes: the first is Marshallian externalities and Porter's cluster processes; and the second set includes urbanization economies and local institutional relationships. The study suggests the key benefits of agglomeration to SEs are that it enables access to demand for SE goods and services together with institutional support, funding and commercial contracts, as well as access to both formal and informal networks that can provide a wide range of knowledge and mutual support. It was, however, difficult to find direct evidence to support the importance of the Marshall-Arrow-Romer (MAR)-type spillovers related to labour market pooling, the efficient procurement of indirect inputs or localized knowledge spillovers.","[Pinch, Steven; Sunley, Peter] Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Sunley, P (通讯作者)，Univ Southampton, Geog & Environm, Southampton SO17 1BJ, Hants, England.",s.p.pinch@soton.ac.uk; p.j.sunley@soton.ac.uk,,"SUNLEY, PETER/0000-0003-4803-5299",Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC); Office for Civil Society; Barrow Cadbury Trust; Economic and Social Research Council [ES/G028877/1] Funding Source: researchfish; ESRC [ES/G028877/1] Funding Source: UKRI,Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC)(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); Office for Civil Society; Barrow Cadbury Trust; Economic and Social Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)); ESRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Economic & Social Research Council (ESRC)),"This research was undertaken within the Third Sector Research Centre Programme funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), Office for Civil Society and Barrow Cadbury Trust, run jointly at the universities of Birmingham and Southampton.",,52,8,8,2,37,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

In the year 2000, Rubella component was added to Measles vaccine, and in the year 2005, Mumps component was added too (now MMR vaccine). OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to identify protective immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels for each antigen (diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis) according to different age groups and residence (rural and urban). METHODS: Two samples, each involving 120 healthy children were selected from urban and rural populations of three central regions of Albania. The children were aged between 1 and 15 years. IgG specific levels for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests (ELISA). Levels of IgG were classified into the following categories: unprotected, insufficient, and fair/good or full/sure protection, using specific thresholds for each, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. RESULTS: Of the same population, 75.7% was found to have IgG protective levels for diphtheria. For tetanus, 81.4% of the total sample had protective levels of IgG, and for pertussis this proportion was 69.0%. Levels of protection for diphtheria and tetanus increased up until 3 years of age (diphtheria: 25.0% at 1 year and then 95.0% at 3 years of age; tetanus: 65.0% at 1 year and 90.0% at 3 years of age). From then on the trend stabilized. The same trend was not observed for pertussis, which presented protective IgG levels of 73.0% from the first year of life. When IgG protective levels were compared between rural and urban samples, differences were only found with diphtheria specific IgG, which was significantly higher in the rural population. Furthermore, a correlation in IgG levels was found among diphtheria and tetanus. CONCLUSIONS: IgG specific levels for diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis referring to our sample are are considered acceptable for providing protection in the general population. Nevertheless, these levels seem to have been achieved only after booster doses until the third year of life, especially for diphtheria.","[Pojani, Eftiola] Catholic Univ Our Lady Good Counsel Tirana, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Tirana, Albania; [Nelaj, Erida] Inst Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol & Infect Dis Control, Tirana, Albania; [Ylli, Alban] Univ Med, Fac Publ Hlth, Tirana, Albania",,"Pojani, E (通讯作者)，Catholic Univ Our Lady Good Counsel Tirana, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Tirana, Albania.",e.pojani@unizkm.al,,,,,,,8,0,0,0,0,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,652,657,,10.12955/cbup.v4.827,0.0,,,6,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000097,0

The arsenal of anticancer drugs occupies a prominent position as medications related to heterocyclic systems (cancer of the digestive system and other areas). In this regard, further development towards new derivatives of purine and pyrimidine series are of significant scientific interest and justify the relevance, novelty, and scientific practical significance of this study. Synthesis of 5-fluorouracil bis-derivative was performed with a halogen-containing pharmacophore group to compose a molecule that was studied for its physical, chemical, and biological properties. Synthesis of 5-fluorouracil bis-derivative is a typical example of substitution reactions with a heteroatom of the uracil molecule (N1) as the second component in the reaction involving halothane, a known inhaled anesthetic. The reaction was carried out in a solvent system of benzene-dimethylformamide-diethyl ether, under conditions of phase transfer catalysis with dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB 18C6) complex (alkaline medium), by heating (14 h), followed by purification, and drying of the products. The structure of the synthesized compound was confirmed by elemental analysis, infrared, and proton nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) spectroscopy. By varying the reaction conditions, a synthesized compound of high purity was obtained with increased practical output of up to 50%. The toxicity and antitumor activity of the synthesized compound were investigated. The new substance, 5-fluorouracil bis-derivative, was found to have high antitumor activity, reducing the Sarcoma 180 tumor by 51.7% (activity criterion >= 50%). This suggests the synthesized compound is suitable as a physiologically active treatment and its further study as a potential vehicle for anti-tumor treatment in patients is recommended.","[Welchinska, Elena] Bohomolets Natl Med Univ, Pharmaceut Fac, Kiev, Ukraine; [Vilchynska, Valeriia] Bohomolets Natl Med Univ, Kiev, Ukraine",Bogomolets National Medical University; Bogomolets National Medical University,"Welchinska, E (通讯作者)，Bohomolets Natl Med Univ, Pharmaceut Fac, Kiev, Ukraine.",elena_wwu@ukr.net,"Welchinska, Welchinskaya, Velchinska, Velchinskaya, Velchynska, Вельчинська, Вельчинская, Elena, Olena, Helena/AAC-6441-2019","Olena, Welchinska/0000-0001-7023-8493",,,,,12,1,1,1,5,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,740,743,,10.12955/cbup.v4.842,0.0,,,4,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000111,0

Recently, investors and policymakers have laid blame for sector under-performance on pipeline sabotage and theft, and sounded the alarm for an impending 'oil crisis'. However, our understanding of the economic effects of social action against oil companies is incomplete. Rigorous analysis has not heretofore been offered as evidence for such dire futures. Despite the obvious risk of pipeline interdiction, price dynamics and aggregate production respond minimally to pipeline interdiction. Based on quantitative analysis of the relationship among price, production and pipeline interdiction from multiple data sources covering different time intervals (monthly data from 2005 to 2014 and annual data from 1999 to 2013), we find no evidence of significant effects of pipeline interdiction on production and a weak relationship between pipeline interdiction and Bonny light crude prices. Reported losses in product are substantial, but there is no evidence of statistically significant impacts on price or production in the aggregate. Explanations for this counterintuitive result are cast in terms of sector resilience. The implications of this finding for producer risk and the likelihood of an impending 'oil crisis' are discussed.

Most studies on the subject have used contingent valuation and choice experiments. However, all empirical designs employed to date suffer from serious biases, such as strategic behavior. We introduce a novel neuroscience-based approach to renewable energy-related WTP research, Neuropricing, which eliminates some of these biases. We tested consumers' WTP for two different green electricity products and found WTP for these products to be about 15% above that for a non-green electricity tariff. Our results suggest that Neuropricing is indeed able to eliminate strategic behavior. Moreover, this approach allows for WTP studies with much smaller sample sizes than traditional methods require. The neuroscience methodology can be used by researchers and marketers alike not only for testing the effects of product attributes on WTP but also for evaluating WTP effects of specific messages in marketing communications. Thus it may lead to a better understanding of consumer behavior and hence facilitate more successful marketing of renewable energy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This topic is of interest, especially since the Stern report and the ensuing public and academic debate have made clear how crucial discounting is for evaluating anti-global warming measures. We investigate the consequences of the assumption that discounting is endogenous, more precisely, decreases as the damage increases, i.e., decision makers become more patient when facing the environmental damages following their high consumption levels. This avoids time inconsistency, a pitfall when using hyperbolic discounting. However, it can lead to quite different and sometimes counterintuitive behavior in comparison to standard exogenous discounting: an endogenous discount rate, albeit always smaller than the exogenous one, (i) can nevertheless imply high stationary damages; (ii) can lead to multiple steady states.

In this study, we examined energy by assessing embodied energy consumption to describe the energy-flow structure in China's seven regions. Based on multi-regional monetary input-output tables and energy statistical yearbooks for Chinese provinces in 2002 and 2007, we accounted for both direct and indirect energy consumption, respectively, and the integral input and output of the provinces. Most integral inputs of energy flowed from north to south or from east to west, whereas integral output flows were mainly from northeast to southwest. This differed from the direct flows, which were predominantly from north to south and west to east. This demonstrates the importance of calculating both direct and indirect energy flows. Analysis of the distance and direction traveled by the energy consumption centers of gravity showed that the centers for embodied energy consumption and inputs moved southeast because of the movements of the centers of the Eastern region. However, the center for outputs moved northeast because the movement of the Central region. These analyses provide a basis for identifying how regional economic development policies influence the embodied energy consumption and its flows among regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We look at two specific cases: (i) demand for transmission varies across time, and (ii) vertical integration is allowed between investors in transmission network and electricity generators. In the case of time-varying demand under Mo, we find that a monopolist may underinvest in transmission when compared to NMo, although NMo may lead to more capacity withholding. In the case of vertical integration, we find that when the market power is with the generators of the exporting node, without vertical integration no welfare-enhancing merchant investment would occur, neither under Mo nor NMo. Further, if the generators in the importing node have market power, in case vertical integration is allowed, Mo is better than NMo. Finally, we also argue that the incentive to collude among various transmission network investors is mitigated with Mo in place. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that there are large opportunities for CO2 emissions reduction in China's coal-fired power plants. Given that all power plants operate fully efficiently, China's CO2 emissions in 2004 and 2008 could have been reduced by 52% and 70%, respectively, accompanied by an expansion in electricity output. In other words, the opportunities for 'double dividend' exist. In 2004, the average marginal abatement cost of CO2 emissions for China's power plants was approximately 955 Yuan/ton, whereas in 2008, the cost increased to 1142 Yuan/ton. The empirical analyses show that subsidies from the government can reduce environmental inefficiency, but the subsidies significantly increase the shadow price of the power plants. Older and larger power plants have a lower environmental efficiency and marginal CO2 abatement cost. The ratio of coal consumption negatively affects the environmental efficiencies of power plants.

This paper reflects on one English local authority's experience delivering a programme intended to foster local interest in the Green Deal. Drawing on social surveys and pre and post Green Deal intervention interviews with five demonstrator homes (households that applied to receive a Green Deal package fully funded by the scheme, providing a test bed for the Green Deal recruitment and installation process), this paper shows that awareness and understanding of the Green Deal scheme is low. There is opposition to the cost of finance offered but a strong interest in improving household warmth and for funding improvements through payments added to the electricity bill. Demonstrator home residents perceived Green Deals had improved the warmth and quality of their home, but saving money was the primary motivator for their involvement, not increasing warmth. Whilst Green Deal has not delivered the level of success that was hoped, much can be learned from the scheme to improve future energy efficiency schemes that will be necessary to deliver emission reduction commitments.

Two hundred and twenty one (221) standardized surveys of single-family residential households in San Antonio, Texas - the seventh largest city in the United States of America - are collected and used as a test case. The objective is to highlight the role of women in improving household energy efficiency. By coupling the behavioral and analytical sciences, studies such as this one provide better insight for the effective deployment of targeted energy efficiency programs that can benefit both households and municipalities while reducing impact on environmental resources. Study conclusions highlight 80% higher per capita consumption in female dominant households versus male dominant households (p=0.000) driven by approximately double the gas consumption in female-headed households (p=0.002), and 54% more electric usage (p=0.004). The higher use in female dominant homes is examined through the socio-demographic impacts of education, income, vintage of home occupied and size of home occupied. The theoretical framework and test case presented in this study promote the need for market segmented energy efficiency initiatives that better engage women in energy demand-side management in industrialized populated cities.

These contributions are further decomposed to show the role of productivity growth in continuing plants vis-a-vis reallocations in output shares. The results show that the largest LEPs, in population terms, with higher levels of job density, a greater reliance on manufacturing, more skilled and better qualified workers, and a lower turnover of businesses achieved the highest TFP growth.

We analyzed the contribution of non-Annex I countries to the GHG emissions in the period 1850-2010 to assess their relative contribution to total GHG emissions. In the period 1850-1990 non-Annex I countries represented 44% of the total but this contribution increased in the period 1990-2010 to 56%. If we extrapolate present trends to 2030 they will represent 69% in the period 1990-2030. The historical responsibility of Annex I countries is therefore decreasing. If we take 1990 as the starting year in which the Climate Convention recognized clearly that greenhouse gases are interfering dangerously with the climate system, it is evident the need of non-Annex I countries to engage with Annex I countries in the effort to reduce emissions. We present three options for the burden sharing in such effort. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Papers in this special issue show how transport transitions in Asia may play out in different socio-economic and policy scenarios, including a low carbon scenario equivalent to 2 degrees C stabilization. Accounting for heterogeneity of national transport systems, these papers use diverse methods, frameworks and models to assess the response of the transport system to environmental policy, such as a carbon tax, as well as to a cluster of policies aimed at diverse development indicators. The analysis shows that CO2 mitigation in a transport system is achieved more effectively by aligning mitigation policies with sustainable development policies and measures such as mandates for mode share and choices such as urban design, information and communication systems, and behavioral measures. Authors therefore advocate policies that target multiple dividends vis-a-vis carbon mitigation, energy security and local air quality. Whereas four papers focus on emissions mitigation policies, one paper examines challenges to adapt fast growing transport infrastructures to future climate change induced risks. Collectively, the papers exemplify a set of policies and measures that can deliver co-benefits, and, also, demonstrate the use of methods, frameworks and models to delineate the optimal mix of such policies and measures.

This is especially the case in developing world cities where decision-makers struggle to keep up with the pace and scale of change. Focusing on Palembang in Indonesia, this paper considers the economic case for proactive investment in low-carbon development. We find that a rapidly growing industrial city in a developing country can reduce emissions by 24.1% in 2025, relative to business as usual levels, with investments of USD405.6 million that would reduce energy expenditure in the city by USD436.8 million. Emissions from the regional grid could be reduced by 12.2% in 2025, relative to business as usual trends, with investments of USD2.9 billion that would generate annual savings of USD175 million. These estimates understate the savings from reduced expenditure on energy subsidies and energy infrastructure. The compelling economic case for mainstreaming climate mitigation in this developing country city suggests that the constraints on climate action can be political and institutional rather than economic. There is therefore a need for more effective energy governance to drive the transition to a low-carbon economy. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

These conditions have economic interpretations and require fewer restrictions than the static factor framework. Under these restrictions, a standard structural vector autoregression (SVAR) with measurement errors can be embedded into a dynamic factor model. More generally, we also consider overidentification restrictions to achieve efficiency. We discuss general linear restrictions, either in the form of known factor loadings or cross-equation restrictions. We further consider serially correlated idiosyncratic errors with heterogeneous dynamics. A numerically stable Bayesian algorithm for the dynamic factor model with general parameter restrictions is constructed for estimation and inference. We show that a square-root form of the Kalman filter improves robustness and accuracy when sampling the latent factors. Confidence intervals (bands) for the parameters of interest such as impulse responses are readily computed. Similar identification conditions are also exploited for multilevel factor models, and they allow us to study the spill-over effects of the shocks arising from one group to another.

This paper shows that the reform was primarily driven by the need to secure electricity supply and cut down tariffs. These national objectives ousted other issues, and notably those that find their expression at the urban level, among which the question of access to electricity in Metro Manila's urban poor communities. The central state withdrew its attention from the issue of electrification, and local actors had to react as they were confronted to social tensions and practices of pilferage. As a consequence, city governments and local administrations are getting involved in this issue, which opens the way to participation of civil society. This paper shows how the rolling back of the central state led to new partnerships and arrangements between the distribution utility, local governments and community organisations. This movement points to an urbanisation of energy issues, which could bring positive results for end-users provided that it is accompanied by a clearer regulatory framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This model represents energy supply and demand sectors in California and simulates the technology and resource requirements needed to meet projected energy service demands. The model includes assumptions on policy constraints, as well as technology and resource costs and availability. Multiple scenarios are developed to analyze the changes and investments in low-carbon electricity generation, alternative fuels and advanced vehicles in transportation, resource utilization, and efficiency improvements across many sectors. Results show that major energy transformations are needed but that achieving the 80% reduction goal for California is possible at reasonable average carbon reduction cost ($9 to $124/tonne CO(2)e at 4% discount rate) relative to a baseline scenario. Availability of low-carbon resources such as nuclear power, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), biofuels, wind and solar generation, and demand reduction all serve to lower the mitigation costs, but CCS is a key technology for achieving the lowest mitigation costs.

For each group the private economic cost of providing heating comfort is minimised. The private solution may deviate from the socio-economical optimal solution and we suggest changes to policy to incentivise the individuals to make choices more in line with the socioeconomic optimal mix of energy savings and technologies. The households can combine their primary heating source with secondary heating e.g. a woodstove. This choice results in increased indoor air pollution with fine particles causing health effects. We integrate health cost due to use of woodstoves into household optimisation of heating expenditures. The results show that due to a combination of low costs of primary fuel and low environmental performance of woodstoves today, included health costs lead to decreased use of secondary heating. Overall the interdependence of heat generation technology- and heat saving-choice is significant. The total optimal level of heat savings for private consumers decrease by 66% when all have the option to shift to the technology with lowest variable costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The baseline time series model is a semiparametric specification based on the quantile autoregressive (QAR) model that assumes that the quantiles depend on the lagged values of the variable. We then augment the time series model with macroeconomic information from a large dataset by including principal components or a subset of variables selected by LASSO. We forecast the distribution of the h-month growth rate for four economic variables from 1975 to 2011 and evaluate the forecast accuracy relative to a stochastic volatility model using the quantile score. The results for the output and employment measures indicate that the multivariate models outperform the time series forecasts, in particular at long horizons and in tails of the distribution, while for the inflation variables the improved performance occurs mostly at the 6-month horizon. We also illustrate the practical relevance of predicting the distribution by considering forecasts at three dates during the last recession.","CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Bert W Wasserman Dept Econ & Finance, New York, NY 10010 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; Baruch College (CUNY),"Manzan, S (通讯作者)，CUNY Bernard M Baruch Coll, Zicklin Sch Business, Bert W Wasserman Dept Econ & Finance, 17 Lexington Ave, New York, NY 10010 USA.",sebastiano.manzan@baruch.cuny.edu,"Manzan, Sebastiano/C-4150-2014","Manzan, Sebastiano/0000-0002-0931-9769",PSC-CUNY Research Award Program; Bert W.

So far, about 1.8 million ha of the total 8.5 million ha irrigated lands are irrigated using modern irrigation networks in Iran. Many new irrigation networks are also under construction. In the other hand, recent studies have shown that the most of the existing networks which have been constructed with huge costs suffer from various social and technical. The nature and type of these problems are different depending on the stages of construction and operation in different networks. In this research, an attempt has been made to determine the main problems of the networks, and remediation measures for rehabilitation and optimal modification of the networks. For this purpose, the methodology and principals of strategic planning was used. To do this, the pattern of strategic planning, including organizing of main and sub main committees with participating of stakeholders, review of literatures, field studies and visits, holding on workshops was applied. Based on arguments made in the workshops and main committee, the whole problems of the irrigation and drainage networks were followed in four principal subjects including drainage and environment, structural and construction, managing aspects and construction materials. The existing problems in the networks were drawn in the form of problem trees for each subject separately. Then in the basis of problem trees, target trees were developed to optimize and modification of irrigation and drainage networks. Based on the target trees, and considering previous studies and experiences, distinctive executive and research strategies were proposed considering various basic criteria. Finally temporal priorities (short, middle and long term) were determined to performance of the suggested executive and research strategies.

Andalucia having access to high quality wool and Cadiz being the arrival port in Spain of raw cotton coming from America, the question that emerges is why did the textile factories created in this region have not success? Concerning the wool industry, we can find the answer for its decline in the massive exports favoured by the government for fiscal reasons. In the case of the cotton industry, the reason for the lack of success came from the high prices of American raw cotton in Cadiz due to the high transport costs and a disadvantageous exchange rate, and its low quality coming from a lack of technical preparation.","Univ Seville, Seville, Spain",University of Sevilla,"Bernal, AM (通讯作者)，Univ Seville, Seville, Spain.",,,,,,,,31,2,2,0,4,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Therefore, in this research paper we aim to see how technology has developed the labour market in Romania, how it has influenced the level of salaries, the educational trends and which is its outcome for the economy. Using different statistical and econometrical methods, we want to build an inventory of the tech companies in Romania and their added value for the labour market. The data will be taken from the National Institute of Statistics, Eurostat, European Commission's studies and several private entities. In the end, our goal is to analyse whether the technology is one of the leading industries in Romania or we still need to catch up compared to other EU countries. Moreover, if technology has imposed itself as a main drive for the economy, we also want to study the sustainability of this situation.

The elements of the comparison are the levels of value relevance of the financial statements drawn according to US GAAP (for North America), respectively of the reports issued in conformity with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) (for the European regions). By using econometric models consecrated in specialized literature, respectively Easton & Harris (1991) and Ohlson (1995), we identified a differentiated contribution according to the accounting norms and to the economic environment where companies perform their activity, for the financial data in making investment / disinvestment decisions. This stresses, after testing the first model, a stronger deterministic connection between financial-accounting information and the stock performance recorded for LSE quoted companies compared to those on the USA capital market, respectively quoted Romanian companies that report in conformity of IFRS. Drawing the financial statements according to RAS provides the investors in the non-regulated section of the Romanian stock market with a better informational basis than in the case of the equivalent clusters analyzed. The second model, based on prices, reveals an increased intensity of the connection in the case of Romanian companies quoted in the main section of the BSE, whose dimension exceeds the association observed in the context of the other stock markets.

It is simple to use and significantly outperforms other financial and macroeconomic indicators in predicting recessions two to six quarters ahead. The steepness of the yield curve should be an excellent indicator of a possible future economic activity. A rise in the short rate tends to flatten the yield curve as well as to slow real growth the near term. This paper aims to analyze the dependence between slope of the yield curve and an economic activity of United Kingdom, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Russia between the years 2000 and 2013. This time period was divided on two samples in order to prove the change of predictive power of the model. The slope of the yield curve can be measured as the yield spread between sovereign 10-year bonds and sovereign 3-month bonds. The natural and probably the most popular measure of economic growth is by GDP growth, taken quarterly. The results showed that the prediction ability of the GDP growth or decrease was proven after year 2008 (financial crisis) in Iceland, Russia and United Kingdom. Certainly the simple yield curve growth forecast should not serve as a replacement for the complex predictive models, it does, however, provide enough information to serve as a useful check on the more sophisticated forecasts. These findings can be beneficial for investors and provide further evidence of the potential usefulness of the yield curve spreads as indicators of the future economic activity. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Prior to this, it was a small heterogeneous collection of hotels not located in developed tourist areas. From the 1950s onward, Paradores became an important instrument of tourism policy beyond the duty of offering beds in a country with an underdeveloped hotel industry. It was charged with controlling official hotel prices, improving the tourism sector and, from a specific moment, helping in the preservation of Spain's cultural heritage. Thus, its development and transformation represent not only a business history but also what Franco's regime meant by tourism and touristic development. The incredible increase in the size of the network, which grew by 65 hotels between 1940-1977, along with its ambitious architectural and territorial policy made the State one of the largest hotel businesses in Spain. This created a paradox in a country where the regime didn't know how to (or couldn't) resolve the problems of the national hotel industry. Beyond the numbers, in this article we look at whether or not Paradores fulfilled its objectives and the role it played in the structure of Spanish tourism, without forgetting, of course, its questioned economic profitability.","[Moreno Garrido, Ana] UNED, Madrid, Spain; [Pellejero Martinez, Carmelo] Univ Malaga, E-29071 Malaga, Spain",Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED); Universidad de Malaga,"Garrido, AM (通讯作者)，UNED, Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,60,2,2,0,8,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

This was demonstrated by the high yields that were recorded from the maize varieties (Pwani Hybrid 4-PH4, Coast Composite Maize-CCM and the local check-Mdzihana) which usually require relatively high rainfall amounts in order for them to produce better yields. Despite the excellent performance of PH4, CCM and Mdzihana, these maize varieties cannot be recommended for the semi-arid areas since the high yields were realized under above normal rainfall.

More recently, however, economists have also started to pay more attention to CSR in popular newspapers and also in academic journals. The CSR concept developed due to the change in the business view, from a limited model, mainly oriented towards profit maximisation, to an open one, largely concerned with the quality of life, preservation of resources and meeting the general interests of society. In other words, a view included in the sustainable development principles. The companies' social commitment has become a significant competitive edge in the new economy and Romania follows this international trend. This paper aims at analyzing the corporate social responsibility issue and the means to integrate it into long-term strategies of the companies that activate in the romanian business environment. The first part of the paper consists in the literature review of CSR and how it is linked to sustainable development. Increasingly companies are being held responsible not just for their own operations but also for the practices in other parts of their sphere of influence. Thus, the second part of the paper represents a study about the responsible practices in Romanian business environment. The attention is oriented to the challenges and benefits that companies have to face and how they are linked to the key actors of CSR. The third part studies the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of CSR development in Romania and how they reflect in sustainable development.

One of the many challenges for a business is to satisfy its employees in order to cope up with the ever changing and evolving environment and to achieve success and remain in competition. In order to increase efficiency, effectiveness, productivity and job commitment of employees, the business must satisfy the needs of its employees by providing good working conditions. The objective of this paper is to analyse the impact of working environment on employee job satisfaction. The study employed a quantitative methodology. Data was collected through a self-administered survey questionnaire. The questionnaire is adopted from a previous validated survey. The target population consists of educational institutes, banking sector and telecommunication industry operating in the city of Quetta, Pakistan. Simple random sampling is used for collection of data from 210 employees. The results indicates a positive relationship between working environment and employee job satisfaction. The study concludes with some brief prospects that the businesses need to realize the importance of good working environment for maximizing the level of job satisfaction. This paper may benefit society by encouraging people to contribute more to their jobs and may help them in their personal growth and development. Hence, it is essential for an organization to motivate their employees to work hard for achieving the organizational goals and objectives. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Terrain of the sub-mountain area is smoothly denudated because it had been eroded for a long time before the volcanic period. Valleys of the Bystry potok and Riecka streams correspond with tectonic faults. The region was colonized during the 17th century by pastorals and later by peasants. Traditional forms of agriculture have persisted in the landscape till today. Soils are slightly fertile. The area lies on the boundary between slightly warm and cold, very humid climatic zone. Annual rainfall is within the range 700-900 mm. But based on a long-term microclimatic measuring, it is shown that the lack of precipitation is in the period of the vegetation growth. Bedrock consists mainly of granodiorite rocks which have low water permeability and weak springs (yield ranging between 0.1-0.4 l.s-1). Water absorbs rapidly and flows over the surface of granodiorite rocks to the lower horizons. A similar process appears in the sandy-loam weathering mantle, which has locally a depth about 2 m. Therefore, local inhabitants had to build a system of catchworks which can distribute water from alluvial plains to uplands' slopes. We identified about 3700 m of catchworks in the Riecka water catchment area. A prevailing part of catchworks distributes water from streams and less flows from springs. During the fieldwork we identified wetlands and waterlogged areas which represent potential sites for spreading of valuable biotopes. Further, we evaluated the degree of the catchwork utilization and succession processes on slopes. Catchworks are only partly functional, and the investigated area suffers from a lack of water mostly during summer seasons. We propose revitalization of the catchwork system in the landscape. Integrated management of the catchment also should take into account effects of current climate change on the studied region. (C) 2015 The Authors.

The Caribbean region can serve as a laboratory in studying the institutional issues relating to energy development due to the differences in political jurisdictions over a short distance. Based on 12 case studies and 75 in-depth interviews with a variety of stakeholders, we identified five factors that appear to be critical for the development of renewable energy in the Caribbean: entrepreneurship attitudes, the role of local champions, the electric utility influence, informal institutions and the influence of international agencies. We built a multiple regression model to test these relationships through a survey of 34 political jurisdictions in the Caribbean. The statistical analysis we conducted suggests that informal institutions have a significant impact on the extent of renewable energy development, while the incumbent electricity utilities' influence may impede the development of renewable energy. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations on how best to make use of these factors identified, in order to develop effective energy policies throughout the Caribbean. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The generation and use of energy resources are two very important aspects for the development of SIDS. Unfortunately, most of SIDS do not use their potential in respect of energy resources, and they as a result have to depend on the import of fossil fuels in order to meet their energy needs. This increases the overall vulnerability of SIDS as they have to depend on the rising or fluctuating fossil fuels prices. Some SIDS, especially in the geographically dispersed Pacific region, do not have proper access to energy whereas other SIDS struggle more with energy security issue. At the same time, SIDS are most vulnerable to the impacts and effects of climate change, as they are among the ones to be most severely affected in case of natural calamities and sea-level rise. Drawing on experiences from Fiji and Mauritius, this paper explains core elements related to energy access and security in SIDS, contextualizes and discusses barriers and list some of the strategies that may be used to ensure access to and a continuous supply of energy in SIDS. A situational analysis of two SIDS outlines their current energy situation and compares their energy policies to globally accepted criteria for SIDS policies as well as with each other. It is claimed that the diverging energy performances of Fiji and Mauritius cannot be explained by policies differences. The reasons for the varying energy performances may therefore lie in the administrative and institutional mechanisms used by the two countries in implementing their energy policies. Finally, to enable SIDS to reduce their overall vulnerability and become truly sustainable islands, it is recommended to undertake careful assessments of the particular local contexts under which island energy regimes operate.

In this paper, we seek to explain these findings using three nationwide datasets from the U.S. - the American Housing Survey, Forms EIA-861, and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. We examine the role of the sample period, level of aggregation, use of panel data, use of instrumental variables, and inclusion of housing characteristics and capital stock. Our findings suggest that price elasticities have remained relatively constant over time. Upon splitting our panel datasets into annual cross sections, we do observe a negative relationship between price elasticities and the average price. Whether prices are rising or falling appears to have little effect on our estimates. We also find that aggregating our data can result in both higher and lower price elasticity estimates, depending on the dataset used, and that controlling for unit-level fixed effects with panel data generally results in more inelastic demand functions. Addressing the endogeneity of price and/or measurement error in price with instrumental variables has a small but noticeable effect on the price elasticities. Finally, controlling for housing characteristics and capital stock produces a lower price elasticity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Discussions of these issues are presented separately for the current operating fleet, for new reactor designs similar in size to the current fleet, and for prospective new reactors of substantially smaller size. This article also discusses the issue of expansion of commercial nuclear power into new countries. The article concludes with recommendations, related both to technical issues and policy considerations. The major implications for policy are that although the level of safety and security achieved in today's operating reactor fleet worldwide is considered broadly acceptable, some advanced designs now under development potentially offer demonstrably safer performance, and may offer improved financial performance also. Management and safety culture are vital attributes for achieving adequate safety and security, as are a strong political culture that includes an absence of corruption, an independent regulatory authority, and a separation of nuclear operation from day-to-day politics. In some countries that are now considering a nuclear-power program for the first time, careful attention to these attributes will be essential for success. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we review the literature in order to summarise the impacts of the different technologies in terms of their materials and energy requirements, their emissions during operation, their health effects during operation, the accident risks, and the associated waste streams. We follow up these comparisons with some more anecdotal evidence on selected impacts that are either particularly topical or are important but less commonly addressed. These include impacts of wind turbines on persons and on bird life, the underestimated problems with biomass, and concerns about biodiversity reduction. Finally we address. the public attitudes towards both renewable energy technologies and to nuclear power. The conclusion is drawn that energy policies of many countries are perhaps more strongly influenced by public and political perceptions of available technologies than they are by rational assessment of the actual benefits and drawbacks. Polity recommendations follow from this conclusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This model is well suited for policy assessment purposes in the context of developing economies as it indicates the transitional effects of policy intervention. Three-ME estimates the carbon tax required to meet emissions reduction targets within the Mexican Climate Change Law, and assesses alternative policy scenarios, each reflecting a different strategy for the recycling of tax revenues. With no compensation, the taxation policy would reduce CO2 emissions by more than 75% by 2050 with respect to Business as Usual (BAU), but at high economic costs. Under full redistribution of carbon tax revenues, a double dividend arises: the policy appears beneficial both in terms of GDP and CO2 emissions reduction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The fall in public demand causes a fall in consumer and investment prices which will foster a sharp increase in investment demand that gradually causes GDP to grow back to its initial levels within a ten year period.","[Fortuna, Mario; Silva, Francisco] Univ Azores, CEEAplA, Rua Mae de Deus, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal; [Medeiros, Ana] Univ Azores, Rua Mae de Deus, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal",Universidade dos Acores; Universidade dos Acores,"Fortuna, M (通讯作者)，Univ Azores, CEEAplA, Rua Mae de Deus, P-9501801 Ponta Delgada, Portugal.",fortuna@uac.pt; fsilva@uac.pt; anabettmedeiros@gmail.com,"Silva, Francisco/AAM-1966-2020","Silva, Francisco/0000-0002-3893-6029; Fortuna, Mario/0000-0002-0046-824X",,,,,25,7,8,1,19,WILEY-BLACKWELL,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The aim of promoting of intelligent green building is to stimulate the architecture technology industry. This has been combined with Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the concept of green building to provide a safe and healthy living environment. While doing this it will also aim to reduce carbon emissions and save energy. This study investigates intelligent green building policies and the promotion of progress in Taiwan. It probes into cases from 1988 to 2014. Key success factors are derived from analyzing and summarizing intelligent green building experiences in Taiwan. This is done through Secondary Data Analyses by: 1. Establishing clear norms and standards for intelligent green building design and improvement; 2. First carrying out policies in public sector, in order to provide field trial and safeguarded market opportunities for industries; 3. Implementing rating-based assessments, in order to raise the quality of design; 4. Mandatory or incentive policies are introduced, depending on local specialties and conditions; 5.

After a review of the international landscape, this paper compiles and analyzes business models and financing options for rooftop solar PV investment in Thailand that have emerged during the period between 2013 and 2015. Despite policy discontinuity for the support of rooftop solar systems, diverse business models and financing options are driving market expansion and expanding solar access to more Thai consumers. Drawing on our policy and regulatory analyses and in-depth interviews with business representatives, we identify four types of business models and one financing option. The business models include Roof Rental, Solar PPA, Solar Leasing, and Community Solar, and the financing option is the solar loan. We analyze the drivers for their emergence, barriers to their success, and the risks from the business owners' and consumers' viewpoints. Our policy recommendation is focused on crafting a net metering regulation with evidence-based studies on the potential costs and benefits to different stakeholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Using event study methodology on a unique sample of 368 listed companies, we show that verified emissions only resulted in statistically significant market responses when the carbon price was high and allowance scarcity was anticipated. The cross-section analysis of abnormal returns surrounding the publication of verified emissions shows that share prices decrease when actual emissions relative to allocated emissions increase. This negative relationship between allocation shortfalls and firm value is only significant for firms that are either carbon-intensive, compared to sector peers, or are less likely to pass through carbon-related costs in their product prices. The results suggest that although the EU ETS has been deemed unsuccessful so far due to over-allocation and low carbon price, shareholders initially perceived allowance holdings as value relevant. Our results highlight that a significant carbon market price and addressing pass-through costing are essential for successful future reforms of the EU ETS and other analogous carbon cap-and-trade systems implemented or planned worldwide.

However, little of the ITI's anticipated outputs materialized and the programme was prematurely terminated. This paper examines the reasons for its failure, which largely centred on the programme's inappropriate design. The findings suggest that greater recognition needs to be given to the specificities of local entrepreneurial ecosystems when designing, aligning and executing systemic innovation policy instruments.

The government is thus actively promoting the use of renewable energy. Since 2000, domestic installations of solar water heaters have increased substantially because of the long-term subsidies provided for such systems. However, data on the annual installation area of solar collectors in recent years indicated that the solar thermal industry in Taiwan has reached a bottleneck. The long-term policy providing subsidies must thus be revised. It is proposed that future thermal applications in Taiwan should focus on building-integrated solar thermal, photovoltaic/thermal, and industrial heating processes. Regarding building-integrated solar thermal systems, the current subsidy model can be continued (according to area of solar collectors); nevertheless, the application of photovoltaic/thermal and industrial heating systems must be determined according to the thermal output of such systems.

The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), introduced in 2002 and revised in 2010, is a key instrument to increase the energy performance of buildings across the European Union. Following the implementation, of the EPBD into Spanish law, all properties offered for sale or rented out in Spain are required to have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC). Given that the implementation of the EPC scheme for new, existing and advertised properties is still very low in Spain, unlike other European housing markets, the Spanish one lacks market data on energy efficiency (EE) labels and their impact on housing price. To overcome this gap, we determine the EE ratings of a sample of 1507 homes across Spain on the basis of information collected previously through household surveys. This allowed us to answer the question of whether or not, and to what extent, Spanish housing markets capitalise the value of EE. We apply the hedonic-price technique and observe that More energy efficient dwellings have a price premium between 5.4% and 9.8% compared to those with the same characteristics but lower EE level.

Mapping the socioeconomic landscape of rural Sweden: towards a typology of rural areas, Regional Studies. Definitions of the rural have been the subject of numerous academic papers. This paper argues that the a priori urban-rural continuum model should be abandoned in favour of a more open approach. In advancing this argument, a socioeconomic typology of rural Sweden is developed by means of cluster analysis. A total of 3983 areas were sorted into five clusters and 16 sub-clusters. One-third of the rural population lives in the middle-class countryside within the urban shadow (12%) and working-class countryside within the urban shadow (22%); the bulk of the rural population lives in countryside outside the urban shadow (25%) and manufacturing periphery (28%); and a smaller share resides in the resource periphery (12%). It is concluded that location-specific typologies based on high-resolution data that avoid a priori assumptions of rurality give great insight into rural heterogeneity.","[Hedlund, Martin] Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Stipendiegrand 6A, SE-90730 Umea, Sweden",Umea University,"Hedlund, M (通讯作者)，Umea Univ, Dept Geog & Econ Hist, Stipendiegrand 6A, SE-90730 Umea, Sweden.",martin.hedlund@geography.umu.se,,,Swedish Research Council Formas,Swedish Research Council Formas(Swedish Research Council Formas),The author is grateful to The Swedish Research Council Formas funding the research.,,56,40,43,4,85,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The study employs ARDL approach to investigate the long run relationship between carbon emissions and a set of economic and financial variables, an Error Correction Model (ECM) to capture the short run dynamics, Granger causality in an augmented VAR framework to check the causality direction, and variance decomposition based on an estimated Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) to determine the relative contributions of economic and financial variables to the evolution of per capita carbon emissions. The periods considered were the full sample (1971-2011), and a reduced sample sub-period (1988-2011) that corresponded to greater liberalization and financial sector development. The financial variables played a role in emission mitigation only in the latter period where greater degree of liberalization and financial sector development occurred. Even then the relative magnitude of emissions mitigation attributable to financial variables was much smaller compared to the emissions raising impact of rising per capita incomes. This underscores the need for adopting other mitigation policies for reducing carbon footprints in those emerging economies where a sufficient degree of financial deepening and financial sector development has not yet taken place.

However, it could be more realistic to consider that the dynamics generating economic growth take place at a smaller spatial scale. Potential heterogeneity across local areas might be not correctly quantified if the analysis is made at an aggregated geographical scale, which produces the so-called modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). The objective of this paper is to explore to which extent MAUP has an effect on convergence analysis, in particular in the empirical estimation of -convergence equations. First, we show how aggregation of spatial data can generate a problem of bias in the OLS estimator of -convergence equations from cross-sectional data, as well as inflating its variance. Second, by means of a numerical simulation, we quantify the effect of geographical aggregation on the estimates of -convergence. Our experiment is based on real spatial structures of aggregated and disaggregated data for different countries, and it numerically illustrates how a modification in the spatial scale has a significant effect on this type of studies.","[Diaz Dapena, Alberto; Fernandez Vazquez, Esteban; Rubiera Morollon, Fernando] Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab, REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain",University of Oviedo,"Morollón, FR (通讯作者)，Univ Oviedo, Reg Econ Lab, REGIOlab, Oviedo, Spain.",frubiera@uniovi.es,"Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/L-8372-2019","Fernández-Vázquez, Esteban/0000-0001-9192-8901; Diaz-Dapena, Alberto/0000-0001-9343-5166",,,,,38,11,12,0,10,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

However, their development faces two critical issues: the uncontrollable generation variability, and the high levelized cost. These two issues impede the development of renewables substitution for a government from lacking of clearly argument of how to promote renewables substitution, and what is the role of traditional generation resources should play to back up the renewable energies in a target year. This study aims to depict the possibility of the concerned topic from the aspects of economy, security, and environment, taking a top-down viewpoint of policy making to address an energy supply problem, and proposes an Energy Supply-Mix Model by considering the complimentary and substitution possibilities between renewable and non-renewable energies, and also among the renewable energies. The solution provides an overall assessment of three aspects under the conditions of supply and demand balance, desired generation percentage of renewable energies, and also ensure no shortage in peak-hour demand. Parametric analysis on the carbon tax is particularly conducted for policy making reference. This study takes Taiwan as a case and performs the scenario analysis according to the recent energy policies. The results have shown that the proposed model can effectively support a decision body for policy formulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, an integrated choice and latent variable model tracing the impact of decision uncertainty on the valuation of flood risk reductions in the Netherlands is developed. The proposed model structure is not subject to the potential endogeneity bias and measurement error issues associated with most applied methods. The driving factors of decision uncertainty are identified through stated choices and a set of self-reported decision uncertainty follow-up questions. The model simultaneously accounts for the impact of decision uncertainty on individual choices and welfare estimates. In the presented case study uncertain respondents are found to make more random choices and select the opt out option more often. Willingness-to pay for flood risk reductions increases after accounting for these behavioural responses to decision uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, while Italy did join Continental European countries in developing such an institutional arrangement, this was differently shaped in the different territorial areas of the country.

Analysis results reveal that provincial energy and carbon intensity targets can be achieved in the assumed carbon mitigation scenarios with carbon cap, ETS, and clean energy development policies. While the carbon constraint exerts negative impacts on the economy, GDP loss could be lowered by the ETS and RE policies. The RE scenario is more economically efficient than the ETS scenario, and coupling the RE and ETS scenarios appears to be the most economically efficient scenario to achieve the desired carbon and energy intensity targets. One of the benefits of the low-carbon policy is its improvement of the energy security of Guangdong in terms of reduced reliance on external coal and oil; in particular, Guangdong coal consumption could peak in 2017-2019.

Twenty-three states direct reporting to FracFocus; additionally, companies in other states use this registry. FracFocus contains the most comprehensive dataset on fracturing chemicals but faces data quality and transparency criticisms. In response, FracFocus announced upgrades, and since May 2015, publishes aggregated data. We used Linux and R version 3.2.0 to clean and analyze 96,449 forms submitted between March 9, 2011 and April 13, 2015 for accuracy, completeness, and timeliness. We characterize data, and compare results to state law and industry practice, to suggest how to induce more accurate and complete disclosures. We find that rates of withheld chemical information have increased since 2013, and appear unaffected by different legal requirements. However, when companies report fracturing chemicals without attribution to the specific products in the fracturing fluid (a systems approach to reporting), withholding rates drop four-fold. State deadlines shortened reporting timelines, but compliance rates are low absent indication states will enforce. Automatic field population and prompts in FracFocus can reduce data error, while enforcement signals, education, and harmonized requirements may boost compliance and enhance disclosure. Systems reporting should occur, with states retaining authority to request product-specific ingredient lists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This situation is caused mainly by drug control policy in which prices are set by the three countries where the drugs are cheapest. With this method of regulating Czech Republic is one of the countries where the drugs are cheapest. Distributors pay to access pricing arbitrage.

The Kaya identity has been widely used for that purpose in order to disaggregate carbon emissions into various driving forces. In this paper, it is applied for the analysis of emissions resulting from energy use at three different scales. First, a decomposition analysis of the carbon emissions for the complete Swiss energy system is presented using the future projections from the Swiss Energy Strategy 2050. The Kaya identity is then applied to the Swiss building sector after it is adapted with factors that are more relatable to building parameters, such as floor area instead of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Finally, the last level of analysis is a small scale community energy system for a unique Swiss village that aims to significantly reduce its emissions. An energy strategy is developed and its effectiveness is assessed with the adapted Kaya identity and benchmarked against the Swiss average values. The presented method demonstrates how the performance of buildings under various retrofitting scenarios can be benchmarked against future emission targets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The main aim of this article was to analyse the key determinants of the development of cross-border cooperation in the BSR, an EU macroregion. Based on literature studies, the BSR was delimited, proposing a definition of this area that is the most beneficial from economic point of view. Having performed an analysis of documents and economic data, it was proven that macroregional cooperation supports territorial cooperation in the BSR in a significant way. For this purpose, the financing devices of territorial cooperation, i.e. cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation programmes, were analysed. It was proven that the priorities of these programmes comply with the priorities of the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region. Furthermore, an attempt was made to analyse the organisational resources of cross-border cooperation, with particular focus on Euroregions and European groupings of territorial cooperation. A diagnosis of the state was made based on secondary and primary data obtained from interviews. It was shown that the organisational structure is not fully efficient, which is a barrier to the development of cross-border cooperation (C) 2016 The Authors.

In view of the expected growth of the sector, the emissions from waterborne transport are a key concern. When at berth, ships typically use their auxiliary engines to generate electrical power for communications, lighting, ventilation and other on-board equipment. The extended use of vessels' auxiliary engines augments greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and air pollution in the adjacent ports, which are typically located in or near densely populated areas, thus leading to dangerous health and environmental effects. Shore Side Electricity (SSE) is an option for reducing the unwanted environmental impacts of ships at berth, i.e. GHG emissions, other air pollutants (NOx, SOx, PM) and noise of ships using their auxiliary engines.

The analysis identifies the conditions under which water reforms, flood damages, and climate change could lead to larger optimal water-project capacities. We also systematically analyze the relation between water-project capacities and water-conservation technologies (e.g., drip irrigation) and identify the conditions under which they are complements.

We present a sectoral diffusion analysis framework, which we apply to identify and examine developments in technical, economic, institutional, cultural and ecological domains that all contributed to an emergent and thorough CHP diffusion in the Dutch greenhouse sector. Five identified key drivers behind the CHP diffusion are the opening of the energy market in 2002, the high spark spread during the transition period, the compatibility of output of a CHP unit with greenhouse demand, the flexibility provided by heat buffers, and the cooperative and competitive greenhouse sector culture. We conclude that policies to stimulate or steer technology diffusion will benefit from an in-depth analysis of domain interactions and company decision-making processes. Such an in-depth analysis makes for well informed and targeted policies that are better able to steer an industrial sector effectively and in a socially desired direction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We identify three different structural oil shocks via sign restrictions: an oil supply shock, an oil demand shock driven by global economic activity and an oil-specific demand shock. The main results suggest that economic activity and prices respond very differently to oil price shocks depending on their types. In particular, an oil supply shock has a limited impact, while a demand shock driven by global economic activity has a significant positive effect in all four Asian countries examined. Our finding also includes that policy tools such as interest rates and exchange rates help mitigating the effects of supply shocks in Japan and Korea; however, they can be more actively used in response to demands shocks.

Specifically, the USD/EUR exchange rate likely adjusted to the sudden economic growth outlook divergence between the US and the EU, as evident by the relative short term interest rate spread measures, and triggered a strong dollar trade, which is negative for the crude oil prices. Thus, in our view, the 2014 oil price bust is another episode of oil price inefficiency, similar to the 2008 oil bubble. The key argument presented in this article is that, as long as there are temporary economic growth divergences between the US and the EU, the resulting exchange rate volatility is likely to create the pricing inefficiencies in crude oil, which in fact are mean-reverting, as the economic growth divergences eventually dissipate.

In response, the Dutch government initiated a gas-hub strategy, which is the policy to transform the gas industry from an export-oriented business into a transit-oriented business. This policy included a number of investments in the gas infrastructure as well as institutional reforms to enhance the liquidity of the gas market. We study the effects of this gas-hub policy. Using hourly data on the Dutch gas balance over the period 2006-2013, we find that gas storage and trading have become more important, but-that the level of gas in transit in the Netherlands remained fairly constant Consequently, the Dutch gas industry is still mainly oriented on domestic production and export of gas, while the Dutch gas hub (UP) has become a key virtual trading place. The policy lesson from the Dutch experience is that implementing a gas-hub strategy requires significant investments in the gas infrastructure, while their effects do not necessarily become visible in the short run.

In this paper, a two-stage network DEA framework is applied to evaluate the efficiency of energy saving and emission reduction in China during the period of the eleventh five-year plan, from 2006 to 2010. In this study, economic activities are divided into production and treatment processes. This is different from previous research which generally focused on either environmental efficiency or energy efficiency, omitting the integration of energy and environmental measures. Today, energy saving and emission reduction are both parts of the basic state policy of China and are equally important. The empirical results in this study show that: (i) eastern China has the best energy saving and emission reduction efficiency, performing is better than western and central China. (ii) The efficiency of the production process in central China is better than that in western China while the western area performs better than the central area in term of treatment efficiency. (iii) Integrated efficiency of energy saving and emission reduction of China was relatively stable in the five years and the pollution treatment efficiency maintained a rising trend.

Regulators offer agricultural producers payments to reduce their emissions for some price per ton relative to the social price of carbon. Abstracting from distributional concerns or costly transfers, we derive optimal contracts for offsets contracts, minimizing welfare losses from adverse selection. The model shows how the level of monitoring and the prices offered should vary depending on the regulator's information. Although existing and proposed policies discount the price that offset producers receive relative to the social cost of carbon to account for the adverse selection, our model argues that optimal offset prices may be above the social cost of carbon for sufficiently high levels of monitoring. Our model also identifies and quantifies the types of firms that produce additional offsets for a given contract, offering guidance on how regulators might better target offset contracts.

We introduce a novel methodology to estimate the conditional expectation, which characterizes the impact of a decision maker's ambiguity attitude on asset prices. Our point estimates of the ambiguity parameter are between 25 and 60, whereas our risk aversion estimates are considerably lower. The substantial difference indicates that market participants are ambiguity averse. Furthermore, we evaluate if ambiguity aversion helps explaining the cross-section of expected returns. Compared with Epstein and Zin preferences, we find that incorporating ambiguity into the decision model improves the fit to the data while keeping relative risk aversion at more reasonable levels.

Furthermore, in order to capture the differences in this relationship, the full sample is divided into various subsamples based on countries' income levels, regional locations and OECD memberships. This framework is argued and found to be appropriate since the causal links and inferences arising therefrom differ considerably among the subsamples, which led us to conclude that the electricity-growth nexus is highly sensitive to regional differences, countries' income levels, urbanization rates and supply risks.

We tackle both at the same time: agglomeration externalities (Marshall, Porter, Jacobs) from census microdata, and firm data from the Community Innovation Survey. Importantly, we allow for sectoral heterogeneity of agglomeration forces. We find that the firm characteristics, including those that proxy for absorptive capacity', have a much stronger relationship with the propensity to innovate than regular agglomeration externalities. The latter are only statistically significant for a few specific sectors, and even then only for some types of innovation. Sorting of innovation-prone firms into specific locations might therefore be much more important to explain spatial patterns of innovation than agglomeration externalities.","[Smit, Martijn J.; de Groot, Henri L.

When transport costs are high, the region with a more valuable natural resource enjoys a higher welfare than the other region. However, as transport costs decrease, firms begin to move out of the region, causing the Dutch disease to occur, initially in terms of industry share, and eventually in terms of welfare too when transport is sufficiently free. A resource boom in intermediate inputs may strengthen the tendency for manufacturing agglomeration in the same region, but a resource boom in consumption inputs will weaken this tendency. The model thus provides insight for cities to utilize their limited resources efficiently. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike FLQ, which has one unique -value for all industries in a region, SFLQ allows for a variation in the exponential parameter value of for each industrial sector in order to capture specialization and to reduce the tendency for overestimation or underestimation of each of the industries in a given region. Since the national and regional survey data are available for South Korea, this study evaluates and compares the results for SFLQ against those of other non-survey techniques. The findings prove that SFLQ is superior to other LQs, including FLQ and augmented FLQ. In addition, empirical evidence shows that the optimal values for the exponential parameters vary drastically among industries. SFLQ provides more detailed information on regional industries with individual values, which is definitely helpful when analyzing regional specialization and shifts in industrial structure. Furthermore, to determine the optimal exponential value in FLQ and SFLQ in advance, Flegg's and Kowalewski's regression models are tested with the use of Korean data. The statistics indicate that the regression equations are debatable and still need major improvement.","[Zhao, Xiaoyun] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Econ, Rizhao 276800, Peoples R China; [Choi, Sung-Goan] Andong Natl Univ, Dept Econ, Andong 36729, South Korea",Qufu Normal University; Andong National University,"Choi, SG (通讯作者)，Andong Natl Univ, Dept Econ, 1375 Gyeongdong Ro, Andong 36729, South Korea.",niethy@163.com; sgchoi@anu.ac.kr,"Li, Huizhen/JPX-2563-2023",,,,,,27,16,16,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

Exposure to these air pollutants is recognized as a major contribution to ill health in the region. Here we discuss new strategies to reduce air pollution. Regulations and subsidies focusing on improved combustion by providing drier wood fuel and better stoves have been in effect since 2007. However, air pollution due to combustion of wood fuel has been steadily rising, along with reports on health consequences. The paper analyzes a survey of 2025 households in the city of Valdivia, which found that wood fuel quality, stove renewal, and awareness of programs are strongly affected by income level, and that higher consumption of wood fuel is found in households already having better stoves and drier wood fuel. The analysis suggests that regulations intended to improve combustion are influenced by user's behavior and have limited potential for lowering pollution. We conclude that thermal refurbishment has a larger potential for improvement, not yet been implemented as an energy policy for the majority. Here we propose improvements and additions to current programs to enhance effectiveness and cover the whole social spectrum. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Lastly, we find that university involvement in these projects tempers job losses among projects discontinued early as well as job growth among those that commercialized their technologies.

Our econometric analysis shows that firms adopt El on the basis of some firm specific and relational factors, while usual drivers such as R&D have no impact. The evidence from our study supports the role of regional factors related to waste management and policy, that is, firms located in regions featuring better separated waste collection and stricter waste policy are more likely to adopt El.

The current energy and exergy flows are shown based on a categorisation by climatic regions with the aim of understanding the impact of local characteristics on regional efficiencies. Due to the limited data currently available, the study is supported by the development of a detailed archetype-based stock model using Energy Plus as a first law analysis tool combined with an existing exergy analysis method. Twenty-one reference models were created to estimate the electric and gas use in the sector. The results indicate that sectoral energy and exergy annual input are 95.37 PJ and 94.28 PJ, respectively. Regional exergy efficiencies were found to be 17.8%, 16.6% and 23.2% for the hot-dry, hot-humid and temperate climates, respectively. The study concludes that significant potential for improvements still exists, especially in the cases of space conditioning, lighting, refrigeration, and cooking where most exergy destructions occur. Additionally, this work highlights that the method described may be further used to study the impact of large-scale refurbishments and promote national regulations and standards for sustainable buildings that takes into consideration energy and exergy indicators.

This paper analyses foreign direct investment (FDI) in Suzhou municipality, China, known for the Sunan model of development based on township and village enterprises. Suzhou has been remaking its development model by attracting FDI and making itself an innovative place. It is argued that local states play an important, yet diminishing, role in FDI location, with the rising significance of agglomeration effects. However, foreign ventures tend to network among themselves. They remain thinly embedded with local economies and strategic coupling rarely exists. Four mismatches - technological, structural, institutional and spatial - are proposed to explain this weak embeddedness. Suzhou's development path requires expansion of endogenous capacities.","[Wei, Y. H. Dennis] Univ Utah, Dept Geog, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Wei, Y. H.

While they are still extensively used in productive farming, part of the irrigated area is gradually being taken over by peri-urban habitat and business and industrial parks. As a result, some parts of the canal network have now been abandoned, either built over or turned into dumping grounds for refuse and waste. Ignorance about the usefulness of these canals and the role they play in draining has led to frequent flooding after severe Mediterranean storms. But these canals are also the backdrop for rapidly developing urban uses and practices. For one, the water is increasingly used to irrigate private gardens, municipal green spaces and golf courses. On a recreational level, the canals have become a site for numerous practices in recent years: walking, jogging, cycling, horseback riding, fishing, as well as swimming and kayaking. Our paper is based on findings from sociological research into the new urban uses of agricultural canals in southern France. First we will point up the diverse nature and complexity of their management. Then we will address their long-term and sustainable maintenance by examining the different options that exist for their governance into the future (C) 2015 The Authors.

Therefore, Participatory Action Research (PAR) was applied to Sangkhom District, Nong Khai Province. Tools and techniques such as observation, in-depth interview, preliminary meetings, inter-group meetings and workshops were used to gain stakeholders' participation. During the PAR process, community-based ecotourism plans were draft and revised by stakeholders, which included public and private sectors at the destination. The implementations of the plans were well supported by stakeholders, especially local residents. Besides gaining local participation and enhancing stakeholders' awareness in tourism environmental (natural, social and culture) conservation, the outcomes from the PAR process included enhancing tourist carrying capacity, empowering local residents in decision making towards community tourism issues, and some new local products with local branding. Thus, community-based ecotourism can be defined as a type of sustainable tourism because in this study, it was not only empowered local residents to make decision in tourism planning in their jurisdictions but also strengthen social and human capital at the destination which would forward to the next generation for continuing tourism development.

This article concerns threat information exchange. Without information exchange a cyber-security system's functionality is severely hampered. An event might not trigger a specific danger threshold if attacks are stealthy and targeted. But the same attack, if information is gathered and correlated from different sources around an organization's network it might hit that specific threshold, and also hit an alarm point which will be much more visible to a human operator. In different studies it is demonstrated that a single hit can make the difference from an incident which is categorized as important and treated in a timely manner or, in the other scenario which is categorized as usual traffic and left uninvestigated. Information regarding cyber threats, when exchanged between entities involved in the same field of action permits transforming information into intelligence. The theme discussed in the present paper is focused on intelligent threat exchange, which makes different checks and decisions before sending different information in a secure manner. Any attack detail can be used by a third party for exploiting different vulnerable resources from the protected organization, if discovered. Another thorny problem of the current cyber security state is that of standardizing the way security incident information is normalized and packed for transport. This latter problem is also delved into in the current article. The experimental setup is built on top of a neural network and an evolved SIEM like infrastructure, for collecting, analyzing and sharing threat information.","Mil Tech Acad, Bucharest, Romania",,"Ionita, MG (通讯作者)，Mil Tech Acad, Bucharest, Romania.",mihai_ionita01@hotmail.com,,,,,,,9,0,0,0,5,BUCHAREST UNIV ECONOMIC STUDIES-ASE,BUCHAREST,"6, PIATA ROMA, 1ST DISTRICT, POSTAL OFFICE 22, BUCHAREST, 010374, ROMANIA",2284-7472,,,INT CONF INFORM ECON,,,2015,,,,,,,63,67,,,,,,5,"Business, Finance; Economics; Information Science & Library Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Information Science & Library Science,BD6ZZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000362796900011,0

The first experiment evaluated the growth and performance of three varieties (early maturing: EM, medium maturing: MM and late maturing: LM) of maize (Zea mays L), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The second experiment evaluated maize and sorghum response to water conservation and three fertiliser rates (0, 20 and 40 kg N/ha). The third experiment assessed the effect of water conservation measures on crop yields of common bean and pigeon pea grown under three plant densities (low, medium and high). Tied ridge tillage was used as the water conservation measure and disc plough as the control in the second and third experiments. Maize, sorghum, pigeon pea and common bean took more than 180, 245, 217 and 95 days respectively, to reach physiological maturity. The MM maize variety (DK8031), EM pigeon pea variety (ICPL 84091) and LM common bean variety (GLP 24) yielded the greatest grain of 4,938, 881 and 620 kg/ha respectively, among the respective crop varieties. The sorghum varieties were attacked by fungal and rust diseases leading to yield losses in all seasons. Soil water conservation in general did not have a significant effect on crop yield though there were yield improvements. In the plant density trial, the medium plant densities of pigeon pea (33,333 pl/ha) and common bean (148,148 pl/ha) resulted in the greatest grain yields. The highest grain yield of maize (4,184 kg/ha) and sorghum (47 kg/ha) was obtained in plots with 20 kg/ha of nitrogen fertilizer. Based on the results of this study, pigeon pea and common bean can be introduced in the farming systems to improve crop diversity. The production of the tested sorghum varieties should be discouraged in this region because they are prone to fungal and rust diseases due to the cold and wet weather conditions.","[Miriti, Joseph M.; Esilaba, Anthony O.; Kimani, Stephen K.; Njeru, Peterson M.; Lekasi, John K.] Kenya Agr Res Inst, POB 30148-00200, Nairobi, Kenya; [Rao, Karuturi P.

Hydrogels have been widely proposed over the last 40 years for agricultural use with the aim to ameliorate water availability for plants, by increasing water holding properties of growing media (soils or soilless substrates). Most of the traditional hydrogels on the market are acrylate-based products, thus not biodegradable. Due to the increasing attention for environmental protection issues, biodegradable hydrogels arise lively interest for potential commercial application in agriculture. In this study, we evaluated a novel class of cellulose-based superabsorbent hydrogels, totally biodegradable and biocompatible, for agricultural use. The objectives of the tests carried out were: 1) to verify the ability of the hydrogel to modify the water retention properties of the growing media (soils and soilless substrates); 2) to study the effects on the growth of plants grown on media amended with the hydrogel. Water retention curve of a sandy soil amended with 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% (w/w) of hydrogel was determined using a Richard's pressure plate apparatus. The hydrogel modified the soil water retention properties. The soil moisture at field capacity increased with the highest hydrogel percentage up to 400% compared to the not amended soil, and at wilting point (-15 bar) was similar to that at field capacity of the not amended soil. When added to perlite, a low water holding capacity soilless substrate, 1 or 2% (w/w) of hydrogel increased the container capacity of 28 and 48%, respectively, with no decrease of air capacity. Tests revealed absence of phytotoxicity of the hydrogel, and cultivation trials on cucumber (on soil) and sweet basil (in soilless conditions) showed a general overall enhancement of plant growth and quality when hydrogel was added to growing media. The tested hydrogel showed to be suitable for potential use in agriculture. Its employment should be further evaluated under a cost-effective perspective.

The present thesis aims at keeping the housing price at a reasonable level so that the purpose of stabilizing the housing price can be achieved.","[Wang Junjie] Cent S Univ, Cent Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Chen Haibo] Sch Cent South Univ, Changsha 410000, Hunan, Peoples R China",Central South University; University System of Ohio; Central State University,"Wang, JJ (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Cent Univ, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",math_wjj@csu.edu.cn,,,,,,,11,0,0,0,3,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",,,978-1-60595-243-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,554,559,,,,,,6,"Economics; Management; Political Science; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Government & Law; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BD4UB,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000361112900103,0

The number of outward FDIs in manufacturing activities is negatively associated with productivity growth in the home region, but investments in sales, distribution and marketing are associated with a boost in local productivity. This is driven especially by investments towards non-European Union locations.

The paper provides two important contributions to the literature. First, we extend the existing research by utilizing the method of Robust Least Squares to estimate a multivariate market capitalization model that controls for firm type. Second, we document the impacts that oil and gas reserves to production ratios have on market capitalization. This is a key finding in the context of discounted net cash flow models and the findings suggest there is an optimal tradeoff between current and future production, given current volumes of reserves, the latter of which is valued positively by the market. Moreover, this optimal tradeoff or the optimal profit-maximizing intertemporal production choice is unique to the type of hydrocarbon being considered. Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of capital structure in the heavily capital intensive oil and gas industry. The results from this research should benefit both oil and gas companies and investors. Specifically, the results provide new and robust information as to the empirical relationships between key determinants of oil and gas company market valuations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although many studies have focused on the EKC, only a few empirical studies have focused on analyzing the EKC with specific reference to Indonesia, and none of them have examined the potential of renewable energy sources within the EKC framework. This study attempts to estimate the EKC in the case of Indonesia for the period of 1971-2010 by considering the role of renewable energy in electricity production, using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to cointegration as the estimation method. We found an inverted U-shaped EKC relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions in the long run. The estimated turning point was found to be 7729 USD per capita, which lies outside of our sample period. The beneficial impacts of renewable energy on CO2 emission reduction are observable both in the short run and in the long run. Our work has important implications both for policymakers and for the future development of renewable energy in Indonesia. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a dynamic computable general equilibrium model that explicitly allows for allowance banking and for a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis at the EU Member State level. We find that tightening the cap provides an ad hoc solution to the fundamental issue of the robustness of the effective carbon price, while introducing a price component to the ETS brings structural carbon price support in times of negative demand shocks for emission allowances. These price-based policies still benefit from the intertemporal flexibility through the banking provision in the EU ETS by re-allocating emissions over time with stronger emission reductions in early years and emission increases in later years. A higher emission price has a larger negative impact on the new Member States' economies than on other Member States. Furthermore, introducing a carbon tax in addition to the EU ETS decreases the price of allowances, resulting in welfare gains for net buyers of allowances while net sellers are worse off.

In the context of a recent shift from quantity to price-based support, the UK has also introduced a new form of budgetary framework, the Levy Control Framework (LCF). The introduction of the LCF has been very important for investors but has received relatively little attention in the academic literature. The paper gives an overview of the LCF, explores its effects on renewables policy, on consumers and on investor confidence arguing that an unintended consequence of its introduction has been to increase uncertainty, through interactions with underlying support mechanisms. A number of problems with the current scope and design of the LCF are noted. It is argued that the LCF is best understood as aimed at avoiding a political backlash against renewable support policy in a context where the benefits of such policy are concentrated economically and socially. The paper concludes by placing the LCF within a wider context of a shift towards greater budgetary control over renewable energy support policy across European countries. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The proposed comprehensive framework distinguishes three broad categories of factors underlying the IDR for household adoption of energy-efficient technologies (EETs): preferences (notably over time, risk, loss, debt, and the environment), predictable (ir)rational behavior (bounded rationality, rational inattention, behavioral biases), and external barriers to energy efficiency. Existing empirical findings suggest that the factors underlying the IDRs that differ across household characteristics and technologies should be accounted for in energy models. Furthermore, the framework allows for a fresh look at the interplay of IDRs and policies. We argue that a simple observation of high IDRs (or observing correlations between IDRs and socio-economic characteristics) does not provide guidance for policy making since the underlying sources cannot be identified. Instead, we propose that some of the factors underlying the IDR - notably external barriers - can be changed (through directed policy interventions) whereas other factors - notably preferences and predictable (ir)rational behavior - are innate and can only be taken into account (through reactive policy interventions).

We pioneered a new feedstock supply model in which the formal official organization of villagers' committees is introduced. Different from the previous feedstock supply patterns, the immaterial utility of relative stakeholders and the impact of villagers' committees on farmers' behavior are considered in this paper. To compare this pattern's performance with that of the conventional ones, this paper developed a multi-agent model specifically for China's situation. We applied the model to simulate the operation of a biomass supply chain. The results show that the proposed feedstock supply pattern can significantly increase the profits of biomass plants, biomass supply amounts, and farmers' participation, and in contrast with the broker pattern, it can lower feedstock prices through disintermediation. Sensitivity analyses show that preferential feed-in tariffs are still necessary for biomass power and that the new pattern can ease the government's subsidy burdens. Additionally, farmers' opportunity costs for supplying biomass, their perceptions of immaterial utility and the cooperative's financial resource schemes of the public welfare fund all have differing impacts on the achievement of the new pattern.

In a randomised control trial, we formulate different treatments such as feedback information and norms, as well as prize competition among subjects. We show that information and norms lead to a sharp - more than 20% - reduction in overall energy consumption. Because participants do not pay for their energy consumption this response cannot be driven by cost saving incentives. Interestingly, when combining feedback and norms with a prize competition for achieving low energy consumption, the reduction effect - while present initially - disappears in the long run. This could suggest that external rewards reduce and even destroy intrinsic motivation to change behaviour. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

While clinical evidence of catch-up has been observed, less clear is the ability to correct for chronic malnutrition found in impoverished environments in the absence of extensive and focused interventions. This paper investigates whether nutritional status at early age affects nutritional status a few years later among children, using panel data from China, South Africa and Nicaragua. The key research question is the extent to which state dependence in linear growth exists among young children, and what family and community level factors mediate state dependency. The answer to this question is crucial for public policy due to the long-term economic consequences of poor childhood nutrition. Results show strong but not perfect persistence in nutritional status across all countries, indicating that catch-up growth is possible though unobserved household behaviours tend to worsen the possibility of catch-up growth. Public policy that can influence these behaviours, especially when children are under 24 months old, can significantly alter nutrition outcomes in South Africa and Nicaragua.","[Handa, Sudhanshu] Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, CB 3435 Abernathy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA; [Handa, Sudhanshu; Peterman, Amber] UNICEF Off Res Innocenti, I-50122 Florence, Italy",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill; Istituto degli Innocenti,"Handa, S (通讯作者)，Univ N Carolina, Dept Publ Policy, CB 3435 Abernathy Hall, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 USA.",shanda@email.unc.edu; apeterman@unicef.org,,"Peterman, Amber/0000-0002-3921-5936",NICHD NIH HHS [P2C HD050924] Funding Source: Medline,NICHD NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD)),,,58,11,13,1,12,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-9049,1468-0084,,OXFORD B ECON STAT,Oxf.

However, some of these policies have not been well performed due to many constraints, particularly the lack of innovative business models and financing mechanisms. This paper looks into this issue through the approach of combining literature review and interactive research, including interactions with managers from China's policy and commercial banks and PV projects. A comprehensive literature review on DSPV business models and financing mechanisms are firstly reviewed. Then the rapid evolving business models and financing mechanisms in the United States are examined, which provides some insights for China. Subsequent to this, the existing innovative business models and financing mechanisms for DSPV deployment in China and challenges facing them are discussed. Built on this discussion, policy recommendations are provided at the end of the paper. This study provides some insights for renewable energy policy makers in China as well as in other countries.

Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE) we employ a willingness to accept framework to estimate the external effects of wind turbines on local residents with the inclusion of community consultation and to quantify the compensation required to permit wind farms to be built in Ireland. Our findings reveal that the majority of respondents are willing to make (monetary) tradeoffs to allow for wind power initiatives and we find that respondents require less compensation if provision is made for a community representative and setback distance is increased.

From a non-innovator to a high-innovation performer: networking as a driver, Regional Studies. This paper explores the patterns of networking benefits gained through collaboration by small firms. The empirical evidence is based on data gathered from 708 Finnish firms with fewer than 50 employees. Separate analyses are conducted for the manufacturing and service businesses. The study demonstrates how the benefits gained through collaboration change along with the journey from a non-innovator to a high-innovation performer. In general, the results suggest that the focus of innovation policies should be shifted from innovations to innovators. In addition, these policies should promote networking activities not only to innovation exploration but also to innovation exploitation.","[Forsman, Helena] Univ Winchester, Winchester Business Sch, Winchester SO22 4NR, Hants, England; [Temel, Serdal] Ege Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey",University of Winchester; Ege University,"Forsman, H (通讯作者)，Univ Winchester, Winchester Business Sch, Winchester SO22 4NR, Hants, England.;Temel, S (通讯作者)，Ege Univ, Ctr Sci & Technol, TR-35100 Izmir, Turkey.",helena.forsman@hforsman.com; serdal.temel@ege.edu.tr,"Temel, Serdal/I-4059-2019","Temel, Serdal/0000-0002-6391-7372",,,,,46,4,4,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

However, it is still unclear how effective different policy incentives are. Also, it is questionable that they have the same impact on different groups of people. In this study, based on a stated-choice experiment, the effect of several potential policy incentives on EV-adoption, as well as the influence of socio-psychological determinants are investigated, using constructs of the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM) and the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT). The probability of stated EV-adoption increases if policy incentives are offered in the choice experiment, which is expected because of the decrease of the generalized cost of EV-use. The high stated valuation of free parking or access to bus lanes makes those incentives an efficient alternative to expensive subsidies. EV-adoption probability increases for people that are further in the process of behavioural change. However, the responsiveness to subsidies decreases for people in more advanced stages of-change. People that believe EVs to be effective in decreasing the negative externalities of the current transport system and people whose travel patterns can cope with the use of EVs also have a higher probability to choose the EV.

In this study the strong effects of the installation context will be analyzed using a customized use phase model for each location. The cost effectiveness of these devices has been proved without credits in Mondovi (IT), New York (NY) and Minneapolis (MN) where the payback time goes from 10 to 7 years. Considering the credits, it is possible to obtain economic feasibility also in Chicago (IL) and reduce the payback for other cities to values from 4 to 6 years. In other cities like Phoenix (AZ) and Houston (TX) the payback can't be reached in any case. The life cycle impact assessment analysis has shown how, even in the cities with cleaner electricity grid, there is a reduction in the emissions of both greenhouse gases and pollutants.

To explore this internal relationship, we developed a Matlab simulation system and simulated the impact of rent-seeking from each level of the supervision department on coal mine productivity in different scenarios. The results showed the following. (1) Rent seeking had no significant influence on the average level of material productivity but it had an adverse effect on the average level of mental productivity. Due to the effects of rent-seeking, productivity tended to exhibit unstable and destructive fluctuations, and rent-seeking had the dual effect of promoting and restraining productivity in a wide range with a high frequency. (2) In the supervision scenario, supervision by the high-level department was efficient, and productivity was promoted more by the national and provincial supervision department. (3) In the rent-seeking scenario, each level of the department had an intensity threshold above which coal mine accidents occurred. We also propose suggestions that focuses on the improved supervision of Chinese coal mine safety in three areas based on the new normal safety concept. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We develop a system dynamics model to analyse the impact of VRES on the investment decision process and to understand how SoS is affected. We focus on the Swiss electricity market, which is currently undergoing a liberalisation process, and simultaneously faces the encouragement of VRES and a nuclear phase out. Our results show that nuclear production is replaced mainly by PV and imports; the country becomes a net importer. This evolution points to a problem of capacity adequacy. The resulting price rise, together with the subsidies needed to support VRES, lead to a rise in tariffs. In the presence of a high share of hydro, the de-rated margin may give a misleading picture of the capacity adequacy. We thus propose a new metric, the annual energy margin, which considers the energy available from all sources, while acknowledging that hydro-storage can function as a battery. This measure shows a much less reassuring picture of the country's capacity adequacy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

(2) Does telecommuting substitute for household travel? Although these causality issues have received great deal of attention, no multivariate analysis approaches exist. Using the 2006 household travel survey data from the Seoul Metropolitan Area, this study adopts a path analysis to discover the complex relationships between telecommuting, residential/job locations, and household travel. First, the path analysis shows that rather than telecommuting serving as the determinant of location choice, job locations determine the choice to telecommute. Hence, secondary impacts of telecommuting on travel may not occur with location changes as the medium. Second, the analysis also shows that the household head's telecommuting has a positive influence on his/her non-commuting travel in both the person kilometers traveled (PKT) and vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) models and on household members' travel in VKT models. Moreover, the VKT model suggests that the household head's non-commuting travel has a negative impact on the household members' travel. These results indicate that although telecommuting reduces commute travel, this may be offset by other travel demand within the household, owing to exhaustion of the limited travel budget. Thus, planners and policymakers must consider these impacts when evaluating the benefits and costs of telecommuting as an urban management policy.","[Kim, Seung-Nam] Architecture & Urban Res Inst, 701 194 Jeolje Ro, Sejong Si 30103, South Korea",,"Kim, SN (通讯作者)，Architecture & Urban Res Inst, 701 194 Jeolje Ro, Sejong Si 30103, South Korea.",snkim@auri.re.kr,"Kim, Seung-Nam/O-4505-2014","Kim, Seung-Nam/0000-0003-3577-1000","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology [2012R1A1A2009216]; Architecture and Urban Research Institute","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) - Ministry of Education, Science and Technology(Ministry of Education, Science & Technology (MEST), Republic of KoreaNational Research Foundation of Korea); Architecture and Urban Research Institute","The comments of the anonymous reviewers have substantially improved this paper.

Territorial cohesion has emerged as an important objective for European Union authorities, particularly since the Treaty of Lisbon. One important strand of territorial cohesion is citizen access to affordable public infrastructure services. While place of residence may influence use of services, insufficient evidence exists as to whether residence may constitute a disadvantage to citizens as regards service use. This paper assesses this by contrasting citizens' stated and revealed preferences for services in three large countries. Residence frequently conditions expenditure on public infrastructure services and satisfaction with service accessibility and affordability, disadvantaging residents in some territories, posing challenges for territorial cohesion.","[Clifton, Judith; Diaz-Fuentes, Daniel; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos] Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, E-39005 Santander, Spain",Universidad de Cantabria,"Fernández-Gutiérrez, M (通讯作者)，Univ Cantabria, Fac Econ & Business, Dept Econ, Avda Los Castros S-N, E-39005 Santander, Spain.",judith.clifton@unican.es; daniel.diaz@unican.es; marcos.fernandez@unican.es,"Clifton, Judith/E-4462-2013; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/AAY-3954-2020; Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/K-8324-2014","Clifton, Judith/0000-0001-6081-6800; Fernandez-Gutierrez, Marcos/0000-0002-4000-9283; Díaz-Fuentes, Daniel/0000-0002-6290-2363",European Community [266887]; Cornell University,European Community; Cornell University,"This research received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme [Grant Agreement No. 266887 (Project COCOPS)], Socioeconomic Sciences & Humanities.

This paper develops and illustrates a methodology based on data envelopment analysis that could be employed to shed light on this critical issue. Different types of regional innovations are analysed based on a longitudinal analysis of all Swedish counties over a five-year period. The approach can be used to analyse and distinguish between expansion-, catching-up-and shift-based types of regional innovation. Regional innovativeness is shown to be related to the regional levels of entrepreneurial activity.","[Anokhin, Sergey] Kent State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Kent, OH 44242 USA; [Wincent, Joakim; Ylinenpaa, Hakan] Lulea Univ Technol, Dept Business Adm Technol & Social Sci, Div Innovat & Design, S-95187 Lulea, Sweden; [Wincent, Joakim] Hanken Sch Econ, Helsinki, Finland",University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University Kent; Kent State University Salem; Lulea University of Technology; Hanken School of Economics,"Anokhin, S (通讯作者)，Kent State Univ, Coll Business Adm, Dept Mkt & Entrepreneurship, Kent, OH 44242 USA.",sanokhin@kent.edu; joakim.wincent@ltu.se; hakan.ylinenpaa@ltu.se,"Anokhin, Sergey/AAI-8258-2020",,,,,,53,2,2,0,13,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

A clean ideal situation considered in standard spatial econometrics textbooks is when we fit Cliff-Ord-type models to data where the spatial units constitute the full population, there are no missing data, and there is no uncertainty on the spatial observations that are free from measurement and locational errors. Unfortunately in practical cases the reality is often very different and the datasets contain all sorts of imperfections: They are often based on a sample drawn from the whole population, some data are missing and they almost invariably contain both attribute and locational errors. This is a situation of dirty spatial econometric modeling. Through a series of Monte Carlo experiments, this paper considers the effects on spatial econometric model estimation and hypothesis testing of two specific sources of dirt, namely missing data and locational errors.","[Arbia, Giuseppe] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Espa, Giuseppe; Giuliani, Diego] Univ Trento, Trento, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Trento,"Arbia, G (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",giuseppe.arbia@rm.unicatt.it,"arbia, giuseppe/AAD-1772-2022",,,,,,22,13,15,0,18,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The maximum order of integration was determined by using PP and ADF unit root tests. The Toda and Yamamoto test is applied regardless of whether the series are I(0), I(1), or I(2), mutually cointegrated or non-cointegrated. The variables were estimated at level in the unrestricted lag-augmented VAR. The AIC, SC and LR lag criteria were used to determine the optimal lag length. The diagnostics tests were performed at the optimum lag selected by estimating the variables at level and confirmed the stability of the unrestricted VAR model. The empirical evidence showed that there exists a the bi-directional causality from electricity consumption to GDP that implies the validity of feedback hypothesis but no causality was found for GDP and energy consumption supporting the neutrality hypothesis. The estimated results confirmed that both the economic growth and electricity consumption empirically support each other and have a mutual and complementary relationship. But on another hand the energy sector of Russia has no impact on the economic growth for a period 1990-2011. Furthermore, if the Government of Russia devises policies to promote the access of energy and higher level of consumption, economic growth will not be affected. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Empirical results reveal that occupations with similar knowledge requirements tend to coagglomerate, and the importance of shared knowledge is larger in metropolitan areas than in states. An extension to the main analysis finds that, when focusing on metropolitan areas, the largest effects on coagglomeration are due to shared knowledge about engineering and technology, arts and humanities, manufacturing and production, and mathematics and science.","[Gabe, Todd M.] Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 5782 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA; [Abel, Jaison R.] Fed Reserve Bank New York, Res & Stat Grp, 237 Main St,Suite 1200, Buffalo, NY 14203 USA",University of Maine System; University of Maine Orono; Federal Reserve System - USA; Federal Reserve Bank - New York,"Gabe, TM (通讯作者)，Univ Maine, Sch Econ, 5782 Winslow Hall, Orono, ME 04469 USA.",todd.gabe@maine.edu; jaison.abel@ny.frb.org,,,Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station; Hatch Multistate Project of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food Agriculture [ME0-L-7-00525-13 (NE 1049)],Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station; Hatch Multistate Project of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Institute of Food Agriculture,Todd M.

Coordinate distributions of polarization ellipticity (PE) image values were estimated for each sample of PFL in the optical arrangement of the Stokes polarimeter using the method of two-dimensional distributions of Stokes-parameters. RESULTS: The most sensitive statistics to the post-mortem manifestations in terms of changes to liquor polycrystalline optical networks were those for the 3rd and 4th order. They characterized asymmetry and kurtosis (peak sharpness) of coordinate distributions for polarization ellipticity images of polycrystalline films of liquor.

Of people who suffer falls, 20-30% experience mild to severe injuries. Timely assessment of risk factors can prevent some of these falls occurring. PURPOSE OF STUDY: To assess the falls risks factors of patients in nursing departments. METHODS: The study was conducted January to September, 2015 in a Lithuanian long-term care and treatment hospital. The Morse Fall Scale was used for assessment of falls risk, which were evaluated within 48 hours and then after one month of admission to the hospital. RESULTS: The study involved 177 respondents. After one month of admission to the hospital, 129 participants took part in the survey. During the first stage of the study, the difference in falls between the age groups and falls risk was statistically significant (p = 0.019). In addition, statistically significant differences (p = 0.004 and p = 0.000) were found between the patients' cognitive impairment, falls within the past 1-year period, and the risk of falls during 48 hours after hospitalization. After one month of admission to the hospital, it was found that differences in falls risk was not statistically significant among age groups (p = 0.360) or the patients' cognitive impairment (p = 0.200). CONCLUSION: An assessment of patients within 48 hours of hospitalisation revealed a statistically significant difference between the patients having suffered a fall within the past year and the current risk of falls.","[Jakavonyte-Akstiniene, Agne; Macijauskiene, Jurate] Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Med Acad, Fac Nursing, Dept Geriatr, Kaunas, Lithuania",Lithuanian University of Health Sciences,"Jakavonyte-Akstiniene, A (通讯作者)，Lithuanian Univ Hlth Sci, Med Acad, Fac Nursing, Dept Geriatr, Kaunas, Lithuania.",agnuziuke@gmail.com; jurate.macijauskiene@lsmuni.lt,"Jakavonytė-Akstinienė, Agnė/HKV-1127-2023; Macijauskiene, Jurate/AAU-5506-2020","Jakavonytė-Akstinienė, Agnė/0000-0001-9758-9090;",,,,,17,0,0,0,1,CENTRAL BOHEMIA UNIV,PRAGUE 8,"POD VODARENSKOU VEZI 4, PRAGUE 8, 18200, CZECH REPUBLIC",1805-997X,1805-9961,978-80-88042-04-4,PROC CBU,,,2016,4.0,,,,,,642,646,,10.12955/cbup.v4.825,0.0,,,5,"Business; Economics; Multidisciplinary Sciences; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BG8HE,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000392271000095,0

As functionally defined, these economic areas represent the relevant regional markets for labor, products and information. The result of spatial switching regression reveals that the initial gaps between economic areas relative to average global initial per capita income appear to have declined, but the two spatial clubs exhibit a significant difference in their income convergence processes over the period. The estimated coefficient of the convergence parameter for the peripheral spatial regime is negative and highly significant, indicating that a convergence process exists in this spatial regime. However, there is no statistically significant evidence of convergence in the core spatial regime, implying the possibility of different patterns in the growth dynamics of the core spatial regime.","[Lim, Up] Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea",Yonsei University,"Lim, U (通讯作者)，Yonsei Univ, Dept Urban Planning & Engn, 50 Yonsei Ro, Seoul 03722, South Korea.",uplim@yonsei.ac.kr,"Lim, Up/G-7971-2012",,,,,,67,18,21,0,14,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0570-1864,1432-0592,,ANN REGIONAL SCI,Ann.

The most common approach to calculate the economic weights is a bioeconomic modelling of the production system. Economically important traits are defined thought the modelling of herd structure using the Markov processes and iterative procedure, taking the total profit as the criterion of the economic efficiency. Marginal economic weights are expressed as a numerical approximation of the partial derivation of the profit function. These are standardized through genetic standard deviations and then expressed relative to the certain trait or as a proportion on the sum all of traits. Except of the production traits, the functional traits (health, reproduction, survival) and feed efficiency traits are very important for the sustainable and competitive animal production. Next to the economic also the environmental benefit (reduction of emissions through more effective utilisation of feed), ensuring the animal welfare (lower mastitis and claw diseases incidence) and finally the food security and sustainable development of the domestic agriculture should be mentioned. To calculate economic weights, the program package ECOWEIGHT (for cattle and for sheep) can be usefully applied.

This paper aims to analyse the responsiveness of household electricity demand and the welfare effects related to both factors in the 2006-2012 period by applying a demand model estimated with the quantile regression method. The results show that the electricity consumption of medium-high income households is particularly responsive to price increases, whereas that of medium-low income households is more responsive to changes in income. The retail electricity price increases and the economic crisis have led to lower and steeper U-shape price elasticities of demand and higher and steeper N-shape income elasticities of demand. The joint impact of those two factors on the welfare of lower-income households is higher in relative terms (i.e., as a share of household income) than for other income groups. These results suggest that the economic crisis and increases in retail electricity prices have had detrimental welfare effects, especially on the lower-income segment of the population. They should be considered when financing climate and energy policies through the electricity bill and provide a rationale to take such support, which pushes the retail electricity price upwards, out of the electricity bill.

The debate on the causes and consequences of urban sprawl has not led to a widely accepted interpretative framework so far. However, to formulate effective sustainable development policies, a comprehensive analysis of sprawl is becoming more and more urgent in Europe. Through an exploratory data analysis of the spatial distribution of 132 indicators (regarded as socioeconomic and environmental factors of urban sprawl) in 8100 Italian municipalities affected by different levels of settlement dispersion, this study discusses place-specific factors that depend on the socioeconomic context and lead to diverging models of sprawl throughout the country. The illustrated methodology produces an informative base possibly supporting urban containment and sustainable development policies in 'sprawling' regions.","[Salvati, Luca] Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CRA, I-00184 Rome, Italy; [Carlucci, Margherita] Univ Roma La Sapienza, Dipartimento Sci Sociali & Econ, I-00185 Rome, Italy",Consiglio per la Ricerca in Agricoltura e L'analisi Dell'economia Agraria (CREA); Sapienza University Rome,"Salvati, L (通讯作者)，Consiglio Ric Agr & Anal Econ Agr CRA, Via Navicella 2-4, I-00184 Rome, Italy.",luca.salvati@entecra.it; margherita.carlucci@uniroma1.it,"Salvati, Luca/AAS-6179-2021; Carlucci, Margherita/B-7812-2010","Carlucci, Margherita/0000-0001-8907-2649",,,,,62,44,46,0,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The increasing use of renewable energy sources makes this problem even more acute. Various existing technologies, including stationary battery energy storage systems (BESS), can be employed to provide additional power during peak demand times. In the future, integration of on-board batteries of the growing fleet of electric vehicles (EV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) into the grid can provide power during peak demand hours (vehicle-to-grid, or V2G technology). This work provides cost estimates of managing peak energy demands using traditional technologies, such as maneuverable power plants, conventional hydroelectric, pumped storage plants and peaker generators, as well as BESS and V2G technologies. The derived estimates provide both per kWh and kW year of energy supplied to the grid. The analysis demonstrates that the use of battery storage is economically justified for short peak demand periods of <1 h. For longer durations, the most suitable technology remains the use of maneuverable steam gas power plants, gas turbine,reciprocating gas engine peaker generators, conventional hydroelectric, pumped storage plants.

The method proposed in this paper considers a reduced amount of carbon emissions, less than that of the current industry baseline, to be an asset that is beneficial to a firm that adopts a new technology. The measured carbon asset values vary across different technologies, in different industries and over time. The new method is applied to the valuing of wind energy technology and uses the Weibull distribution to estimate the wind energy capacity and a concrete sensitivity analysis. These applications support the validity of the new method and show that the impact of the fluctuations of carbon sinks on the values of carbon assets is significantly greater than that of volatility in the production output. The paper also presents some policy recommendations based on the results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Yet, public support for such a tax increase has been rather low among US residents. We performed eight survey experiments (total N approximately 3000) to examine how selected policy characteristics and persuasive messages influence support for a gasoline tax increase. Several policy characteristics significantly increased support for a gasoline tax increase. Having the increase phased in over five years modestly increased support. Compared with giving the extra revenue to the US Treasury's General Fund, both refunding the extra revenue equally to all American families and having this revenue used for energy efficient transportation strongly increased support. Support for a gasoline tax increase was not affected by the nature of the mechanism to achieve revenue neutrality. Most people supported a 20 cent per gallon tax increase to repair roads and bridges. Explaining how the gasoline tax increase would reduce fuel consumption slightly increased support for a gasoline tax increase, but neither being informed of the high gasoline prices in other advanced industrial countries nor the actual pump price of gasoline at the time of the experiment influenced support for a gasoline tax increase.

This presentation of uncertainty is limited in its provision of context, and as an overall picture of how costs and uncertainty vary over time. This study aims to address these two shortcomings. Two analyses are performed using reported DECC LCOE estimates for three important electricity generation technologies for the UK; nuclear, offshore wind and coal with carbon capture and storage. The first analysis composes LCOE estimate trajectories from previous years' DECC estimates and presents them alongside contextual data, including some out-turn costs. The second quantifies the variability presented in the LCOE estimate trajectories for commissioning dates in the decade 2020-2030. Nuclear costs are presented as both the most consistent and lowest in magnitude. An imminently forecast steep fall in the LCOE of offshore wind raises questions about the timing of investment and deployment. In most cases estimate variability decreases over the estimation horizon, strangely suggesting greater levels of certainty for further flung commissioning dates. Further observations and implications for policy stemming from the analyses are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Because most air pollutants in China are closely related to coal combustion, the restriction of coal consumption is critical to the improvement of the environment in China. In this study, a panel of 29 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2012 is utilized to predict China's coal consumption through 2020. After controlling for the spatial correlation of coal consumption among neighboring provinces, an inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) between coal consumption per capita and GOP per capita in China is detected. Furthermore, based on the estimation results and reasonable predictions of key control variables, China's provincial and national coal consumption through 2020 is forecasted. Specifically, under the benchmark scenario, consumption is expected to continue growing at a decreasing rate until 2020, when China's coal consumption would be approximately 4.43 billion tons. However, if China can maintain relatively high growth rate (an annual growth rate of 7.8 percent), the turning point in total coal consumption would occur in 2019, with projected consumption peaking at 4.16 billion tons.

Four pathways to achieve this target have been developed by the Department of Energy and Climate Change, with all pathways requiring increased us of bioenergy. A significant amount of this could be indigenously sourced from crops, but will increased domestic production of energy crops conflict with other agricultural priorities? To address this question, a coupled analysis of the UK energy system and land use has been developed. The two systems are connected by the production of bioenergy, and are projected forwards in time under the energy pathways, accounting for various constraints on land use for agriculture and ecosystem services. The results show different combinations of crop yield and compositions for the pathways lead to the appropriation of between 7% and 61% of UK's agricultural land for bioenergy production. This could result in competition for land for food production and other land uses, as well as indirect land use change in other countries due to an increase in bioenergy imports.

The GPRD consists of Hong Kong (HK) on the one hand, providing an advanced institutional system, and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China on the other hand, with its evolving institutional setting. Despite or even because of the one country, two systems' situation, firms in the GPRD have become established suppliers in the electronics value chain. The paper takes up the challenge of operationalizing and empirically studying the relations of HK firms and PRD producers adapted to regionally specific institutional pattern and demand for flexibility in production using a quantitative approach based in a survey of HK electronic firms and a logit model explaining the relations between HK firms and PRD producers. The analysis reveals that in the course of time, HK firms have used different entry modes as a response to the maturity the institutional setting.","[Meyer, Susanne] AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Innovat Syst Dept, A-1220 Vienna, Austria; [Diez, Javier Revilla] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Econ & Cultural Geog, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT); Leibniz University Hannover,"Meyer, S (通讯作者)，AIT Austrian Inst Technol GmbH, Innovat Syst Dept, Donau City Str 1, A-1220 Vienna, Austria.",susanne.meyer@ait.ac.at; diez@wigeo.uni-hannover.de,"Revilla Diez, Javier/J-2392-2019","Revilla Diez, Javier/0000-0003-2065-1380","German Research Foundation (DFG) [1233, RE 172078-1]",German Research Foundation (DFG)(German Research Foundation (DFG)),This work was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Priority Programme 1233 (2006-2012) 'Megacity-Megachallenge: Informal Dynamics of Global Change' under grant RE 172078-1.,,27,5,5,1,18,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1056-8190,1435-5957,,PAP REG SCI,Pap.

The model is fitted to data on the S&P 500 Index and the prices of vanilla options written on the index, for the period 1990 to 2011. The method is able to estimate both the parameters of the physical measure (associated with the index) and the parameters of the risk-neutral measure (associated with the options), including the volatility and jump risk premia. The estimation is implemented using a particle filter whose efficacy is demonstrated under simulation. The computational load of this estimation method, which previously has been prohibitive, is managed by the effective use of parallel computing using graphics processing units (GPUs). The empirical results indicate that the parameters of the models are reliably estimated and consistent with values reported in previous work. In particular, both the volatility risk premium and the jump risk premium are found to be significant.","[Hurn, A. S.; Lindsay, K.

The European Council agreed to continue with this strategy through to 2030 by setting a RE target of 27% in addition to a GHG reduction target of 40%. We provide a detailed sectoral impact assessment by analyzing the implications for the electricity sector in terms of economic costs and the regional distribution of investments and shares of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E). According to the Impact Analysis by the European Commission the 27% RE target corresponds to a RES-E share of 49%. Our model-based sensitivity analysis on underlying technological and institutional assumptions shows that the cost-effective RES-E share varies between 43% and 56%. Secondly, we quantify the economic costs of these variants and those which would be incurred with higher shares. The long-term additional costs for higher RES-E shares would be less than 1% of total system costs. The third aspect relates to the regional distribution of EU-wide efforts for upscaling renewables. We point out that delivering high RES-E shares in a cost-effective manner involves considerably different efforts by the Member States. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent literature suggests that inter-sectoral structural change has a negligible impact on aggregate productivity growth. Through the application of dynamic shift-share methods, this paper presents a re-examination of this perspective using data for 181 European regions from 1980 to 2007. Results suggest that the effect of the inter-sectoral component is far from negligible and is substantially stronger for those regions towards the higher deciles of the distribution. Moreover, its effects appear to be particularly growth enhancing when the region is either high and improving' or low and deteriorating'. These results rehabilitate the importance of structural change for growth and convergence.","[O'Leary, Eoin] Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Inst Business Dev & Competitiveness, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland; [Webber, Don J.] Univ W England, Dept Accounting Econ & Finance, Bristol BS16 1QY, Avon, England",University College Cork; University of West England,"O'Leary, E (通讯作者)，Natl Univ Ireland Univ Coll Cork, Inst Business Dev & Competitiveness, Sch Econ, Cork, Ireland.",eoin.oleary@ucc.ie; don.webber@uwe.ac.uk,,,,,,,31,17,17,1,34,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

By estimating a structural model, one of their striking points is that increasing a city's initial stock of highways by 10 per cent leads to a 1.5 per cent positive respond of the city's employment over the sample period. This note mainly argues that their investigation leaves out potential spillovers of labour input from neighbouring growth centres/cities in the steady-state directly implied by the open city assumption.

The increase in energy consumption and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions justifies the greater attention being paid to energy efficiency and especially to industrial EE. The ability of manufacturing companies to innovate and improve their EE has a substantial influence on attaining objectives regarding climate change mitigation. Despite the effort to design more efficient energy policies, the EE determinants in manufacturing firms have been little studied in the empirical literature. From an exhaustive sample of Spanish manufacturing firms and using a logit model, we examine the energy efficiency determinants for those firms that have innovated. To carry out the econometric analysis, we use panel data from the Community Innovation Survey for the period 2008-2011. Our empirical results underline the role of size among the characteristics of firms that facilitate energy efficiency innovation. Regarding company behaviour, firms that consider the reduction of environmental impacts to be an important objective of innovation and that have introduced organisational innovations are more likely to innovate with the objective of increasing energy efficiency.

This, together with an expectation of a similar reduction for battery prices has prompted a new wave of social and academic discussions about the possibility of installing PV-battery systems and leaving the grid or living off-grid. This, if uncontrolled, has been termed the death spiral for utility companies. We have developed a decision support tool for rigorous assessment of the feasibility of leaving the grid. Numerous sensitivity analyses are carried out over critical parameters such as technology costs, system size, consumer load, and feed-in-tariff. The results show that, in most cases, leaving-the-grid is not the best economic option and it might be more beneficial to keep the connection with the grid, but minimize the electricity purchased by installation of an optimized size of PV-battery systems. The policy implication of this study is that, from an economic perspective, widespread disconnection might not be a realistic projection of the future. Rather, a notable reduction of energy demand per connection point is a more realistic option as PV-battery system prices decline further. Therefore, policies could be devised to help electricity network operators develop other sources of revenue rather than increasing energy prices, which have been assumed to be the key driver of the death spiral.

Gains from increased refining include reducing fuel imports and capturing margins now bequeathed to competitors. Refining also allows the kingdom to export its heavy crude oil to a wider array of customers, beyond select importers configured to handle heavy crudes. However, the move also presents strategic complications. The world's swing supplier of oil may grow less willing or able to adjust supply to suit market demands.

Most studies on regional clusters focus on identifying factors and processes that make clusters grow. However, sometimes technologies and market conditions suddenly shift, and clusters decline. This paper analyses the process of decline of the wireless communication cluster in Denmark. The longitudinal study on the high-tech cluster reveals that technological lock-in and exit of key firms have contributed to decline. Entrepreneurship has a positive effect on the cluster's adaptive capabilities, while multinational companies have contradicting effects by bringing in new resources to the cluster but being quick to withdraw in times of crisis.","[Ostergaard, Christian Richter; Park, Eunkyung] Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, DK-9220 Aalborg Oe, Denmark",Aalborg University,"Ostergaard, CR (通讯作者)，Aalborg Univ, Dept Business & Management, Fibigerstraede 11, DK-9220 Aalborg Oe, Denmark.",cro@business.aau.dk,"Østergaard, Christian R./P-4325-2019","Østergaard, Christian R./0000-0003-1782-202X",GONE - Danish Council for Strategic Research; AEGIS - European Union 7th Framework Programme [225134],GONE - Danish Council for Strategic Research; AEGIS - European Union 7th Framework Programme,"This project was funded by two projects: GONE, sponsored by the Danish Council for Strategic Research; and AEGIS, sponsored by European Union 7th Framework Programme [grant agreement number 225134].",,49,63,68,2,100,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

J,"He, XP",,,,"He, Xiaoping",,,Regional differences in China's CO2 abatement cost,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Shadow price; Carbon abatement; Distance function,MULTILATERAL PRODUCTIVITY COMPARISONS; SHADOW PRICES; POLLUTION; OUTPUTS,"Under a framework of output distance function with multiple outputs, the study discusses the carbon abatement cost at provincial and regional levels in China, using the shadow price analysis. The findings show that the abatement cost, reflecting the marginal opportunity cost of carbon reduction, varies greatly among the provinces. On average, the abatement cost of the eastern region was much higher than that of the mid-western region during the observed period. The findings provide evidence that the carbon prices in the current ETS pilots have been much lower than desired levels, implying inefficiency of the markets. The wide range of the abatement cost estimates supports that the equi-marginal principle does not hold for the regulations on carbon pollution at regional levels. The regional cost differences indicate the huge potential for China to minimize the total abatement cost with policy instruments that may motive the emissions moving from areas of low abatement cost to where the abatement cost is higher.

We improve the traditional model using spatial econometric techniques and compare the estimates from different spatial models, namely the spatial lag model, the spatial error model, and the spatial Durbin model (SDM). While our use of spatial models addresses the common problem of omitted variable bias, the SDM specifically allows for controlling possible nearby proximity effects (i.e., small-scale neighborhood) that are rarely included in this type of analyses. Findings indicate that distance from the greenbelt is important in explaining apartment prices in Vienna and that the greenbelt exerts a centrifugal force. The SDM is found to be the best performing model indicating the existence of small-scale neighborhood effects and presenting a solid case for the consideration of this model in valuation of green amenities.","[Herath, Shanaka] Univ New S Wales, Fac Built Environm, City Futures Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Choumert, Johanna] Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France; [Maier, Gunther] WU Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Inst Multilevel Governance & Dev, Res Inst Spatial & Real Estate Econ, A-1020 Vienna, Austria",University of New South Wales Sydney; Universite Clermont Auvergne (UCA); Vienna University of Economics & Business,"Choumert, J (通讯作者)，Univ Auvergne, CERDI CNRS, 65 Blvd F Mitterrand, F-63000 Clermont Ferrand, France.",shanaka.herath@unsw.edu.au; Johanna.choumert@udamail.fr; gunther.maier@wu.ac.at,"Maier, Gunther/AAJ-7503-2020; Herath, Shanaka/AAC-5483-2019","Herath, Shanaka/0000-0002-7958-3274; Maier, Gunther/0000-0003-2290-9998",Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government [ANR-10-LABX-14-01],Agence Nationale de la Recherche of the French government(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)),"We thank the Editor and two anonymous referees for very helpful comments on a previous version of our paper.

Most non-compensatory models employ cutoffs, the point at which utility abruptly changes. But cutoffs are usually elicited directly from respondents using a stated preference question. Such elicitation could be inaccurate and might introduce bias to the decision process. In this article, we develop a model that estimates cutoff levels endogenously. Our model has two error components, one for the utility function and another for the cutoff function. This facilitates the estimation of the cutoff as a function of individual specific variables. We estimate the model by maximizing the log-likelihood function that involves the weighted sum of the two error components. We test the model using synthetic data and find that estimated parameters are close to the true parameters. When applied to actual empirical data, our model appears to be a better fit than the compensatory preference model; however it is somewhat different than the self-reported cutoff model, highlighting the need for an approach that does not rely on stated cutoff information.

This study shows that the effect of the spatial concentration of industries on the post-entry hazards of new firms differs by type of exit, and by industry. New firms located in regions with a higher relative concentration of firms in the same industry are less likely to exit by closing activities and more likely to exit by mergers and acquisitions (M & As). While localization economies that favour new firms' survival or a potentially successful exit through M & As are dominant in manufacturing, new firms in business services also experience increasing competition from new entrants that lowers the likelihood of survival and exit through M & As.","[Weterings, Anet] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [Weterings, Anet; Marsili, Orietta] Erasmus Univ, Rotterdam Sch Management, NL-3062 PA Rotterdam, Netherlands",Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam,"Weterings, A (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30-314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.",anet.weterings@pbl.nl; omarsili@rsm.nl,,"Marsili, Orietta/0000-0002-4879-6701",,,,,38,27,36,1,35,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

The default may occur if the liabilities are not met under the terms of the contract which in turn results into the loss of the company (the creditor). Specifically, the liabilities arose from the credit, trade or investment activities, payment system and trade settlement. Difficulties in credit risk modelling arise due to the fact that the company default is not a frequent phenomenon but it occurs mainly unexpectedly. However, if the default occurs, it often causes the creditors major losses which size cannot be quantified in advance. The issue of modelling and quantification of credit risk is the subject of interest of many studies, scientific articles and publications. The access of individual authors to the present issue is diverse and so the methodology used for this purpose is not uniform. The present contribution will address the analysis and comparison of four basic approaches of description, but especially the quantification of credit risk: CreditRisk+, Credit Metrics, Merton model and Credit Grades. The comparison will be made on the basis of the computer performance, the applicability to different types of companies (public or non-public tradable), the volatility of credit events, the correlation of credit events occurrence, the required input data, currency of data and such like. Conclusions and recommendations for the application of the various approaches in specific situations will be parts of the contribution. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Applying an integrated standards model is shown to be a more effective way then applying the standards independently. The problem that arises is that in order to adopt the integrated version of standards there have to be made some changes at the organizational level.

It does so looking at the largest companies investing in Spain, a traditional net importer of capital, coming from the two leaders of the Second Industrial Revolution, Germany and the United States, between the late 19th century and 1975. We can observe that the entry mode chosen by the multinationals of both countries changed accordingly with Spanish economic evolution, but, contrary to what happened in other European countries, strategic alliances were persistently pursued as a response to both economic nationalism and very active local entrepreneurship. We conclude that these alliances' resilience not only explains the continuity of foreign investments in spite of increasing governmental restrictions, but also created a path of dependency which favoured fruitful interaction of foreign companies' expatriates and local managers with Spanish professional and educational institutions.","[Puig Raposo, Nuria] Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Alvaro Moya, Adoracion] CUNEF, Madrid, Spain",Complutense University of Madrid; CUNEF Universidad,"Raposo, NP (通讯作者)，Univ Complutense Madrid, E-28040 Madrid, Spain.",,,,,,,,112,0,0,1,14,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,2385-3247,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Consequently, studying the interdependencies between the inflow of FDI and the unemployment becomes of high importance for each country which shows increased interest in attracting foreign direct investments.

Within a decade of industrialisation of this landscape, these projects have had profound impacts on the environment, livelihoods and futures of its Kutchi inhabitants. Today, the coastline between the old Kandla and Mundra ports is drawn into a three-way battle between International Financial Institutions (IFIs) investing in coal projects, technical experts of sustainable development and international anti-coal campaigners. These three groups have selectively engaged the project affected Kutchis on the importance of economic development, environmental management and climate change. But the affected local people comprising artisanal fisherfolk who belong to a minority community, economically powerful salt and agricultural farmers and a traditional pastoral community of camel herders, frame, debate and act upon the impacts of the project in pragmatic ways. The range of remedies sought by them can be located between the practical expediency of everyday life and ethical questions about correct action. These remedies offer a glimpse of what regulatory bodies should be paying attention to rather than abstract or procedural justice. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The electricity supplied in the Dutch retail market is presented as renewable energy for 34%, but this relatively high share is for 69% based on certificates (Guarantees of Origin) which are imported from in particular Norway. The certificates are used to sell green electricity to consumers. The premium for green electricity which is actually paid by Dutch consumers is no more than a few percentages of the retail price. The low level of this premium is related to the abundant supply of certificates at low marginal costs from Norway. This also means that the premium for green electricity is too low to give an incentive for investments in new capacity. Hence, the current labelling system for renewable electricity is mainly valuable, besides being an instrument for tracking and tracing of renewable energy, as a marketing instrument for electricity retailers. The effectiveness of Guarantees of Origin as a policy instrument to foster renewable electricity sources is weak. This effectiveness can be raised by implementing restrictions on the international trade or the issuance of new certificates. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we explore the interplay between the role of aid and energy policy in the development of renewable energy resources in SIDS. We find that the importance of development assistance has implications for the sustainability of renewable energy development, given that funding is not always accompanied by necessary energy policy reforms. We also identify energy efficiency and access to modern energy services as having received insufficient attention in the establishment and structure of renewable energy targets in SIDS, and argue that this is problematic due to the strong economic case for such investments.

The increasing diffusion of wind energy, however, has turned wind energy acceptance into a significant barrier with respect to the deployment of wind turbines. This article assesses whether, and at what cost, Austrian renewable energy targets can be met under different expansion scenarios considering the socio-political and market acceptance of wind energy. Land-use scenarios have been defined in a participatory modeling approach with stakeholders from various interest groups. We calculated the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for all of the potential wind turbine sites, which we used to generate wind energy supply curves. The results show that wind energy production could be expanded to 20% of the final end energy demand in three out of four scenarios. However, more restrictive criteria increase LCOE by up to 20%. In contrast to common views that see local opposition against wind projects as the main barrier for wind power expansion, our participatory modeling approach indicates that even on the level of key stakeholders, the future possible contribution of wind energy to Austrian renewable energy targets reaches from almost no further expansion to very high shares of wind energy.

The residential electricity demand comprises of income, price, temperature, rainy days, old-age dependency and the impact of energy efficiency policies. Our results are consistent with previous studies, where income and price elasticities are inelastic. Hence, from a policy perspective, subsidies will not be effective in reducing electricity demand. We also found that old-age dependency is an important determinant that reduces electricity consumption at least in the short-run, suggesting that policies that target the younger population may bring more savings. The model findings suggest that in general, energy efficiency interventions introduced after 2007, which comprises of both informational strategies and efficiency standards, were effective in reducing household electricity consumption. However, in order to realise greater electricity reduction potential, policy efforts have to intensify into the future, with the main objectives being to permanently change energy habits, and consider the role of hassle 'costs' when rolling out energy saving measures.

Here, we employ a novel approach to create experience curves, to examine both global and North American compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) data for the years 1990-2007. We move away from the prevailing method of fitting a single, constant, exponential curve to data and instead search for break points where changes in the learning rate may have occurred. Our analysis suggests a learning rate of approximately 21% for the period of 1990-1997, and 51% and 79% in global and North American datasets, respectively, after 1998. We use price data for this analysis; therefore our learning rates encompass developments beyond typical learning by doing, including supply chain impacts such as market competition. We examine correlations between North American learning rates and the initiation of new programs, abrupt technological advances, and economic and political events, and find an increased learning rate associated with design advancements and federal standards programs. Our findings support the use of segmented experience curves for retrospective and prospective technology analysis, and may imply that investments in technology programs have contributed to an increase of the CFL learning rate.

By analyzing and expanding the fundamental concept of personality, a type of personality, namely ecological personality (EP), was defined and a structural model of EP was constructed based on a five-factor model. The study surveyed 890 urban residents to examine the relationship between EP and low-carbon behavioral intention (LCBI). Ecological personality is a five dimensional concept comprising eco-neuroticism, eco-agreeableness, eco-openness, eco-extraversion, and eco-conscientiousness. Ecological personality traits were positively correlated with the LCBI. However, a quadrifid graph model showed that the EP is not always consistent with LCBI, and respondents fell into two groups: one group comprised ecological residents with consistent traits (positive EP and high LCBI) and non-ecological residents with consistent traits (negative EP and low LCBI), and their EP was consistent with LCBI; the other group comprised ecological residents with gap traits (positive EP and low LCBI) and non-ecological residents with gap traits (negative EP and high LCBI), and neither showed any consistency between personality and intentions. A policy to guide the conversion of different groups into ecological residents with consistent traits is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results reaffirm the critical importance of default correlations. With default correlations, both default-rate and portfolio-loss distributions become far more right-skewed, reflecting a much higher likelihood of defaulting together. Our results also reveal that portfolio credit risk profiles evaluated at two different time points can change drastically with moving economic conditions, suggesting the importance of modeling credit risks with a dynamic system.

It pledged to curb carbon emissions by at least 7% by 2030. However, complying with this target may be a difficult task without compromising economic growth. The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth in Algeria, taking into account energy use, electricity consumption, exports and imports. The validity of the EKC hypothesis, throughout the period from 1970 to 2010, is tested by using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag model extended to introduce the break points. Results confirm the EKC for Algeria. Nevertheless, the turning point is reached for a very high GDP per capita value, indicating that economic growth in Algeria will continue to increase emissions. Results also indicate that an increase in energy use and electricity consumption increase CO2 emissions, and that exports and imports affect them negatively and positively, respectively. Therefore, it is necessary to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency policies. Regulatory reforms are needed to facilitate foreign investments with which to carry out these policies. Likewise, it may be appropriate to decrease subsides in energy prices to encourage energy efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal consumption, which accounts for about 70% of total energy consumption, is of particular concern. Hence, it is crucial to study the driving factors behind coal demand in China. This work uses an input-output structural decomposition analysis (I-O SDA) model to decompose the increments of coal demand in China from 1997 to 2012 into the sum of the weighted average for eight driving factors from three aspects, including: domestic demand, foreign trade and industrial upgrading. Results show that: during the research period, the demand for coal increases by 153.3%, which is increased by 185.4% and 76.4% respectively due to the driving forces of domestic demand and foreign trade; in addition, industrial upgrading can effectively restrain the growth in coal demand with a contribution rate of 108.6%. On this basis, we mainly studied the driving factors of coal demand in six high energy-consuming industries, namely the electrical power, energy processing, metals, mining, building materials and chemical industries. Finally, we proposed targeted policy suggestions for the realisation of energy conservation and emissions reduction in China. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

J. and Deem J. A tale of two regionalisms: improving the measurement of regionalism in Australia and beyond, Regional Studies. Studies of regional identification are integral to the role of regionalism in political development, but how does one study regionalism when subnational political scales and regional political culture may be out of alignment? This question is tackled using Australia, a federation theorized as having possibly hit a regionalization ceiling effect', but which empirical study using a moderate relational approach shows to have not one regionalism but two within its political culture: formal state-regionalism' reflected in its federal system and a more organic region-regionalism' only thinly reflected in political structure, albeit apparently still consistent with federalism. Both are identified as politically salient and reflected in institutional preferences, but as also reinforcing debates that regionalization from a devolutionary perspective is far from complete, as manifested in citizen support for new regional government. The results better inform reform debates and provide departure points for research.","[Brown, A.

We postulate the construction, information, manufacturing, utilities, and mining sectors as a group of emissions efficiency-related industries and identify the mutual relationships. The emissions efficiency positively influences the job shares of these industries except mining, whereas increased employment in these industries has a negative effect on the emissions efficiency. Electricity restructuring has a positive effect on overall employment, however, it does not have a statistically significant effect on the emissions efficiency. Additionally, population aging and educational attainment have positive effects on the emissions efficiency, and a higher proportion of rental households has a negative influence on it. Increases in renewable energy and nuclear energy generation have elastic effects on enhancing emissions efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The data are collected from a discrete choice experiment with two alternatives (variable-speed and constant speed room air conditioners) characterized by attributes of brand, purchase price and energy grade. Three versions of the questionnaires with choice sets differing only in energy consumption indicators were distributed randomly to 1602 potential consumers in Nanjing, China and a sample of 1569 was obtained after dropping missing data. The analysis with multinomial and mixed logit models reveal that the price premium that consumers are willing to pay for a variable-speed room AC over a constant-speed room AC increases significantly when energy consumption information becomes comparable and additional energy-related information is provided. Furthermore, the impact of information on WTP varies under different energy-saving scenarios. It is suggested that China Energy Label should correct information inefficiency by adopting same energy indicators for room ACs with different technologies and providing energy consumption information based on different climate zones.

Until that time district heating had been organized mainly as municipal utilities. After 1996 district heating is instead expected to function on a market. In competitive and integrated markets, prices are expected to be equal, or converging. To find out if district heating operates on an integrated market the differences in price levels, price convergence, price strategy, and business goals, among municipal, private and state owned district heating companies are investigated. Price statistics was used along with results from a questionnaire that was answered by representatives for 109 Swedish district heating companies. The results show that prices among district heating systems do not converge significantly and that variations in prices among municipal systems are larger than among private and state owned systems. Furthermore, despite the fact that district heating is supposed to be commercial, a vast majority of district heating companies apply cost-based pricing and not market pricing. The municipal companies give priority to political goals before financial goals. The conclusion is that a Swedish integrated market for heat has not yet evolved, and some district heating price-controlling mechanism is necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We explored the roles of policy acceptance and other factors in commuters' transport mode decisions, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. A questionnaire survey was conducted in Tianjin, China. A structural equation model was developed to test eight hypotheses, two of which were rejected. The results indicate that a driving restriction policy alone cannot effectively motivate commuters to use public transport if the policymakers fail to improve public transport, enhance commuters' awareness of consequences, increase commuters' perceived behavior control, and encourage car owners to change driving behavior. Comparisons between car owners and non-owners indicated that car owners view driving restriction policy and public transport more negatively. These negative views could be a barrier for the promotion of public transport among car owners. In addition, attitude toward public transport was found to have positive correlation with commuting time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Our main hypothesis is that although liberalization was imposed by the European authorities, the strategy adopted and steps taken by the Government to open the market were importantly determined by two objectives of the national economic policy: the universalization of the service and the anti-inflationary policy oriented toward entrance into the European Monetary Union (EMU). Identification of the national political interests at each point in time led the Government to block or accelerate liberalization according to the European calendar. This political use of liberalization is essential to understanding the telecommunications policy of this period. We also argue that the subordination of telecommunications policy to the anti-inflationary policy caused a delay in Telefonica's tariff rebalancing. Finally, we explain how telecommunications policy was affected by national policy objectives. Initially, a model of infrastructure competition was introduced, but it was soon reformed due to a lack of competition and investment. Thus, a more pragmatic strategy was adopted, based on access to Telefonica's local loop.","[Calzada, Joan; Costas, Anton] Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain",University of Barcelona,"Calzada, J (通讯作者)，Univ Barcelona, Dept Polit Econ, Ave Diagonal 690, Barcelona 08034, Spain.",calzada@ub.edu; acostas@ub.edu,"Calzada, Joan/R-8242-2018","Calzada, Joan/0000-0002-2976-1677",,,,,100,0,0,0,7,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

The overall effects of investment support on farm efficiency and productivity we estimated by non-parametric method Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), using output-oriented CCR and BCC models. Total factor productivity changes were estimated by Malmquist indices and their decomposition. We found, that productivity of both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of the investment support slightly decreased over time. This decline could be mostly attributed to technological regression. On average, the farms, non-beneficiaries of investment support, were more technically efficient than beneficiaries. Investment support however, enabled beneficiaries specialised on crop production significantly improve their performance towards the best farms. The investment support provided under the RDP should be more targeted towards smaller farms with low capital endowment.","[Hurnakova, Jaroslava; Bartova, L'ubica; Fandel, Peter] Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia",Slovak University of Agriculture Nitra,"Bartová, L (通讯作者)，Slovak Univ Agr, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Stat & Operat Res, Tr A Hlinku 2, Nitra, Slovakia.",lubica.bartova@uniag.sk,"Bartova, Lubica/A-9056-2016","FANDEL, Peter/0000-0003-4285-6811",,,,,32,0,0,0,4,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,923,930,,10.15414/isd2016.s12.03,0.0,,,8,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500109,0

In particular, the performance of the construction, electricity, manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and transport sectors is examined. The analysis is based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) combined with the Malmquist Productivity Index (MPI), which allows for distinctions between efficiency and technology changes over time. At the second stage of the analysis, cross-classified multilevel modelling is applied to analyse the main drivers behind efficiency performance using a number of sector and country characteristics. Based on DEA results, an overall improvement in efficiency is observed in all sectors over the period. The decomposition of the MPI indicates that technology change is primarily responsible for the improvements achieved in most sectors. The results obtained by the cross-classified model show, among other things, that the high electricity prices, energy taxes, and market share of the largest generator in the electricity market have a negative effect on industrial energy efficiency.

In fact, Cuban rum producers had to face Spanish commercial tariffs first, and then those of the US. It was only thanks to the social and economic networks built by Catalonian producers in the industrial districts that they created that rum firms could reduce their costs and become competitive. Additionally, both commercial restrictions and high internal transaction costs pushed these firms toward greater horizontal and vertical integration. As a result of this process, in 1959 Havana Club and Bacardi were two of the most powerful beverage firms in the world.

In the baseline treatment, all three members are completely strangers. While in the experimental treatment, one of the trustees is an acquaintance of the trustor and the other trustee is a stranger. The experimental results demonstrate that the varied social distances among trustor and trustees make some difference even when the identity information is semi-transparent that the trustor cannot tell with certainty which trustee is the acquaintance. The presence of the acquaintance promotes the trusting behaviour of the trustor towards both trustees. And the reactions of the two trustees are respectively higher than the trustees in the baseline treatment. Surprisingly, there is no significant difference of the return proportion between the stranger trustee and the acquaintance of the trustor owing to that both trustees in the multi periods trust game could compete for the chance to cooperate with the trustor in the future periods.","[Zhang, Xi; Huang, Deng-shi] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, First North Sect 111,Erhuan Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Dong, Zhan-kui] Henan Univ, Inst Management Sci & Engn, Jin Ming Ave, Kaifeng, Henan, Peoples R China",Southwest Jiaotong University; Henan University,"Zhang, X (通讯作者)，Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Econ & Management, First North Sect 111,Erhuan Rd, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,"DESTECH PUBLICATIONS, INC",LANCASTER,"439 DUKE STREET, LANCASTER, PA 17602-4967 USA",2475-0042,,978-1-60595-400-4,DESTECH TRANS SOC,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5,"Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences, Interdisciplinary",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Education & Educational Research; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BI1PU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000406675600052,0

We employ a Bayesian dynamic latent factor model to disentangle the common and idiosyncratic sector-specific factors of the prices of a group of China's commodity sectors: petrochemicals, grains, energy, non-ferrous metals, oils 82 fats, and softs. The results indicate that the common factor accounts for a significant portion of the fluctuations of China's commodity sectors, providing evidence of the strong commodity sector comovements in China. We further use a VAR model to link the common movements across China's commodity sectors to the underlying determinants, including global oil price shocks and domestic macroeconomic fluctuations. We find that the global oil price shocks have strong effects on the common movements across commodity sectors in China in addition to its domestic macroeconomic fluctuations at long horizons. However, at short horizons, the common movements across commodity sectors in China respond more strongly to the global oil shocks than to its domestic macroeconomic fluctuations.

This boom generated a wave of new state laws and regulations, especially addressing disclosure of fracturing chemicals. In 2011 the chemical disclosure registry FracFocus.Org was launched to provide well-by-well chemical information to the public. Many states adopted FracFocus for chemical reporting. In 2013, Harvard Law School researchers issued a report concluding that FracFocus fails as a regulatory compliance tool. The report made serious criticisms regarding the utility of the registry; however, the report was incomplete because its authors never interviewed state regulators. This paper remedies that oversight. We surveyed regulators in twenty oil and gas producing states to determine how they view and are using FracFocus. The results contradict the most crucial claims of the Harvard report and indicate that states are quite positive about FracFocus and are using it in novel ways that go beyond the registry's original purpose. This paper represents the first comprehensive survey of state regulators and the first attempt to obtain a data-driven analysis of how FracFocus is being used and whether it is effective as a regulatory tool.

If they are based on the joint asymptotic distribution possibly constructed with bootstrap methods in a frequentist framework, often individual confidence intervals are simply connected to obtain the bands. Such bands are known to be too narrow and have a joint coverage probability lower than the desired one. If instead the Wald statistic is used and the joint bootstrap distribution of the impulse response coefficient estimators is taken into account and mapped into the band, it is shown that such a band is typically rather conservative.

An alternative is to use lagged values of the endogenous variable in instrumental variable estimation.

Two popular alternatives are compressed natural gas (CNG) and electric vehicles. The latter provides the opportunity to generate revenue through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) services if properly equipped. This analysis conducts a robust accounting of the costs of diesel, CNG and battery-electric powertrains for school buses. Both marginal and fleet-wide scenarios are explored. Results indicate that the marginal addition of neither a small CNG nor a small V2G-enabled electric bus is cost effective at current prices. Contrary to previous findings, a small V2G-enabled electric bus increases net present costs by $7,200/seat relative to diesel for a Philadelphia, PA school district. A small CNG bus increases costs by $1,200/seat relative to diesel. This analysis is the first to quantify and include the economic implications of cold temperature extremes on electric vehicle battery operations, and the lower V2G revenues that result. Additional costs and limitations imposed by electric vehicles performing V2G are frequently overlooked in the literature and are explored here. If a variety of technical, legal, and economic challenges are overcome, a future eBus may be economical. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Whilst emissions have fallen significantly since 1990, further reductions will be increasingly difficult to achieve. The government has agreed carbon budgets to the late 2020s that are consistent with the long-term 80% target. However, increasing energy prices since the mid-2000s and the 2008 financial crisis have led to cracks in the political consensus in support of these budgets and targets. This paper carries out an assessment of the feasibility of the UK's agreed low carbon pathway over the medium term, with a particular focus on the fourth carbon budget (2023-27). It analyses the uncertainties associated with the specific changes that may be necessary to comply with this carbon budget - including measures to decarbonise electricity, heat and transport. This analysis focuses on 'instrumental' uncertainties associated with specific areas of the energy system (e.g. the decarbonisation of heat in households) and 'systemic' uncertainties that tend to have more pervasive implications for the energy system as a whole (e.g. uncertainties associated with public attitudes). A framework is developed that sets out and analyses the key uncertainties under those two broad categories, in terms of their complexity and their potential impact on the fourth carbon budget. Through the application of this framework the paper also considers strategies to mitigate or manage these uncertainties, and which actors could help develop and implement these strategies.

To do so, it employs a hybrid cost function approach and uses the panel data covering the nine years from 2000 to 2008 in local governments. Empirical findings show mixed evidence on the effects of the two institutional arrangements on cost savings and productivity gains. Water supply costs are significantly lower under contracting out than under direct public delivery. However, there are no significant differences in productivity gains between the two institutional arrangements.

First, a spatial Granger causality analysis is performed that indicates the relevant impact of spatial spillover effects across regions in Spain. Second, the empirical research offers a contribution in the context of the SpVAR modelling estimating the push-in (from the neighbours to the region) and push-out (from the region to its neighbours) effects of growth spillovers within a regional economic system. Finally, the proposed methodology reveals empirical evidence about both the short-run and long-term regional growth adjustment processes in space and time. The results for the Spanish regional panel data suggest the existence of strong spatiotemporal regional spillovers of growth output. This has important implications for the choice of regional policy goals and regional policy instruments.","[Marquez, Miguel A.; Ramajo, Julian] Univ Extremadura, Econ, Avda Elvas S-N, E-06071 Badajoz, Spain; [Hewings, Geoffrey J.

These models assume that energy is an intermediate product of some combination of human labour and capital. These models also assume that the supply of energy is driven by economic demand. We assume the contrary, i.e. that useful energy is a primary input, derived (mostly) from natural capital. This failure to capture the impact of primary resources (as useful energy) on economic growth leads to inappropriate formulation of economic growth theories. To understand that impact better we need explicit evidence of marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy or useful work. As applied to the explanation of the past half century of economic growth of the EU-15 countries, the new results demonstrate the use of non-parametric relationships between capital, labour and useful energy to explain economic growth. They also indicate that marginal products of capital, labour and useful energy are variable - the marginal product depends on the levels of capital stock, labour input and useful energy flows. The proposed semi-parametric production function suggests country-specific policy implications for the EU (and other countries). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The empirical results presented suggest that international trade in intermediate goods decreases the positive impact on carbon emission of energy consumption. When compared with the trade in final goods, intermediate goods trade contributes to a greater decrease in carbon pollution resulting from energy consumption. These results confirm that the link between energy consumption and carbon pollution in East Asia is significantly affected by international production fragmentation-induced trade in intermediate goods.

A reference system was used to construct alternative systems in the heating and transport sectors. The alternative system in the heating sector is based on heat pumps and bio-heat boilers while the alternative systems in the transport sector are based on three different pathways: bio-dimethyl ether, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and battery electric vehicles. The alternative systems were compared with the reference system after a business-economic optimisation had been made using an energy system analysis tool. The results show that the excess electricity availability due to increased energy efficiency measures hampers the competitiveness and penetration of bio-heating over heat pumps in the heating sector. Indeed, the synergy effect of using bio-dimethyl ether in the transport sector for an increased share of renewable energy sources is much higher than that of the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle and battery electric vehicle pathways. The study also revealed that increasing renewable energy production would increase the renewable energy share more than what would be achieved by an increase in energy efficiency.

Future cost reductions in lead acid batteries could increase investment and time scales needed for emerging storage technologies to reach cost-parity. In this paper the first documented model of cost reductions for lead-acid batteries is developed. Regression to a standard experience curve using 1989-2012 data yield a poor fit, with R-2 values of 0.17 for small batteries and 0.05 for larger systems. To address this problem, battery costs are separated into material and residual costs, and experience curves developed for residual costs. Depending on the year, residual costs account for 41-86% of total battery cost. Using running-time averages to address volatility in material costs, a 4-year time average experience curve for residual costs yield much higher R-2, 0.78 for small and 0.74 for large lead-acid batteries. The learning rate for residual costs in lead-acid batteries is 20%, a discovery with policy implications. Neglecting to consider cost reductions in lead-acid batteries could result in failure of energy storage start-ups and public policy programs. Generalizing this result, learning in incumbent technologies must be understood to assess the potential of emerging ones. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The policy Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) has mandated energy efficiency targets for these manufacturing industries in India. We focus on two major drivers of energy demand: technological progress and energy price. Productivity growth accounting and estimation of parametric cost function using Annual Survey of Industry data bring out important implications regarding the role of these two drivers. Results suggest that these industries experienced technological progress over the study period (1973-74 to 2011-12) with significant energy-saving bias during 1998-99 to 2011-12. Increase in energy price has led to reduction in energy demand and augmented technological progress in most of the industries. Energy and material inputs are mostly substitutes. During 1998-99 to 2011-12, productivity growth of energy input was induced by both technological progress and increase in energy price. Estimates of inter-factor substitution suggest that price induced reduction in energy demand can be a capital-intensive process in case of some industries. Rebound effect has never taken back full gains of energy efficiency policies in the context of these industries. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Much or most of the resulting carbon emissions can often be eliminated later, through a retrofit that may however be costly. This paper studies the joint decision to invest in such infrastructure, and retrofit it later, given that future climate damages are uncertain and follow a geometric Brownian motion process with positive drift. We find that higher climate cost volatility (for given unconditional expected costs) then delays the retrofit decision by increasing the option value of waiting to invest. The initial infrastructure is also chosen with higher energy intensity, further increasing total emissions, when volatility is higher. We provide conditions under which higher climate cost volatility increases total expected discounted climate damage from the infrastructure, which happens in a wide set of circumstances.

The CO2 emissions trading scheme (ETS) was initiated in January 2015 to meet this target. We attempt to estimate the public's value of implementing the ETS for CO2 emissions reduction. We apply the contingent valuation (CV) method using the willingness to pay (WTP) data obtained from a national CV survey of 1000 randomly selected households. The survey was conducted via in-person interviews. Value judgments required of the respondents were within their abilities. The mean WTP to achieve the stated target of CO2 emissions reduction using ETS is estimated to be KRW 1873 (USD 1.66) per household per month, which is statistically significant at the 1% level. The aggregate national value amounts to KRW 409.2 billion (USD 363.4 million) per year. Thus, even though Korea has no obligations to cut emissions under the Kyoto protocol, the public is willing to bear a financial burden to implement the ETS. If its cost is less than this value, implementing the ETS can be socially profitable. The results of this study can serve as a basis for further policy discussions and decisions.

This environmental measure consists of removing a share of the allowances allocated for a given period in order to reallocate some or all of them later on. To analyze the impact of the permits back-loading, we determine the CO2 price equilibrium with and without the policy measure, considering not only the market for permits but also the output market of regulated sectors. We propose a two-period model, where the market for permits is perfectly competitive, and the output market can be either competitive or oligopolistic. First, we define the condition under which banking from one period to another is optimal. This condition, that is the absence of arbitrage opportunities (AOA), depends not only from the period initial allocation but also on production market fundamentals.

Governments and utility providers tend to favor technical solutions, neglecting the socio-economic dimension. This article analyzes the interaction between the socio-economic factors trust, informal social norms, awareness and electricity pricing effect and technical control measures in Uganda. After reforming its power sector, Uganda introduced two technical innovations: bulk metering for micro and small enterprises (MSE) and prepaid metering for households. The bulk metering system imposes a strong form of social control among MSEs. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 29 MSEs and 16 experts in Uganda, this article shows how well bulk metering works in practice. It finds that trust is key in the relations between electricity user and utility provider, between citizens and government overseeing the energy sector as well as within bulk metering groups of MSEs. The electricity price impacts MSEs' ability to pay and to some extent also their willingness to pay. Finally, power theft used to be accepted as an informal social norm. Change is happening, but is currently undermined by corruption and patronage networks in the energy Sector and the political system, impacting people's attitude to compliance - regardless of the privatization of the electricity sector.

An empirical investigation tests these arguments using information on the evolution of 280 networks of subsidized research and development (R&D) collaboration in Germany. The empirical findings clearly confirm the existence of systematic and dynamic interrelatedness between proximities.

The article maps and analyses the main influences on the developments of Norwegian Advanced Metering policy. Based on 12 interviews and extensive document mapping the Norwegian policy developments are traced from about 1990 to 2014, divided into three phases: Before 2000, between 2000 and 2007, and after 2007. It finds that the main influence and push came from an increasingly united industry sector, fronted by the grid utilities with respective interest organizations. Policy change has been boosted by years of constrained supply, creating incentives for political action. Also developments at the EU level have been important for creating attention for smart meters, while consumer groups have been less influential. The national regulator NVE has adapted its policy process to include external expertise, in particular from the grid companies. The findings confirm that influence into policy processes is a matter of financial and organizational resources and expert knowledge. Of particular policy relevance is the weak organization of private consumer interests into these policy streams, which may be important for further policy development for distributed generation and regulation of private generation activities.

A three-sector model is developed to explore the economy-wide effects of two policies implemented by a government participating in REDD that differ in how they bring together incentives and benefit sharing: an incentive payment scheme where these are intrinsically linked and taxes where they are-separated. Two sectors utilise forest as an input to production, one in which forest is substitutable for labour, producing a carbon externality, and one in which forest and labour are complements and where forest is used sustainably. Two important effects determine model outcomes. First, the government factors in general equilibrium effects when determining the efficient payment level. This implies that the level of international transfers is not fully passed through to the forest-using sectors. Second, even though the sustainable sector receives no incentive payment it can increase in size through the effect of REDD payments on markets. With political influence, where incentives and benefit sharing are linked the forest-using sectors may lobby for lower payment rates for themselves in order to create a larger international transfer. Where there is a separation between incentives and benefit-sharing this effect disappears. The findings indicate that REDD may be less cost-effective than envisioned at the international level.

We incorporate the two approaches into a bioeconomic model and evaluate how they act as substitutes and/or complements when used together in fisheries stock recovery plans. Simulations of the model with estimated parameters from an actual fishery show that the cost of adopting a harvest strategy of slow stock rebuilding can be offset or substituted by a no-take reserve. For each of the harvest strategies explored, we find there is a range of reserve sizes that can act as a complement in a stock recovery plan such that a no-take reserve improves both the profitability of fishers and average annual harvest during stock rebuilding. We demonstrate that a stock recovery plan that incorporates both harvest control rules and no-take reserves can simultaneously contribute to conservation, economic and socio-economic objectives of fisheries management.

In light of this work, the Federal Reserve's recent policy of quantitative easing, with its goal of affecting the supply of liquid assets, appears to be a radical break from standard practice. Alternatively, one could posit that the monetary aggregates, when measured properly, never lost their ability to explain aggregate fluctuations and, for this reason, represent an important omission from standard models and policy discussions. In this context, the new policy initiatives can be characterized simply as conventional attempts to increase money growth. This view is supported by evidence that superlative (Divisia) measures of money often help in forecasting movements in key macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the statistical fit of a structural vector autoregression deteriorates significantly if such measures of money are excluded when identifying monetary policy shocks. These results cast doubt on the adequacy of conventional models that focus on interest rates alone. They also highlight that all monetary disturbances have an important quantitative component, which is captured by movements in a properly measured monetary aggregate.","[Belongia, Michael T.] Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA; [Ireland, Peter N.] Boston Coll, Dept Econ, Chestnut Hill, MA 02467 USA",University of Mississippi; Boston College,"Belongia, MT (通讯作者)，Univ Mississippi, Dept Econ, University, MS 38677 USA.",mvpt@earthlink.net; peter.ireland@bc.edu,,,,,,,39,59,67,1,36,AMER STATISTICAL ASSOC,ALEXANDRIA,"732 N WASHINGTON ST, ALEXANDRIA, VA 22314-1943 USA",0735-0015,1537-2707,,J BUS ECON STAT,J.

In this context, we applied least-cost and cost-risk optimization models to allocate energy sources for sustainable development in the Korean electric power generation industry. The least-cost model determined an electricity generation mix from 2012 to 2030 that incurs minimum generation cost to meet electricity demand. The cost-risk model determined electricity generation mixes in 2030 considering the risks associated with each energy source in order to lessen external risks. In deriving these optimal electricity generation mixes, we considered both conventional and renewable energy sources in conjunction with physical and policy constraints that realistically reflect Korean circumstances. Moreover, we accounted for CO2 and external costs within the electricity generation costs for each energy source. For sustainable development in Korea, we conclude that a portion of the coal and gas in the electricity generation mix must be substituted with nuclear and renewable energy. Furthermore, we found that least-cost allocation is sub-optimal from cost-risk perspective and that it limits the adoption of renewables. Finally, we also discuss the implications of decisions taken by the Korean government regarding the electricity generation mix for next-generation energy planning to achieve sustainability.

We combine data from two scoring mechanisms that independently capture local regulatory process efficiency with the largest dataset of installed PV prices in the United States. We find that variations in local permitting procedures can lead to differences in average residential PV prices of approximately $0.18/W between the jurisdictions with the least-favorable and most-favorable permitting procedures. Between jurisdictions with scores across the middle 90% of the range (i.e., 5th percentile to 95th percentile), the difference is $0.14/W, equivalent to a $700 (2.2%) difference in system costs for a typical 5-kW residential PV installation. When considering variations not only in permitting practices, but also in other local regulatory procedures, price differences grow to $0.64-$0.93/W between the least-favorable and most-favorable jurisdictions. Between jurisdictions with scores across the middle 90% of the range, the difference is equivalent to a price impact of at least $2500 (8%) for a typical 5-kW residential PV installation.

Increasingly, traditional global hedonic price models that largely ignore spatial effects are being superseded by models that deal with spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity. In addition, many novel methods integrating spatial economics, statistics and geographical information science (GIScience) have been developed recently to incorporate temporal effects into hedonic house price modelling. Here, a local spatial modelling technique, geographically weighted regression (GWR), which accounts for spatial heterogeneity in housing utility functions is applied to a 19-year set of house price data in London (1980-1998) in order to explore spatiotemporal variations in the determinants of house prices. Further, based on the local parameter estimates derived from GWR, a new method integrating GWR and time series (TS) forecasting techniques, GWR-TS, is proposed to predict future local parameters and thus future house prices.

Contrary to this framing, however, we argue that GGR technologies can in fact form a valuable complement to emissions control within on-going mitigation efforts. Through decoupling abatement from emissions sources, they add much-needed flexibility to the mitigation toolbox, increasing feasibility and reducing costs of meeting climate targets. Integrating GGR effectively into policy raises significant challenges relating to uncertain costs, side effects, life-cycle effectiveness and accounting. Delaying policy action until these uncertainties are resolved, however, risks missing early opportunities, suffocating innovation and locking out the long-term potential of GGR. Based on an analysis of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, we develop four policy principles to begin unlocking the potential of GGR: (i) support further research, development and demonstration; (ii) support near-term opportunities through modifying existing policy mechanisms; (iii) commit to full GGR integration in carbon accreditation and broader climate policy frameworks in future; (iv) develop sector-specific steps that lay the groundwork for future opportunities and avoid lock-out (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","[Lomax, Guy] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Energy Futures Lab, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Workman, Mark] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Grantham Inst Climate Change, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Lenton, Timothy] Univ Exeter, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Exeter, Devon, England; [Shah, Nilay] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Chem Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England",Imperial College London; Imperial College London; University of Exeter; Imperial College London,"Lomax, G (通讯作者)，Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Energy Futures Lab, South Kensington Campus, London SW7 2AZ, England.",guy.lomax12@imperial.ac.uk,"Lenton, Tim M/X-1893-2018; Shah, Nilay/E-4925-2015","Lenton, Tim M/0000-0002-6725-7498; Lomax, Guy/0000-0001-9561-1506; Shah, Nilay/0000-0002-8906-6844",,,,,78,66,73,3,85,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,MAR,2015,78.0,,,,,,125,136,,10.1016/j.enpol.2014.10.002,0.0,,,12,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,CB6IX,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000349731800012,0

The case of Norway and Sweden: Does increased renewable energy production impact domestic greenhouse gas emissions?,ENERGY POLICY,,,English,Article,,,,,,Renewable energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Norway and Sweden,,"This article examines how the EU's RES directive(1) will impact domestic greenhouse gas emissions in Norway and Sweden by 2020. The directive aims for a higher RES share in the energy consumption mix, and Norway and Sweden have established a common electricity certificate scheme to help achieve these RES goals. In terms of how these two national RES plans will impact domestic emissions by 2020, factors such as nuclear power, consumption changes and the energy balance must be considered. The most practical approach to evaluate the plans' impact on emissions is to focus on changes in carbon-based consumption within the three directive sectors. The Norwegian RES action plan will not affect domestic emissions unless the electricity surplus generated by the certificate market is used to phase out fossil fuels in domestic sectors beyond the scope of the RES directive. The use of electricity to phase out fossil fuel consumption in the offshore sector would substantially reduce Norwegian emissions figures. The Swedish plan would positively impact Swedish greenhouse gas emissions; however, this impact is limited, primarily because a substantial increase in energy consumption is expected.

They may be useful as a product-oriented trajectory. The scenarios on the agenda of the 2013 Energy Debate in France belong to this category. But a scenario may also be process-oriented, in the sense that its scripting process helps build consensus and a minimum level of agreement. We have scripted scenarios using a codevelopment method, involving about 40 stakeholders from the private and public sectors, and from the state: NGOs, consumer groups, trade unions, banks and local authorities. They selected policies they considered acceptable for achieving 75% greenhouse gases emission reductions in 2050. These policies were then integrated in the Imaclim-R-France technico-economic simulation model, as part of a high or moderate acceptability scenario. In the first case emissions were cut by between 58% and 72% by 2050; in the second case by between 68% and 81%, depending on the energy price assumptions. All these measures benefited jobs and economic growth, swiftly and durably cutting household spending on energy services. This offers a solid basis for gaining acceptability for low carbon trajectories; the process constitutes also a framework for consolidating collective learning centering on the acceptability of climate policies.

Governments generally choose to build stations for home charging (including piles) within residential communities. Given the conflict of interest between various government agencies and property management companies, constructing a charging station within residential communities would result in welfare loss for the property management companies and therefore lead to the principal agent problem. This paper constructs a two-period imperfect information game theory model to study the moral hazard involved in this issue and government agencies' optimal choice. In the analytic solution of the model, we find that the optimal choice for a farsighted government agency is to constantly improve the incentive mechanism and introduce charging stations only when the conflict of interest is eliminated. Any benefits derived from government regulations by force would prove short-lived. The government should focus on long-term returns in the development of EVs, and its optimal mechanism should be designed to mitigate the principal agent problem of property management companies, thereby accelerate the progress of EV charging infrastructure and improve overall social welfare.

One of the possible approach for proper irrigation scheduling is measuring the soil water potential, simple and easy to manage. The purpose of this research was to examine the effects of two different irrigation regimes (obtained by the use of tensiometers connected to a relay controller) on yield, fruit quality and water consumption of greenhouse tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Naxos) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus L., cv Sarig, in the first cropping cycle, and the local landrace 'Mezzo lungo di Polignano', in the second one) grown on a silty-clay soil in Mediterranean conditions. For each species, two tests (August-February and February-July cycle) were carried out in a plastic greenhouse-tunnel. Drip irrigation was adopted, with automated schedule based on tensiometer readings. Two water potential irrigation set-points were compared: -100 and -400 hPa for tomato and -100 and -300 hPa for cucumber, in both cycles. Yield (marketable and unmarketable) and quality traits of fruits (soluble solids, dry matter and titratable acidity) were determined. Water consumption was calculated at the end of each crop cycle. In the first cycle, the two water regimes did not affect the yield of tomato and cucumber. The cucumber irrigated at the lowest soil water potential set-point produced fruits with 8% higher dry matter. In the second cycle, the tomato irrigated at the potential of -400 hPa showed a 40% lower yield (mainly due to the lower fruit size) compared to that of plants irrigated at -100 hPa. However, the fruits of tomato plants irrigated at -400 hPa showed total soluble solids, dry matter and titratable acidity, respectively 41, 45 and 59% higher than plants irrigated at 100 hPa. In both crop cycles, a water saving of 35% and 46%, on average, for tomato and cucumber, respectively, was obtained using the lowest potential as irrigation set-point. Proper use of tensiometer could allow a better use of water resource. Selection of proper water potential set-points according to the cultivation season is crucial for satisfactory results. The positive effects of a controlled and moderate water stress on fruit quality should be taken into account.

In prosperity periods -of excessive wealth-the Arts and Engineering flourish, an advanced know-how in constructions is developed and monumental projects are launched. The examination of the technological level in (monumental) constructions and hydraulic works of Middle Bronze Age - Late Bronze Age (MBA, ca. 2200/2100-1580 B.C. - LBA, ca. 1600 - 1100 B.C.)

There is a debate surrounding Technology and its flow, its nature and origins. Some researchers support the spread of innovation from East to West, and a contradictious aspect of cross-fertilization or diffusion between East and West. In the present study, a combination of the archaeological evidence (both material and textual) of the technological level in constructions - especially in MBA and LBA Greece-and metal production, the ancient literature, the written sources, is attempted, in order to infer conclusions for the Technological, environmental, cultural and socio-economic aspects regarding possible relations and exchanges of Technology among Minoan Crete and/or Mycenaean Greeks -Danaoi/Achaeans, as Homer calls them-with Egypt and the land of Hatti, specifically during the Middle and Late Bronze Age.

Yet the impact on the biological living standards of specific segments of the population together with the magnitude of intra-urban differences continues largely unexplored in this country. This paper presents and discusses male height differentials by occupation and urban districts in Antequera (Andalusia, southern Spain) among cohorts born 1859-1880, thus matching the halt of the growth experienced by wool-based manufacturing and its subsequent decline. Anthropometric and socio-demographic data come from military enlistments held between 1879-1899, which included more than 5000 young males aged 18-20. Descriptive analyses and multivariate linear regression analysis are conducted. Results illustrate the influence of two components of inequality and poverty in past urban industrial societies: income levels and physical environment. The peasantry exhibits the lowest height averages. Within this group, those living in the industrial periphery of the town display shorter mean statures.","[Martinez Carrion, Jose Miguel] Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain; [Camara, Antonio D.] Univ Jaen, Jaen, Spain",University of Murcia; Universidad de Jaen,"Carrión, JMM (通讯作者)，Univ Murcia, E-30001 Murcia, Spain.",,"Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/E-4219-2016; Cámara, Antonio D./AAF-7587-2022; Cámara, Antonio D./AFK-0610-2022","Martínez-Carrión, José-Miguel/0000-0002-8918-8833; Cámara, Antonio D./0000-0002-6199-1106; Cámara, Antonio D./0000-0002-6199-1106",,,,,56,3,3,0,7,"UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT HISTORIA, INST ECONOMIQUES",BARCELONA,"AVDA DIAGONAL 690, BARCELONA, 08034, SPAIN",1132-7200,,,REV HIST INDUST,Rev.

Stone as building material was originating from rocks in the near territory, resulting an absolute harmony with the natural environment. From a hydrological and hydrostatical point of view, many of the protective type stone structures (terraces, dams) had gaps in their main body for passage of the water, significantly reducing the hydrostatic loads and increasing their stability.

The main purpose of EU synergy is to be competitive in the world with aims of economic and social cohesion and regional development. An increasing share of EU budget devoted to Regional Policy draws big attention of economist's who are analyzing the impact of the structural support on economic growth. It is important to identify the results of the former programming period's structural support in order to plan more effective use and implementation of the new EU structural assistance for the period 2014-2020. Multivariate statistical analysis for European Union states' NUTS2 level socio-economic data was performed in the paper. The results showed that despite long lasting purposeful structural funds allocations there are still big regional development gaps between European Union member states. The performed research identified the clusters of socio-economic similarity and indicated groups of states. The recommendations suggesting groups of states that should be paid more attention in allocating funds and revising regional performance was made.

The form of organization operating activities varied in time from the mining plant that integrate all mining related activities (less than the production of electricity) to mining company of national interest (from which almost all related activities of proper operation were outsourced). During this period, electricity production activity was organized economically independent in two companies which operated the two power plants powered by coal: Paroseni power plant (located in the Jiu Valley, with spaced mass transport mining) and thermo Mintia (located outside the Jiu Valley, the mining mass transport distance of 100 km). The economic results of the three entities have experienced different stages of evolution, circumscribed overall economic development of Romania. In terms of energy market liberalization in Romania, in 2012 it was decided to integrate the activities of coal mining and electricity production, the company Energy Complex Hunedoara SA being founded. The economic entity has in his structure two power plants and four units in underground mining coal. This paper analyzes the effects that this integration has had on the cost of electricity production, trying to highlight the economic benefits of it. They also highlighted possible directions for future development of the Company's economic results in the context of Romania's integration into a regional electricity market. The analysis is based on the cost of the two power plants and the four mining units. It is revealed the costs structure and their evolutionary trends. It is used the cost structure in fixed costs and variable costs (using the criterion of their behavior in relation to the level of activity) in order to allow predictions about the evolution of costs, and transformation of cost information into a useful tool for managerial decision making related to the level of activity.

The analysis uses a unique data set with 10 years of recall data on school attendance and household shocks. We find that the probability of a child dropping out of school increases significantly when the household experiences an illness, death or asset shock. We propose a test to distinguish whether the impact of shocks on school attendance can be attributed to credit constraints, labour market rigidities, or a combination of the two.

This article contends that the energy transition is also a social process. We develop a provisional local ethnography of the Energiewende, an account of the lived experience of this social process from the perspective of villagers in Atterwasch, Kerkwitz and Grabko, in the region of Lusatia in Eastern Germany. Their experiences are particularly salient, since their villages are facing demolition to make way for the expansion of the nearby janschwalde coal mine. The villagers' struggle to defend their homes highlights a fundamental contradiction in the energy transition, sometimes referred to as the coal conundrum. The contest over the future of coal in Lusatia can be seen as a struggle to control key cultural 'scripts' or narratives, of home, belonging, ecological modernization, climate change, and democratic deficit. Our research suggests that any resolution of the coal conundrum, and effective implementation of the Energiewende, must be informed by an understanding of these scripts, and how they underpin the motivations and mentalities of different social actors.

However, investigations on the best entry and exit occasions of governmental subsidies for the PV industry were rarely reported in previous studies. Therefore, based on the existing division method of enterprise development model, classification of 72 PV companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in China was firstly carried out in this paper. This is followed by studying the influence of governmental subsidies on the indexes of different stages of enterprise development. Finally, a conclusion was drawn that the governmental subsidies at Early Exploratory Stage can maximize the social and economic effects, suggesting the best entry occasion, and subsidies at Intermediate Stage and Mature Stage have little effects on its turnover and aggravate the overcapacity of PV supply, suggesting a suitable exit occasion.","[Xiong Yongqing; Yang Xiaohan] Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China; [Yang Xiaohan] China Resources Holdings Co Ltd, Wanchai Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China",Central South University; China Resources Group,"Yang, XH (通讯作者)，Cent S Univ, Sch Business, Changsha, Hunan, Peoples R China.",Yangxiaohan@crc.com.hk,"晓晗, 杨/GRF-5024-2022","晓晗, 杨/0000-0003-3594-2308","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [71173243, 71473276]",National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"The authors acknowledge the financial supports from National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) (71173243, 71473276) for the work reported in this paper.",,42,72,77,9,112,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0301-4215,1873-6777,,ENERG POLICY,Energy Policy,DEC,2016,99.0,,,,,,111,119,,10.1016/j.enpol.2016.09.013,0.0,,,9,Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Energy & Fuels; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,EC3VS,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000388055800011,0

Despite broad public support for the sector, wind energy proposals have routinely triggered social conflict and localised opposition. To promote social acceptance and avoid conflict, the wind energy sector undertakes community engagement. This paper interrogates the community engagement undertaken in King Island (Tasmania, Australia) for a large scale wind energy development proposal which did not proceed to implementation due to external economic factors. Despite the proponent's adoption of what was described as a 'best practice' community engagement strategy, the proposal caused significant social conflict for the community. In-depth interviews (n=30) were conducted with members of the King Island community and were qualitatively analysed through the social identity lens. Five key drivers of the local conflict were identified: problematic pre-feasibility engagement; the lack of a third-party facilitator of the community consultative committee; holding a vote which polarised the community; the lack of a clear place in the engagement process for local opposition, and; the significance of local context. These findings are instructive for improving community engagement practice for wind energy and other energy generation and land use change sectors. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

To analyze the issue, the paper employs various poverty and vulnerability measures with the assistance of our unique dataset. The results indicate the aggravation of energy poverty among lower-income and vulnerable households during the past decade, resulting from both the escalation of energy prices and lowering of income. The analysis also employs a new decomposition technique and identifies the explanatory factors associated with the increase in energy poverty. These results suggest there were major changes in the forces driving the increase in energy poverty before and after the GEJE. After 2011, income alleviates energy poverty in Japan, with energy prices becoming the main driving factor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We argue that an increasing share of fossil fuel rents lessens the innovation of new energy technologies. We consider a sample of countries beyond the common selection of OECD members and investigate innovation efforts in the energy sector of 116 countries from 1980 to 2012. We observe the gradually growing influence of resource-abundant countries on global R&D expenditures and find that increasing fossil fuel rents have a negative effect on patent grants. This study contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the potential effects of resource abundance. More importantly, it increases our understanding of innovation activities within the energy sector and further underscores the need to extend future research to countries that have not been taken into account thus far.

For routine maintenance, grid operators typically acquire technologies in one-off transactions, but the innovative nature of smart grid projects may require more collaborate relationships. This paper studies how a transactional versus relational approach to governing smart grid innovation projects affects incentives for other actors to collaborate. We analyse 34 cases of smart grid innovation projects based on extensive archival data as well as interviews. We find that projects relying on relational governance are more likely to provide incentives for collaboration. Especially non-financial incentives such as reputational benefits and shared intellectual property rights are more likely to be found in projects relying on relational governance. Policy makers that wish to stimulate smart grid innovation projects should consider stimulating long-term relationships between grid operators and third parties, because such relationships are more likely to produce incentives for collaboration.

Based on an empirical analysis of different German wind power profiles from 2007 to mid-2012, we are able to show that the profitability significantly depends on the correlation of the wind power portfolio with the overall wind power feed-in and prediction error in Germany. Significant differences between the wind forecast errors clearing cost of the analyzed portfolios can be identified. Our analysis shows that a wind power operator would profit in most cases from a reduced forecast error, which could be achieved through an improved forecast model and an increased share of the intraday cleared error. Furthermore significant locational portfolio advantages and disadvantages can be identified when comparing the different market values. In general, the empirical. analysis shows that a premium of 3.5 (sic)/MWh is suitable to cover the cost of an imperfect forecast. Taking further into account that for 2012 a premium of 12 (sic)/MWh was granted; the direct marketing option can be evaluated as highly attractive, which is furthermore indicated by the rapid increase of the directly marketed wind power and photovoltaic generation.

We argue that a missing component of biofuel policy is consideration of the risks faced by companies in the biofuels industry. The purpose of this paper is to address the research question: What are the most important risks facing companies in the biofuels industry? We identify 22 risks in our analysis of 652 narrative risk factor descriptions disclosed by 26 publicly traded biofuel companies in the US and Canada. The results show that the most important risks are related to management and management processes, and to market conditions and profitability. Biofuel companies view technological risks, including those related to intellectual property protection, as less significant. These results suggest that, in order to be responsive to the risks companies face, biofuel policy needs to support the development of managers and management processes; to support market conditions and industry profitability; and to strike an appropriate balance between policy support for technology development and for business development. Further, we suggest a risk informed approach to setting government policy for the biofuels industry may support the industry's development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To this end, the concept of implicit CO2 prices is introduced, based on which prices for different fossil fuel uses are derived. Implicit CO2 prices are defined as the difference between actual prices paid by consumers and efficient domestic fuel prices. Efficient domestic fuel prices, in turn, consist of private production costs, a uniform value added tax and only local external costs, not including external costs due to CO2 emissions and global climate change. The resulting prices differ substantially, which suggests that there is considerable cost-saving potential in reducing CO2 emissions in Switzerland. For passenger cars and air traffic, the implicit prices are negative. For these uses, higher fuel charges would therefore be beneficial from a purely domestic perspective, i.e., without considering the negative repercussions of global warming. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

It employed the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test cointegration method and analysed both long-run and short-run determinants of import demand for total and specific petroleum products. In the long-run, aggregate and sectoral incomes are significant determinants of import of refined kerosene. Further, real effective exchange rate (REER), aggregate income (GDP), manufacturing sector's income, domestic energy production (DEP) and population growth rate (PGR) are drivers of import of refined motor spirit Moreover, REER, DEP and manufacturing sector's income are propellers of import of refined distillate fuel. Also, REER and total output of petroleum products are major drivers of total import of refined petroleum products. Short-run results show that previous period GDP, PGR and manufacturing and service sectors' incomes are determinants of import demand for refined kerosene. Moreover, REER, GDP, previous PGR and manufacturing sector's income exert significant effects on the import of refined motor spirit.

Central is the idea that one neighbour's deforestation actions may impact the returns to deforestation in nearby patches. We determine the impact of each policy in terms of avoided deforestation and leakage levels at the landscape scale through modelling and simulations. Avoided deforestation policies at a landscape level are respectively: two Payment for Environmental Services (PES) policies, one focused on deforestation hotspots, the second being equally available to all agents; a conservation area; and, an agglomeration bonus. Because our model accommodates spatial interactions in the absence of a deforestation policy, it is possible that a spatial policy can affect both within intervention areas and outside-intervention spatial spillovers in terms of leakage across different landowners' forest patches. These two different elements of the total extent of displacement across the full landscape have not been considered before. Our contribution is twofold. In terms of methodology, we expand the concept of leakage in accounting for direct impacts to adjacent patches and spatial spillovers over the landscape, and we provide a measure of leakage in a dynamic manner for policy assessment. From our analytical model and simulations, we show that leakage is sensitive to the spatial distribution of forest patch types. The two PES policies are the most cost-effective policies regarding avoided deforestation. The agglomeration bonus policy is efficient at the expense of a higher cost, whilst the conservation area policy is efficient when patches with similar characteristics are gathered.

This policy is now widely known as the Energiewende. While many global observers consider this program to be primarily driven by the need to tackle climate change, the precise political goals of the Energiewende are, by and large, unclear. In our study we compiled a list of 14 goals put forward in political debates and conducted a mapping survey among more than 50 policy experts. We asked them to prioritize the goals based on their personal views and provide arguments for their rankings in ensuing interviews. Our main findings are as follows: (i) a large majority named climate protection among the top-level goals of the Energiewende; at the same time, around 80% of all participants also identified additional goals; (ii) when asked if the Energiewende would make sense even if climate change did not exist, two thirds of the participants agreed, which, when taken with the first finding, demonstrates that the goals and motivations driving the Energiewende are more complex than often assumed. We conclude that for the sake of effective and efficient policies and ever rising climate policy ambition, a public debate and clear specification of the top-level goals are indispensable.

In particular, I compare counties with fracking activity in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the control group of counties in New York, which imposed a moratorium and later ban on fracking. I look at how the benefits to the labor demand shock are shared between industries as well as how employment and wages in related industries adjust over the course of the resource boom. The results suggest total employment and wages per job increase by 7% and 11% respectively above pre-boom levels in the three years after the boom, but decline after 4 years or more. The results also show significant positive spillovers to related sectors, such as construction, transportation, retail trade and accommodations.

However there exist very few scientifically sound studies, which apply due diligence to substantiating this impression. In the present paper, the case of photovoltaic power sources in regions of moderate insolation is analysed critically by using the concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (ERoEI, also called EROI). But the methodology for calculating the ERoEI differs greatly from author-to-author. The main differences between solar PV Systems are between the current ERoEI and what is called the extended ERoEI (ERoEI(EXT)). The current methodology recommended by the International Energy Agency is not strictly applicable for comparing photovoltaic (PV) power generation with other systems. The main reasons are due to the fact that on one hand, solar electricity is very material-intensive, labour-intensive and capital-intensive and on the other hand the solar radiation exhibits a rather low power density.

However, the two approaches have not been reconciled - even as the Government intervenes, it reaffirms its goal of creating more competitive markets. The contradictions are most apparent with electricity, which has been the main focus of intervention to date, in line with decarbonisation strategy. Investment is dependent on Government support, which changes in response to circumstances, creating uncertainty and undermining the basis of market operation - so leading to the need for more intervention. The future for other sources - natural gas, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in particular remains unclear. The Government risks getting the worst of both worlds - without the coordination and direction which could come from a centralised approach or the efficiencies and innovation which might emerge from a more consistent market based policy. Unless a fuller policy statement, expected later this year, can clarify matters, UK energy policy will not be fit for purpose and will fail to meet its key goals, of economic effectiveness, environmental protection and energy security.

In turn, stimulating investments in renewable energy production at the community level requires a better understanding of investors' motives. This paper aims to study the heterogeneity of motivations that drive individuals to participate in community renewable energy projects and the underlying explanatory factors behind this, as well as the implications for their level of engagement in initiatives. Based on quantitative data from an original survey conducted with two renewable energy cooperatives in Flanders, the statistical analysis shows that cooperative members should not be considered as one homogeneous group. Several categories of members with different motives and levels of engagement can be distinguished. This heterogeneity is explained by contrasts in terms of institutional settings, spatial patterns and attitudes to the diffusion of institutional innovations. Regarding policy implications, the findings suggest that this heterogeneity should be taken into account in designing more effective supporting policies to stimulate investments at the community level. The activation of social norms is also shown to be a promising mechanism for triggering investment decisions, although the implications of its interplay with economic incentives should be further explored.

Household decisions after the audits are recorded along with the corresponding recommended modifications and the offers for co-funding. A discrete choice model of the household decision after the audit is estimated. The results indicate that the potential improvement in heating efficiency from the proposed modifications increase the probability of implementing conservation measures. Co-funding offers also significantly raise the odds of accepting the modifications but are relatively less important than anticipated efficiency improvements. Several approaches are used. to determine whether and how much energy is saved after the audits. Electricity demand models are estimated using data two years before and after each household audit. For households who decide to Modify their houses after the audit, monthly average-electricity use per square foot decreases 7%. While there is an estimated. 2% reduction in electricity use attributed to the audit by households who decided not to adopt the proposed modifications, this reduction is not statistically significant, casting doubt on the presence of modifications in behavior from the audit information itself. For all households audited, the results from the electricity demand models suggest that the LVE home energy audit program reduced household electricity use 4.7%. In contrast, a differences-in-differences approach using synthetic control groups based upon a smaller but. still sizeable sample of 2000 observations finds that home energy audits reduce household electricity use by more than 10%. Overall, these findings suggest that home audits result in modest but significant reductions in energy use and that co-funding encourages investments that otherwise may not be privately optimal.

Results indicated that the direct resource input (the first stage) along with on-site construction (the zeroth stage) consumed the highest amount of energy in the supply chain and accounted for approximately 50% of total energy consumption. Regional analysis showed that energy consumption in the construction industry at the provincial level was self-sufficient. Sectoral analysis demonstrated that the direct inputs from the sectors of manufacture of non-metallic mineral products and smelting and pressing of metals generated the most important energy flows, whereas the sectors of production and distribution of electric power and heat power and extraction of petroleum and natural gas significantly but indirectly influenced energy use.

Large-scale surveys and in-depth measurements of residential heating consumption is important to monitor trends. More importantly, a macro energy model that reflects the current status and that can be used to analyze future scenarios is needed. In this paper, a bottom-up model was established, and the results show the total energy consumption in the HSCW and the influences of building envelops, heating equipment efficiency, and especially occupant behavior on energy use. Related technical and policy suggestions were analyzed in different scenarios. Presently, energy consumption for heating in urban residential areas of the HSCW is relatively low, but is increasing rapidly, so the establishment of superior national building energy efficient designs requires attention. The findings suggest that the district heating network would not be feasible for the HSCW and decentralized heating should be the major heating method employed. Besides building efficiency, appliance efficiency should also be improved. Lastly, residents' behaviors in regards to the opening of windows can significantly influence energy use and should be carefully considered by policy makers and engineers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

City population density is one of the key factors that influence urban energy consumption and the subsequent GHG emissions. However, previous research on the relationship between population density and GHG emissions led to contradictory results due to urban/rural definition conundrum and the varying methodologies for estimating GHG emissions. This work addresses these ambiguities by employing the City Clustering Algorithm (CCA) and utilizing the gridded CO2 emissions data. Our results, derived from the analysis of all inhabited areas in the US, show a sub-linear relationship between population density and the total emissions (i.e. the sum of on-road and building emissions) on a per capita basis. Accordingly, we find that doubling the population density would entail a reduction in the total CO2 emissions in buildings and on-road sectors typically by at least 42%. Moreover, we find that population density exerts a higher influence on on-road emissions than buildings emissions. From an energy consumption point of view, our results suggest that on-going urban sprawl will lead to an increase in on-road energy consumption in cities and therefore stresses the importance of developing adequate local policy measures to limit urban sprawl.

The results showed that not only has the CAFE standard had a direct and significant impact on improving fuel economy and increasing the market share of fuel-efficient vehicles, it has also boosted the development of technologies for enhancing fuel economy and raised consumer interest in fuel economy, thus indirectly contributing to overcoming market failure. The significance of this study is that we used publically available observed data and analyzed the recent impact of the CAFE standard specifically with a focus on the behavior and strategies exhibited by consumers and automakers.

Incentive schemes such as subsidies, taxes and bonus-malus schemes are widely used to promote energy-efficient appliances. Most research, however, considers instruments in isolation, and only rarely in the context of political constraints on instrument use, or for alternative policy goals. This paper presents a methodology for the optimal design of incentive schemes based on the minimisation of Dead Weight Loss for different policy goals and policy restrictions. The use of the methodology is illustrated by designing optimal combinations of taxes and subsidies in Spain for three types of appliance: dishwashers, refrigerators and washing machines. The optimal policies are designed subject to different policy goals such as achieving a fixed reduction in emissions or a certain increased market share for efficient appliances, and for policy constraints such as budget neutrality. The methodology developed here can also be used to evaluate past and current incentive schemes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

First, we use detailed trade-flow data across European regions to decompose regional economic growth into two components: demand-led growth due to growing export markets and structural growth due to growing market shares in those export markets. Only structural growth, constituting on average approximately 20 per cent of total growth, is potentially affected by regionally varying locational characteristics. The second network novelty we introduce is revealed competition as a measure of regional network membership in the growth analysis. Applying a neo-classical regional growth model using geographically weighted regression, we show that the degree of revealed competition in trade and services between sectors moderates regional structural growth. Regions operating on similar international markets share more favourable structural growth prospects, with locational determinants being more - albeit still limited - significant due to similar externalities. With regional characteristics being of limited sectoral and geographical importance for structural growth, our results suggest that the recently advocated place-based development strategies of European regions should be complemented with competitive regional network strategies. Resumen En este articulo se introduce en dos formas nuevas la dependencia de las redes en los analisis del crecimiento regional europeo. En primer lugar, se utilizan datos detallados de flujos comerciales de las regiones europeas para separar el crecimiento economico regional en dos componentes: el crecimiento impulsado por la demanda debido al crecimiento de los mercados de exportacion y el crecimiento estructural debido al crecimiento de la cuota de mercado en dichos mercados de exportacion. Tan solo el crecimiento estructural, que constituye en promedio el 20 por ciento aproximadamente del crecimiento total, se ve afectado potencialmente por caracteristicas de ubicacion variables a escala regional. La segunda novedad que se presenta en cuanto a redes es la competencia revelada como una medida de la pertenencia a la red regional en el analisis del crecimiento. Mediante la aplicacion de un modelo de crecimiento regional neoclasico, que emplea una regresion ponderada geograficamente, se muestra que el grado de competencia revelada en el comercio y en los servicios entre los sectores modera el crecimiento estructural regional. Las regiones que operan en mercados internacionales similares comparten perspectivas de crecimiento estructural mas favorables, de modo que los determinantes de localizacion resultan mas significativos -aunque con limitaciones- debido a externalidades similares. Puesto que las caracteristicas regionales poseen una importancia geografica y sectorial limitada para el crecimiento estructural, nuestros resultados sugieren que las estrategias de desarrollo de las regiones europeas basadas en la localizacion, defendidas recientemente, deberian complementarse con estrategias de redes regionales competitivas.","[Thissen, Mark] PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands; [de Graaff, Thomas] Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands; [van Oort, Frank] Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Oort, Frank] Erasmus Univ, IHS, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands; [van Oort, Frank] Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr, POB 80115, NL-3508 DR Utrecht, Netherlands",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Erasmus University Rotterdam - Excl Erasmus MC; Erasmus University Rotterdam; Utrecht University,"Thissen, M (通讯作者)，PBL Netherlands Environm Assessment Agcy, POB 30314, NL-2500 GH The Hague, Netherlands.;de Graaff, T (通讯作者)，Vrije Univ Amsterdam, Dept Spatial Econ, Boelelaan 1105, NL-1081 HV Amsterdam, Netherlands.;van Oort, F (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, Erasmus Sch Econ, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.;van Oort, F (通讯作者)，Erasmus Univ, IHS, POB 1738, NL-3000 DR Rotterdam, Netherlands.;van Oort, F (通讯作者)，Univ Utrecht, Urban & Reg Res Ctr, POB 80115, NL-3508 DR Utrecht, Netherlands.",Mark.Thissen@pbl.nl; t.de.graaff@vu.nl; vanoort@ese.eur.nl,"Van Oort, Frank/ABA-9504-2020; Thissen, Mark/ABA-8140-2020","Van Oort, Frank/0000-0003-0614-768X; Thissen, Mark/0000-0001-7654-3253; de Graaff, Thomas/0000-0002-1782-9742",JPI Urban Europe Project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being [438-13-406],JPI Urban Europe Project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being,"Financial support of JPI Urban Europe Project 'Resilient Cities: Industrial Network and Institutional perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-Being (438-13-406)' is greatly acknowledged for Frank van Oort.

Using data from in-house weighing of fuel conducted in rural India, we examine the impact of cleaner cook stoves most of which are LPG stoves on three key outcomes related to solid fuel use. Our results suggest that using a clean cookstove is associated with daily reductions of about 4.5 kg of biomass fuel, 160 fewer minutes cooking on traditional stoves, and 105 fewer minutes collecting biomass fuels. These findings of substantial savings are robust to the use of estimators with varying levels of controlfor selection, and to alternative data obtained from household self-reports. Our results support the idea that efforts to promote clean stoves among poor rural households can reduce solid fuel use and cooking time, and that rebound effects toward greater amounts of cooking on multiple stoves are not sufficient to eliminate these gains. We also find, however, that households who have greater wealth, fewer members, are in less marginalized groups, and practice other health-averting behaviors, are more likely to use these cleaner stoves, which suggests that socioeconomic status plays an important role in determining who benefits from such technologies. Future efforts to capture social benefits must therefore consider how to promote the use of alternative technologies by poor households, given that these households are least likely to own clean stoves.

Discussing these complexities and the necessity to deal with them, this paper strives to help the country with a tool by introducing Richest Alternatives for Implementation to Supply Energy (RAISE), a mixed integer linear programming model developed by the means of GNUMathprog mathematical programming language. The paper fully elaborates authors' desired modeling mentality and formulations on which RAISE is programmed to work and verifies its structure by running a widely known sample case named UTOPIA and comparing the results with other works including OSeMOSYS and Temoa. The model applies RAISE model to Iranian energy sector to elicit optimal policy without and with a CO2 emission cap. The results suggest promotion of energy efficiency through investment on combined cycle power plants as the key to optimal policy in power generation sector. Regarding oil refining sector, investment on condensate refineries and advanced refineries equipped with Residual Fluid Catalytic Cracking (RFCC) units are suggested. Results also undermine the prevailing supposition that climate change mitigation deteriorates economic efficiency of energy system and suggest that there is a strong synergy between them. In the case of imposing a CO2 cap that aims at maintaining CO2 emissions from electricity production activities at 2012 levels, a shift to renewable energies occurs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the positive aspects are incontestable. One of these aspects is represented by the efforts of making the public administrative processes more efficient. Managers of public institutions were obligated, due to lack of funds, to concentrate on creating and/or developing various mechanisms in order to optimize the internal processes with the intention of assuring the development of their activities and obtaining their overall objective. By doing this, they gained the importance of organizational functions such as internal public audits, internal managerial control and governess. The intent of this paper is to present the efficient process which took place in public administration sector of Romania during the financial crisis and immediately after. In order to better understand this procedure, a comparative analysis between the process implemented in Romania and the ones applied by the European Union will be discussed.

Special attention is directed to statistical methods from the field of panel-data econometrics, which are able to deal with endogeneity problems and with structural reverse causality. The preferred estimator that is based on firm fixed effects insinuates that the voting rights of ultimate shareholders affect Tobin's q unambiguously negatively, whereas the squared voting rights affect it unambiguously positively. This implies a U-curved relationship between Tobin's q and voting rights concentration with a turning point at 45%. More than 75% of the companies fall in the upward sloping part of the curve. While positive incentive effects are at work in Pakistan, financial market development is retarded by the reluctance of minority shareholders facing dominant shareholders to hold small stakes in listed companies. Consistently, institutional shareholders do not yet provide a positive monitoring role in Pakistan.","[Afgan, Nouman; Gugler, Klaus] Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Vienna, Austria; [Kunst, Robert] Univ Vienna, Dept Econ, A-1010 Vienna, Austria",Vienna University of Economics & Business; University of Vienna,"Afgan, N (通讯作者)，Vienna Univ Econ & Business, Dept Quantitat Econ, Vienna, Austria.",nafgan@wu.ac.at; klaus.gugler@wu.ac.at; robert.kunst@univie.ac.at,"Kunst, Robert/C-7125-2017","Kunst, Robert/0000-0001-6831-2471",Higher Education Commission,Higher Education Commission(Ministry of Higher Education & Scientific Research (MHESR)),"We are grateful to the Higher Education Commission that supported the research.

While this certainly can be consistent with some observed agglomeration effects, it may be insufficient for the growth of a cluster. The key condition for this is that profitability is higher. The paper tests for agglomeration effects using a profit function approach. This may be particularly important for firms in high-cost clusters, where revenue effects can be as important as productivity and cost effects. The paper tests for both intra- and inter-industry agglomeration externalities using firm-level data.","[Asche, Frank; Roll, Kristin H.] Univ Stavanger, Dept Ind Econ, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway; [Tveteras, Ragnar] Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway",Universitetet i Stavanger; Universitetet i Stavanger,"Tveteras, R (通讯作者)，Univ Stavanger, UiS Business Sch, N-4036 Stavanger, Norway.",frank.asche@uis.no; kristin.h.roll@uis.no; ragnar.tveteras@uis.no,"Asche, Frank/AAG-9920-2020","Asche, Frank/0000-0002-1540-9728; Tveteras, Ragnar/0000-0002-8553-556X",Norwegian Research Council (Norges forskningsrad) [234121/E40],Norwegian Research Council (Norges forskningsrad),This work was supported by the Norwegian Research Council (Norges forskningsrad) [grant number 234121/E40].,,48,31,32,2,24,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Two models have been developed and their results compared: one based on the energy intensity (IE) and another one on a link with the country urbanization rate (URB). The IE model allowed to segment energy consumption in four posts while the URB model only in two posts. For the sensitivity analysis to economic growth, three future GDP evolution scenarios are proposed. The retrospective correlations of both models are excellent but their future extrapolations finish in slightly different results. Through their correlation to electricity consumption, peak power forecasts are also presented. A forecast of the country energy intensity is commented. As the average yearly increase of electricity should still be between 4.9% and 7.1% during 2020-2030, the electric equipment program continuation after 2020 must soon be clarified and avoid the former implementation delays. As the white combustibles needs should yearly increase between 6.3% and 7.8% in 2020-2030, electrical equipment programs should also make provisions for the case of deployment of electric cars. Butane subsidies widen the gap with other fuels and must be removed very soon possible to reduce the growth of its consumption and energy intensity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The saving concept has an important and crucial place in all economies. Indeed, the importance of savings leads to the discussion of determinants of savings in the literature. Moreover, with an awareness of the determinants of savings, the government have to put effort for increasing savings with using policies and precautions on their institutions. In this point, raising the savings of a household, which is an important element of economic life, has gained an crucial role. However, it is clear that all factors which have impacts on it should be known to solve this issue. Narrowing into transition economies, which transited from a planned economic system to market economy, the structure of savings has changed from public funds to private savings. It is clear that saving habits cannot change or adapt in the short term, in fact this paper aims to put forward recommendations to policymakers in transition economies. In this paper, it has been investigated how demographic determinants are effective on saving ratios using panel data analysis between 1993 and 2013 on 20 transition economies. The chosen demographic and economic variables are dependency ratio (total, youth and old), GDP per capita growth, population density, urban population of percentage of total population, female participation of labour force, unemployment rate.

In particular, we analyze the short- and mid-term interactions between fiscal policy and emissions by using sign restrictions to identify the policy shocks. We construct the impulse responses to linear combinations of fiscal shocks, corresponding to the scenarios of deficit-financed spending and deficit-financed tax-cuts. To consider possible variations of the effect of fiscal policy according to the sources of pollution, we distinguish between production- and consumption-generated CO2 emissions. The results point out that the implementation of expansionary fiscal spending provides an alleviating effect on emissions from both sources of the pollutant, whereas deficit-financed tax-cuts are associated with an increase on consumption-generated CO2 emissions. The exact pattern of the effects depends on the source of emissions, the scenario of fiscal policy that is implemented and the functional class of government expenditure being increased.

The results show that the new rural sports is an important component of well-off society construction, which has outstanding value in the new rural culture construction, economic development as well as the shaping of new farmers. In the new period, the introduction of new rural construction policy and the development of rural economy, farmer's lifestyle as well as the sports industry have provided good improving platform for the rural sports.

However, China is a large developing agriculture country and there are nearly 80% of the population lives in the countryside, so the rural problem is obviously becoming the core and difficult point in the full-around well-off society construction. In order to promote the rural economic and cultural development in a further way, it is clearly stated in the passed in the 4th session of the 10th National People's Congress to build a new socialist countryside, develop rural culture undertakings and promote and implement peasants fitness project. It can be seen that in the process of building a well-off society in a full-around way, rural sports has become an important part of building well-off society and new socialist countryside. So how to develop a new rural sports that matches the construction of new socialist countryside is becoming a practical problem that needs urgent study and solution in our country.

The use of the limited resources has also increased in Europe and it holds true in the V4 countries, too. That is the reason why this question is also important in the V4 countries, but the natural possibilities are different. The goal of the countries is to find those alternative or renewable energy sources which could be suitable for solving this problem, and boost the economy instead of destroying their natural environment. In this paper I compare the energy utilisation of V4 countries in the past, the structure of the fossil and renewable energy usage nowadays and examine those possibilities (wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy, biomass), which can help them reduce their energy dependency from other countries. These countries need to increase the ratio of the utilisation of renewable- and alternative resources in the future if they want to satisfy their population demand.","[Magda, Robert] Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Econ Law & Methodol, Dept Microecon, Pater Karoly Ut 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Magda, R (通讯作者)，Szent Istvan Univ, Inst Econ Law & Methodol, Dept Microecon, Pater Karoly Ut 1, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",magda.robert@gtk.szie.hu,"Magda, Robert/HCH-0867-2022",,,,,,6,0,0,0,3,SLOVAK UNIV AGRICULTURE NITRA,NITRA,"TR A HLINKU2, NITRA, 94976, SLOVAKIA",,,978-80-552-1503-7,,,,2016,,,,,,,123,128,,10.15414/isd2016.s2.03,0.0,,,6,Agricultural Economics & Policy; Business; Food Science & Technology,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Agriculture; Business & Economics; Food Science & Technology,BG7BT,,"hybrid, Green Submitted",,,2024-03-09,WOS:000391174500013,0

An important role in the comprehensive care of individuals with an incurable disease is special education, because in addition to education it deals with the stigma attached to the care and education of families with a child with an incurable disease. The paper presents the partial results of research focused on the problems of individuals with oncological disease in the context of special education. Research data were obtained by a variety of methods, where the most crucial were the semi-structured interview method and the method of narration. These methods were applied on individuals with oncological disease who had been diagnosed with cancer during the time of schooling. The obtained data were processed by qualitative analysis.

We begin by discussing the theory of international trade cooperation in electricity, with a view to discussing what preconditions might be important in facilitating wide area trading across national borders. We then develop lessons based on the comparison of four case studies. These include three regional developing country power pools - the Southern African Power pool (SAPP), West African Power pool (WAPP) and the Central American Power Market (MER). We contrast these with Northern Europe's Nord Pool. These cases highlight both the potential and difficulty of having cross-jurisdictional power pools. In the light of the theory and evidence we present, we draw key lessons in the areas of: preconditions for trading; necessary institutional arrangements; practicalities of timetabling; reasons to be hopeful about future prospects.

To put it in a different way, cuisines where many different identities of a society merge together and national feelings are felt most are a mirror of daily life styles, religious beliefs, habits, traditions and customs. Changes of eating style in societies and rising the value of eating socially have been one of the reasons for movements in tourism activities. Gastronomy tourism has become major and has become a rapidly growing component of the attractiveness of tourism destination in recent years. The marketing opportunities to gastronomy tourism are being developed by the countries given importance to that issue. Tourists' wishes to experience the local tastes in the destinations and accommodation facilities have prepared the ground for the development of gastronomy tourism. Tourism businesses that realized the importance to gastronomy tourism given by local and foreign tourists have featured the gastronomic factors in their facilities. Therefore, it is ensured that to take attention for gastronomy, tourism should be managed in coordination with all tourism-related foundations and civil society organizations and with the encouragement of relevant ministries.

By 2006 the majority of maquiladoras were located off-border with notable growth in higher value-added manufacturing. The evolving geography of export-oriented industrialization has been the subject of descriptive narratives that purportedly model manufacturing trends. This study reviews these models positing the flying geese metaphor provides an explanation for Mexico's transitioning maquiladoras. The study focuses on the metaphor's underlying themes, sectoral and spatial trends, and finds increasing product sector segmentation by value-added and location. Among the paper's contributions is the incorporation of statistical significance that differentiates explanation from description, thereby adding analytical underpinning for an understanding of transitioning export-oriented manufactures.","[South, Robert B.] Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geog, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"South, RB (通讯作者)，Univ Cincinnati, Dept Geog, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA.",robert.south@uc.edu,,,,,,,47,5,5,2,12,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Cycle ergometer exercise tests were conducted to assess CRF as indicated by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). Participants were categorized into three CRF levels (low, moderate and high). High CRF level was associated with significantly less BF%, lower PWV, and higher weekly physical activity compared with low and moderate CRF (P < 0.05). Compared to high CRF, the odds ratios for having >= 3 main CVD risk factors (overweight, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) in low and moderate CRF were 2.09 (95% CI: 1.48-2.94) and 1.84 (95% CI: 1.29-2.62), respectively.

Accordingly, this paper proposes a methodology using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for assessment of the energy credits through studying and comparing four of the common global rating systems, the British Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM), the American Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the Australian Green Stars (GS), and the PEARL assessment system of the United Arab Emirates, in order to contribute to the enhancement of the Egyptian Green Pyramid Rating System (GPRS). The results show the mandatory and optional energy credits that should be considered with their proposed weights according to the present and future needs of green Egypt. The results are compared to data gathered through desk studies and results extracted from recent questionnaires. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","[Aleem, Shady H. E.

GB 50189-2005 played a crucial role in regulating the energy efficiency in Chinese commercial buildings. The standard was recently updated in 2014 to increase energy savings targets by 30% compared with the 2005 standard. This paper reviews the major changes to the standard, including expansion of energy efficiency coverage and more stringent efficiency requirements. The paper also discusses the interrelationship of the design standard with China's other building energy standards. Furthermore, comparisons are made with ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013 to provide contrasting differences in efficiency requirements. Finally recommendations are provided to guide the future standard revision, focusing on three areas: (1) increasing efficiency requirements of building envelope and HVAC systems, (2) adding a whole-building performance compliance pathway and implementing a ruleset based automatic code baseline model generation in an effort to reduce the discrepancies of baseline models created by different tools and users, and (3) adding inspection and commissioning requirements to ensure building equipment and systems are installed correctly and operate as designed.

To address this need, the government created a programme called My house, My life. The main subsidies of the programme are for families earning up to three times the minimum wage. In order to formulate strategies for more energy efficiency buildings, it is necessary to understand the thermal and energy performance of what is being built. This article defines representative projects for typologies being built in the Brazilian social housing sector through the analysis of 108 projects considering two groups of income levels and investigates the thermal and energy performance of the representative projects in relation to the Regulation for Energy Efficiency Labelling of Residential Buildings in Brazil for two bioclimatic zones. Five representative building models were defined. Considering the most common features found on the sample, the study suggests the importance of addresing energy efficiency measures on the sector since current building techniques for social housing shows a tendency towards a low performance in relation to the thermal and energy performance criteria of the Energy Labelling especially for lower income projects. This provides a basis for future policy and allows for more in depth studies within the sector. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Knowledge, innovation and productivity gains across European regions, Regional Studies. This paper studies the relationship between knowledge, innovation and productivity in European regions, looking for the sources of spatial heterogeneity across regions in the type of knowledge needed for innovation and in the propensity to innovate, which mostly depend upon specific and systemic context conditions. The conceptual framework of analysis is based on the strong belief that different modes of innovation characterize regions, according to the presence/absence of some context conditions that allow for the creation and/or adoption of knowledge and innovation. Given the differences in knowledge and innovation intensity that characterize each mode/pattern of innovation, expectations are formulated on the achievement of productivity gains in regions characterized by different innovation patterns. Empirical evidence supports the conceptual expectations and shows that in regional innovation patterns based on local scientific knowledge-creation processes there are positive returns to scientific knowledge. However, in less knowledge-intensive patterns considerable productivity gains can also be achieved by local actors exploiting non-scientific knowledge and innovative capacity. Importantly, whereas the benefits accruing from knowledge appear rather selective and concentrated in a relatively small number of regions, the benefits generated by innovation seem more pervasive and beneficial, even in regions with a low endowment of scientific knowledge. These results have considerable implications for the current design of European Union innovation policies at the regional level.","[Capello, Roberta; Lenzi, Camilla] Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy",Polytechnic University of Milan,"Capello, R (通讯作者)，Politecn Milan, Dept ABC, I-20133 Milan, Italy.",camilla.lenzi@polimi.it,"Lenzi, Camilla/ABE-4498-2022","Capello, Roberta/0000-0003-0438-6900",,,,,51,49,49,0,39,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Substitution or overlap? The relations between geographical and non-spatial proximity dimensions in collaborative innovation projects, Regional Studies. Traditionally, economic geographers stress geographical proximity's positive impact on collaboration processes. However, effects of cognitive, organizational, social and institutional proximity dimensions have been emphasized recently. This paper examines the relations between geography and these non-spatial dimensions by distinguishing two mechanisms: the substitution mechanism, where non-spatial forms of proximity substitute for geographical proximity; and the overlap mechanism, where geographical proximity facilitates non-spatial proximity. The two mechanisms' importance is analysed in collaborative innovation projects in the Danish cleantech industry. Regression models are complemented by a qualitative analysis of the relationship between the geographical and institutional dimensions.","Lund Univ, CIRCLE, S-22100 Lund, Sweden",Lund University,"Hansen, T (通讯作者)，Lund Univ, CIRCLE, POB 117, S-22100 Lund, Sweden.",teis.hansen@circle.lu.se,"Hansen, Teis/E-8032-2011","Hansen, Teis/0000-0001-9383-3471","Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen; Swedish Research Council [349200680]; Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems [2010-07370]","Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen; Swedish Research Council(Swedish Research Council); Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems(Vinnova)","This study was funded by the Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen.

Using a detailed fundamental model of price formation risks, under increasing replacement of fossil fuel facilities with onshore and offshore wind, we show that the risk return profile becomes less attractive over time, and may therefore need sustained and possibly increasing policy support. Furthermore, we show that green certificate trading may become progressively more attractive as a supplementary support to wholesale prices, compared to fixed feed-in-tariffs. This is because the increasingly negative correlation between renewable output and wholesale prices reduces its revenue risk compared to fixed feed-in tariffs, if other factors remain constant, and thereby improves conventional financial performance risk metrics. In particular, this suggests that the recent energy policy change in Britain to move away from green certificates and into contracts-for-differences may have been ill-founded. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

J. Does enhanced student commitment reduce school dropout? Evidence from two major dropout regions in the Netherlands, Regional Studies. Enhanced student commitment to the school, peers and teachers may improve student motivation and reduce school dropout. A Dutch dropout prevention measure in this respect deals with smoothing the transition from the pre-vocational school to the vocational school in order to reduce school dropout. Potential dropout students are followed during the summer break, go through an intake procedure, and communication between the pre-vocational school and the vocational school is enhanced by transferring a file containing detailed information on the student. Also a small government experiment offered the possibility to students to attend classes from familiar teachers in their pre-vocational school. Using regional borders as an instrument, and accounting for differences in the underlying student population in a quasi-experimental set-up, the results show, on the one hand, that the transition policy did not decline school dropout among native Dutch students. On the other hand, ethnic minority students increasingly dropped out of school one year after the transition policy became effective.","Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands",Maastricht University,"Cabus, SJ (通讯作者)，Maastricht Univ, Top Inst Evidence Based Educ Res TIER, Kapoenstr 2, NL-6200 MD Maastricht, Netherlands.",s.cabus@maastrichtuniversity.nl,,,,,,,39,8,11,2,42,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD",ABINGDON,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",0034-3404,1360-0591,,REG STUD,Reg.

Using survey data from 2011 on annual consumption of electricity and sample-derived average electricity price, we provide country-specific price elasticity estimates and average income elasticity estimates. For most countries in our sample, we find strong price responsiveness, with elasticities varying (in absolute value) between 0.27 for South Korea and 1.4 for Australia, and higher than 0.5 for most countries. Exploiting the presence of many attitudinal indicators in the dataset, we provide evidence that non-price related factors to affect energy demand; in particular, households' self-reported energy savings behaviour reduces demand between 2 and 4%. In contrast, we find very weak income responsiveness, with income elasticities varying from 0.07 to 0.16 and no evidence for heterogeneity across the countries in our sample. Our results regarding price elasticity are in contrast with those of many existing studies which find low-to-moderate price responsiveness, and adds to a few recent studies indicating more policy space for demand reduction than previously thought.

A parametric bootstrap procedure is proposed for implementation of the tests. The procedure is shown to work very well in a set of simulation experiments, and to compare favorably with other commonly used goodness-of-fit tests. By varying the parameter of the statistic, one can obtain information on how the distribution that generated a sample diverges from the target family of distributions when the true distribution does not belong to that family.

Consumer perceptions regarding the brand's country-of-origin must concur with product category associations in order to avoid negative country-of-origin influences on the brand's perceived positioning.

The study is based on analysis of a rich bibliography on the development of health tourism, as well as a quantification of this process, for the period 1993-2012. The Spa tourism phenomenon was measured based on the evolution of the number of tickets issued (National House of Health Insurances - CNAS), tourist traffic in the SPA's, and the evolution of the accommodation, made by the National Institute of Statistics in Romania. A database of NACE (Classification of National Economic Activities) was built, for the period 2000-2012, to analyze the evolution of the number of firms, number of employees and the annual growth business and profit.

The report shows, that with an aging world population the traditional informal care provided by family, friends and community ceases to be sustainable. The world report expects that in approximately 40 years the number of dependent older people will be almost three times higher -from 101 million in 2010 to 277 million in 2050. The World Health Organisation (2013) divided old age into three stages. From early old age, 60 to 74, from 74 to 89 years of age and 90 years or more is denoted like longevity. As the biggest health insurance company in the Czech Republic, the General Health Insurance Company (VZP) issues nearly 600 million Czech crowns for the treatment of patients with the Alzheimer's disease. Every year there are more and more patients, last year VZP recorded more than 27 thousand patients. While not in all cases is disease diagnosed in time. Experts estimated that Alzheimer's disease which is in most cases the most common cause of dementia is suffered by more than 130 thousand of citizens of Czech Republic. Every state creates its own program which focuses on old age and aging in the Czech Republic it is the National program of preparation for aging of the population. The aim of this program is to create conditions for the solutions of aging issues and to achieve changes in attitudes and approaches at every level. Therefore, it is necessary provide support from state and other non-state institutions which can improve the quality of life for senior citizens. The support means some kind of handover or support in various forms of assistance in diverse situations (material, economical, informational etc.).

Companies should also be aware of the fact that the high-potential label is not recognition of employee's past results, but it is more likely the assessment of his potential contribution in the future, therefore it is impossible to implement the management of high-potential employees in isolation.

The materials and methods used for research consisted in treaties and scientific articles regarding the characteristics and nutritional facts of the horse meat, statistical databases, data about its production and consumption, studies among consumers and media items on the horse meat scandal, and official documents concerning the food fraud. Although the horse meat scandal has affected the European consumer behavior, the main problems are not nutritional or food safety. This type of meat is a valuable new foodstuff, with physical, chemical and nutritional characteristics higher or closer to those of other domestic animals, being a part of the traditional diet in many communities. Yet, the main problems are those related to ethics, such as the attempts of fraud of some producers or traders. The European Union reacted promptly to the scandal of beef substitution with horse meat, proposing measures for strengthening the system of control and food fraud prevention. (C) 2015 The Authors.

As economic growth in developed economies has almost peaked, developing economies are becoming to be the source of firm's future growth. Additionally, as SMEs are relevant economic actors in the majority of developed economies where they provide growth and wealth, and also play a relevant role in developing economies where they contribute to alleviate poverty, their international expansion to developing economies deserves research attention. However, extant literature in international business has little addressed SMEs' internationalization; particularly as such firms expand into developing economies. Purpose of Study. To provide a first cohesive model to recommend a process of SME's knowledge acquisition to successfully enter into its first developing economy. Sources of Evidence. We review and integrate the literature on developing economies, international business, and organizational knowledge. Main Argument. Developing economies have weak institutional environments with high levels of business uncertainty, institutional voids, political instability, weak legal systems, and exchanges based on social networks, among other adverse locational factors. These institutional conditions are highly distant from those of SMEs from developed economies; thus, these firms entering into developing economies must develop new strategies in order to succeed in their international expansion processes -e.g., designing operations by creating intermediaries or bypassing inefficient markets, extending the framework for quality to other dimensions such as availability or timeliness. In order to implement these new strategies, SMEs must develop new ownership advantages -e.g., political capabilities, abilities to operate in informal markets, high flexibility-. Within this process of strategic change, SMEs would have to acquire those knowledge resources needed for a successful implementation of the new competitive strategies in developing economies. To the best of our knowledge, no article has been published that attempt to systematically assess type of knowledge required for internationalization to the first developing economy, the challenges its acquisition represents, and the sources for acquiring that knowledge. Conclusions. Four different types of internationalization knowledge and seven different sources of them must be considered by SMEs when internationalizing to their first developing economy. As developing economies as highly distant from developed ones, additional challenges add to those commonly associated with the acquisition of each type of knowledge. This work takes them into account and offers a normative model of SMEs' knowledge acquisition to successfully enter into their first developing economy. This model suggests the suitable sources for each type of knowledge along time. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.","[Suarez-Ortega, S. M.; Garcia-Cabrera, A.

Physical activity and alcohol consumption, for instance, may be beneficial to one's health in moderate but detrimental in large quantities. We develop a demand-for-health framework that incorporates the feature of a physiologically optimal level. An individual may still choose a physiologically non-optimal level, because of the trade-off in his or her preferences for health versus other utility-affecting commodities. However, any deviation above or below the physiologically optimal level will be punished with respect to health. Distinguishing between two individual types we study (a) the qualitative properties of optimal time-paths of health capital and health-related behaviour, (b) the perturbations of the optimal time-paths that result from changes in exogenous parameters, and (c) steady state properties.

More cost-effective surgical techniques and the centralization/regionalization of services are two solutions. The former requires an assessment of newer minimally invasive and muscle-sparing surgical techniques. The latter necessitates an effective volume-outcome (VO) relationship. Prior studies have failed to evaluate and control for the VO relation. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative cost and outcome effectiveness of two minimally invasive and one muscle-sparing techniques while evaluating and controlling for a potentially endogenous VO relation. Methods An all payer claims database for all THR performed in Maine in 2011 was used. The cost and outcome effectiveness of newer minimally invasive (modified Hardinge) and muscle-sparing (modified Watson-Jones) techniques were compared with the standard bearer posterior minimally invasive method. Using regression analysis, the outcomes analyzed were as follows: total costs, length of hospital stay, nursing care and home discharges, and use of physical therapy. Regression analysis was also used to evaluate and control for VO effects. Results (1) Newer muscle-sparing and minimally invasive approaches are substantially more effective; (2) irrespective of technique, higher volume surgeons are more effective; (3) technique-specific VO effects for more complex techniques exist and show substantial savings when yearly volume exceeds 30-50; and (4) the anterolateral muscle-sparing technique is accessible to the average surgeon. Conclusion Reliance on newer surgical techniques and centralization/regionalization of THR services can reduce costs.","[Goldstein, Jonathan P.; Millar, Andrew] Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA; [Babikian, George M.; Rana, Adam J.; Mackenzie, Johanna A.] Maine Med Ctr, Dept Surg, Div Joint Replacement, Portland, ME 04102 USA; [Babikian, George M.; Rana, Adam J.; Mackenzie, Johanna A.] 5 Bucknam Rd,Suite 1D, Falmouth, ME 04105 USA",Bowdoin College; Maine Medical Center,"Goldstein, JP (通讯作者)，Bowdoin Coll, Dept Econ, 9700 Coll Stn, Brunswick, ME 04011 USA.",jgoldste@bowdoin.edu,,,,,,,65,6,6,0,6,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Such measures are typically composed of two or more underlying discrete variables. In this paper, I investigate conditions where the estimated treatment effect based solely on the composite outcome is biased under non-random treatment assignment, which I refer to as composite bias. I then compare the magnitude of this bias across a variety of estimators, including ordinary least squares, propensity score estimators, and an alternative two-stage approach that first estimates treatment effects on the underlying outcomes and then combines these effects into an overall effect on the composite outcome of interest. The results highlight the presence of composite bias, identify general conditions under which such bias exists, and offer guidance as to how best to minimize this bias in practice.

The purpose is to analyze how a paternalistic government, which implements a time-consistent mix of labor income taxation, capital income taxation and commodity taxation, ought to use this tax system for purposes of redistribution and correction when individual ability is private information. Among the results, we show how the (nonlinear) income taxes ought to be used as indirect instruments for influencing the commodity demand behavior at the individual level: the intuition is that linear commodity taxes are not flexible enough to achieve proper incentives for consumption of unhealthy goods.
