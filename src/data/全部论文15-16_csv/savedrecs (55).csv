In this study we examine the cost effectiveness of antipsychotics for schizophrenia in Uganda. Methods We developed a decision-analytic 10-state Markov model to represent the clinical and treatment course of schizophrenia and the experience of the average patient within the Uganda healthcare system. The model was run for a base population of 25-years-old patients attending Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital, in annual cycles over a lifetime horizon. Parameters were derived from a primary chart abstraction study, a local community pharmacy survey, published literature, and expert opinion where necessary. We computed mean disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs (in US$2012) for each antipsychotic, incremental cost, and DALYs averted as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results In the base-case analysis, mean DALYs were highest with chlorpromazine (27.608), followed by haloperidol (27.563), while olanzapine (27.552) and risperidone had the lowest DALYs (27.557). Expected costs were highest with quetiapine (US$4943), and lowest with risperidone (US$4424). Compared to chlorpromazine, haloperidol was a dominant option (i.e. it was less costly and more effective); and risperidone was dominant over both haloperidol and quetiapine. The ICER comparing olanzapine to risperidone was US$5868 per DALY averted. Conclusion When choosing between first-generation antipsychotics, clinicians should consider haloperidol as the first-line agent for schizophrenia. However, overall, risperidone is a cost-saving strategy; policymakers should consider its addition to essential medicines lists for treatment of schizophrenia in Uganda.","[Lubinga, Solomon J.; Babigumira, Joseph B.] Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Lubinga, Solomon J.; Babigumira, Joseph B.] Univ Washington, Dept Global Hlth, Global Med Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA; [Mutamba, Byamah B.] Butabika Natl Referral Hosp Mental Neurol & Subst, Kampala, Uganda; [Nganizi, Angelo] Kad Hosp, Kampala, Uganda",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle; University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lubinga, SJ (通讯作者)，Univ Washington, Dept Pharm, Pharmaceut Outcomes Res & Policy Program, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",slubinga@uw.edu,"Lubinga, Solomon James/AAD-6637-2019; Babigumira, Joseph/T-4208-2019","Lubinga, Solomon James/0000-0003-0539-9156;",,,,,55,6,8,0,7,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

We show that the Anderson and Hsiao (1981, 1982) simple instrumental variable estimator (IV) or maximizing the likelihood function with initial value distribution properly treated (quasi-maximum likelihood estimator) is asymptotically unbiased when either N or T or both tend to infinity. On the other hand, the QMLE mistreating the initial value as fixed is asymptotically unbiased only if N is fixed and T is large. If both N and T are large and N/T -> c (c not equal 0, c < infinity) as T -> infinity, it is asymptotically biased of order root N/T. We also explore the source of the bias of the Arellano and Bond (1991) type GMM estimator. We show that it is asymptotically biased of order root T/N if T/N -> c (c not equal 0, c < infinity) as N -> infinity even if we restrict the number of instruments used. Monte Carlo studies show that whether an estimator is asymptotically biased or not has important implications on the actual size of the conventional t-test. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In 1998, the Chinese government imposed stringent air pollution regulations, in one of the first large-scale regulatory attempts in a developing country. We find that the infant mortality rate fell by 20 percent in the treatment cities designated as Two Control Zones. The greatest reduction in mortality occurred during the neonatal period, highlighting an important pathophysiologic mechanism, and was largest among infants born to mothers with low levels of education. The finding is robust to various alternative hypotheses and specifications. Further, a falsification test using deaths from causes unrelated to air pollution supports these findings.

Methods: The current therapeutic pathway was identified by searching medical databases and from the results of a survey of practice in Italian clinical reference centers. A systematic review was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of second-line alternatives. Budget impact and cost-effectiveness analyses were performed from the Italian National Health Service perspective over a 7-year time horizon through the adaption of a Markov model. The following health states were considered: complete and partial response, stable disease, and progression. A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. Results: The most common alternatives used in Italy for the management of steroid-refractory/resistant cGvHD were ECP, mycophenolate, pentostatin, and imatinib. The literature review highlighted that complete and partial responses are higher with ECP than with the alternatives while serious adverse events are less common. The economic analysis showed that Therakos online ECP represents the dominating alternative, in that it delivers greater benefit at a lower cost. In fact, according to the alternatives considered, cost saving ranged from (sic)3237.09 to (sic)19,903.51 per patient with 0.04 to 0.21 quality adjusted life year gained. Conclusions: Therakos online ECP should be considered an effective, safe, and cost-effective alternative in steroid-refractory/resistant cGvHD. There is inequality in access, and a dedicated reimbursement tariff, however, should be introduced to overcome these barriers.","[de Waure, Chiara; Capri, Stefano; Veneziano, Maria Assunta; Specchia, Maria Lucia; Cadeddu, Chiara; Di Nardo, Francesco; Ferriero, Anna Maria; Mancuso, Agostino; Quaranta, Gianluigi; Raponi, Matteo; Valerio, Luca; Ricciardi, Walter] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Publ Hlth, Sect Hyg, I-00168 Rome, Italy; [Capri, Stefano] LIUC Univ, Sch Econ & Management, Castellanza, VA, Italy; [Gennari, Francesca; Hamilton, Colette] Therakos Inc, W Chester, PA USA; [Gensini, Gianfranco] Univ Florence, Dept Expt & Clin Med, Fac Med, Florence, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; Universita Carlo Cattaneo - Liuc; University of Florence,"de Waure, C (通讯作者)，Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Publ Hlth, Sect Hyg, L go F Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy.",chiara.dewaure@rm.unicatt.it,"Ricciardi, Walter/K-3342-2018; Dewaure, Chiara/K-7192-2016; Valerio, Luca/AGX-7211-2022; Cadeddu, Chiara/AFN-3082-2022; Di Nardo, Francesco/B-6703-2017; Ricciardi, Walter/AAB-2056-2019; Di Nardo, Francesco/AAD-1680-2019","Dewaure, Chiara/0000-0002-4346-1494; Valerio, Luca/0000-0003-4466-0724; Cadeddu, Chiara/0000-0003-0149-1078; Di Nardo, Francesco/0000-0003-3655-0904; Ricciardi, Walter/0000-0002-5655-688X; Di Nardo, Francesco/0000-0002-5362-3776; Capri, Stefano/0000-0003-4633-4420; Specchia, Maria Lucia/0000-0002-3859-4591; , Matteo/0000-0001-8688-9960",,,,,77,25,25,0,11,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,457,466,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.01.009,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091600.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600013,0

Both least squares and instrumental variables estimates are examined, and the permissible rate of growth of the dimension of the parameter space relative to sample size is studied. Besides allowing the number of parameters to increase with the data, this has the advantage of accommodating some asymptotic regimes that are suggested by certain spatial settings, several of which are discussed. A small empirical example is also included, and a Monte Carlo study analyses various implications of the theory in finite samples. (C) 2015 The Authors.

From data on almost all residents of Austria, a country with mandatory health insurance and universal health coverage, we estimated potential cost savings by substituting prescribed medicines with the cheapest medicines that were of the same chemical substance and strength, and available during the same time. Methods Data from 8.3 million persons (98.5 % of the total Austrian insured population) from 2009-2012 were analyzed. Real prescription costs for antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic medicines achievable by same-substance, same-strength drug substitution were computed for each active ingredient, and per gender and 1-year age category of patients. Results In 2012, health insurance providers spent (sic)231.3 million, (sic)77.8 million, and (sic)91.9 million for antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and diabetes medications, of which (sic)52.2 million (22.6 %), (sic)15.9 million (20.5 %), and (sic)4.1 million (4.5 %), respectively, could have been saved by same-substance drug substitution. Highest potential savings were calculated for amlodipine ((sic)8.0 million, 65.4 %), simvastatin ((sic)12.2 million, 59.3 %), and metformin ((sic)2.4 million, 54.6 %), respectively. Higher savings for men than for women resulted from differing prescribed cumulative dosages and proportions of patients with co-payment waiver. Potential cost savings in antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs increased from 2009-2012. Conclusion Our study highlights the cost-savings potential from arguably the most acceptable of interventions, simply switching to the cheapest available same-substance, same-strength product. In 2012, this strategy could have reduced costs for antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and hypoglycemic treatment by up to 18.0 %.","[Heinze, Georg; Hronsky, Milan] Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Med Stat Informat & Intelligent Syst, Sect Clin Biometr, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Reichardt, Berthold] Burgenland Gebietskrankenkasse, Sickness Fund Burgenland, Eisenstadt, Austria; [Baumgaertel, Christoph; Muellner, Marcus] Austrian Agcy Hlth & Food Safety, Vienna, Austria; [Muellner, Marcus] PERI Change GmbH, Vienna, Austria; [Bucsics, Anna] Austrian Social Secur Inst, Main Assoc, Vienna, Austria; [Bucsics, Anna] Univ Vienna, Dept Finance, Vienna, Austria; [Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C.] Stanford Univ, Sch Med, Div Nephrol, Palo Alto, CA 94304 USA; [Winkelmayer, Wolfgang C.] Baylor Coll Med, Dept Med, Nephrol Sect, Houston, TX 77030 USA",Medical University of Vienna; University of Vienna; Stanford University; Baylor College of Medicine,"Heinze, G (通讯作者)，Med Univ Vienna, Ctr Med Stat Informat & Intelligent Syst, Sect Clin Biometr, Spitalgasse 23, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.",georg.heinze@meduniwien.ac.at,"Bucsics, Anna E/HJP-5793-2023","Hronsky, Milan/0000-0003-3788-3639; Heinze, Georg/0000-0003-1147-8491",University of Vienna [Zl. 21-VPM-68.92/11]; Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions [Zl. 21-VPM-68.92/11]; Osterreichische Apotheker-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH,University of Vienna; Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions; Osterreichische Apotheker-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH,"This study was conducted under contract number Zl. 21-VPM-68.92/11 between the Medical University of Vienna (Georg Heinze, Principal Investigator) and the Main Association of Austrian Social Security Institutions.

We investigate the extent to which greater supply of nursing home beds or lower prices can reduce hospital bed-blocking using a new Local Authority (LA) level administrative data from England on hospital delayed discharges in 2009-2013. The results suggest that delayed discharges respond to the availability of care home beds, but the effect is modest: an increase in care home beds by 10% (250 additional beds per LA) would reduce social care delayed discharges by about 6-9%. We also find strong evidence of spillover effects across LAs: more care home beds or fewer patients aged over 65years in nearby LAs are associated with fewer delayed discharges. (c) 2015 The Authors.

Methods: The trade-off between the efficiency and fairness of allocation strategies was demonstrated through an illustrative simulation study of an influenza epidemic in Southwestern Virginia. A Susceptible-Exposed-infectious-Recovered model was used to represent the disease progression within the host Results: Our findings showed that among all the criteria considered here, the household size (largest first) combined with age (youngest first)-based strategy leads to the best outcome. At 80% fairness, highest efficiency can be achieved but in order to be 100% fair, disease prevalence will have to rise by approximately 1.5%.

Conventional estimation methods rely on the key assumption that the spatial weight matrix is strictly exogenous, which would likely be violated in some empirical applications where spatial weights are determined by economic factors.

We provide three estimation methods: two-stage instrumental variable (2SIV) method, quasi-maximum likelihood estimation (QMLE) approach, and generalized method of moments (GMM).

In this study, we tested the effect of biosorbent dosage and contact time of Cd2+ ions with different dried algal biomass or plant on biosorption efficiency (%). The initial concentration of Cd2+ ions was 10 mg/L. The solutions were filtered in four time intervals. Final concentration of Cd2+ ions in the filtrates was determined by the atomic absorption spectrometry on the CONTRAA 700 (Analytik Jena) at the wavelength 228.8 nm. The biosorption efficiency was found to be biomass dosage dependent. When the biomass dose was increased ten times, from 0.2 g/L on 2 g/L, the maximum biosorption efficiency of Cd2+ increased 75.05% from 39.01. The alga Parachlorella was demonstrated as the most effective biosorbent of ions Cd2+ with maximum percentage biosorption 73.14% (corresponds to 3.657 mg Cd2+/g DW), in comparison to Tillandsia usneoides which only reached 37.66% (corresponds to 1.916 mg Cd2+/g DW).","[Hynstova, Veronika; Klejdus, Borivoj; Hedbavny, Josef] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Hynstova, V (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",veronika.hynstova@mendelu.cz,"Hynstova, Veronika/P-2213-2018; Hedbavny, Josef/AAH-1368-2020; Klejdus, Borivoj/D-8490-2012","Hynstova, Veronika/0000-0002-4326-997X; Hedbavny, Josef/0000-0001-6769-3639; Klejdus, Borivoj/0000-0002-5557-5771",,,,,10,0,0,0,6,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,585,590,,,,,,6,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100110,0

By using the data on liquidity and credit of 1,606 Japanese manufacturing firms, this paper employs the empirical methodology developed by Rajan and Zingales (1998) to distinguish the natural disaster effect on Japanese globally operating firms from that on other Japanese firms that are domestic market oriented. We also widened our analysis creating two sub-samples according to the location of the firms and their branches that are closer to ground zero. It is found that multinational companies were affected significantly worse than domestic counterparts in all operational performances. Interestingly, another finding showed that firms which gave more trade credits to clients and kept additional inventories generated significantly better profit during supply shock despite meeting larger sales decline. Meanwhile, globally operating firms are relatively immune to natural disaster effect if the ratio of overseas sales to total sales is smaller. Moreover, internal shock blew the hardest impact the firms with more interest bearing loans. Especially, manufacturing firms closer to ground zero with headquarters or branches in Tohoku and selected Kanto area were affected severely through credit channels, while their significant coefficient through credit channel was more or less tripled than those in whole sample.","[Olimov, Ashrafbek] Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan",Yokohama National University,"Olimov, A (通讯作者)，Yokohama Natl Univ, Grad Sch Social Sci, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan.",olimov-ashrafbek-wt@ynu.ac.jp,,,,,,,27,0,0,2,14,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,120,141,,,,,,22,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900008,0

There are many macroeconomic, industry, and company-specific factors that can affect stock prices such as global stock price indices, aggregate economic activity, exchange rate, interest rate and among others. An abundance of research, however, makes forecast of stock prices by using their own lagged terms. This study aims to forecast the movement of the Vietnam index (VNIndex) by using such time series methods as exponential smoothing, Holt's exponential smoothing, Winter's exponential, decomposition, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. The data on VNIndex collected at the monthly interval cover the time period from July-2000 to October 2014 with 172 closing prices. The prediction accuracy is compared among the methods in terms of two criteria, namely root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) based on out-of-sample forecasts of 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months. Evidence reveals that the Holts exponential smoothing model with double weight is consistently ranked the first among the methods in prediction accuracy no matter what criteria are applied and what out-of-sample forecasts are based. This finding is of great significance to the investors in the Vietnamese stock market when they attempt to forecast the movement of the market.","[Wang, Yung-Chang] Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, Dept Finance & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan; [Thanh Nhan Nguyen] Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, Grad Inst Int Business Adm, Taipei, Taiwan",Chinese Culture University; Chinese Culture University,"Wang, YC (通讯作者)，Chinese Culture Univ, Coll Business, Dept Finance & Banking, Taipei, Taiwan.",michalenguyen@gmail.com,"Nguyen-Thanh, Nhan/GZB-2262-2022","Nguyen-Thanh, Nhan/0000-0003-2188-9147",,,,,20,1,1,0,3,TON DUC THANG UNIV,HO CHI MINH CITY,"98 NGO TAT TO STR, WARD 129, HO CHI MINH CITY, 00000, VIETNAM",,,978-80-87990-04-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,190,200,,,,,,11,"Business; Business, Finance; Economics; Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Social Sciences - Other Topics,BF6YZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000383851900012,0

The paper tries to give some insights from a technical standard perspective for how to realize trade facilitation and ecologically oriented development in the process of co-building the Silk Road Economic Belt. We differentiate basic standards and ecologically oriented standards and use panel data concerning China's standards stock and its trade performance to investigate the role of technical standards in facilitating trade toward an ecologically oriented direction. Results show that moderate while overall growth of standards, especially those internationally harmonized standards, promotes China's foreign trade development. In sectors which have reasonable standards amount and composition, the larger the stock of ecologically oriented while internationally harmonized standards, the larger the trade volume of China. In order to substantially facilitate trade in a more sustainable and ecologically-oriented direction, countries along the Silk Road should widely communicate and cooperate in international level, regional level as well as national level about standardization practices and enhance the international level for national standardization system.","[Yang Li-juan] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Econ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University,"Yang, LJ (通讯作者)，Lanzhou Univ, Sch Econ, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",,,,"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [13LZUJBWZY053, 14LZUJBWZY026]",Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"Supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (13LZUJBWZY053, 14LZUJBWZY026)",,31,0,0,1,7,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,944,957,,,,,,14,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600126,0

In the Netherlands, an estimated 50,000 couples visit their general practitioner and 30,000 couples seek medical specialist care for sub-fertility. We conducted an economic evaluation comparing recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, r-hFSH, Gonal-F (R)) with two classes of urinary gonadotrophins-highly purified human menopausal gonadotrophin (hp-HMG, Menopur (R)) and urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (uFSH, Fostimon (R))-for ovarian stimulation in women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment in the Netherlands. Methods A pharmacoeconomic model was developed, simulating each step in the IVF protocol from the start of therapy until either a live birth, a new IVF treatment cycle or cessation of IVF, following a long down-regulation protocol. A decision tree combined with a Markov model details progress through each health state, including ovum pickup, fresh embryo transfer, up to two subsequent cryo-preserved embryo transfers, and (ongoing) pregnancy or miscarriage. A health insurer perspective was chosen, and the time horizon was set at a maximum of three consecutive treatment cycles, in accordance with Dutch reimbursement policy. Transition probabilities and costing data were derived from a real-world observational outcomes database (from Germany) and official tariff lists (from the Netherlands). Adverse events were considered equal among the comparators and were therefore excluded from the economic analysis. A Monte Carlo simulation of 5000 iterations was undertaken for each strategy to explore uncertainty and to construct uncertainty intervals (UIs). All cost data were valued in 2013 Euros. The model's structure, parameters and assumptions were assessed and confirmed by an external clinician with experience in health economics modelling, to inform on the appropriateness of the outcomes and the applicability of the model in the chosen setting. Results The mean total treatment costs were estimated as (sic)5664 for follitropin alfa (95 % UI (sic)5167-6151), (sic)5990 for hp-HMG (95 % UI (sic)5498-6488) and (sic)5760 for uFSH (95 % UI (sic)5256-6246). The probability of a live birth was estimated at 36.1 % (95 % UI 27.4-44.3 %), 33.9 % (95 % UI 26.2-41.5 %) and 34.1 % (95 % UI 25.9-41.8 %) for follitropin alfa, hp-HMG and uFSH, respectively. The costs per live birth estimates were (sic)15,674 for follitropin alfa, (sic)17,636 for hp-HMG and (sic)16,878 for uFSH. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a probability of 72.5 % that follitropin alfa is cost effective at a willingness to pay of (sic)20,000 per live birth. The probabilistic results remained constant under several analyses. Conclusion The present analysis shows that follitropin alfa may represent a cost-effective option in comparison with uFSH and hp-HMG for IVF treatment in the Netherlands healthcare system.","[Fragoulakis, Vassilis; Maniadakis, Nikos] Natl Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth Serv Org & Management, 196 Alexandras Ave, Athens 11521, Greece; [Pescott, Chris P.] Merck KgaA, Dept Global Evidence & Value Dev, Frankfurter Str 250,F135-101, D-64293 Darmstadt, Germany; [Smeenk, Jesper M.

The Case of Vaccine Economics in Latin America,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Article,,,,,,cost-effectiveness; developing countries; Latin America; vaccination,EXPERIENCE; DECISIONS,"Background: In middle-income countries, vaccines against pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, and human papilloma virus are in general more costly, not necessarily cost saving, and less consistently costeffective than earlier generation vaccines against measles, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Budget impact is also substantial; public spending on vaccines in countries adopting new vaccines is, on average, double the amount of countries that have not adopted. Policymakers must weigh the costs and benefits of the adoption decision carefully, given the low coverage of other kinds of costeffective health and nonhealth interventions in these same settings and relatively flat overall public spending on health as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) over time. Objective: This paper considers lessons learned from recent vaccine cost-effectiveness analyses and subsequent adoption decisions in Latin America a, largely under the auspices of the Pro Vac Initiative. Results: The paper illustrates how small methodological choices and seemingly minor technical limitations of cost-effectiveness models can have major implications for the studies' conclusions, potentially influencing countries' subsequent vaccine adoption decisions. Methods: We evaluate the ProVac models and technical outputs against the standards and framework set out by the International Decision Support Initiative Reference Case for economic evaluation and consider the practical effects of deviations from those standards. Conclusions: Lessons learned are discussed, including issues of appropriate comparators, GDP-based thresholds, and use of average versus incremental cost-effectiveness ratios as a convention are assessed.

Methods: A longitudinal cohort of patients with diabetes was constructed from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database of 1999 to 2012. The survival functions for diabetic patients and age- and sex-matched general population were estimated by using a semiparametric extrapolation method with annual life tables. The average monthly health care expenditures were multiplied by the corresponding monthly survival rates and summed to calculate the lifetime health care expenditures. Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to corroborate the effects of sex and age, after being adjusted for comorbidities, complications, and calendar years. Results: A total of 2386 cases (45% early diagnosis, 49% males) were identified. An additional LE after diabetes diagnosis was 45.12 years, with an estimated 17.63 years of life lost. The predicted total and diabetes-related lifetime costs were $56,939 and $102,140, respectively. Early diagnosed patients had a longer LE and lower health care spending compared with those of late-diagnosed patients. Male patients had a shorter LE and a higher expected years of life lost than the female patients, which corresponded to lower lifetime costs for the former. The Cox model results for overall mortality corroborated these trends.

A dynamic panel correlated random effects model is used in conjunction with a rich data set that combines information from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), expert ratings of job demands from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), and mid career earnings records from the Social Security Administration's (SSA) Master Earnings File (MEF). Results reveal a strong relationship between positive aspects of the psychosocial work environment and improved self-reported health status, blood pressure, and cognitive function. However, there is little evidence to suggest that working conditions shape observed health disparities between occupations in the years leading up to retirement. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We characterize two effects of such a policy: the competition effect' that drives hospitals to compete for patients by increasing service rates and reducing waiting times and the signaling effect' that allows patients to distinguish a high-quality hospital from a low-quality one. While for a low-quality hospital both effects help reduce waiting time, for a high-quality hospital, they act in opposite directions. We show that the competition effect will outweigh the signaling effect for the high-quality hospital, and consequently, both hospitals' waiting times will be reduced by the introduction of the policy. This result holds in a policy environment where maximum waiting time targets are not binding.

We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for interim-implementable trading rules, analogous to the result in Myerson and Satterthwaite (1983), and a necessary condition for mechanisms that are free from ex post regret on and off equilibrium path. Based on these two theorems, our contribution is three-fold. First, we illustrate the results by means of three examples. Second, in contrast to the continuous model, there always exist strictly positive probability mass functions such that ex post efficiency and interim-implementability is feasible. Third, we show the difference between interim- and ex post-implementation. In the class of threshold trading rules, interim-implementation only precludes inefficient trade, while ex post-implementation is equivalent to posted price implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Testing the entire covariance under high dimensionality endures large variability and causes a dilution of the signal-to-noise ratio and hence a reduction in the power. We consider a more powerful test procedure that focuses on testing along the super-diagonals of the high dimensional covariance matrix, which can infer more accurately on the structure of the covariance. We show that the test is powerful in detecting sparse signals and parametric structures in the covariance. The properties of the test are demonstrated by theoretical analyses, simulation and empirical studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Prim's algorithm provides a way of finding the minimum cost tree m. This has led to several definitions in the literature, regarding how to distribute the cost. These rules propose different cost allocations, which can be understood as compensations and/or payments between players, with respect to the status quo point: each user pays for the connection she uses to be linked to the source. In this paper we analyze the rationale behind a distribution of the minimum cost by defining an a priori transfer structure. Our first result states the existence of a transfer structure such that no user is willing to choose a different tree from the minimum cost tree. Moreover, given a transfer structure, we implement the above solution as a subgame perfect equilibrium outcome of a game where players decide sequentially with whom to connect. Finally, we obtain that the existence of a transfer structure supporting an allocation characterizes the core of the monotone cooperative game associated with a minimum cost spanning tree problem. This transfer structure is called social transfer structure. Therefore, the minimum cost spanning tree emerges as both a social and individual solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Previously the large sample distribution of this statistic has been calculated when short sales are allowed and sample returns and covariance matrix are asymptotically normally distributed. This paper considers the more complex situation when short sales are not allowed, and provides conditions under which the maximum Sharpe ratio is asymptotically normal. This is not always the case, as we show, in particular when the returns have zero mean. For this situation we obtain upper and lower asymptotic bounds (in distribution) on the possible values of the maximum Sharpe ratio which coincide when the returns are asymptotically uncorrelated. We indicate how the asymptotic theory, developed for the case of no short sales, can be extended to handle a more general class of portfolio constraints defined in terms of convex polytopes. Via simulations we examine the rapidity of approach to the limit distributions under various assumptions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This study aimed to develop an unidimensional NP scale with scores that represent levels of NP and distinguish between individuals with NP and non-NP conditions. Methods: A candidate item pool of 42 pain quality descriptors was administered to participants with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic neuropathy, and cancer chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. A subset of pain quality descriptors (items) that best distinguished between participants with and those without NP conditions were identified. Dimensionality of pain descriptors was evaluated in a development sample and cross-validated in a holdout sample. Item responses were calibrated using an item response theory model, and scores were generated on a T-score metric. NP scale scores were evaluated in terms of the reliability, validity, and ability to distinguish between participants with and without conditions typically associated with NP. Results: Of the 42 initial items, 5 were identified for the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Neuropathic Pain Quality Scale. T scores exhibited good discriminatory ability on the basis of receiver-operator characteristic analysis. Score thresholds that optimize sensitivity and specificity were identified. Construct, criterion, and discriminant validity, and reliability of scale scores were supported. Conclusions: The five-item Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS PQ-Neuro) Neuropathic Pain Quality Scale is a short and practical measure that can be used to identify patients more likely to have NP and to distinguish levels of NP. The data collected will support future research that targets other unidimensional pain quality domains (e.g., nociceptive pain).","[Askew, Robert L.] Stetson Univ, Dept Psychol, 421 N Woodland Blvd, Deland, FL 32723 USA; [Cook, Karon F.; Nowinski, Cindy J.; Cella, David] Northwestern Univ, Feinberg Sch Med, Chicago, IL 60611 USA; [Keefe, Francis J.] Duke Univ, Durham, NC USA; [Revicki, Dennis A.] Evidera, Bethesda, MD USA; [DeWitt, Esi M.

Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the metrics obtained from a discrete choice experiment (DCE) and profile-case best-worst scaling (BWS) with respect to hip replacement. Methods: We surveyed the general US population of men aged 45 to 65 years, and potentially eligible for hip replacement surgery. The survey included sociodemographic questions, eight DCE questions, and twelve BWS questions. Attributes were the probability of a first and second revision, pain relief, ability to participate in sports and perform daily activities, and length of hospital stay. Conditional logit analysis was used to estimate attribute weights, level preferences, and the maximum acceptable risk (MAR) for undergoing revision surgery in six hypothetical treatment scenarios with different attribute levels. Results: A total of 429 (96%) respondents were included. Comparable attribute weights and level preferences were found for both BWS and DCE. Preferences were greatest for hip replacement surgery with high pain relief and the ability to participate in sports and perform daily activities. Although the estimated MARs for revision surgery followed the same trend, the MARs were systematically higher in five of the six scenarios using DCE. Conclusions: This study confirms previous findings that BWS or DCEs are comparable in estimating attribute weights and level preferences. However, the risk tolerance threshold based on the estimation of MAR differs between these methods, possibly leading to inconsistency in comparing treatment scenarios.","[van Dijk, Joris D.; Groothuis-Oudshoorn, Catharina G.

For various reasons, there may be more or fewer objects than initially planned and allocated. How should such unexpected changes be handled? One way is to declare the initial decision irrelevant and reallocate all available objects. Alternatively, one can use the initial decision as starting point in allocating the new objects. Since both perspectives seem equally reasonable, a natural robustness principle on the rule is that it should produce the same outcome no matter which one is taken. We define two robustness properties based on this idea, pertaining to more objects and fewer objects, respectively. We characterize the family of rules that satisfy mild efficiency, fairness and incentives requirements, together with either one of our robustness properties. They are the family of serial dictatorship rules. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Using Florida data on all such patients from 1992 to 2014, we decompose practice style into two components: The provider's probability of conducting invasive procedures on the average patient (which we characterize as aggressiveness), and the responsiveness of the choice of procedure to the patient's characteristics. We show that within hospitals and years, patients with more aggressive providers have consistently higher costs and better outcomes. Since all patients benefit from higher utilization of invasive procedures, targeting procedure use to the most appropriate patients benefits these patients at the expense of the less appropriate patients. We also find that the most aggressive and responsive physicians are young, male, and trained in top 20 schools. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First, we extend the characterization of equilibrium payoff correspondences in history-dependent dynamic policy games to a class with endogenously heterogeneous private agents. In contrast to policy games involving representative agents, this extension has interesting consequences as it implies additional nonlinearity (i.e., bilinearity) between the game states (distributions) and continuation/promised values in the policymaker's objective and incentive constraints. The second contribution of our paper is in addressing the computational challenges arising from this payoff relevant nonlinearity. Exploiting the game's structure, we propose implementable approximate bilinear programming formulations to construct estimates of the equilibrium value correspondence. Our approximation method respects the property of upper hemicontinuity in the target correspondence. We provide small-scale computational examples as proofs of concept. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

A model called continuous quasi-hyperbolic discounting is considered, extending the popular quasi-hyperbolic discounting to an integral form. Dynamic preference axioms, time consistency and time invariance, are formulated and used to provide a foundation for an integral form of exponential discounting; the central model of dynamic, intertemporal choice in economics. A relaxation of the time consistency axiom, complementary time consistency, is formulated to provide a dynamic preference foundation for continuous quasi-hyperbolic discounting. A preference condition for present bias is also characterised in the context of the model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the absence of transplant, approximately 50 % of dialysis patients die within 5 years. Although more frequent and/or longer haemodialysis (high-dose HD) improves survival, this regimen may add to the burden on dialysis services and healthcare costs. This systematic review summarised the cost effectiveness of high-dose HD compared with conventional HD. Methods English language publications reporting the cost-utility/effectiveness of high-dose HD in adults with ESRD were identified via a search of MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Publications comparing any form of high-dose HD with conventional HD were reviewed. Results Seven publications (published between 2003 and 2014) reporting cost-utility analyses from the public healthcare payer perspective were identified. High-dose HD in-centre was compared with in-centre conventional HD in one US model; all other analyses (UK, Canada) compared high-dose HD at home with in-centre conventional HD (n = 5) or in-centre/home conventional HD (n = 1). The time horizon varied from one year to lifetime. Similar survival for high-dose HD and conventional HD was assumed, with the impact of higher survival only assessed in the sensitivity analyses of three models. High-dose HD at home was found to be cost effective compared with conventional HD in all six analyses. The analysis comparing high-dose HD in-centre with conventional in-centre HD produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio generally acceptable for the USA, but not for Europe, Canada or Australia. Conclusion High-dose HD can be cost effective when performed at home. Future analyses assuming survival benefits for high-dose HD compared with conventional HD are needed.","[Laplante, S.; Liu, F.

It is based upon an approach that constrains decision rules to be temporally consistent: these are stationary and unequivocally ruled by the state variable. For agents who differ only in their discount factors and have equal weights in the planner's objective, the temporally consistent optimal solution produces identical consumption for the agents at all time periods. In the long run, the capital stock is determined by a modified golden rule that corresponds to an average-like summation of all discount factors. The general argument is illustrated by various two-agent examples that allow for an explicit determination of the temporally consistent decision rules.

We explain how long memory can naturally arise within the term structure of interest rates, providing a theoretical underpinning for our model.

Objective: To describe the role of economic evidence in drug pricing decisions in Jordan. Methods: A prospective review of all applications submitted between November 2013 and May 2015 to the Jordan Food and Drug Association's drug pricing committee was carried out. All applications that involved requests for CE evidence were reviewed. Details on the type of study, the extent, and whether the evidence submitted was part of the formal deliberations were extracted and summarized. Results: The committee reviewed a total of 1608 drug pricing applications over the period of the study. CE evidence was requested in only 11 applications. The submitted evidence was of limited use to the committee due to concerns about quality, relevance of studies, and lack of pharmacoeconomic expertise. There were also no clear rules describing how CE would inform pricing decisions. Conclusions: Limited local data and health economic experience were the main barriers to the use of economic evidence in drug pricing decisions in Jordan. In addition, there are no official rules describing the elements and process by which the CE evidence would inform drug pricing decisions. This study summarized accumulated observations for the current use of economic evaluations and evidence-based decision making in Jordan. Recommendations have been proposed to applicants and key decision makers to enhance the role of economic evidence in influencing health policies and evidence-based decision making across priority settings.","[Hammad, Eman A.] Univ Jordan, Sch Pharm, Dept Biopharmaceut & Clin Pharm, Queen Rania St, Amman 11942, Jordan",University of Jordan,"Hammad, EA (通讯作者)，Univ Jordan, Sch Pharm, Dept Biopharmaceut & Clin Pharm, Queen Rania St, Amman 11942, Jordan.",e.hammad@ju.edu.jo,,"Hammad, Eman A/0000-0003-2059-6473",,,,,20,13,13,0,3,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,233,238,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.007,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021758.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800015,0

Methods: Between August and November 2013, US -residing members of the PatientsLikeMe online CLL patient community completed open-ended web-based surveys designed to elicit descriptions of CLL symptoms, impacts, and treatment-related perceptions. Qualitative telephone follow-up interviews were conducted with a subsample of respondents. Survey responses and interview transcripts were coded for qualitative analysis using Atlas.ti. Results: Fifty survey responses were included in the analyses. Participants were age 60.5 +/- 6.9 years, 54% female, and 96% white. When surveyed, 20% were receiving current treatment, 16% were in remission, and 64% were treatment na ve. Among respondents, 369 descriptions of CLL symptoms were coded. Fatigue-related symptoms were expressed most frequently, with 54% reporting fatigue, tiredness, or both in their responses. These concepts were followed by night sweats (38%), swollen lymph nodes (32%), and frequent infections (28%). Among impacts of CLL, worry and fear (66% of respondents), depressed feelings (52%), and work limitations (50%) were noted most frequently. Conclusions: Survey results identified constitutional symptoms of CLL included in existing PRO instruments and the literature. Although the findings suggest that qualitative data obtained through social media applications can be potentially useful in supporting concept identification for newly developed PRO instruments, they also indicate that online approaches alone may not be sufficient to achieve efficient and exhaustive concept elicitation. Further research is needed to identify whether the results can support content validity in the same way as established qualitative research methods.

Data were linked from birth, hospital discharge and mortality registries. For each infant basic clinical and demographic information, infant mortality and LoS at 1year were retrieved. In addition, socio-economic variables at the regional level were used. Results based on 16087 infants confirm that gestational age and Apgar score at 5min are important determinants of both mortality and LoS. In most countries, infants admitted or transferred to third-level hospitals showed lower probability of death and longer LoS. In the meta-analyses, the combined estimates show that being male, multiple births, presence of malformations, per capita income and low population density are significant risk factors for death. It is essential that national policies improve the quality of administrative datasets and address systemic problems in assigning identification numbers at birth. European policy should aim at improving the comparability of data across jurisdictions.

The study links microdata from the Finnish and Norwegian national patient registers describing treatment episodes with data from prescription registers, causes-of-death registers and registers covering education and income. We show that socio-economic variables affect access to percutaneous coronary intervention in both countries, but that these effects are only moderate and that the indirect effects of the socio-economic factors on mortality through access to percutaneous coronary intervention are minor. The direct effects of income and education on mortality are significantly larger. We conclude that the socio-economic gradient in the use of percutaneous coronary intervention adds to socio-economic differences in mortality to little or no extent.

Our results indicate that public venue smoking bans in Switzerland reduce smoking rates, but the findings do not emerge until 1year following the ban. This pattern of results is consistent with delays in ban enforcement on the part of business owners, difficulties in changing addictive behaviors such as smoking, and/or learning on the part of smokers. We find evidence that smoking bans influence going-out behavior and there is substantial heterogeneity across venue and consumer characteristics.

We focus on the nonparametric identification and estimation of panel data models under unobserved heterogeneity which is captured by random coefficients and when these random coefficients are correlated with regressors. Our identification conditions and estimation are based on the framework of the model with a special regressor, which is a novel approach proposed by Lewbel (1998, 2000) to solve the heterogeneity and endogeneity problem in the binary response models. With the help of the additional information on the special regressor, we can transform a binary response CRC model to a linear moment relation. We also construct a semiparametric estimator for the average slopes and derive the root n-normality result. Further, we propose a nonparametric method to test the correlations between random coefficients and regressors. Simulations are given to show the finite sample performance of our estimators and test statistics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Our difference-in-difference estimates exploit heterogeneity in the implementation of the financial incentive programme across districts. We find that cash incentives to women were associated with increased uptake of maternity services but there is no strong evidence that the JSY was associated with a reduction in neonatal or early neonatal mortality. The positive effects on utilisation are larger for less educated and poorer women, and in places where the cash payment was most generous. We also find evidence of unintended consequences. The financial incentive programme was associated with a substitution away from private health providers, an increase in breastfeeding and more pregnancies. These findings demonstrate the potential for financial incentives to have unanticipated effects that may, in the case of fertility, undermine the programme's own objective of reducing mortality.

Objective We sought to estimate and compare two directly elicited valuations for SF-6D health states between the Japan and UK general adult populations using Bayesian methods. Methods We analysed data from two SF-6D valuation studies where, using similar standard gamble protocols, values for 241 and 249 states were elicited from representative samples of the Japan and UK general adult populations, respectively. We estimate a function applicable across both countries that explicitly accounts for the differences between them, and is estimated using data from both countries. Results The results suggest that differences in SF-6D health-state valuations between the Japan and UK general populations are potentially important. The magnitude of these country-specific differences in health-state valuation depended, however, in a complex way on the levels of individual dimensions. Conclusion The new Bayesian non-parametric method is a powerful approach for analysing data from multiple nationalities or ethnic groups, to understand the differences between them and potentially to estimate the underlying utility functions more efficiently.","Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England",University of York - UK,"Kharroubi, SA (通讯作者)，Univ York, Dept Math, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",samer.kharroubi@york.ac.uk,"Kharroubi, Samer/AAQ-4583-2020",,,,,,31,13,13,0,9,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

This article employs the accessibility and acceptability framework to review the barriers to using evidence from economic evaluation in healthcare policy and the strategies used to overcome these barriers. Economic evaluations are often inaccessible to policymakers due to the absence of relevant economic evaluations, the time and cost required to conduct and interpret economic evaluations, and lack of expertise to evaluate quality and interpret results. Consistently reported factors that limit the translation of findings from economic evaluations into healthcare policy include poor quality of research informing economic evaluations, assumptions used in economic modelling, conflicts of interest, difficulties in transferring resources between sectors, negative attitudes to healthcare rationing, and the absence of equity considerations. Strategies to overcome these barriers have been suggested in the literature, including training, structured abstract databases, rapid evaluation, reporting checklists for journals, and considering factors other than cost effectiveness in economic evaluations, such as equity or budget impact. The factors that prevent or encourage decision makers to use evidence from economic evaluations have been identified, but the relative importance of these factors to decision makers is uncertain.","[Merlo, Gregory; Page, Katie; Halton, Kate; Graves, Nicholas] Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, CRE RHAI, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia; [Ratcliffe, Julie] Flinders Univ S Australia, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia",Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Flinders University South Australia,"Merlo, G (通讯作者)，Queensland Univ Technol, Inst Hlth & Biomed Innovat, CRE RHAI, Brisbane, Qld 4001, Australia.",gb.merlo@qut.edu.au,"Page, Katie/H-4283-2019; Graves, Nicholas/A-3052-2011; Merlo, Gregory/AAR-1810-2020; Halton, Kate A/I-9964-2012; Ratcliffe, Julie/G-3169-2017","Page, Katie/0000-0001-9183-9175; Merlo, Gregory/0000-0001-9931-7830; Halton, Kate/0000-0001-9785-1458; Graves, Nicholas/0000-0002-5559-3267; Ratcliffe, Julie/0000-0001-7365-1988",,,,,58,43,44,0,5,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Lottery winnings allow us to make causal statements regarding the effect of income on health, as the amount won by winners is largely exogenous. Positive income shocks have no significant effect on self-assessed overall health, but a significant positive effect on mental health. This result seems paradoxical on two levels. First, there is a well-known gradient in health status in cross-sectional data, and second, general health should partly reflect mental health, so that we may expect both variables to move in the same direction. We propose a solution to the first apparent paradox by underlining the endogeneity of income. For the second, we show that lottery winnings are also associated with more smoking and social drinking. General health will reflect both mental health and the effect of these behaviours and so may not improve following a positive income shock.

Strict targets, which have specified maximum waiting times, have been introduced in the NHS over the last decade and have been criticised for distorting existing clinical priorities in scheduling hospital treatment. We demonstrate the usefulness of conditional density estimation (CDE) in the evaluation of the reform using data for Scotland for 2002 and 2007. We develop a modified goodness of fit test to discriminate between models with different numbers of bins. We document a change in prioritisation between different patient groups with longer waiting patients benefiting at the expense of those who previously waited less. Our results contribute to understanding the response of publicly funded health systems to enforced targets for maximum waiting times. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, many of these psychiatrists have prescription patterns that are statistically significantly different than random draws from national market shares for prescriptions by psychiatrists. For example, many have prescription patterns that are significantly more concentrated than such draws. Second, among psychiatrists who are the most concentrated, different prescribers often concentrate on distinct drugs. Motivated by these two findings, we then construct a model of physician learning-by-doing that fits these facts and generates two further predictions: both concentration (on one or a few drugs) and deviation (from the prescription patterns of others) should be smaller for high-volume physicians. We find empirical support for these predictions. Furthermore, our model outperforms an alternative theory concerning detailing by pharmaceutical representatives. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Using data from the universe of Medicaid recipients in three states, I evaluate how Medicaid managed care policies impact primary care diagnosis and treatment of children's mental health disorders. Specific policies examined include the presence of a behavioral carve-out, traditional health maintenance organization, or primary care case management program. To alleviate concerns of endogenous patient sorting, my preferred identification strategy uses variation in Medicaid policy penetration to instrument for individual plan choices. I show that while health maintenance organizations reduce diagnosis and non-drug treatment of mental health disorders, primary care case management program policies shift in diagnosis and treatment from within primary care to specialist providers such as psychiatrists, where serious mental health conditions are more likely to be identified.

Their basic property is the ability to absorb large amount of water in the rainy periods, retain the water and release it to vegetation in the periods of drought. The typical problem of Mediterranean vegetation is wilting in the dry spells. If polymer is applied to soil before the start of the rainy period, sufficient water supply for the dry season can be secured. It has been proved that polymers also have a favorable effect on a number of physical properties of soil, such as aggregate stability or infiltration. Soil is a complex system, consisting of animate and inanimate constituents, whose mutual relations and balance determine the soil fertility. The positive effect of polymer on the physical properties therefore need not entail the increase of fertility. This contribution aims to assess the impact of TerraCottem polymer on the availability of nitrogen in the soil. The results of the work suggest that the application of polymer not only improves the soil physical properties, but also influences the soil life. The experiment included work with model soils containing different amounts of polymer plus another additive.

Firstly, a policy-inspired model was systematically and dynamically simulated using empirical data of mainland China from 1990 to 2013. Simulation results are in consistence with the actual data. Then, we strengthen the policy incentives and analyze the policy-inspired efficacy. The results showed that the combination of revenue incentive policy and risk guarantee policy could effectively stimulate R&D impetus of enterprises, which would gradually achieve the transition from the state of lower innovation state to that of higher in novation state after going through multistage policy stimulation.

Moreover, we find that managers manage reported earnings or revise initial forecasts to meet their own forecasts. Specifically, when firm's actual earnings fall below the lower bound of range forecasts, managers tend to' manage earnings upward or revise forecasts downward; when firm's actual earnings fall above the upper bound of range forecasts, managers tend to manage earnings downward or revise forecasts upward.

These peptides are aimed directly on the phospholipid bilayer and do not target on the cellular or metabolic activities of the cells as antibiotics and other drugs do. But thanks to many vital proteins associated with the membrane, these peptides can also influence these structures and therefore facilitate and accelerate their death. Melittin is a well-characterized pore-forming lytic amphiphilic peptide (consisting of 26 amino acids) found in bee venom. The amphiphilic property of this peptide makes it water-soluble and yet it spontaneously associates with natural and artificial membranes. This integration leads to the distortion and permeabilization of the membrane. In this study melittin has been utilized to study antiviral properties against influenza A virus. Melittin was used in the mixture with the influenza A virus and together were inoculated into chicken embryo. Living conditions were monitored during infection. After death of chicken, biochemistry of allantoic fluid was performed.","[Michalek, Petr; Zitka, Ondrej; Krejcova, Ludmila; Kominkova, Marketa; Guran, Roman; Milosavljevic, Vedran; Kopel, Pavel; Heger, Zbynek; Adam, Vojtech; Kizek, Rene] Mendel Univ Brno, Lab Metall & Nanotechnol, Dept Chem & Biochem, Brno 61300, Czech Republic; [Michalek, Petr; Zitka, Ondrej; Krejcova, Ludmila; Kominkova, Marketa; Guran, Roman; Milosavljevic, Vedran; Kopel, Pavel; Heger, Zbynek; Adam, Vojtech; Kizek, Rene] Brno Univ Technol, Cent European Inst Technol, Brno 61600, Czech Republic; [Pridal, Antonin] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Zool Fisheries Hydrobiol & Apiculture, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno; Brno University of Technology; Masaryk University Brno; Mendel University in Brno,"Michalek, P (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Lab Metall & Nanotechnol, Dept Chem & Biochem, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",petrmichalek85@gmail.com,"Kopel, Pavel/E-5711-2012; Adam, Vojtech/D-7686-2012; Zitka, Ondrej/E-1107-2012; Krejcova, Ludmila/E-8440-2012; Kominkova, Marketa/D-2297-2013; Kizek, Rene/D-7748-2012; Zitka, Ondrej/L-5588-2019; Heger, Zbyněk/D-1973-2013; Guran, Roman/C-2610-2016; Milosavljević, Vedran/L-9078-2019; Pridal, Antonin/S-5171-2017","Kopel, Pavel/0000-0003-4216-9544; Adam, Vojtech/0000-0002-8527-286X; Krejcova, Ludmila/0000-0002-5199-2949; Zitka, Ondrej/0000-0001-7607-5058; Heger, Zbyněk/0000-0002-3915-7270; Guran, Roman/0000-0002-2912-714X; Milosavljević, Vedran/0000-0003-4122-0694; Michalek, Petr/0000-0002-0121-0128; Pridal, Antonin/0000-0002-5798-6785",,,,,18,1,1,0,11,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1665-1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,475,479,,,,,,5,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100090,0

Methods: Thirteen NCDs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, angina, arthritis, osteoporosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, cataract, and depression) were selected from the Korean Community Health Survey 2010. The Euro-Qol five-dimensional questionnaire index from the Korean Community Health Survey 2010 and the Korean valuation set were used to estimate utility weights according to sex, age, and disease. Morbidity data were also obtained from the Korean Community Health Survey 2010. Mortality data according to disease and life expectancy were retrieved from the Korean Statistical Information Service. To predict future QALY loss, future population projection data from the Korean Statistical Information Service were used as substitutes for 2010 population size. Results: Among the assessed 13 NCDs, the largest total QALY loss was for hypertension (513,113 QALYs; units are omitted hereafter), followed by arthritis (509,317) and stroke (431,049). The largest QALY loss due to mortality was stroke (306,733), whereas the largest QALY loss due to morbidity was arthritis (502,513). By applying the middle estimate of future population, the largest increase in total QALY loss between 2010 and 2040 was for hypertension (840,582), followed by stroke (719,076) and diabetes mellitus (474,607). Conclusions: Hypertension, arthritis, and stroke are important in terms of total QALY loss, which will continuous to increase because of aging. These results could be used to develop cost-effective interventions that reduce the burden of NCDs.

This paper will study the different effect of different reward mechanism on controlling free riding behavior by using the experimental method. The most effective reward mechanism is found to provide the experimental basis for settling the free riding behavior essentially. This paper introduces three types of supervision, self-supervision, third-party supervision and mutual supervision between groups. In the free riding experiments, there are spiritual reward and material reward. Framing effect and reward scope is also introduced in this paper. There are 8 reward mechanism formed by these factors. The experiments collect data by using Z-Tree software and questionnaire. STATA12.0 is used to analyze the experiment data. Comparative analysis and empirical analysis are combined to analyze, summarize and discuss the result of the experiments. The conclusion is: the third-party supervision material reward mechanism (only reward to the highest contributor) changed the optimal strategy of the subjects. This reward mechanism is the most effective and stable mechanism to mitigate free riding behavior.

We consider two measures of avoidable emergency visits recorded at list level for each General Practitioner. We test whether extending practices' opening hours to up to 12 hours/day reduces the inappropriate utilization of emergency services. Since subscribing to the extension program is voluntary, we account for the potential endogeneity of participation in a count model for emergency admissions in two ways: first, we use a two-stage residual inclusion approach. Then we exploit panel methods on data covering a three-year period, thus accounting directly for individual heterogeneity. Our results show that increasing primary care accessibility acts as a restraint on the inappropriate use of emergency departments.

Previous studies suggest that telemonitoring could be effective in preventing hospitalisations and hence reduce costs. Objective The aim was to evaluate whether telemonitoring interventions for COPD are cost-effective from the perspective of German statutory sickness funds. Methods A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a combination of a Markov model and a decision tree. Telemonitoring as add-on to standard treatment was compared with standard treatment alone. The model consisted of four transition stages to account for COPD severity, and a terminal stage for death. Within each cycle, the frequency of exacerbations as well as outcomes for 2015 costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for each stage were calculated. Values for input parameters were taken from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results In the base case, telemonitoring led to an increase in incremental costs ((sic)866 per patient) but also in incremental QALYs (0.05 per patient). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was thus (sic)17,410 per QALY gained. A deterministic sensitivity analysis showed that hospitalisation rate and costs for telemonitoring equipment greatly affected results. The probabilistic ICER averaged (sic)34,432 per QALY (95 % confidence interval 12,161-56,703). Conclusion We provide evidence that telemonitoring may be cost-effective in Germany from a payer's point of view. This holds even after deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.","[Hofer, Florian; Achelrod, Dmitrij; Stargardt, Tom] Univ Hamburg, HCHE, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany",University of Hamburg,"Hofer, F (通讯作者)，Univ Hamburg, HCHE, Esplanade 36, D-20354 Hamburg, Germany.",florian.hofer@uni-hamburg.de,,"Hofer, Florian/0000-0003-2532-0919",,,,,49,7,7,0,11,SPRINGER INT PUBL AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

Objective: To empirically analyze all arbitrations since the reform of Germany's Act to Reorganize the Pharmaceuticals' Market in the Statutory Health Insurance System came into effect. Methods: All available relevant documents up to January 2016 were screened and the identified contentious issues between the negotiation parties extracted. Reimbursement requests of both the negotiating parties and the arbitrations were transformed into a comparable format on the basis of defined daily doses and then contrasted among each other. Results: In the given period, 16 arbitrations took place. The arbitration board is implementing the same criteria used in the negotiations between manufacturers and payers. Almost all arbitrations dealt with generic appropriate comparative therapies. Reimbursement amounts set by arbitration were on average 38.4% less than the mean of negotiation parties' requests (69.2% less than the manufacturers' requests). The corresponding prescription volumes were arranged rather centrally. All but one arbitration refer to a 1-year contract period. The arbitration board rarely decided on further technical contentious points. Hence, no heuristics referring to them were derivable. Conclusions: There is some evidence for a quasi algorithmic approach of the arbitration board, even though it is legally determined that it has to decide while taking the peculiar conditions of each case into due consideration, including the characteristics of the respective therapeutic area. The balance of interests proved to be within a very narrow space albeit it concerns in principle discretionary decisions. Thus, the purpose of arbitration seems not to be achieved sufficiently.","[Ludwig, Saskia] Univ Cologne, Cologne Inst Hlth Econ & Clin Epidemiol, Cologne, Germany; [Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos] Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Fac Med, Inst Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Econ, Gebaude 14-82,Moorenstr 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany",University of Cologne; Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf,"Dintsios, CM (通讯作者)，Heinrich Heine Univ Dusseldorf, Fac Med, Inst Hlth Serv Res & Hlth Econ, Gebaude 14-82,Moorenstr 5, D-40225 Dusseldorf, Germany.",dintsios@hhu.de,,"Dintsios, Charalabos-Markos/0000-0003-3469-092X",,,,,33,16,17,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,DEC,2016,19.0,8.0,,,,,1016,1025,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.05.016,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,EO1HD,27987628.0,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000396448300015,0

Objectives: To estimate EQ-5D scores for diabetes-related chronic conditions that are consistent with the previous catalogue. Methods: The MEPS is a nationally representative survey of the US civilian population. EQ-5D-3L questionnaire responses were mapped from short-form 12 health survey responses in 2000 to 2011 MEPS data using multinomial logistic regression. Country-specific tariffs were applied to the mapped EQ-5D responses for the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Spain. EQ-5D scores were regressed on diabetes-related comorbidities controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, body mass index, and comorbidity using robust (median) regression. Methods were consistent with the previously published catalogue of EQ-5D scores for the United States. Results: There were 20,705 individuals with diabetes and a valid mapped EQ-5D score in the 2000 to 2011 MEPS data. Unadjusted mapped EQ-5D scores for individuals with diabetes varied by country-specific tariff from 0.70 (France) to 0.79 (United States). Regression results reflecting marginal disutility estimates for EQ-5D scores are provided for 17 diabetes-related comorbidities and body mass index categories for US, UK, French, and Spanish tariffs. Conclusions: The estimates provided in this research may be useful for analysts attempting to model the impact of diabetes and diabetes-related comorbid conditions on utility. They are derived from a single-source, nationally representative population and augment the existing off-the-shelf catalogue of EQ-5D scores for chronic conditions.","[Sullivan, Patrick W.] Regis Univ, Sch Pharm, 3333 Regis Blvd,H-28, Denver, CO 80221 USA; [Ghushchyan, Vahram H.] Univ Colorado, Ctr Pharmaceut Outcomes Res, Dept Clin Pharm, Aurora, CO USA; [Ghushchyan, Vahram H.] Amer Univ Armenia, Yerevan, Armenia",Regis University; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus; American University of Armenia,"Sullivan, PW (通讯作者)，Regis Univ, Sch Pharm, 3333 Regis Blvd,H-28, Denver, CO 80221 USA.",psulliva@regis.edu,,,Boehringer Ingelheim,Boehringer Ingelheim(Boehringer Ingelheim),"This study was supported by a research grant from Boehringer Ingelheim.

However, concerns about the credibility of these studies exist, particularly in studies from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This analysis was performed to explore economic evaluations conducted in LMICs in terms of methodological variations, quality of reporting and evidence used for the analyses. These results were compared with those studies conducted in high-income countries (HICs). Methods Rotavirus vaccine was selected as a case study, as it is one of the interventions that many studies in both settings have explored. The search to identify individual studies on rotavirus vaccines was performed in March 2014 using MEDLINE and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database. Only full economic evaluations, comparing cost and outcomes of at least two alternatives, were included for review. Selected criteria were applied to assess methodological variation, quality of reporting and quality of evidence used. Results Eighty-five studies were included, consisting of 45 studies in HICs and 40 studies in LMICs. Seventy-five percent of the studies in LMICs were published by researchers from HICs. Compared with studies in HICs, the LMIC studies showed less methodological variety. In terms of the quality of reporting, LMICs had a high adherence to technical criteria, but HICs ultimately proved to be better. The same trend applied for the quality of evidence used. Conclusion Although the quality of economic evaluations in LMICs was not as high as those from HICs, it is of an acceptable level given several limitations that exist in these settings. However, the results of this study may not reflect the fact that LMICs have developed a better research capacity in the domain of health economics, given that most of the studies were in theory led by researchers from HICs. Putting more effort into fostering the development of both research infrastructure and capacity building as well as encouraging local engagement in LMICs is thus necessary.","[Thiboonboon, Kittiphong; Santatiwongchai, Benjarin; Chantarastapornchit, Varit; Rattanavipapong, Waranya; Teerawattananon, Yot] Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, 6th Floor,6th Bldg,Tiwanon Rd, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand",Ministry of Public Health - Thailand,"Thiboonboon, K (通讯作者)，Minist Publ Hlth, Dept Hlth, Hlth Intervent & Technol Assessment Program, 6th Floor,6th Bldg,Tiwanon Rd, Muang 11000, Nonthaburi, Thailand.",kittiphong10@gmail.com,,"Thiboonboon, Kittiphong/0000-0003-3922-4362; Teerawattananon, Yot/0000-0003-2217-2930","Thailand Research Fund under the Senior Research Scholar on Health Technology Assessment [RTA5580010]; National Health Security Office; Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Health Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health; Thaihealth-Global Link Initiative Project","Thailand Research Fund under the Senior Research Scholar on Health Technology Assessment; National Health Security Office; Thai Health Promotion Foundation; Health System Research Institute; Bureau of Health Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health; Thaihealth-Global Link Initiative Project","The Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) is funded by the Thailand Research Fund under the Senior Research Scholar on Health Technology Assessment (RTA5580010), the National Health Security Office, the Thai Health Promotion Foundation, the Health System Research Institute, and the Bureau of Health Policy and Strategy, Ministry of Public Health.

We report the most prolific authors, institutions and countries and we find that the share of collaborative articles has increased over time and that most contributions come from affiliations that are based in the USA (but decreasingly so). We also apply social network analysis and discover the most central authors, institutions and countries in the Journal of Econometrics.

However, the available evidence shows that they are interdependent, which implies that policies against smoking or obesity may have larger scope than expected. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic rational model where eating, smoking, and physical exercise are simultaneous choices that jointly affect body weight and addiction to smoking. Focusing on direct and cross-price effects, we study the impact of tobacco and food taxes, and we show that in both cases a single policy tool can reduce both smoking and body weight.

EVIDENCE USING INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ORDERED PROBIT MODELS,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,overweight; obesity; self-rated health; ordered probit; instrumental variables,REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE; SUBJECTIVE HEALTH; MORTALITY; BMI; ASSOCIATION,"This paper, for the first time, presents estimates of the causal impact of overweight and obesity on self-rated health (SRH) using instrumental variables (IV) econometric methods. While a number of previous studies have sought to better understand the determinants of SRH, there is no consensus in relation to the impact of overweight and obesity. Using data from a large nationally representative sample of Irish parents and their children, we estimate a range of ordered probit models to isolate the causal effect of overweight and obesity on SRH. Our data includes independently and objectively recorded weight and height measures for parents and their children and we instrument for parental body mass index (BMI) status using the BMI of a biological child. After controlling for a range of individual, socioeconomic, health and lifestyle related variables, we find that being overweight has a negligible impact on SRI-I, while being obese has a practically and statistically significant negative impact on SRH. with these effects most pronounced for those who are most obese. We find only minor differences in these effects across gender.

Methods: A discrete choice experiment was administered to 290 patients with cancer in Singapore to elicit preferences for LETs and only palliative care (PC). Responses were fitted to a latent class conditional logistic regression model. We also quantified patients' willingness to pay to avoid and willingness to accept a less effective LET or PC-only. We then simulated the effects of various LET subsidy and cash payout policies on treatment choices. Results: We identified three classes of patients according to their preferences. The first class (26.1% of the sample) had a strong preference for PC and were willing to give up life expectancy gains and even pay for receiving only PC. The second class (29.8% of the sample) had a strong preference for LETs and preferred to extend life regardless of cost or quality of life. The final class (44.1% of the sample) preferred LETs to PC, but actively traded off costs and length and quality of life when making end-of-life treatment choices. Policy simulations showed that LET subsidies increase demand for LETs at the expense of demand for PC, but an equivalent cash payout was not shown to distort demand. Conclusions: Patients with cancer have heterogeneous end-of-life preferences. LET subsidies and cash payouts have differing effects on the use of LETs. Policymakers should be mindful of these differences when designing health care financing schemes for patients with life-limiting illnesses.","[Finkelstein, Eric; Malhotra, Chetna; Chay, Junxing; Ozdemir, Semra] Duke NUS Med Sch, Hlth Serv & Syst Res Program, Singapore, Singapore; [Finkelstein, Eric] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Chopra, Akhil] Johns Hopkins Singapore Int Med Ctr, Singapore, Singapore; [Kanesvaran, Ravindran] Natl Canc Ctr Singapore, Div Med Oncol, Singapore, Singapore",National University of Singapore; Duke University; Johns Hopkins University; Johns Hopkins Medicine; National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS),"Finkelstein, E (通讯作者)，Duke NUS Grad Med Sch, 8 Coll Rd, Singapore 169857, Singapore.",eric.finkelstein@duke-nus.edu.sg,"Ozdemir, Semra/GXW-0913-2022; Chay, Junxing/JBR-9656-2023; Ozdemir, Semra/HLQ-7417-2023","Ozdemir, Semra/0000-0001-7556-1601; Chay, Junxing/0000-0002-3291-4523; Chopra, Akhil/0000-0002-8299-0516; Kanesvaran, Ravindran/0000-0002-2351-881X; Malhotra, Chetna/0000-0002-5380-0525; Finkelstein, Eric/0000-0001-6443-9686",Singapore Millennium Foundation [2012-SMF-0001],Singapore Millennium Foundation,"Financial support for this study was provided entirely by a grant (2012-SMF-0001) from Singapore Millennium Foundation.

Objectives: To explore the impact of future price reductions caused by increasing uptake on HTAs and decision making for medical devices. Methods: We demonstrate the use of a two-stage modeling approach to derive estimates of technology price as a consequence of changes in technology uptake over future periods on the basis of existing theory and supported by empirical studies. We explore the impact on cost-effectiveness and expected value of information analysis in an illustrative example on the basis of a technology in development for preterm birth screening. Results: The application of our approach to the case study technology generates smaller incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with the commonly used single cohort approach. The extent of this reduction in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio depends on the magnitude of the modeled price reduction, the speed of diffusion, and the length of the assumed technology life horizon. Results of value of information analysis are affected through changes in the expected net benefit calculation, the addition of uncertain parameters, and the diffusion-adjusted estimate of the affected patient population. Conclusions: Because modeling future changes in price and uptake has the potential to affect HTA outcomes, modeling techniques that can address such changes should be considered for medical devices that may otherwise be rejected.","[Grimm, Sabine E.; Dixon, Simon; Stevens, John W.] Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England",University of Sheffield,"Grimm, SE (通讯作者)，Univ Sheffield, Sch Hlth & Related Res ScHARR, Hlth Econ & Decis Sci, 30 Regent St, Sheffield S1 4DA, S Yorkshire, England.",s.grimm@sheffield.ac.uk,"Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/HSE-7402-2023","Grimm, Sabine Elisabeth/0000-0002-2175-7999; Dixon, Simon/0000-0001-7394-7009","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency; Department of Health Policy Research Programme","Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency; Department of Health Policy Research Programme","This study was supported entirely by a grant from the Department of Health's Policy Research Unit in Economic Evaluation of Health and Care Interventions, a UK government agency.

Identification of treatment effects is determined by a birthday cutoff-based discontinuity in the eligibility for a financial incentive to participate in the screening. Assigned preschoolers are 14.5 percentage points more likely to participate in the program. For participants with high socio-economic status (SES), we find little evidence for interventions and consistently no effect on healthcare costs in the long run.

Methods: A consortium of COPD modeling groups completed three tasks. First, they reported all patient characteristics included in the model and provided the level of detail in which the input parameters were specified. Second, groups simulated disease progression, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs for hypothetical subgroups of patients that differed in terms of sex, age, smoking status, and lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] % predicted). Finally, model outcomes for exacerbations and mortality for subgroups of patients were validated against published subgroup results of two large COPD trials. Results: Nine COPD modeling groups participated. Most models included sex (seven), age (nine), smoking status (six), and FEV1% predicted (nine), mainly to specify disease progression and mortality. Trial results showed higher exacerbation rates for women (found in one model), higher mortality rates for men (two models), lower mortality for younger patients (four models), and higher exacerbation and mortality rates in patients with severe COPD (four models). Conclusions: Most currently available COPD cost-effectiveness models are able to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalized treatment on the basis of sex, age, smoking, and FEV1% predicted. Treatment in COPD is, however, more likely to be personalized on the basis of clinical parameters. Two models include several clinical patient characteristics and are therefore most suitable to evaluate personalized treatment, although some important clinical parameters are still missing.","[Hoogendoorn, Martine; Rutten-van Molken, Maureen P.

Allowance is made for different combinations of stock and flow variables as well as deterministic trends, and the variables themselves may be stationary or nonstationary (and possibly cointegrated). The resulting discrete time representations allow for the information contained in high frequency data to be utilised alongside the low frequency data in the estimation of the parameters of the continuous time model. Monte Carlo simulations explore the finite sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimator of the continuous time system parameters based on mixed frequency data, and a comparison with extant methods of using data only at the lowest frequency is provided. An empirical application demonstrates the methods developed in the paper and it concludes with a discussion of further ways in which the present analysis can be extended and refined.

Methods: One thousand randomized clinical trials were simulated using PRO based on the GRM and under various combinations of the number of patients in each arm, the group allocation ratio, the number of items and categories, and group effects. The power and sample size estimated in the simulations were then compared with those computed using the CTT framework. Results: The results indicated that the impact of the most influential factors, including the number of patients, group allocation ratio, group effects, and the number of categories, on the power and sample size of the GRM-based and CTT-based approaches was similar. Nevertheless, the strong impact of the number of items on these issues distinguished the two approaches. Conclusions: It is crucial to use an adapted sample size formula in a GRM-based analysis because the classical formula designed for the CTT-based approach does not consider the impact of the number of items, which could result in an inadequately sized study and a decrease in power. Thus, when clinicians design a randomized clinical trial with polytomous PRO endpoints using classical sample size formula as the base, they should be aware of the possibility of making an incorrect clinical decision.","[Doostfatemeh, Marziyeh; Ayatollah, Seyyed Mohammad Taghi; Jafari, Peyman] Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Emam Hossein Sq, Shiraz, Iran",Shiraz University of Medical Science,"Ayatollah, SMT (通讯作者)，Shiraz Univ Med Sci, Dept Biostat, Emam Hossein Sq, Shiraz, Iran.",ayatolahim@sums.ac.ir,"Jafari, Peyman/B-1914-2012; Doostfatemeh, Marziyeh/O-9438-2018; Doostfatemeh, Marziyeh/AAG-9720-2021","Jafari, Peyman/0000-0002-6766-1343; Doostfatemeh, Marziyeh/0000-0003-3073-2600; jafari, peyman/0000-0002-4957-887X",Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Research Council [92-6807],Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Research Council,This work was supported by a grant from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences Research Council (grant no. 92-6807).,,40,10,12,0,7,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUL-AUG,2016,19.0,5.0,,,,,639,647,,10.1016/j.jval.2016.03.1857,0.0,,,9,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DU5MA,27565281.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000382254600018,0

Health shocks cover disability and morbidity and are measured by days unable to carry out regular activity', days in bed due to illness/injury', and hospitalization'. Overall, Vietnamese households are able to smooth total non-health expenditures in the short run in the face of a significant rise in out-of-pocket health expenditures. However, this is accomplished through vulnerability-enhancing mechanisms, especially in rural areas, including increased loans and asset sales and decreased education expenditures. Female-headed and rural households are found to be the least able to protect consumption. Results highlight the need to extend and deepen social protection and universal health coverage.

Objectives: The objective of this study was to examine the costs and benefits of RALP versus retropubic radical prostatectomy from an expanded view, including hospital, payer, and societal perspectives. Methods: We performed a model based cost comparison using clinical outcomes obtained from a systematic review of the published literature. Equipment costs were obtained from the manufacturer of the robotic system; other economic model parameters were obtained from government agencies, online resources, commercially available databases, an advisory expert panel, and the literature. Clinical point estimates and care pathways based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines were used to model costs out to 3 years. Hospital costs and costs incurred for the patients' postdischarge complications, adjuvant and salvage radiation treatment, incontinence and potency treatment, and lost wages during recovery were considered. Robotic system costs were modeled in two ways: as hospital overhead (hospital overhead calculation: RALP-H) and as a function of robotic case volume (robotic amortization calculation: RALP-R). All costs were adjusted to year 2014 US dollars. Results: Because of more favorable clinical outcomes over 3 years, RALP provided hospital ($1094 savings with RALP-H, $341 deficit with RALP-R), payer ($1451), and societal ($1202) economic benefits relative to retropubic radical prostatectomy. Conclusions: Monte-Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 38% to 99% probability that RALP provides cost savings (depending on the perspective). Higher surgical consumable costs are offset by a decreased hospital stay, lower complication rate, and faster return to work.","[Bijlani, Akash; Hebert, April E.] Intuit Surg, Sunnyvale, CA USA; [Davitian, Mike; May, Holly; Speers, Mark] Hlth Adv LLC, Weston, MA USA; [Davitian, Mike; May, Holly; Speers, Mark] Hlth Adv LLC, San Francisco, CA USA; [Leung, Robert; Mohamed, Nihal E.; Tewari, Ashutosh] Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Urol, 1425 Madison Ave,6th Floor,Room L6-70, New York, NY 10029 USA; [Sacks, Henry S.] Icahn Sch Med Mt Sinai, Thomas C Chalmers Clin Trials Unit, New York, NY 10029 USA","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","Tewari, A (通讯作者)，Mt Sinai Hosp, Dept Urol, 1425 Madison Ave,6th Floor,Room L6-70, New York, NY 10029 USA.",ash.tewari@mountsinai.org,,,Health Advances LLC; Usha Kreaden; Steve Duff,Health Advances LLC; Usha Kreaden; Steve Duff,"Intuitive Surgical, the manufacturer of the robotic system, financed the analyses performed by Health Advances LLC, Usha Kreaden, and Steve Duff.",,111,23,24,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2016,19.0,4.0,,,,,391,403,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.12.019,0.0,,,13,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DO9GU,27325331.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000378094200013,0

The cost-effectiveness, budget, and public health impacts of current Medicaid treatment policies restricting treatment to patients with advanced disease remain unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current Medicaid policies restricting hepatitis C treatment to patients with advanced disease compared with a strategy providing unrestricted access to hepatitis C treatment, assess the budget and public health impact of each strategy, and estimate the feasibility and long-term effects of increased access to treatment for patients with hepatitis C. Methods: Using a Markov model, we compared two strategies for 45- to 55-year-old Medicaid beneficiaries: 1) Current Practice only advanced disease is treated before Medicare eligibility and 2) Full Access both early-stage and advanced disease are treated before Medicare eligibility. Patients could develop progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, undergo transplantation, or die each year. Morbidity was reduced after successful treatment. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and compared the costs and public health effects of each strategy from the perspective of Medicare alone as well as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services perspective. We varied model inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Full Access was less costly and more effective than Current Practice for all cohorts and perspectives, with differences in cost ranging from $5,369 to $11,960 and in effectiveness from 0.82 to 3.01 quality-adjusted life-years. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Full Access was cost saving in 93% of model iterations. Compared with Current Practice, Full Access averted 5,994 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 121 liver transplants per 100,000 patients. Conclusions: Current Medicaid policies restricting hepatitis C treatment to patients with advanced disease are more costly and less effective than unrestricted, full-access strategies. Collaboration between state and federal payers may be needed to realize the full public health impact of recent innovations in hepatitis C treatment.","[Chidi, Alexis P.; Fine, Michael J.; Landsittel, Douglas P.; Myaskovsky, Larissa; Rogal, Shari S.; Switzer, Galen E.; Tsung, Allan; Smith, Kenneth J.] Univ Pittsburgh, Sch Med, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Chidi, Alexis P.; Fine, Michael J.; Myaskovsky, Larissa; Rogal, Shari S.; Switzer, Galen E.; Tsung, Allan] VA Pittsburgh Healthcare Syst, Pittsburgh, PA USA; [Bryce, Cindy L.; Donohue, Julie M.] Univ Pittsburgh, Grad Sch Publ Hlth, Pittsburgh, PA USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; US Department of Veterans Affairs; Veterans Health Administration (VHA); VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Chidi, AP (通讯作者)，3471 Fifth Ave,Suite 300, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA.",apc10@pitt.edu,"Rogal, Shari/AGN-8326-2022","Rogal, Shari/0000-0001-8184-1546; Smith, Kenneth J/0000-0001-8088-566X",Gilead Sciences,Gilead Sciences(Gilead Sciences),S.

In particular, the DSMH sampler possesses the capacity to cope with extremely irregular distributions that contain winding ridges and multiple peaks; and it is robust to how the sampling procedure progresses across stages.

This problem is particularly challenging since this density is still unknown, even in cases where the model parameters are given. Although the volatility variables are only observed with multiplicative independent innovation errors with unknown density, we manage to construct a nonparametric procedure which estimates the log volatility density consistently. By carefully exploiting the specific GARCH dependence structure of the data, our iterative procedure even attains the striking parametric root-T convergence rate. As a by-product of our main results, we also derive new smoothness properties of the stationary density. Using numerical simulations, we illustrate the performance of our estimator, and we provide an application to financial data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We replace the axiom of fairness for neighbors proposed by Beal et al. (2012a) by axioms of fairness for degree in order to characterize the component-wise proportional solutions. When a link of a graph is removed, fairness for neighbors states that a player incident to the link and any of his other neighbors should be affected similarly while fairness for degree states that a player incident to the link and all players connected to the player should be affected proportionally to their degree. We first characterize the component-wise proportional solution and the component-wise proportional surplus solution in terms of component efficiency, some kind of fairness for degree and equal treatment or fairness for two-player components. Secondly, we obtain a characterization of the two-step component-wise proportional surplus solution in terms of efficiency, fairness for degree with degree bi-surplus worth, fairness for two-player components and proportional distribution of the surplus.

Methods: A retrospective, propensity-score matched, cohort study compared refill/repeat and adding-on/switching patterns and outpatient visits and prescriptions (health care resource utilization) over 6 months in patients receiving IngMeb versus those receiving imiquimod, 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac sodium, and methyl aminolevulinate or aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (MAL/ALA-PDT). Results: The final sample analyzed included four matched treatment cohort pairs (IngMeb and comparator; n = 790-971 per treatment arm). Refill rates were similar except for imiquimod (15% vs. 9% for imiquimod and IngMeb, respectively; P < 0.05). MAL/ALA-PDT treatment repetition rates were higher than IngMeb refill rates (20% vs. 10%; P < 0.05). Topical agent add-on/switch rates were comparable. PDT had higher switch rates than did IngMeb (5% vs. 2%; P < 0.05). The IngMeb cohort had a significantly lower proportion of patients with at least one AK-related outpatient visit during the 6-month follow-up than did any other cohort: versus imiquimod (50% vs. 66%; P < 0.0001), versus 5-fluorouracil (50% vs. 69%; P < 0.0001), versus diclofenac sodium (51% vs. 56%; P = 0.034), and versus MAL/ALA-PDT (50% vs. 100%; P < 0.0001). There were significantly fewer AK-related prescriptions among patients receiving IngMeb than among patients in other cohorts. Conclusions: Results based on the first 6 months after treatment initiation suggested that most field-directed AK therapies had clinically comparable treatment patterns except imiquimod, which was associated with higher refill rates, and PDT, which was associated with significantly more frequent treatment sessions and higher switching rates. IngMeb was also associated with significantly fewer outpatient visits than were other field-directed therapies.","[Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Ctr Outcomes Res, One Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Dept Med, Peoria, IL 61656 USA; [Asche, Carl V.] Univ Illinois, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharm Syst Outcomes & Policy, Chicago, IL USA; [Zografos, Panagiotis; Urbanek, Bill; Mamay, Carl] LEO Pharma Inc, Parsippany, NJ USA; [Norlin, Jenny M.; Erntoft, Sandra] LEO Pharma A S, Ballerup, Denmark; [Mamay, Carl; Chen, Chi-Chang; Hines, Dionne M.] IMS Hlth, RWE HEOR Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia, PA USA; [Siegel, Daniel Mark] Suny Downstate, Dept Dermatol, Brooklyn, NY USA; [Siegel, Daniel Mark] Long Isl Skin Canc Dermatol Surg, Smithtown, NY USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Peoria; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital; LEO Pharma; LEO Pharma; State University of New York (SUNY) System; State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center,"Asche, CV (通讯作者)，Univ Illinois, Coll Med, Ctr Outcomes Res, One Illini Dr, Peoria, IL 61656 USA.",cva@uic.edu,,"Asche, Carl V/0000-0002-3193-6800",LEO Pharma A/S,LEO Pharma A/S,This study was funded by LEO Pharma A/S.,,38,6,6,0,1,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,239,248,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.014,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021759.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800016,0

The measure can be decomposed into the probability that medical expenditure exceeds a threshold, the loss due to predictably low consumption of other goods if it does and the further loss arising from the volatility of medical expenses above the threshold. Depending on the choice of threshold, the measure is consistent with a model of reference-dependent utility with loss aversion. Unlike the risk premium, the measure is only sensitive to particularly high expenses, and can identify households that expect to incur such expenses and would benefit from subsidised, but not actuarially fair, insurance. An empirical illustration using data from seven Asian countries demonstrates the importance of taking account of informal insurance and reveals clear differences in catastrophic medical expenditure risk across and within countries. In general, risk is higher among poorer, rural and chronically ill populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Public health care decision makers from Sweden and the United Kingdom have started examining environmental impacts when assessing new technologies. This article considers the case for incorporating environmental impacts into the health technology assessment (HTA) process and discusses the associated challenges. Two arguments favor incorporating environmental impacts into HTA: 1) environmental changes could directly affect people's health and 2) policy decision makers have broad mandates and objectives extending beyond health care. Two types of challenges hinder this process. First, the nascent evidence base is insufficient to support the accurate comparison of technologies' environmental impacts. Second, cost-utility analysis, which is favored by many HTA agencies, could capture some of the value of environmental impacts, especially those generating health impacts, but might not be suitable for addressing broader concerns. Both cost-benefit and multicriteria decision analyses are potential methods for evaluating health and environmental outcomes, but are less familiar to health care decision makers. Health care is an important and sizable sector of the economy that could warrant closer policy attention to its impact on the environment. Considerable work is needed to track decision makers' demands, augment the environmental evidence base, and develop robust methods for capturing and incorporating environmental data as part of HTA.","[Marsh, Kevin] Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London, England; [Ganz, Michael L.] Evidera Inc, Lexington, MA USA; [Hsu, John] Harvard Univ, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA; [Strandberg-Larsen, Martin] Univ Copenhagen, Ctr Hlth Econ & Policy, Copenhagen, Denmark; [Lund, Niels] Novo Nordisk AS, DK-2880 Bagsvaerd, Denmark",Evidera; Evidera; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; University of Copenhagen; Novo Nordisk,"Marsh, K (通讯作者)，Evidera Inc, Metro Bldg,6th Floor,1 Butterwick, London, England.",kevin.marsh@evidera.com,,"Ganz, Michael/0000-0002-9702-2999",Novo Nordisk A/S,Novo Nordisk A/S(Novo Nordisk),This research was funded by Novo Nordisk A/S.,,54,31,32,1,10,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,249,254,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.008,0.0,,,6,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021760.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800017,0

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of incobotulinumtoxin-A administered with flexible treatment intervals compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A (Botox, Sydney, New South Wales) in blepharospasm and cervical dystonia from the perspective of Australian health care providers. Methods: A Markov state transition model was developed to perform a cost-utility analysis to compare the cost and health benefits of incobotulinumtoxin-A to that of onabotulinumtoxin-A. The cost-utility analysis compared incobotulinumtoxin-A treatment, given at minimum intervals of 6 weeks and maximum intervals of 20 weeks, with onabotulinumtoxin-A treatment, given at minimum intervals of 12 weeks and maximum intervals of 20 weeks. The Markov model consisted of three health states and followed patients in weekly cycles for 5 years. Only direct health care costs associated with the acquisition and administration of type A botulinum neurotoxins were included. Utility values were derived from a prospective, open-labeled cohort study. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: Incobotulinumtoxin-A was cost-effective compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A in both blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, with an incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year gained of A$25,588 and A$23,794, respectively. Conclusions: Incobotulinumtoxin-A administered at flexible treatment intervals determined by the needs of the patient was found to be a cost-effective treatment option when compared to the administration of onabotulinumtoxin-A in the Australian health care system. The option to administer incobotulinumtoxin-A according to the needs of the patient resulted in patients experiencing symptoms for a fewer number of weeks compared to onabotulinumtoxin-A given at minimum 12-week intervals.","[Tilden, Dominic; Guarnieri, Carmel] Thema Consulting Pty Ltd, Suite 311,55 Miller St, Pyrmont, NSW 2009, Australia",,"Guarnieri, C (通讯作者)，Thema Consulting Pty Ltd, Suite 311,55 Miller St, Pyrmont, NSW 2009, Australia.",cguarnieri@thema.net,,,Merz Pharmaceuticals,Merz Pharmaceuticals,This study was financially supported by Merz Pharmaceuticals.,,17,5,6,0,4,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,MAR-APR,2016,19.0,2.0,,,,,145,152,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.11.009,0.0,,,8,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,DH8WY,27021747.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373078800004,0

We exploit a change in the payment schedule of Peru's conditional cash transfer program to identify the impact of benefit receipt frequency on the purchase of temptation goods. We use annual household data among cross-sectional and panel samples to analyze the effect of the policy change on the share of the household budget devoted to four categories of temptation goods. Using a difference-in-differences estimation approach, we find that larger, less frequent payments increased the expenditure share of alcohol by 55-80% and sweets by 10-40%, although the absolute magnitudes of these effects are small. Our study suggests that less frequent benefits scheduling may lead cash recipients to make certain types of temptation purchases. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

We rely on an original instrumental variable approach on the basis of the idea that workers perceive greater job security in countries where employment is strongly protected by the law and more so if employed in industries where employment protection legislation is more binding; that is, in induastries with a higher natural rate of dismissals. Using cross-country data from the 2010 European Working Conditions Survey, we show that, when the potential endogeneity of job insecurity is not accounted for, the latter appears to deteriorate almost all health outcomes. When tackling the endogeneity issue by estimating an instrumental variable model and dealing with potential weak-instrument issues, the health-damaging effect of job insecurity is confirmed for a limited subgroup of health outcomes; namely, suffering from headaches or eyestrain and skin problems. As for other health variables, the impact of job insecurity appears to be insignificant at conventional levels.

In the presence of heterogeneous conditions (like environmental factors) that may influence the shape and the position of the frontier, traditional measures of efficiency obtained in the space of inputs/outputs are difficult to interpret, since they mix managerial inefficiency and shift of the frontier. This can be corrected by using nonparametric conditional efficiencies. In this paper we extend these concepts in the case where the heterogeneity is not observed. We propose a model where the heterogeneity variable is linked to a particular input (or output). It is defined as the part of the input (or the output), independent from some instrumental variable through a nonseparable nonparametric model. We discuss endogeneity issues involved in this model. We show that the model is identified and analyze the asymptotic properties of proposed nonparametric estimators. When using FDH estimators we achieve a limiting Weibull distribution, whereas when using the robust order-m estimators we obtain the asymptotic normality. The method is illustrated with some simulated and real data examples. A Monte-Carlo experiment shows how the procedure works for finite samples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Using structured, explicit approaches to decisions involving multiple criteria can improve the quality of decision making and a set of techniques, known under the collective heading multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA), are useful for this purpose. MCDA methods are widely used in other sectors, and recently there has been an increase in health care applications. In 2014, ISPOR established an MCDA Emerging Good Practices Task Force. It was charged with establishing a common definition for MCDA in health care decision making and developing good practice guidelines for conducting MCDA to aid health care decision making. This initial ISPOR MCDA task force report provides an introduction to MCDA - it defines MCDA; provides examples of its use in different kinds of decision making in health care (including benefit risk analysis, health technology assessment, resource allocation, portfolio decision analysis, shared patient clinician decision making and prioritizing patients' access to services); provides an overview of the principal methods of MCDA; and describes the key steps involved. Upon reviewing this report, readers should have a solid overview of MCDA methods and their potential for supporting health care decision making.

Evidence suggests that generic measures may not be appropriate for multiple sclerosis (MS). Objectives: To report the first stage in the development of an MS-specific preference-based measure to quantify the impact of MS and its treatment: deriving a health state classification system, which is amenable to valuation, from the 29-item Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), a widely used patient-reported outcome measure in MS. Methods: The dimensional structure of the MSIS-29 was determined using factor analysis and a conceptual framework of HRQOL in MS. Item performance was assessed, using Rasch analysis and psychometric criteria, to enable the selection of one item to represent each dimension of HRQOL covered by the MSIS-29. Analysis was undertaken using a sample (N = 529) from a longitudinal study of people with MS. Results were validated by repeating the analysis with a second sample (N = 528). Results: Factor analysis confirmed the two-subscale structure of the MSIS-29. Both subscales covered several conceptually independent dimensions of HRQOL. Following Rasch and psychometric analysis, an eight-dimensional classification system named the MSIS-8D was developed. Each dimension was represented by one item with four response levels. Conclusions: Combining factor analysis with conceptual mapping, and Rasch analysis with psychometric criteria, provides a valid method of constructing a classification system for an MS specific preference-based measure. The next stage is to obtain preference weights so that the measure can be used in studies investigating MS.","[Goodwin, Elizabeth; Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Hlth Econ Grp, Exeter, Devon, England; [Green, Colin] Univ Exeter, Sch Med, Collaborat Leadership Appl Hlth Res & Care South, Exeter, Devon, England",University of Exeter; University of Exeter,"Goodwin, E (通讯作者)，Inst Hlth Res, Hlth Econ Grp, South Cloisters,St Lukes Campus, Exeter EX1 2LU, Devon, England.",e.goodwin@exeter.ac.uk,,"Goodwin, Elizabeth/0000-0003-1351-9170",Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula at the Royal Devon and Exeter National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust,Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care South West Peninsula at the Royal Devon and Exeter National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust,"This research was funded by the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The asymptotic distribution of the quasi-maximum likelihood estimators and the filtered empirical percentiles is derived. Three applications of the asymptotic result are considered. First, we construct aminterval estimator of the conditional quantile without any distributional assumptions. Second, we develop a specification test for the error distribution. Finally, using the specification test, we propose methods for estimating the tail index of the error distribution that supports the construction of a new estimator for the conditional quantile at the extreme tail. The asymptotic results and their applications are illustrated by simulations and real data analyses in which our methods for analyzing daily and intraday financial return series have been adopted.

There is a need to assess the acceptance of such treatments and their mode of administration. Objectives: To develop a novel patient-reported outcome measure, the Injection Treatment Acceptance Questionnaire (I-TAQ), and assess its content validity using qualitative methods. Methods: Concepts generated from a literature and instrument review informed the initial drafting of 17 items in the I-TAQ with item wording adapted from three existing instruments. Three rounds of qualitative interviews were conducted with 29 US-English speaking patients at high cardiovascular risk. Concept elicitation questioning was used to explore patients' treatment experiences followed by cognitive debriefing of the I-TAQ using think-aloud methods. Verbatim transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Qualitative analysis of concept elicitation data identified the following relevant concepts: perceived efficacy, side effects, self-efficacy, convenience, and overall acceptance. Seven (24%) patients discussed an initial fear of needles, but described this as subsiding with no impact on adherence. Five items were added after round one interviews, three of which were retained after round two testing in which two further items were added, forming the conceptually comprehensive 22-item I-TAQ. Patients demonstrated good understanding of item wording, instructions, response scales, and recall period. Conclusions: Successive rounds of in-depth interviews resulted in a treatment acceptance measure with strong content validity. Pending demonstration of its psychometric properties, the I-TAQ may prove to be a valuable measure of patients' perspectives toward being treated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapies requiring subcutaneous injections.","[Tatlock, Sophi; Grant, Laura; Arbuckle, Rob] Adelphi Mill, Adelphi Values, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England; [Spertus, John A.] St Lukes Hosp, Mid Amer Heart Inst, Kansas City, MO 64111 USA; [Spertus, John A.] Univ Missouri, Kansas City, MO 64110 USA; [Khan, Irfan] Sanofi, Bridgewater, MA USA; [Manvelian, Garen; Sanchez, Robert J.] Regeneron Pharmaceut Inc, Tarrytown, NY 10591 USA",Adelphi Group Ltd; Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute; Saint Luke's Hospital - Missouri; University of Missouri System; University of Missouri Kansas City; Sanofi-Aventis; Regeneron,"Tatlock, S (通讯作者)，Adelphi Mill, Adelphi Values, Bollington SK10 5JB, Cheshire, England.",sophi.tatlock@adelphivalues.com,"Spertus, John/ABD-3075-2021; Khan, Irfan/ABD-3838-2020","Khan, Irfan/0000-0002-9832-0904; Spertus, John/0000-0002-2839-2611",Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; Sanofi,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals(Regeneron); Sanofi,"This work was sponsored by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi.

A Discrete Time Hazard Model for Germany,HEALTH ECONOMICS,,,English,Article,,,,,,statutory and private health insurance; incentives; personality traits,SELF-ASSESSED HEALTH; DEMAND,"The coexistence of social health insurance and private health insurance in Germany is subject to intense public debate. As only few have the opportunity to choose between the two systems, they are often regarded as privileged by the health insurance system. Applying a hazard model in discrete time, this paper examines the role of incentives set by the regulatory framework and the influence of individual personality characteristics on the decision to opt out of the statutory system. To address potential endogeneity of one of the key explanatory variables, an instrumental variable approach is also applied. The estimation results yield robust evidence on the choice of health insurance type that is consistent with pragmatic decision making, with both incentives set by regulation and personality traits as relevant determinants.

If poor cognitive achievement is truly a consequence of childhood obesity, this relationship has significant policy implications. Therefore, an important question is to what extent can this correlation be explained by other factors that jointly determine obesity and cognitive achievement in childhood? To answer this question, we exploit a rich longitudinal dataset of Australian children, which is linked to national assessments in math and literacy. Using a range of estimators, we find that obesity and body mass index are negatively related to cognitive achievement for boys but not girls. This effect cannot be explained by sociodemographic factors, past cognitive achievement or unobserved time-invariant characteristics and is robust to different measures of adiposity. Given the enormous importance of early human capital development for future well-being and prosperity, this negative effect for boys is concerning and warrants further investigation.

We find that the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) for the MESS is consistent under heteroskedasticity, a property not shared by the QMLE of the SAR model. For the general model that has MESS in both the dependent variable and disturbances, labeled MESS(1,1), the QMLE can be consistent under unknown heteroskedasticity when the spatial weights matrices in the two MESS processes are commutative. We also consider the generalized method of moments estimator (GMME). In the homoskedastic case, we derive a best GMME that is as efficient as the maximum likelihood estimator under normality and can be asymptotically more efficient than the QMLE under non-normality. In the heteroskedastic case, an optimal GMME can be more efficient than the QMLE asymptotically. The QML approach for the MESS has the computational advantage over that of a SAR model. The computational simplicity carries over to MESS models with any finite order of spatial matrices. No parameter range needs to be imposed in order for the model to be stable. Results of Monte Carlo experiments for finite sample properties of the estimators are reported. Finally, the MESS(1,1) is applied to Belgium's outward FDI data and we observe that the dominant motivation of Belgium's outward FDI lies in finding cheaper factor inputs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We view the model as an approximation to the true data generating process whose exact nature is unknown but perhaps changing over time either continuously or with some jumps. This view is widely held in the forecasting literature and under this view, the time series dependence property of all the observed variables is unstable as well. We establish that the rate of convergence of the estimator to a properly defined limit is at most the cube root of T, where T is the sample size, which is much slower than the standard super consistent rate. We also provide an asymptotic distribution of the estimator and that of the Gaussian quasi likelihood ratio statistic for a certain class of true data generating processes. We relate our finding to current forecast combination methods and propose a new averaging scheme. Our method compares favourably with various contemporary forecasting methods in forecasting a number of macroeconomic series. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In France, public financial support is provided to dependent patients: it can be used to finance informal care time and nonmedical care use. Eligibility for public subsidies and reimbursement of costs is associated with a specific tool: the autonomie gerontologie groupes iso-ressources (AGGIR) scale score. Objective: Our objective was to explore whether patients with Alzheimer's disease who are eligible for public financial support have greater needs than do noneligible patients. Methods: Using data from the Dependance des patients atteints de la maladie d'Alzheimer en France study, we calculated nonmedical care expenditures (in) using microcosting methods and informal care time demand (hours/month) using the Resource Use in Dementia questionnaire. We measured the burden associated with informal care provision with Zarit Burden Interview. We used a modified two-part model to explore the correlation between public financial support eligibility and these three variables. Results: We find evidence of higher informal care use, higher informal caregivers' burden, and higher care expenditures when patients have an AGGIR scale score corresponding to public financial support eligibility. Conclusions: 'The AGGIR scale is useful to target patients with the highest costs and needs. Given our results, public subsidies could be used to further sustain informal caregivers networks by financing programs dedicated to lowering informal caregivers' burden.

Without posing a martingale difference assumption on the error terms, the asymptotic null distribution of the CM test is obtained. Moreover, this CM test is consistent, and has nontrivial power against the local alternative of order n(-1/2). Due to the unknown dependence of error terms and the estimation effects, a new block-wise random weighting method is constructed to bootstrap the critical values of the test statistic. The new method is easy to implement and its validity is justified. The theory is illustrated by a small simulation study and an application to S&P 500 stock index. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: To reassess the costs and effects of PVP versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) on the basis of most recent data. Methods: The same model was used as in 2008. Transition probabilities were estimated using a Bayesian approach updating the 2008 estimates with data from two meta analyses and data from GOLIATH, the latest and largest trial comparing PVP with TURF. Utility estimates were from the 2008 assessment, and estimates of resource utilization and costs were updated. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs are in UK pounds. The balance between costs and effects was addressed by multivariate sensitivity analysis. Results: If the 2010 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence analysis would have updated the cost-effectiveness analysis with figures from its own meta-analysis, it would have estimated the change in quality-adjusted life-years at -0.01 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.05 to 0.01) instead of at -0.11 (95% CI -0.31 to -0.01) as in the 2008 analysis. The GOLIATH estimate of -0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.02) strengthens the conclusion of near equivalence. Estimates of additional costs vary from 491 pound (21- pound 1286) pound in 2008 to 111 pound (315 pound to 595) pound for 2010 and to 109 pound (-204 pound to 504) pound for GOLIATH. PVP becomes cost saving if more than 32% can be carried out as a day case in the United Kingdom. Conclusions: The available evidence indicates that PVP can be a cost-effective alternative for TURP in a potentially broad group of patients.","[Thomas, J.

Assessments of added clinical benefit are invariably based on evidence generated to support registration. Objective: Our objective was to identify and characterize significant problems relating to the quality of the clinical evidence in submissions to the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) seeking subsidy on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and thus determine whether the evidence presented to the committee was fit for purpose. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of submissions considered by the PBAC between 2005 and 2012 using a published evaluation framework. We developed an additional framework to categorize significant problems in more detail. Significant problems related to the choice of comparator, the unavailability of randomized clinical trial evidence, poor quality data, a claim of clinical superiority, and a claim of clinical noninferiority. Results: We identified 261 significant problems in 479 major submissions. There was a significant problem with the sponsor's choice of comparator in 11% of the submissions. The most common significant problem (29%) was the determination of a medicine's comparative performance in the target patient population. Conclusions: The supporting clinical evidence is the foundation of a PBAC submission. We found a poor fit for purpose; on average, one in every two major submissions had a significant problem with the supporting evidence. The findings from our study, if confirmed in other jurisdictions, raise important questions regarding what clinical evidence should be generated to support the reimbursement of new medicines.","[Wonder, Michael] Wonder Drug Consulting Pty Ltd, Cronulla, NSW, Australia; [Dunlop, Sheryl] Zimmer Pty Ltd, Asia Pacific, Market Access, Belrose, NSW, Australia",,"Wonder, M (通讯作者)，POB 470, Cronulla, NSW 2230, Australia.",wonderdrug@optusnet.com.au,,,,,,,13,9,9,0,9,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"360 PARK AVE SOUTH, NEW YORK, NY 10010-1710 USA",1098-3015,1524-4733,,VALUE HEALTH,Value Health,JUN,2015,18.0,4.0,,,,,467,476,,10.1016/j.jval.2015.02.011,0.0,,,10,Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services; Health Policy & Services,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Business & Economics; Health Care Sciences & Services,CK6SQ,26091601.0,hybrid,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000356358600014,0

In the presence of positive network externalities, under relative-performance based delegation, Bertrand competition yields lower prices and profits, and higher quantities, consumers surplus and welfare than Cournot competition. On the contrary, these rankings are completely reversed in the presence of negative network externalities. It also discusses the endogenous choice of price or quantity contract under delegation in the presence of network externalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We focus on establishing the asymptotic results for estimators using smooth backfitting methods. We consider two estimators for the smooth unknown function in nonparametric panel regressions. One is a local linear estimator constructed similar as the one in Mammen et al. (2009) which was proposed for the additive nonparametric panel model. The other is the local profile likelihood based estimator proposed by Henderson et al. (2008) (HCL hereafter). We build the link and compare the difference between these two estimators which are constructed under different sets of conditions. We put both of these estimators in the smooth backfitting algorithm framework discussed in Mammen et al. (1999). Following the recently developed theories on backfitting kernel estimates in Mammen et al. (2009), we establish the asymptotic normality of these estimators, and hence verify the conjectures made by HCL and complement their paper. Further, we consider a partially linear fixed effects panel data model with the nonparametric component estimated using the methods discussed in the first part of the paper. We give the-asymptotic result for the-estimators of finite dimensional parameters, which shows that the first-step plug-in estimators will not affect the asymptotic variance in the second-step estimation.

Methods We used the Survey on Disabilities, Autonomy and Dependency carried out in 2008 to obtain information about disabled individuals and their informal caregivers. We computed the total number of informal caregiving hours provided by main caregivers in Spain in 2008. The monetary value of informal care time was obtained using three different approaches: the proxy good method, the opportunity cost method and the contingent valuation method. Results Total hours of informal care provided in 2008 were estimated at 4193 million and the monetary value ranged from EUR23,064 to EUR50,158 million depending on the method used. The value of informal care was estimated at figures equivalent to 1.73-4.90 % of the gross domestic product for that year. Conclusion Informal care represents a very high social cost regardless of the estimation method considered. A holistic approach to care of dependent people should take into account the role and needs of informal caregivers, promote their social recognition and lead to policies that enhance efficient use of formal and informal resources.","[Oliva-Moreno, Juan; Maria Pena-Longobardo, Luz] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Res Seminar Econ & Hlth, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Oliva-Moreno, Juan] Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo, Anal Econ & Finanzas, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain; [Vilaplana-Prieto, Cristina] Univ Murcia, Murcia, Spain",Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; University of Murcia,"Oliva-Moreno, J (通讯作者)，Univ Castilla La Mancha, Fac Ciencias Jurid & Sociales Toledo, Anal Econ & Finanzas, Cobertizo San Pedro Martir S-N, Toledo 45071, Spain.",juan.olivamoreno@uclm.es,"Oliva, Juan/A-1299-2011; Oliva, Juan/JOZ-4028-2023; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/K-6413-2017","Oliva, Juan/0000-0002-8997-0307; Pena Longobardo, Luz Maria/0000-0001-7224-2189",Instituto de Estudios Fiscales; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [ECO2013-48217-C2-2-R]; Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology [ECO2011-30323-C03-02],Instituto de Estudios Fiscales; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness(Spanish Government); Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology(Spanish Government),The authors are grateful to the Instituto de Estudios Fiscales for funding the research project of which this study is a part.

Methods: We used a retrospective cohort design of patients older than 12 years with asthma diagnosis in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to evaluate asthma-related morbidity measured by oral corticosteroid (OCS) initiation within 12 months of initiating LABAs, ICSs, or ICSs/LABAs. Asthma severity 12 months before drug initiation (use of OCSs, asthma-related hospital or emergency department visits, and number of short acting betaagonist prescriptions) and during follow-up (short-acting betaagonist prescriptions and total number of asthma drug classes) was adjusted as a time varying variable via marginal structural models. Results: A total of 51,103 patients with asthma were followed for 12 months after receiving first prescription for study drugs from 1993 to 2010. About 92% initiated ICSs, 1% initiated LABAs, and 7% initiated ICSs/LABAs. Compared with ICSs, LABAs were associated with a 10% increased risk of asthma exacerbations requiring short courses of OCSs (hazard ratio [HA] 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-1.18). ICS/LABA initiators were 62% less likely than ICS initiators (HR 0.38; 95% Cl 0.12-0.66) and 50% less likely than LABA initiators to receive OCS prescriptions for asthma exacerbations (HR 0.50; 95% CI 0.14-0.78). Conclusions: In concordance with current asthma management guidelines, inhaled LABAs should not be prescribed as monotherapy to patients with asthma. The findings suggest the presence of time dependent confounding by asthma severity, which was accounted for by the marginal structural model.","[Ali, Ayad K.] Eli Lilly & Co, Global Patient Safety, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA; [Ali, Ayad K.] Indiana Univ, Richard M Fairbanks Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Indianapolis, IN 46204 USA; [Ali, Ayad K.; Hartzema, Abraham G.; Winterstein, Almut G.; Segal, Richard] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Outcomes & Policy, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hartzema, Abraham G.] Univ Florida, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Dept Epidemiol, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hartzema, Abraham G.; Lu, Xiaomin] Univ Florida, Coll Med, Gainesville, FL USA; [Segal, Richard] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Dean Off, Gainesville, FL USA; [Lu, Xiaomin] Univ Florida, Coll Publ Hlth & Hlth Profess, Dept Biostat, Gainesville, FL USA; [Hendeles, Leslie] Univ Florida, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmacotherapy & Translat Res, Gainesville, FL USA",Eli Lilly; Indiana University System; Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Ali, AK (通讯作者)，Eli Lilly & Co, Lilly Corp Ctr, Indianapolis, IN 46285 USA.",ayadali@alumni.ufl.edu,"winterstein, almut/ABH-1838-2020; Winterstein, Almut/A-3017-2014","Winterstein, Almut/0000-0002-6518-5961; Ali, Ayad/0000-0003-4665-5769",Perry A.

A main effects plan plus its foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that attachment' and stability' each account for around 22% of the space, and autonomy', achievement' and enjoyment' account for around 18% each. Across all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across public policy generally. (c) 2013 The Authors.

We use individual data from Dutch registers (years 1815-2000), combined with business cycle conditions in childhood as indicators of early-life conditions. The empirical analysis estimates bivariate duration models of marriage and mortality, allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. Results show that conditions around birth and school going ages are important for marriage and mortality. Men typically enjoy a protective effect of marriage, whereas women suffer during childbearing ages. However, having been born under favorable economic conditions reduces female mortality during childbearing ages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In order to cope with these uncertainties, some enterprises have to establish a research joint venture (RJV) in the R&D project investment, but they will still compete for more benefits after the success of project. For the optimal investment decision in cooperation, it needs to be very accurate in valuation of the R&D project before investment. There are four kinds of investment decisions for two enterprises in coopetition: leader, follower, investment together at once, or investment together after waiting. Depend on European option, this paper establishes the corresponding investment decision payoff model of the R&D project which can quantify the uncertainties and assess the timing and payoffs of the R&D project investment. After option game, the two enterprises could obtain their own optimal investment decision from the R&D project investment in coopetition.","[Cao Bo-yang; Jiang Ming-hui] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Cao, BY (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [70871030]; Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China [G200914]; National Defense Science and Industry Bureau Technology Foundation Research Project of China [JZ20150006],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province); National Defense Science and Industry Bureau Technology Foundation Research Project of China,"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (70871030), the Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province of China (G200914) and the National Defense Science and Industry Bureau Technology Foundation Research Project of China (JZ20150006)",,31,0,0,2,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,369,374,,,,,,6,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600050,0

Based on social capital theory, social exchange theory, and social cognitive theory, this study explored why users continuously seek knowledge from online social Q&A communities. Empirical data was collected from a popular Chinese online social Q&A community. The results from a negative binomial regression model indicate that knowledge exchange behavior, identity-based trust have positive impact on knowledge contribution behaviors, but group size has negative impact. This study provided theoretical basis for knowledge seeking behavior in online Q&A communities, and findings can help to guide the development and operation of online social Q&A communities.","[Jin Jia-hua; Yan Xiang-bin; Wang Le; Li Yi-jun] Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China",Harbin Institute of Technology,"Jin, JH (通讯作者)，Harbin Inst Technol, Sch Management, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.",,"Yan, xiangbin/AAF-8402-2019",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [71328103, 71171067]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71328103, 71171067)",,34,0,0,0,17,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,83,89,,,,,,7,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600012,0

Third, a dimension decomposition based relationship analysis between Fidelity-Utility and Fidelity-Cost is presented. A Utility-Fidelity mapping method is used to map simulation objective into fidelity requirement (FR). Fidelity design (FD) is strictly based on this FR, and simulation design is in turn based on FD. Finally, a Utility-Cost management model is presented to show how well a simulation implementation is done. The SLM framework is effective in guiding the simulation to achieve reasonable balance between utility and cost, which falls into the cost-effective equilibrium zone in the Utility-Cost management model.","[Liu, Yu-kun; Shan, Meng-rui] Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Automat, Logist Engn Ctr, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China",Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications,"Liu, YK (通讯作者)，Beijing Univ Posts & Telecommun, Sch Automat, Logist Engn Ctr, Beijing 100088, Peoples R China.",lykbupt@163.com; shanmengrui@163.com,,,,,,,14,0,0,0,3,ATLANTIS PRESS,PARIS,"29 AVENUE LAVMIERE, PARIS, 75019, FRANCE",,,978-94-6239-102-4; 978-94-6239-101-7,,,,2015,,,,,,,47,50,,10.2991/978-94-6239-102-4_10,0.0,,,4,"Economics; Engineering, Industrial; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Engineering; Operations Research & Management Science,BE5UU,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000373492700010,0

In terms of the contingencies on this effect, direct regulation, green procurement and ISO14001 certification would positively moderate the link between eco-product innovation and profitability. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which eco-product innovation firms reap the desirable economic benefits are investigated. The results of panel regressions indicate that market expansion and productivity improvement constitute two main drivers of the reported positive economic return.

Methods: Momentary HRQOL was examined with the experience sampling method (ESM) in 139 participants from four different samples. The ESM consists of a so-called beep questionnaire that was administered 10 times a day by an electronic device. Feasibility was determined by assessing willingness to participate in the study and by analyzing the percentage of dropouts and the number of completed beep questionnaires. Multilevel analysis was used to investigate the relation between momentary HRQOL and momentary feelings and symptoms. The relation between momentary outcomes and the EuroQol visual analogue scale was investigated with a multiple regression model. Results: The overall participation rate was low, but there were no dropouts and the number of completed beeps was comparable to that in other studies. Multilevel analysis showed that feelings and symptoms were significant predictors of momentary HRQOL. The strength of these relations differed among three patient groups and a population-based sample. The EuroQol visual analogue scale was not predicted by momentary feelings and symptoms. Conclusions: We can conclude that the use of the ESM to measure accounts of the momentary experience of health in different populations is feasible. Retrospective measures may provide a biased account of the impact of health problems in the daily lives of people who are affected. Moreover, the bias may be different in different conditions.

The procedure involves a 4-year period of conditional reimbursement. During this period, additional evidence has to be gathered usually through a patient registry. Given the costs and time involved in gathering the data, it is important to carefully evaluate the registry. Objectives: This study aimed to develop a model for the regular evaluation of patient registries during an access with evidence development process and find the optimal length of the registry period. Methods: We used data from a recent registry in The Netherlands on oxaliplatin as a treatment option for stage III colon cancer. We added simulated follow-up data to the empirical data available and applied value of information analysis to balance the gains of extending the period and amount of data gathering against the costs of registering patients. Results: We show that given the assumptions on cohort size, follow-up time, and purpose of the registry, the current (partly simulated) registry was not very efficient. Notably, the observation period could have been stopped to make a definite reimbursement decision after a maximum of 2 years rather than the fixed 4-year period. Conclusions: Patient registries may be an efficient way to gather data on new medical treatments, but they need to be carefully designed and evaluated, in particular regarding their follow-up time. For each purpose, data gathering can be tailored to make sure decisions are taken at the moment that sufficient data are available.

Although the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended meningococcal vaccination for at-risk children aged 9 through 23 months, it has not endorsed universal vaccination. Health insurance payments for the vaccination of children who are not at risk are likely to be limited. Use of infant meningococcal vaccines by these families will thus depend on the preferences of physicians who might recommend vaccination to parents, as well as parents' preferences. Objective: To quantify pediatricians' preferences for specific features of hypothetical infant meningococcal vaccines. Methods: A sample of pediatricians (n = 216) completed a Web enabled, discrete choice experiment survey in which respondents chose between pairs of hypothetical vaccines in a series of trade-off questions. The questions described vaccines with six attributes. A random parameters logit regression model was used to estimate the relative importance weights physicians place on vaccine features. These weights were used to calculate the predicted probability that a physician chooses hypothetical vaccines with given characteristics. Results: Pediatricians' choices indicated that increases in vaccine effectiveness were among the most important factors in their vaccine recommendations, followed by increases in the number of injections. The age at which protection begins and the number of additional office visits were less important. Whether a booster was required after 5 years was the least important factor in vaccine recommendations. The results suggest that virtually all (99.9%) physicians in the sample would recommend a vaccine even with the least-preferred features rather than no infant meningococcal vaccine. Conclusions: Physicians' responses indicate a strong preference for infant meningococcal vaccination. Copyright (C) 2015, International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR).

The purpose of this study was to obtain general facts about the heritability of the seed vigour. Effect of drought stress on the observed characteristics of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was evaluated in the pot experiment. The root system size and seed vigour were evaluated in four genotypes. Seed vigour as the germination percentage under drought (-0.5 MPa) and temperature stress (10 degrees C) was evaluated. It was also evaluated the relationship between seed vigour and the root system size of the parents and their progenies. Statistical significant correlations (r = 0.747-0.801) of the root system size in the stage of stem elongation and seed vigour in Variant III (moderate stress) were found. The root system size of parents at the stage of heading in unstressed variant (Variant II) statistically significantly (r = 0.730-0.939) influenced the length of the plumula and roots of the progenies in both variants of seed vitality testing (i.e. control and drought stress).","[Vintrlikova, Eva; Klimesova, Jana; Streda, Tomas] Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Brno 61300, Czech Republic",Mendel University in Brno,"Vintrlikova, E (通讯作者)，Mendel Univ Brno, Dept Crop Sci Breeding & Plant Med, Zemedelska 1, Brno 61300, Czech Republic.",xvintrl2@mendelu.cz,"Klimešová, Jana/L-2924-2018; Streda, Tomas/F-4256-2015","Streda, Tomas/0000-0001-9908-4539",,,,,10,4,4,0,1,"MENDEL UNIV BRNO, FAC AGRONOMY",BRNO,"ZEMEDELSKA 1, BRNO, 613 00, CZECH REPUBLIC",,,978-80-7509-363-9,,,,2015,,,,,,,99,102,,,,,,4,"Agriculture, Dairy & Animal Science; Agricultural Economics & Policy; Agronomy",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),Agriculture,BE0NZ,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000366466100017,0

On the basis of the standards, the paper carries out a statistical analysis of the policy from Collection of Laws, Regulations and policies of science and technology from 1985 to 2011 and evaluates the S&T policy from the perspective of numbers and effectiveness. The paper argues that China's S&T policy undergoes the evolution paradigm of Science - Technology Innovation with a higher growth rate compared to developed countries and the government should improve the policy effectiveness, especially the policy in favor of the enterprises' technology innovation. In the policy objective system, there is a balance in numbers, but insufficient attention to some policy that is more conducive to technological innovation. The demand-side policy has not only a shortage of quantity but also low effectiveness.","[Xu Zhe; Li Chun-yan] Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China; [Ma Yu-song] Northeast Normal Univ, Coll Humanities & Sci, Sch Int Business, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China",Northeast Normal University - China; Northeast Normal University - China,"Xu, Z (通讯作者)，Northeast Normal Univ, Sch Business, Changchun 130117, Peoples R China.",,"Li, Chun/HKW-1738-2023",,,,,,33,0,0,2,4,IEEE,NEW YORK,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA",2155-1847,,978-1-4673-6512-3,INT C MANAGE SCI ENG,,,2015,,,,,,,1874,1883,,,,,,10,"Business, Finance; Economics; Management; Operations Research & Management Science",Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science & Humanities (CPCI-SSH),Business & Economics; Operations Research & Management Science,BH1BL,,,,,2024-03-09,WOS:000397545600248,0

Previous studies of quality and choice of hospitals have used crude measures of quality such as mortality and readmission rates rather than measures of the health gain from specific treatments. We estimate multinomial logit models of hospital choice by patients undergoing hip replacement surgery in the English NHS to test whether hospital demand responds to quality as measured by detailed patient reports of health before and after hip replacement.

Based on a partition function game, we define an extensive game, which is a propose-respond sequential bargaining game where the rejecter of a proposal exits from the game with some positive probability. We show that the NBS is supported as the expected payoff profile of any stationary subgame perfect equilibrium (SSPE) of the extensive game such that in any subgame, a coalition of all active players forms immediately. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for such an SSPE to exist. Moreover, we consider extensions to the cases of nontransferable utilities, time discounting and multiple-coalition formation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Nonparametric CVaR estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and slow convergence rate. To overcome these issues, we study semiparametric CVaR estimation and inference for parametric model with nonparametric noise distribution. Under a general framework that allows for many widely used time series models, we propose a semiparametric CVaR estimator that achieves the parametric convergence rate. Furthermore, to draw simultaneous inference for CVaR at multiple confidence levels, we establish a functional central limit theorem for CVaR process indexed by the confidence level and use it to study the conditional expected shortfall. A user-friendly bootstrap approach is introduced to facilitate non-expert practitioners to perform confidence interval construction for CVaR. The methodology is illustrated through both Monte Carlo studies and an application to S&P 500 index. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study the dynamic portfolio choice with multiple conditioning variables, where the dimension of the conditioning variables can be either fixed or diverging to infinity at certain polynomial rate of the sample size. We propose a novel data-driven method to estimate the optimal portfolio choice, motivated by the model averaging marginal regression approach suggested by Li et al. (2015). More specifically, in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality associated with the multivariate nonparametric regression problem and to make it practically implementable, we first estimate the marginal optimal portfolio choice by maximizing the conditional utility function for each univariate conditioning variable, and then construct the joint dynamic optimal portfolio through the weighted average of the marginal optimal portfolio across all the conditioning variables. Under some regularity conditions, we establish the large sample properties for the developed portfolio choice procedure. Both the simulation study and empirical application well demonstrate the finite-sample performance of the proposed methodology. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Objective By applying bootstrapped data envelopment analysis across the 20 Italian Regional Health Systems (RHSs) for the period 2008-2012, we employed a two-stage procedure to investigate the relationship between care appropriateness and productivity evolution in public hospital services. Methods In the first stage, we estimated the Malmquist index and decomposed this overall measure of productivity into efficiency and technological change. In the second stage, the two components of the Malmquist index were regressed on a set of variables measuring per capita health expenditure, care appropriateness, and clinical appropriateness. Results Malmquist analysis shows that no gains in productivity in the health industry have been achieved in Italy despite the sequence of reforms that took place during the 1990s, which were devoted to increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Analysis of the efficiency change index clearly indicates that the source of productivity gain relies on a rationalization of the employed inputs in the Italian RHSs. At the same time, the trend of the technological change index reveals that the health systems in the three macro-areas (North, Central, and South) are characterized by technological regress. Conclusion Overall, our results suggest that productivity increases could be achieved in the Italian health system by reducing the level of inputs, improving care and clinical appropriateness, and by counteracting the 'DRG (diagnosis-related group) creep' phenomenon.","[Mancuso, Paolo] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Ind Engn, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Valdmanis, Vivian Grace] Western Michigan Univ, Sch Interdisciplinary Hlth, Program Publ Hlth, 200 Ionia Ave SW, Grand Rapids, MI 49503 USA; [Valdmanis, Vivian Grace] IESEG Sch Management, Lille, France; [Valdmanis, Vivian Grace] IESEG Sch Management, Paris, France",University of Rome Tor Vergata; Western Michigan University; IESEG School of Management; IESEG School of Management,"Mancuso, P (通讯作者)，Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Ind Engn, Via Politecn 1, I-00133 Rome, Italy.",paolo.mancuso@uniroma2.it; vivian.valdmanis@wmich.edu,,,,,,,46,13,13,0,20,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,CHAM,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",1175-5652,1179-1896,,APPL HEALTH ECON HEA,Appl.

A Retrospective Review,VALUE IN HEALTH,,,English,Review,,,,,,Cancer Drugs Fund; cost-effectiveness; priority setting,ECONOMIC RATIONALE; NATIONAL INSTITUTE; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; HEALTH-CARE; ONCOLOGY; EXCELLENCE; SURVIVAL; SOCIETY; ENGLAND; SAYS,"Background: The Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) will have spent more than 1 pound billion between October 2010 and the introduction of reforms to its structure and operations in July 2016. There has been much more debate about the existence of the fund than about how it spent its substantial budget. It is important to undertake a retrospective examination of where the money went in light of the substantial reforms that will be introduced in 2016. Objectives: We review the means by which the CDF made recent funding decisions for cancer drugs to provide an assessment of the merits of the CDF model as a basis for allocation decisions. We assess the extent to which proposed reforms could overcome defects in the original CDF model of prioritization, and lessons for other countries. Methods: We provide a narrative commentary on CDF's methods and processes since 2014. We evaluate methods against best practice in cost-effectiveness analysis, and processes against the accountability for reasonableness framework. We comment on reforms to the fund. Results: There are no grounds for concluding that the opportunity costs imposed on cancer patients were well evidenced, or the product of legitimate deliberative processes. We note that some of these issues will be addressed in the next incarnation of the fund, but the rationale for the fund's existence remains unconvincing. Conclusions: It is important and timely to debate how cancer drugs appraisal ought to be conducted to confront the consequences of CDF's model of appraisal. We conclude that it did matter that the CDF was not NICE.","[Dixon, Padraig; Chamberlain, Charlotte; Hollingworth, William] Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England",University of Bristol,"Dixon, P (通讯作者)，Univ Bristol, Sch Social & Community Med, Canynge Hall,39 Whatley Rd, Bristol BS8 2PS, Avon, England.",padraig.dixon@bristol.ac.uk,,"Hollingworth, William/0000-0002-0840-6254; Chamberlain, charlotte/0000-0003-1891-7522; Dixon, Padraig/0000-0001-5285-409X","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [DRF-2011-04-024] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR); National Institute for Health Research [DRF-2011-04-024, CL-2015-25-501] Funding Source: researchfish",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)),"Part of this work was funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) doctoral research training fellowship awarded to CC.

We set up a theoretical framework that allows for altruistic preferences, and subsequently test theoretical predictions through the design of a discrete choice experiment. By varying the tax scenario (uniform versus individual tax), the experimental design allows us to verify whether pure altruistic preferences are present and the underlying causes. We find evidence of negative pure altruism. Under a coercive uniform tax system respondents lower their willingness to pay possibly to ensure that they are not forcing others to pay at a level that corresponds to their own higher valuations. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that respondents perceive other individuals' valuations to be lower than their own. Our results suggest that public valuations of mortality risk reductions may underestimate the true societal value because respondents are considering other individuals' welfare, and wrongfully perceive other people's valuations to be low.

While common factors impact in principle all countries, their effect is likely to differ across countries. To allow for unobserved heterogeneity in the effects of common shocks, we estimate a panel data model of healthcare expenditure growth in 34 OECD countries over the years 1980 to 2012, where the usual fixed or random effects are replaced by a multifactor error structure. We address model uncertainty with Bayesian model averaging, to identify a small set of robust expenditure drivers from 43 potential candidates. We establish 16 significant drivers of healthcare expenditure growth, including growth in GDP per capita and in insurance premiums, changes in financing arrangements and some institutional characteristics, expenditures on pharmaceuticals, population ageing, costs of health administration, and inpatient care. Our approach allows us to provide robust evidence to policy makers on the drivers that were most strongly associated with the growth in healthcare expenditures over the past 32years.

The local polynomial CQR regression method is a robust alternative to the widely-used local polynomial method, and has been well studied in stationary time series. In this paper, we relax the stationarity restriction on the model, and allow that the regressors are generated by a general Harris recurrent Markov process which includes both the stationary (positive recurrent) and nonstationary (null recurrent) cases. Under some mild conditions, we establish the asymptotic theory for the proposed local polynomial CQR estimator of the mean regression function, and show that the convergence rate for the estimator in nonstationary case is slower than that in stationary case. Furthermore, a weighted type local polynomial CQR estimator is provided to improve the estimation efficiency, and a data-driven bandwidth selection is introduced to choose the optimal bandwidth involved in the nonparametric estimators. Finally, we give some numerical studies to examine the finite sample performance of the developed methodology and theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Hospital payment schemes were classified as fixed-budget (i.e. not directly based on activities), fee-for-service (FFS) or patient-based payment (PBP) schemes. The data were analysed using a difference-in-difference model that allows for a structural change in outcomes due to payment reform. The results suggest that FFS schemes increase the growth rate of healthcare output, whereas PBP schemes positively affect life expectancy at age 65years.

These benefits form the primary basis for continued efforts to restrict youth access to alcohol. It is important to keep in mind that policymakers have a wide variety of alcohol-control options available to them, and understanding how these policies may complement or substitute for one another can improve policy making moving forward. Towards this end, we propose that investigating the causal effects of the minimum legal drinking age in New South Wales, Australia, provides a particularly informative case study, because Australian states are among the world leaders in their efforts against drunk driving. Using an age-based regression discontinuity design applied to restricted-use data from several sources, we find no evidence that legal access to alcohol has effects on motor vehicle accidents of any type in New South Wales, despite having large effects on drinking and on hospitalizations due to alcohol abuse.

This approach considers key variables such as context and structure, known to be important for communication. Objective: Our objective was to adapt the ELF to evaluate the quality of self-report questionnaires. Methods: We reviewed the Health Literacy Questionnaire using the ELF. On the basis of these data, we drafted the preliminary version of the Evaluative Linguistic Framework for Questionnaires (ELF-Q) and applied it to English- and French-language versions of two arthritis self-report questionnaires and to Spanish, Dutch, and Turkish versions of an arthritis questionnaire. Results: The developed ELF-Q was found to be effective for evaluating questionnaires in English and in four other languages. It contains nine items with new descriptions and assessment probes. These include overall organizational or generic structure of the questionnaire, metadiscourse (or text about the text), headings, rhetorical elements (function of each move or stage of the text in relation to the reader), the writer-reader relationship, technicality of vocabulary, lexical density (proportion of content words in the text), format, and overall judgment. We added assessment responses on a two- or three-point Likert scale to complement the assessment probes and make the intent and meaning of the probes fully explicit for the questionnaire developer or assessor. Conclusions: The ELF-Q is a framework practical to use for the development or assessment of any type of self-report questionnaire. Its application can identify features of a self-report questionnaire that could be improved to optimize its comprehensibility.","[Clerehan, Rosemary] Monash Univ, Fac Med Nursing & Hlth Sci, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Guillemin, Francis; Epstein, Jonathan] Univ Lorraine, Fac Med, Vandoeuvre Les Nancy, France; [Buchbinder, Rachelle] Cabrini Inst, Monash Dept Clin Epidemiol, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Buchbinder, Rachelle] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Dept Epidemiol & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia",Monash University; Universite de Lorraine; Cabrini Health; Monash University; Monash University,"Buchbinder, R (通讯作者)，Cabrini Med Ctr, Monash Dept Clin Epidemiol, Suite 41,183 Wattletree Rd, Malvern, Vic 3144, Australia.",rachelle.buchbinder@monash.edu,"Buchbinder, Rachelle/G-2952-2011","Buchbinder, Rachelle/0000-0002-0597-0933; Epstein, Jonathan/0000-0001-7908-7636",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Senior Principal Research Fellowship,Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Senior Principal Research Fellowship(National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia),There was no direct funding for this research.
